that followed the winddriven warm water washing up against the coasts of north and south america caused deserts to flood and raindenied rain forests to wither drought parched southeast asia and smoke from fires that engulfed indonesia blocked out the sun and plunged the country into neardarkness for weeks there was so little water in the lakes and rivers feeding the panama canal that ship size had

hundred degrees seared texas scores of people died from heatstroke forest fires engulfed florida canada was paralyzed by ice storms siberia was also hugely affected tundra permanently frozen so hard that houses were built without foundations melted in places reducing entire villages to collapsing matchwood the thaw was particularly pronounced around yakutsk it was returning home to the tiny township of kiriyestyakh from a supplybuying trip to yakutsk that a reindeer herder found the bodies had he not been on horsebackdenied the more customary use of the sled the animal normally pulledhe might not have seen the upthrust handclenched arm as it was his first impression was of a tree branch he was too young to have known the great patriotic war although his grandfather had been killed on the eastern front and his father had lost an arm in the battle of stalingrad but the until now perfectly preserving ice tomb had collapsed sufficiently for him torecognize that both corpses were dressed in military uniform neither uniform looked like those hed seen in any photographs of his grandfather or father his initial impulse was to loot the bodies of whatever valuables there might be but siberia is the most superstitious of any russian region and to graverob risked the evil eye instead he remounted his horse and hurried on to kiriyestyakh to report his find although after all hed seen and endured and done it would have been impossible for charlie muffin to believe in god it had seemed divine intervention when he of all operatives got the firsttime moscow posting in the departments anxiety to justify its continued existence by becoming a quasibritish fbi after the supposed end of the cold war maybe despite being a disbeliever he had believed it was something like that so quickly had he again come into contact with nataliaand seen their daughter for the first timeand imagined shed so easily forget all the hurt and all the deceit the fact that shed resumed their affair at all was little short of a miracle that she was here with sasha in his apartment even more miraculous second thoughtsand third thoughts and fourth thoughtswere inevitable he had every time convincingly allayed them as convincingly as hed persuaded her to move into lesnaya ulitza although charlie accepted natalia had hardly moved in the belated doubt had come even before shed unpacked this is ridiculous a mistake youre here now lets just give it a chance we cant afford chances not one she shook her head distractedly i cant conceive that im here that i agreed to it neither in all but rare honesty could charlie hed even phrased the initial suggestion in a way that he could have dismissed it as a joke although deep down it hadnt been its not like the old days we dont even have a concierge to inform on us and youre keepingleninskaya on officially thats still where you and sasha live which will be meaningless if were discovered why didnt she tell him of the threat she thought herself to be under despite so much of it personally involving him too much to think about too muchtoo fastof everything i love you declared charlie solemnly sasha is my daughter im in moscow permanently now officially it doesnt make sense for us to go on living apart it does if you really intend us to make some sort of life if our being together comes out youll be withdrawn and ill probably be dismissed and then whats left london natalia shook her head i was prepared to make that sacrifice once remember risked imprisonmentworse maybe because i was officially in the kgb thento get myself to london expecting you to meet your side of the bargain all you had to do was meet me arrange my defection but you backed offabandoned me because you werent sure which in one very important way im glad about now i was so much in love with you then that i forgot i was russian how much being russian means which no one who isnt can ever understand leaving russiacoming to london and bringing sasha to londonis the very last thing i want to do which id ever consider doing which has nothing whatsoever to do with how i feel about you and about us ill do everything i can to avoid it charlie felt abruptly hollowed out and it was several moments before he replied as he did so he gestured around the huge room in which they were and the apartment beyond if youre telling me that youre not sure any longer then i agree this doesnt make sense nothing does im telling you ive got to make up my mind whether i am or not i thought moving in might be a way of my finding out thought too much about what seemed my biggest problem and not enough about what others could be caused by my being here which was stupid they were talking english sasha who was five said impatiently what are you talking about in russian charlie said i was telling mummy how much i love you and how pleased i am that youre here did princesses really live here once asked the child craning her neck in awe all the time and now another one is going to you i want to see demanded the child charlie got up almost too quickly to take the childs hand glad of the escape from a conversation he didnt want to have the lesnaya apartment extended over a quarter of an entire floor of what had been in the fifth story of one of the grandest moscow palacemansions of a cousin prince of the last tsar legends had it as legends often do that tsar nicholas had not once but several times slept there although not in the guest rooms on charlies level rasputin at the time caring for nicholass hemophiliac son tsarevich alexei had been on charlies floor according to the same fable but again not in any of the rooms in which charlie lived everything was echoingly enormous following the principle that the specially chosen and therefore exalted rulers of others had to reside in surroundings built for giants charlie liked the leaderofmen imagery the ceiling of the main room was high enough to have formed scaffolding for a tired moon there was a huge venetian mirror over an ornately carved mantelpiece its cavorting cherubs climbing a bas relief to the faraway corniced and molded ceiling in the main room more a reception salon there were three verandaed and velvetdraped windows stretching the entire height from that ceiling to the deeply carpeted floor and although a hodgepodge of style and period all the furniture was of the highest and most comfortable quality apart from some of the piecesparticularly two couchesthat appeared from their pattern fade and some wear to date from the houses original occupant there was a separate smaller and more convenient family room in which charlie had installed the largescreen transformeroperated and satellitelinked televisionimported from englandand three bedrooms two with fourposter beds around which despite complete central heating curtains could be drawn against a moscow winter the el nino appeared to have defeated the kitchen was a burnished chromiumgleaming contrast to the bygone age a laboratory of microwave ice machines walkin refrigerators and rotisseries the entire edifice had been maintained and created for a relative of leonid brezhnev when the most corrupt of recent soviet leaders had ruledtaken over by subsequent party tsars until the demise of communism after which it had come upon the list of diplomatically offered properties through endemic bureaucratic incompetence charlie had gotten it totally by chance to support his arrival assignment cover as an entrepreneurial intermediary to infiltrate the nuclearsmuggling russian mafia and was reasonably confidentalthough not absolutely surethat he could manipulate a matching dinosaur of whitehall bureaucracy to go on living there by right of existing possession even though the reason for his original occupancy had been successfully concluded it wasnt until the end of the tour tightly holding her mothers hand that sasha said wheres my room and scuttled into the smaller one containing the curtained fourposter to which charlie pointed the child stood legs apart surveying it and gravely said i like it i want to stay im glad said charlie turning to nataliaknowing in advance he shouldnt use the childs remarkhe added how about mummy natalias answer wasnt a direct one ill tell you if i decide im not sure anymore about you and i all right said charlie unable to think of anything better does that make you think any less of me no said charlie honestly it took me long enough but now im sure i want it to work charlie i really do so youre going to stay i might change my mind think i should change my mind theyd reverted to english feeling neglected again sasha said are you going to live here too with mummy and me yes said charlie does that make you a daddy charlie and natalia looked at each other charlie said yes would you like that i dont know said sasha with childlike truthfulness lets hope everyone makes all their decisions soon said charlie the entire town council of kiriyestyakh led by the mayor stood around the softening grave the bodies were still deeply frozen theclawed hand stiffly upright but more earth had crumbled so that they could see the backs of both heads had been shot away the mayor who had fought with the reindeer herders father said definitely foreign english i think and american i saw uniforms like these in berlin what are we going to do with them asked his deputy the mayor had survived the long years of communism by never once making a decision this is in yakutsk jurisdiction theyve got facilities there theyve been preserved exactly as they were the moment they were shot the awed deputy pointed out english and american repeated the other man there will be a big investigation we can get to yakutsk in an hour do we take the bodies with us asked a third man we dont touch them warned the mayor let others risk the eye yakutsk is the capital of the partially autonomous russian republic of yakutskaya one of the most remote and inhospitable places on earth and provably the coldest where temperatures plunge to minus eighty degrees centigrade as well as being certain of the evil eye and the magic power of shaman witch doctor priests the yakut people who exist there believe unheard conversations freeze in the winter to be heard in the brief summer thaw in that region the summer is plagued by mosquitoes that sting so viciously that grazing reindeer and cows and horses that are not driven mad by the pain often suffocate from the attacking clog in their nostrils and mouths men and women have been driven insane by a concerted swarm although the more frequent dementia is caused by the vodka intended to numb every feeling the freak weather of the el nino had awakened the insects early and the melting grave was blackly thick by the time the mayor gotback to it with the two official investigators the mayor and his council were all yakuts less troubled by the mosquitoes than colonel aleksandr kurshin and vitali novikov both of whose ancestry was russian kurshin the homicide chief at once lit supposedly repelling smoke candles that made everyones eyes sting but did little to drive away the bugs novikov the pathologist put on a personally adapted and meshvisored hat and gauze mask and protected his hands with rubber medical gloves he didnt have a spare mask but he gave his extra gloves to kurshin who snatched at them wheres your hat and mask demanded novikov whod made the same face protection for the other man a boyhood friend as well as a professional colleague forgot said kurshin thats stupid said novikov everyone drank too much in yakutsk but kurshin was increasingly drinking more than most and it worried novikov kurshin had stunk out the mortuary vehicle on the way there the weather and its effect worried novikov too malaria had never been a problem in such a frigid climate but if this unnatural weather lasted the disease could become an insectborne epidemic if it remained so warm for too much longer hed warn the health ministry in moscow despite yakutskayas independence pretensions he couldnt be accused of negligence if he sounded an alarm before a problem arose it was ingrained in people whose forefathers had been exiled to permanent imprisonment albeit without jail walls to arrange defense before accusation novikov was not however thinking of malaria at that precise moment as he stared down into the grave other thoughtsdesperate halfformed fantasieswere swirling through his mind so distracting that he had consciously to try to push them back he looked beyond the grave squinting through the permanent half darkness of the yakutskaya day over the flat empty wasteland he was sure he was right but there was nothing to see not the slightest trace as if in fact a shaman had cast a spell to make everything disappear how he wondered could he make it come back again neither aleksandr andreevich kurshin nor vitali maksimovich novikov were frightened of the supernatural although they were familiar with all the superstitions neither sneered at the folklore beliefs either novikov who also practiced as a general physicianknew of at least seven shamans in yakutsk he knew too that the townspeople consulted them as much as they came to him and that sometimes people whose maladies he had failed to diagnose recovered from whatever the shamans prescribed novikov considered himself a man of science but didnt know of a better medicine than the power of absolute mindovermatter conviction unable to resist another fantasy he was curious if he possessed it sufficiently himself kurshin a fat rumpled man who had little conviction about anything apart from the anaesthesia of vodka said they look like wartime uniforms he couldnt possibly be expected to solve something that had happened such a long time ago this whole area was closed then like yakutsk reminded novikov his father like kurshins had been exiled there during the stalin era on trumpedup charges of political conspiracy it had left both with an inferiority complexan apprehension of authoritythat both tried hard to conceal too often when he was drunk kurshin wept for no apparent reason it doesnt make sense agreed the policeman uncomfortably this is too important for us judged novikov as anxious as his friend to avoid any accountability he was a thin nervous man whose blinking increased in proportion to his apprehension it was very rapid at that moment this would he knew attract the attentionmaybe even the involvementof faraway moscow could there in some way be the salvation he almost maniacally dreamed of or the disaster that had overwhelmed his father i know that too weve got to get everything right agreed kurshin hed solved each of his eight previous murders because they had all been barroom brawls or mining camp disputes where the killers had either been standing over their victims or pointed out to him when hed gotten to the scene hed had to shoot dead one man crazed from vodka not mosquito bites the first two shots had missed the third had only hit because the man had lunged toward him i intend to said novikov he checked to ensure his camera was loaded even though he had put in the new film himself before leaving the mortuary there werent any proper forensic facilities in yakutsk the two men were expected to provide their own the kiriyestyakh group as well as the two yakut mortuary attendantswhod come with novikov backed away from the grave roughly by the same distance that the medical examiner advanced toward it a disturbed dense mass rose up toward him and before every exposure he had to shake the camera to dislodge the persistent cloud every print would be speckled it couldnt be avoided he worked his way around the entire grave taking a picture at each sideways step behind him kurshin made a rough sketch against which to put his measurements it was a vaguely round banked hole the still partially earthcovered bodies at its lowest point several times the measuring tape came free of the stones with which he tried to tether it so he had to repeat the process it would have been pointless asking any of the withdrawn group to come closer to hold it in place reminded he said i suppose ill have to touch the bodies as well as you to get the eye before your people will take them out of course said novikov surprised at the question im being stung to death itll be worse in there you shouldnt have forgotten your hat and mask it doesnt help to be told there was a murmur from the watching yakuts as novikov stepped as delicately as possible into the grave medical bag hanging from its strap over his shoulder flying things engulfed him encroaching beneath his jacket and trouser cuffs bites began to burn their way up his arms and legs kurshin was right about it being worse inside the grave even though it was far colder than hed expected kurshin also under attack said lets hurry novikov said we cant afford to the bodies were still frozen too solidly to intrude a thermometer into any part of either body from which novikov would have normally attempted a reading he laid the thermometer against the outside of each grimaced face flies and bugs were crawling in and out of the stretchedapart mouths and their faces were swollen and bumped from stings inflicted at their moment of death unknown years before novikov took closeup photographs of the obvious wounds the backs of both heads were totally gone exposing brain pulp in the center of each was a trajectory hole he hoped still contained the fatal bullet he wrote e for english and a for americanin his notebook and against the e recorded the twist of the mans foot it would he guessed be a greenbone ankle fracture from the fall into the pit strangely the americans spectacles were still perfectly in place although the left lens was shattered novikov himself had taken the chance and worn his contact lenses in which he preferred to work although he had glasses in his medical bag normally at this time of year it was so cold that contact lenses froze in the eye making them impossible to wear he was the only person in yakutsk who bothered with what was considered a pointless ophthalmic invention he said it wont be easy getting the englishman into the van with his arm thrust out like that how would that have happened muscle spasm when he was struck by the bullet guessed novikov he tried but couldnt open the englishmans tunic pockets i would have expected the clothing to have thawed by now you think they were prisoners of war novikov shook his head deciding against telling even his best friend what he thought he knew and what he was thinking kurshin would have laughed at him as hed laughed before about the things hed tried to do for marina and the boys theyre too smart look you can see the creases in their trousers you want to get in here and touch the bodies so we can get my people to move them waving his arms against a fresh insect upsurge kurshin stepped into the grave and tapped both corpses each was icecold and rockhard looking back at the village headman kurshin said moscow will have to be told naturally shouldnt we leave the bodies here for ryabov to seebe photographed looking at perhaps yuri vyacheslav ryabov was yakutsks publicityconscious eagertopose militia commissioner fuck him said novikov you dont have to rely on him like i do complained kurshin i dont want animals eating at the bodies even though its still going to be some time before they thaw said novikov he shouted to the two mortuary attendants who reluctantly approached with stretchers kurshin remained in the grave for the two yakuts to see that hehad touched the bodies and attracted the bad spirits before climbing out he was halfway toward the road pacing out its distance from the grave when the shout came he turned in time to see the two attendants scrambling out one actually fled toward the kiriyestyakh group kurshin ran back himself unable at first to hear what novikov was yelling from the hole what kurshin shouted still some distance away theres a third body said novikov it was covered by the other two its a woman taking sasha to the state circus all part of charlie learning fatherhood had been wonderful as it always was but theyd had to stand in line for half an hour to get into mcdonalds which was a long time for charlie to stand comfortably neither charlie nor natalia had ordered food and now charlie wished hed chosen the cola instead of the coffee which was awful he pushed it aside trying to be philosophical charlie supposed a thirtyminute wait was practically moving at the speed of light for a russian restaurant and sasha her face greased by her cheeseburger was enjoying it i checked again announced natalia theres nothing on you apart from your appointment details long before charlies moscow posting natalia had used her colonels rank within the thenexisting kgb to expunge all charlies records from the organizations files as charlie had doublechecked the embassys security archives against those in london to establish there was no file on natalia charlie looked sadly at her you already knew that just wanted to be sure so now you are hed badly misjudged how difficult it was going to be even sasha seemed aware of her mothers uncertainty searching for a new topic he said i didnt know you had a sister were not close the letter from irena had been among the mail she had collected from the apartment she still maintained in leninskaya what does she want says she hasnt been able to contact me she flies for aeroflot and brings things from abroad for sasha what have you told her about sasha that there was an affair that ended she looked directly at charlie i thought it had and maybe would have liked it to charlie thought am i going to meet her maybe said natalia noncommittally i suppose i should call her or write theres something else about us what i dont expect you to ask me anythingto use my positionand i dont expect you to share anything with me neithers crossed my mind charlie said with a smile trying to lighten the atmosphere mcdonalds hardly seemed the place for such a conversation but then whator wherewas thats bollocks and you know it accused natalia using the word that charlie had taught her it doesnt sound the same when you say it it means the same charlie accepted that hed abused natalias professional position badly enough in the very beginning after hed staged his phony defection to moscow and deceived her when shed been assigned to debrief him so her distrust was justified like everything else natalia had sufficient professional integrity to make up for any that he might lack still seemed a pity if the facility was there but then charlie abruptly stopped the reflection he wouldnt cheat or treat natalia badly ever again in fact he had to do even better than that he had to make her love him again difficult though it was about anything involving the man gerald williams did his best to remain totally objective about charlie muffin and objectively he accepted hed lost the last battle like so many before it but most certainly he hadnt lost the war nor would he still objective he conceded that charlie muffin had succeeded in hisexperimental posting to moscow by shattering a russian nuclearsmuggling operation to the middle east and that for the moment charlie muffin could do no wrong in the opinion of sir rupert dean the directorgeneral which wasnt by any stretch of any imagination williamss opinion charlie muffin couldand wouldbreak rules the man couldnt help himself it was muffins way the way that one daythe sooner the betterhed make the mistake he couldnt wriggle away from as hed wriggled away from so many the mistake with which he gerald williams would finally rid the service of a nuisance that should not have been allowed to exist in the first place and shouldnt be allowed to continue in these uncertain times there had been too many changes made too quickly in expanding the department with the hope of justifying its continued existence after the end of the cold war thered actually been some personnel moves as a direct result of what the damned man had already done in moscow which meant that for the moment not enough people remained in power who knew charlie muffin for what he truly was but gerald williams knew he knew charlie muffin to be an insubordinate liar and cheat with an inverted snobbery about people with better accents whose boots he shouldnt have been allowed to lick let alone appear equal tosometimes even superior williams a fat but fastidiously neat man was sure of his strategy time but with persistence what he had to do was allow charlie muffin all the timeall the ropewith which to hang himself but not let this ridiculous admiration cult grow simply because of one initial new posting success so there had to be constant leveling reminders and there was no one better qualified than he to introduce that constant balance and he was going to be able to do that now that he was being included in these nervous discussions about the uncertainty of their organization williams was happy with his reflections quite content for the departmental conference chaired by sir rupert dean to swirl around for some of the time hed only half listened more interested in his own thoughts gazing across the thames to the headquarters of the mi or sis as britains external intelligence service preferred to call itself todays meeting had been convened by the directorgeneral toassess the effectiveness of the national crime squad as britains fbithe role theyd fought to establish for themselves in the postcold war adjustmentsand williams felt the least threatened of all the first to suffer from any retraction or functional change would be operational heads his record as financial director and chief accountant was unblemished although as careful as he was williams recognized a dangeranother reason to be wary of the manin the drunkensailor way charlie muffin was being allowed to throw money around in moscow as if he had the key to the safe worriedly it occurred to williams that the bloody man was devious enough actually to have made an impression and done just that i believe theyve made inroads damaged our claim insisted jocelyn hamilton he was new to the control group a replacement as deans immediate deputy the demise of hamiltons predecessor had come from the mans own power struggle miscalculation but the nuclearsmuggling moscow episode had been the trigger and williams hoped hed find an ally in the bullchested sparsehaired new deputy whose office was festooned with photographs of him as a rugby prop forward and fourtime english rugby international weve more than held our own countered dean a disheveled man whose hair retreated from his forehead in an upright tidal wave hed been appointed directorgeneral from the chair of modern and political history at oxfords balliol college and was internationally acclaimed as the foremost sociopolitical authority in europe there was no longer talk of his tenure being temporary as it had been described in the beginning williams didnt believe the nuclear affair had anything to do with deans knighthood but it had come soon afterward and some people thought there was a connection its just more duplication persisted hamilton theres already the national criminal intelligence service theres regional crime squads theres us what can a national crime squad do that we or any of the others couldnt or arent already doing focus on the criminals identified at the very top said jeremy simpson the legal adviser heavily he added and ncis isnt operational patrick pacey a small darkhaired and totally nondescript man except for a face permanently reddened by blood pressure said itmakes the governments commitment against organized crime look good he was the political officer i dont think there is any cause for us yet to overreact said dean he habitually spoke too quickly his voice staccato and seemed to make more use of his spectacles as worry beads than as an aid to reading nor to be complacent said hamilton time carefully to venture a toe into the water decided williams he said certainly it would be a bad time for us to make a mistake jeremy simpson who compensated for his alopecia baldness with a drooping bush of a mustache sighed do you know a good time to make a mistake he didnt like williams and regretted his inclusion in these meetings although acknowledging finances and costs were important in their overall future williams flushed well aware he couldnt expect any support from the oddlooking lawyer who was buttressed against any upheaval within the department by an inherited personal fortune i meant that perhaps we should devote some time to anticipating potential problems like what demanded the political officer personnel said williams shortly here we go again sighed simpson in weary anticipation why do you have such animosity toward charlie muffin williams shifted uncomfortably knowing it would be wrong for his objections to appear a personal vendetta even though it had for him developed into one from how charlie muffin had maneuvered his attempt to impose some financial restraint into open ridicule throughout the department holding back from the specifics hed intended williams said he totally disregards authoritydoesnt conform which are attitudes i dont think we can afford in our current situation you think he should be withdrawn asked hamilton i would not oppose the suggestion snatched williams eagerly most of the cabinet intelligence committee would after that most recent business deflated pacey theres no justification any longer in his retaining the apartment he has blurted williams unable to stop himself and regretting it at once now were getting to it jeered the lawyer its excessive expenditure said williams my function is to control the finances of this department i will be hardpressed to explain the huge amount of money moscow is costing there was every justification for the apartment to distance muffin from the embassy over the nuclear business pointed out dean becoming as irritated as simpson by the accountants obduracy and you wont be called upon to explain i will enough williams decided he was on record as having fulfilled his official and expected role which was important he said i feltand still feelthat the point should be made and youve made it dismissed simpson and would again determined williams it was extremely important to discover everything he could about charlie muffins extravagant lifestyle in moscow the problem was finding a way of doing it vitali novikovs mortuary examination room and what were supposed to be his scientific testing facilities epitomized the township at the center of which it stood crumbling and inadequate like the provincial government offices and militia headquarters to which it was attached it had been built of brick and concrete to appear impressive before architects learned brick and concrete thawed the permafrozen ground upon which they were placed the whole complex was now lopsided and gradually subsiding breaking up like a sinking ship the freak thaw had caused fresh cracks in novikovs particular section and down the outside wall brick dust leaked and smeared appropriately red like blood the space originally made for it had pulled away from the frame the only outside window in what passed as novikovs laboratory widening an already existing gap that needed fresh canvas packing cardboard and binding tape to block up fortunately the inner autopsy room didnt have an outside wall it had little else either novikov had only ever had one corpse at a time and was unsure how effective the two additional but rarely used freezer cabinets were it was not an immediate problem while the bodies were still melting but on their journey back to yakutsk from the grave novikov and kurshin had agreed anxious to convince themselves that moscowwould send in a team that required ironically that the bodies be refrozen after novikovs initial examination and because of the climate change he couldnt simply leave them in an outside storage shed which he would otherwise have done in january there was only one examination table and there werent replacements anywhere in town for the three bulbs that had blown in the overhead cluster reducing his working light by half novikov had both watched and conducted full autopsies at his fathers side but always the medical details of the killings had been as unarguable as the circumstances of their being inflicted during the day and a half it still took for the bodies sufficiently to melt he reviewed two basic guidance manuals on forensic pathologyboth communistera unauthorized translations of american originalsand decided his best protection against professional criticism was to remove and preserve as many of the most obviously necessary body organs as possible for later moscow analysis almost at once he realized that with three bodies he wouldnt have enough proper preserving containers he supposed hed be able to improvise with ordinary pickle jars but he wasnt sure if he had sufficient formaldehyde hed have to be sparing from the start novikov was not permitted to concentrate entirely upon the postmortems which he would have liked during the delay in being able to start them hetogether with kurshinwas summoned before the inner governing cabinet of yakutskaya for a meeting that was pointless because neither could offer any evidence or theory about bodies still too frigidly rockhard even for clothes to be stripped and examined equally without any practical purpose apart from their physical presence being recordedwhich it was by two photographers and a secretarythe fiveman group also personally visited the mortuary to examine the ice mummies it was headed by valentin ivanovich polyakov the chief minister whose detestation of everything russian stemmed from the exile and premature death of his father banished not by stalin but by his secret police chief lavrenty beria polyakov was the regions fiercest advocate of distancing itself from russian domination with the end of communism until now polyakov regarded as his best independence gesture persuading in the yakutskaya cabinet now uncomfortably grouped around him to impose a local visa requirement uponany foreignerparticularly russiansarriving at the towns airport although he still hadnt worked out how polyakov considered the finding of the three bodiestwo of them westernersan opportunity to make another dramatic gesture of independence by comparisonalthough paradoxically by the same reasoningthere was hardly any of the outrage kurshin had feared from yuri ryabov for not being alerted before the bodies had been removed from their grave the local militia commander was well aware of their professional and technical inadequacies and saw protection in not having been involved from the very beginning so for once local newspaper and radio headlines were secondary to an excuseif excuse was neededfor any failure in the investigation if there was praise he could equally ensure he was the recipient as the ultimate commander he also didnt like the way kurshin looked from having been out there ryabov a vain man constantly aware of his appearance was as familiar with the warmweather infestation as anyone else in the region but could rarely remember seeing anyone so badly bitten as kurshin the mans head and neck remained so swollen even after two days that he was physically unable to button his collar and his pumpkinsized face was purpled from the insect attack the government visit was spoiled before it began by their entryperhaps because of the door slammingbeing the moment that the englishmans upright arm abruptly fell perfectly by his side as if hed suddenly become alive all the cabinet apart from polyakov were full yakuts but it was polyakov who cried out in terror pulling back toward the door to which the rest retreated actually huddled together as if for protection recovering the quickest novikov said its nothing what im waiting to happen he too was surprised by the state of kurshins face and was glad now that the bodies were softening that hed suctioned the persistent mosquitoes midges and gnats from the victims mouths noses ears and eyesocket surrounds despite novikovs assurance the cabinet remained tightly just inside the door as if the medical judgment were his polyakov declared it will still be some time before we can discover anything about them i want to know as much as possible before contacting moscow there were murmurs and shuffles of agreement from men anxious to get out of the room ryabov eager to establish a working procedure said itll be their case though has to be we dont know what anything has to be until we find out what happened whenever it happened disputed polyakov officiously making it a government order he said we wait ill decide if and when moscow is informed and ill do it personally asshole thought ryabov he said ive checked with wartime photographs theyre definitely english and american uniforms officers too what about the woman asked someone unseen from the cabinet group civilian clothes said ryabov unnecessarily because the still fully clothed woman was lying on a trolley next to the momentarily unneeded freezer drawers but they look russian to me so does she slavic this is an opportunity to bring world attention to what stalin and the bastards who followed him did to their own people decided polyakov an idea hardening in his mind were going to use this for all its worth embarrass moscow theyre still pillaging our country for whats in the ground lets hope it was moscow who had them killed all those years ago said kurshin emboldened by the vodka hed drunk before the visit novikov listened uncomfortably unsure after all if the murders would be the chance for which hed hoped the more hed thought about it the more determined hed become to make it so but he couldnt achieve it if the intention was positive obstruction and embarrassment he wanted friends not enemies novikov began the autopsies later that evening starting with the englishman because the bodys outstretched arm had made it more convenient to put upon the examination table when theyd first arrived againas he did subsequently with the american and the womanhe exhausted an entire roll of film photographing the body from every conceivable angle reloading in readiness to record the dissection before physically touching the body from both his fathers tuition and the stolen guidance manuals he knew it wouldhave been professionally acceptable to cut the uniform away but he had heard of incredible advances in forensic sciencedna for instance which he only vaguely understoodand used the empty threat of dismissal to force the two mortuary attendants his only assistants to help him lift and maneuver all three bodies to strip the clothes away intact having done that he left the naked body on the slab to go through each item of clothing stopping painstakingly to itemize by hand each article he found from the englishman in total there was twenty british sterling in notes and ten coins german warscript marks and both currencies all in notes a gold watch with a worn leather strap the hands stopped at a gold cigarette case containing six american camel cigarettes and engraved with an inscription in roman lettering that novikov could not understand a cigarette lighter uninscribed four keys one designated by a twist of red cotton around its shank a britishmade parker fountain pen the ink inside still frozen and a tie pin in the shape of a bayonet the pin was still in a plain armyissue tie but the tie itself was snapped close to the neck the clothes consisted of brown leather shoes showing little sign of wear armyissue cotton socks cotton singlet vest with halfthighlength underpants starchcollared khaki shirt the top four buttons undone with two missing but already found lodged at the waist during the undressing and a welltailored khaki officers uniform around the jacket of which there was what novikov described in his notes as a leather harness a belt encircling the waist of the jacket which continued to midthigh with another leather strap looped over the mans right shoulder to be joined front and back to the waist belt at the left there was brass shoulder insignia which novikov noted although he was not able to identify the denoted rank all the clothes were so perfectly preserved that novikov thought that with cleaningthe brass buttons and leather polishedeverything would have been wearable again the body was that of a blondhaired wellnourished male caucasian approximately thirty years old from its condition the man could have died that day novikov concentrated upon the obvious cause of death at least half the cranial casing had been lost a considerable amount driven into the brain pulp it was easier than novikovexpected to extract the single bullet which had entered in a downward trajectory and lodged at the atlas vertebra at the spinal tip the pathologist had no forensic ballistic knowledge or experience but the bullet looked quite large and appeared reasonably intact there were minor facial abrasions dark with afterdeath lividity and there was a lividity burn around at the rear of the neck apart from that there was no body wound the wrists and ankles were bruised predeath indicating the man had been tightly bound he sawed into the sternum continuing the chest opening to the mans pelvis and braced the rib cage apart novikov extensively photographed the exposed organs before examining each intently none looked enlarged or diseased finally still working downward he extracted and weighed the heart aorta both lungs the thymus stomach liver gallbladder pancreas spleen both kidneys both adrenaline glands bladder prostate and urethra having done that he returned to the skull and removed weighed and preserved what remained of the cerebrum and cerebellum inserting a pencil to show the trajectory of the wound on the photographs only when he finished did novikov remember the manual guidance about stomach contents and remove enough to discover it contained a largely undigested meal even without using his microscope the mirror of which was tarnished novikov identified meat and what looked like cheese he had actually to consult the manual to learn that stomach evidence should not be preserved in formaldehyde he immersed everything else carefully labeling each jar as he did so without a name he used the believed nationality again following the manual he took fingernail scrapings which just looked like dirt but which he fixed onto a microscope slide it was at that moment he remembered he hadnt weighed the body intact which he should have done he weighed it anyway adding the minimal additions of the nowremoved organs after doing that he took height and body measurements something else he should have done at the outset an inevitable second more accurate autopsy with better equipment would probably pick up his error he didnt make it on either of the other two bodies he chose that of the believed american next the uniform was similar to the first without the leather harness again it was all armyissue cotton socks boxer shorts underwear and singlet the tie was completely missingand the three top buttons of the shirt unfastened the tunic jacket again had shoulder ranking designation which novikov noted there was a silvercased khakistrapped wristwatch which novikov took to be armyissue stopped at and a silver ring surmounted by a large red stone on the small finger of his left hand the pocket of the uniform contained in notes and twentyfive cents in coin and warscript dmarks five keys in a flat leather case none with any identification a small ivoryhandled penknife a pocket magnifying glass with what appeared to be a matching set of tweezers a zippo lighter but no cigarettes or cigarette case a silver propelling pencil and a packet of juicy fruit chewing gum with two sticks missing the body was again that of a wellnourished male caucasian age about thirtyfive the fatal wound was once more to the back of the head but more to its right than that of the first victim less cranial bone had been shattered it was again comparatively easy to recover the bullet the trajectory of which had taken it from the right to the left of the mans skull and been slightly more damaged by impact against the rear teeth to the left of the jaw there was a lividity burn almost completely around the neck novikov made the same gullettocrotch opening broke open the rib cage and this time used the mans own magnifying glass to examine each of the organs none of which showed any indication of damage or disease he patiently went through the same weighing and preserving process once more leaving the brain until last again for the photographs he marked the trajectory with a pencil there was undigested vegetable matter as well as meat among the stomach contents there didnt seem to be debris beneath the mans fingernails but novikov made scrape slides he continued using the supposed nationality to identify his specimen jars the dead womans clothinga dark blue threequarterlength jacket and skirtresembled a uniform although there was no indication of any service or rank there were no pockets in the jacket but two in the skirt in that on the left side there was a single key in the right a cellophaned pack of camels from which two were missing the remainder were crushed and broken her watch which had stopped at was tincased the strap imitation leather the womans shoes were down at heel the mock leather uppersscuffed there were no stockings her underpants were stringtied with halfthigh legs she wore only a bra beneath a longsleeved white shirt which was marked with several days wear at the cuffs and collar as with the two men some of the front shirt buttons were openthree in her case around her neck which was unmarked a thin chain held a bare silver cross although heavily bloodmatted now her hair had been black and would have been long practically to her shoulders her mouth had frozen into a grimace of agony and although that had relaxed the features were still distorted destroying what once would have been an attractive even beautiful highcheekboned face her heavybreasted body would have been exciting too the pelvis was marked with the striae gravidarum of childbirth as well as an appendectomy scar the shattering wound was more to the left side of the skull and only when novikov inserted a probe to trace the entry line and locate the bullet did he properly realize that what hed thought to be leaked blood from the head entry was in fact congealed around an exit wound in her throat just above the larynx and that the bullet had not lodged in her body as he was examining the exit woundagain with the americans magnifying glasshe isolated small black specks he couldnt immediately identify until separately placing them under the closer and more direct arc light on his desk they were longdead mosquitoes and gnats he at once returned to the two men whose postmortems he had completed making a scalpel incision in each throat both windpipes contained insect debris the chest stomach and pelvic opening had virtually become routine he went almost automatically through the process of examining extracting weighing and preserving the organs all of which appeared perfectly normal additionally with the woman he extracted the ovaries they as well as the spleen pancreas and remains of the brain had to go into vegetable pickle jars only when he was transferring the scant debris from beneath her very short and in places bitten nails did novikov remember he had not estimated an age it was difficult because of the distortion he now knew to have been caused by the exiting bullet but he guessed between thirty and thirtyfive so intently had novikov worked that only when he looked virtually for the first time toward his supposed laboratory and sawdaylight through the skewed window did he become aware he had worked completely through the night his watch showed sixthirty abruptly he was engulfed in a physically aching tiredness he doubted would bring any sleep so much was there to try to understand he stored all three bodies squinting at the temperature gauges outside each cabinet to ensure the refrigeration was working shuffled across to his office and slumped into a chair that had lost most of its seat stuffing he couldnt immediately decide whether it was good or bad mixed maybe for him personally more good than bad certainly enough to make what he hoped would be a sufficiently impressive presentation it took a long time for aleksandr kurshin to answer his telephone and when he did his voice was still thick from vodka and it took several more minutes for the homicide detective to recognize to whom and about what he was talking who are they kurshin demanded finally his voice still slurred thats the point said novikov everything and anything that might have identified them has been taken we dont know who they are and theres no way were ever going to find out yakutsk is six hours ahead of moscow time so it was still only midday when the telephone exchanges from the far side of siberia percolated down through the foreign ministry to the interior ministers secretariat and eventually to natalia she made only brief interjections and afterward sat without moving even though the demand for her to attend was immediate this could be the problemthe potential disastershed prayed would never arise im going to be late she told charlie who answered the telephone on the first ring what time hed thought it might have been london although telephones were normally reserved for emergencies the sum total of his activity that day and too many before it had been to create a deltawinged paper plane that flew completely across his office through the open door and almost reached the far wall of the outside corridor thered been four improvements from that mornings prototype it all had to do with the tilt of the wings i dont know can you pick sasha up from the creche sure something big ill call when i have some idea of a time refused natalia ignoring the question i love you he said but natalia had already replaced the telephone when it rang again within minutes he snatched it up smiling expecting it to be natalia again but it wasnt natalia was not late but everyone else was already there viktor romanovich viskov even had his jacket off and collar unbuttoned and she felt a fresh twitch of anxiety at the thought that the deputy interior minister trying to depose her might have already started an undermining attack in her absence the room had gone ominously expectantly quiet at her entry only dmitri nikulin gave any formal greeting viskov a squat stonefaced and professional longterm survivor in the oxygenstarved nearsummit of russian government remained expressionless which natalia expected she supposed she should also have expected only the curt gravefaced nod from mikhail suslov confronted as the man appeared to be after only four months as deputy foreign minister with an international situation of potentially enormous proportion for herself natalia accepted that the international perception of russia was of an outoflegalcontrol country dominated by organized crime which too much of it was and that of anyone in the room she could be made to appear the person most closely connected to that failure and to that embarrassment which didnt end that simply there was the fact that yakutsk was three thousand miles from moscow the capital of a timewarped antagonistic nearindependent republic and that the murders appeared to have been committed decades ago all and every problem of which was compounded by the meeting being convened in the sixthfloor white house suite of dmitri borisovichnikulin chief of staff of the president whose own quarters were farther along the linking corridor on the same level a constant although unneeded reminder of the echelon at which the matter was being considered from the outset we seem to have an extremely serious problem opened nikulin he was a thin gaunt man who invariably appeared to invite an opinion from the people to whom he was speaking before offering one himself on the face of it agreed suslov cautiously we hardly know enough yet to make any sort of judgment qualified viskov just as carefully quickly however he added what is essential today is that we ensure from the very beginning that we are properly prepared particularly that any investigation is totally successful he spoke looking directly at natalia the obvious first essential encouraged nikulin its difficult from what weve received so far to judge what it is that we might be investigating it will have to be officers from here pressed viskov still looking at natalia i think we should hear your thoughts natalia nikandrova the invitation should have come from the presidential adviser gauged natalia the cadaverous man didnt appear offended we can of course do that said natalia but yakutskaya has a great deal of autonomy have we been askedinvitedto take over whatever investigation is going on there she had to remain focused not allow any private distractions why now this soon she thought in familiar litany why ever suslov was one of the new notyetforty universityeducated russian reformers impatient for changes too long promised he nodded approvingly at the womans political awareness not in as many words its inferred from the very fact of our being informed its a good qualification natalia nikandrova not the praise of someone involved in a plot before her arrival natalia thought relieved deciding the diplomatic road the one to take she said so at the moment we have no right even to go there i dont consider we can proceed on the basis of inference its a valid point congratulated nikulin we have to ensure our participation is officially requested and that cooperation is guaranteed persisted natalia it would be unfortunate if investigators from here were blamed for mistakes not of their making she allowed her mind briefly to go sideways an investigation seemingly involving a murdered englishman without question charlies sort of crime according to the remit of his posting so added to the danger of their living together was now going to be the constant conflict of interest shed determined not to allow she felt constricted as if a band were physically tightening around her chest shed be hopelessly compromised if they were discovered it scarcely mattered anymore whether they were occupying the same apartment or not her dismissal and his expulsion would be inevitable and shed meant what shed said about being a true russian with a russians umbilical link to her country abandoning it to go to live in london really would be the ultimate unthinkable sacrifice she supposed it came down to how much she loved charlie maybe more maybe it was how much she truly felt she could trust him there wasnt actually an expression but viskovs features had tightened at apparently being outargued im not suggesting we go uninvited but to believe we wont be is naive he paused yet again addressing natalia more than nikulin which i find surprising for someone whose paramount function is properly considering the political implications of criminal investigations perhaps for that reason it should be her deputywho is after all a trained investigator in his own rightwho supervises everything on a daytoday basis colonel petr pavlovich travin had been viskovs personal choice appointed without any reference to her the most positive indication of an intended almost oldtime purge natalia said and i in turn am surprised that viktor romanovich a politician considers the political implicationssurely the reason for this initial meetingto be secondary they are in my opinion no way secondary they are the first priority she hesitated abruptly aware of another so far unrealized practical difficulty just as quickly recognizing how to overcome it at the same time as hopefully defusing viskovs attack of course the proper russian investigatory team is of the utmost importance and of course my deputy shall have daytoday responsibility she saw the tightness go from viskovs face at his imagining he had won the exchange nikulin appeared aware of the tension between them and said i think weve sufficiently covered that point every indication is that its a wartime situation do we have any archival records of american or british presence there what archival records demanded suslov who sometimes overstressed his contempt for the communist past russia has no accurate history for the past seventy years not in any ministry file or i wouldnt think any intelligence or militia agency everything has been sanitized and corrected and improved after every event for each decision and action to be shown to be the right one there was momentary silence both at the cynicism and the outburst but checks are being made in the foreign ministry persisted nikulin one of suslovs advisers came quickly forward whispering in the deputy ministers ear suslov frowned regretting the apparent prompt yes and also through the records of my ministry offered viskov anxious to recover if this does escalate its important that everything is seen to have been done properly in the correct order quite so nikulin smiled bleakly which was surely what we agreed at my suggestion a few moments ago capped natalia which brings us to the next political consideration what do we do about london and washington should we do anything this early questioned viskov following nikulins lead of seeking an opinion rather than advancing one lets take the worst scenario that an american and an english officer were murdered together with a russian woman suggested nikulin it would have happened too long ago for that in itself to be a difficulty for the present government whatever the circumstances of their being in what was during and after the war a closedtooutsiders stalin gulag complex our concentration has got to be how we handle it now its essential we appear totally open with nothing to hide and we dont have anything to hide the thin man hesitated nodding in private agreement with himself it is going to be a difficult crime to solve after such a long time almostcertainly impossible therell be mistakes problems whats important is keeping us beyond all criticism for those problems he paused in further reflection it would help if they turned out to be spies of course natalia listened intently frowning anxious to anticipate the point toward which the presidential adviser was moving we have an extremely backward but volatile republic suspicious of foreignerswith perhaps the exception of canada with which they have some joint ventureswith russia at the top of the hate list theyre going to resent the need for us to be involved maybe even intentionally make it awkward for whoever we send there the man paused at a moment of rare commitment we need insurance and i think that insurance could very definitely be to involve london and washington at this stage to go as far as inviting them to send investigators at the same time as we send ours logicallyinevitablythat would be charlie natalia accepted once more what would charlies insurance be it would have to be her if they were to survive together natalia admitted so much for avoiding a conflict of interest shed still try to avoid it happening for as long as possible at the same time echoed viskov rhetorically wanting nikulin to recognize his understanding of what the man was saying nikulin gave another bleak smile unoffended at the interruption problemsdifficultiesof an investigation by their own people into a fiftyyearold murder of an englishman and an american would be their problems and difficulties not ours wouldnt they absolutely agreed suslov smiling too nikulin looked directly at natalia i want you to choose your team extremely carefully and brief them even more carefully the investigation will fail it cant do otherwise the failure must be shown to be that of the english and americans not us the agenda for our people must be to make the foreigners provably responsible for every error the smile came again at a perfectly devised strategy still directly addressing natalia he said you have any difficultyargumentwith that none whatsoever lied natalia mikhail suslov said washington and london will have to be officially told through my ministry ill do it immediately this is a boring game protested sasha we got three planes right across the room said charlie the distance from one end of the main salon to the other was much farther than the corridor wall from his empty office desk your planes and you threw them reminded the child mine crashed all your home schoolwork done everything i had to do shed made pictures of a dog and a horse and chosen their initial letters without his help how about a story we could watch television sasha suggested instead american cartoons it helps me to learn the words charlie and natalia wanted sasha to be bilingual and spent half an hour each evening talking only english he wasnt sure of the benefit of the satellite programs and words like pow and wham and blam but he didnt want to lose sashas enthusiasm only while i get supper baked beans she said in english they were a noveltyunavailable in moscowand sashas latest favorite which charlie got through the embassy commissary he turned on the widescreen set in the smaller room and insisted she sit properly in a chair several feet away vaguely remembering a warning about x ray or some sort of ray that could harm children sitting too close can i have it on a tray on my lap no please no why not its not a proper way to eat ley used to let me said sasha ley was the closest sasha had ever been able to get to the given name of alexei popov natalias deputy whom shed planned to marry until charlies exposure of the man as a mafialinked member of the nuclearsmuggling organization manipulating her and the rank he held within the ministry by unspokenalthough in charlies opinion unnecessaryagreement he and natalia never referred betweenthemselves to the man who had contributed to another layer of natalias toomiserable life but very occasionally like now when she wasnt getting her own way sasha followed her childs instinct and experimented charlie said he might have done im not where is ley gone gone where wherever someone goes who gets shot pointblank and full in the face with a mm bullet thought charlie remembering the final moments of the ambush in which popov had tried to kill him he said away is he coming back no never ever never ever so youll eat properly at the table in the kitchen he set her place complete with a proper napkin and timed the beans and toast to be ready when the cartoon program finished he sat opposite while she ate beyond the child the nearly full bottle of islay malt stood out on the drinks tray like a beacon but charlie ignored it even though technically it was happy hour there were a lot of unimagined changes in being a father shall we try to speak english if youd like said charlie pleased it was her suggestion which was how he and natalia always tried to make it how long will mummy be she inverted the verb but for a child of sashas age it was conversationally very good she didnt know shes going to phone to tell us are you going to bathe me another first by himself accepted charlie yes all right said sasha gravely as if giving permission which charlie supposed she was the downstairs buzzer sounded making them both jump by its unexpectedness not natalia thought charlie at once shed promised to phone and in any case she had her own key the grandiose apartment had been an effective part of his cover as a crooked entrepreneur and all the nuclear ringleaders had been either arrested or killed but a lot of the minnow men the gofers and the fetcherswould have gotten through the net and there had always been at the back of charlies mind the awareness that some might know this address might know too that he was the person whod destroyed everything but they wouldnt come at him like this not ring the bell easierbetterjust to wait outside hit him when he arrived or left mummy asked sasha when the bell went again i dont think so said charlie he could legally carry a gun in moscow but didnt hed have liked the comfort of a weapon now even though he wasnt very good never able to keep his eyes open at the moment of firing or keep the kick from hurting his wrist even though he adopted the correct handsupporting shooting crouch he hadnt been the person to shoot popov as popov was preparing to shoot him ill go said sasha brightly no said charlie too sharply stay and wipe your mouth ill see who it is the downstairs door could be forced even if he didnt operate the admission button but it was very thick and heavy and wouldnt be easy and there were two bolts and a crossbar as well as a chain from the previous protection on the apartment door which was practically as strong as that five floors below he wasnt reassured it had been downright fucking stupid to have let himself be trapped like thislike this with sasha of all things without any means of protection or escape the bell sounded a third time as he reached the microphone yes i was about to give up on you it was a womans voice who is this irena natalias sister hello he said to the woman whod called immediately after natalia earlier i wasnt expecting you you said it would be all right to call round so i decided to at once charlie pressed the release button and opened the apartment door in readiness sasha came to the door and when he told her who was coming up the stairs said i like aunt irena she brings me presents irena was in western clothes loafers levis jeans and a designerversion of a fleecylined pilots jacket she picked sasha up kissed her and carried her laughing into the apartment immediately inside she gave sasha a donald duck that climbed quacking up a cord by some mechanism triggered by it being pulled sharply downward the child began to retreat giggling delightedly then stopped and said thank you and kissed the woman again she looked to charlie for approval charlie nodded irena turned at last to charlie so youre my sisters new partner charlie accepted that he was as far as irena was concerned but didnt like the question it inferred thered been a lot he didnt know in fact whether there had been or not it wasnt something he and natalia had felt the need to discuss yes he said simply and english said irena in the same language which she spoke well the embassy or business here something in between avoided charlie daddy was just going to bath me announced sasha now you can help daddy charlie seized at once until that moment she hadnt made any attempt at a name not even a guess at charlie which theyd decided to allow if shed tried irena seized it too daddy if i can be said charlie he wasnt enjoying the encounter why dont i bathe you myselfand read you a storywhile daddy gets me a drink suggested the woman charlie decided he liked the way the title sounded he was glad too that irena had taken over bathtime duties he was learning how to be a father at roughly the same pace as sasha was mastering basic spoken english theres most things he invited scotch water back very american vernacular thought charlie amused he took islay scotch as well pouring both straight setting out her water glass separately and putting ice in a bucket for her to add herself to avoid it melting to dilute the drink for someone who until that moment had been a total stranger irenairena seminova modin charlie remembered from the mcdonalds conversationseemed very adept at appearing an old friend it probably had something to do with being a stewardess longhaul he recalled australia as well america there was a lot of splashing and laughing from the bathroom sasha was in her nightdress warm and freshsmelling when she ran in to kiss him good night she announced aunt irena is going to tell me a story girls only but you can come in to say good night later and ran out again giggling irena emerged ten minutes later pulling her sweater down about her and said i got splashed charlie wondered what had happened to the flying jacket irena was far biggerbusted than her sister and seemed proud of it from the tightness of the sweater he said whats this girlsonly all about irena smiled taking the large enveloping chair beside the couch on which charlie sat she said she wanted to have a secret so i told her to make one up charlie indicated the drink pouring a second for himself irena added just one ice cube properly sipping the water separately and charlie decided there was nothing wrong with a pretension if it was carried out confidently enough irena was doing fairly well how long have you and natalia been together a while said charlie evasively the woman was looking around the apartment and isnt she the lucky one sasha said princesses lived here once and i believe her you must be either very important or very rich or both theres a lot of opportunities in moscow now charlie decided that apart from an obvious facial resemblance irena was different in every way from natalia he preferred natalias natural darkness to irenas blondhighlighted hair and if he was making a direct comparisonwhich he washe thought natalias figure was better too irena verged upon the voluptuous and seemed to want to from the tightness of the secondskin jeans as well as the sweater i know someone from the american embassy trade division irena declared saul freeman you know him of him said charlie cautiously saul freeman headed the fbis station at the us embassy it had been the bureaus success in getting a man based in moscowand the dominance and western crime links of the russian mafiathat had been instrumental in charlies appointment freeman was a balding new york bachelor who shared with the british embassys matchingly single mi residentrichard cartright the apparent ambition to screw every woman in moscow natalia wouldnt be happy at irena finding them together and most certainly not at irena knowing someone with a bureau function from another western embassy howd you meet saul he was on my flight about six months ago she grinned not by choice it was the only plane available she looked around the apartment again but his place doesnt come within a million miles of this cautiously charlie said you seeing each other irena grimaced again pulling down the corners of her mouth we went out to dinner once or twice but he didnt make me laugh and he counts counts in a notebook writes down what he spends when he spends it youre joking i told you there was nothing to laugh about i think youd make me laugh though what do you think i think i know someone whod think he was terrific making a note of his expenditure said charlie refusing the flagrant invitation shed be disappointed he makes love by number too hup one two three hup one two three charlie laughed because he was expected to curious just the same genuine free spirit or something else he shouldnt kid himself it was anything else its a man maybe thats his real interest he tried to explore time to call a halt charlie decided ill check sasha say good night shes okay ill still check sasha was asleep the donald duck string around her wrist charlie gently disentangled it and put it on the bedside table sasha snuffled but didnt wake up when he returned to the smaller sitting room irena had moved from the chair to the couch upon which charlie had earlier sat he momentarily considered the chair but went back to his original seat although wedging himself in the corner farthest from the woman and half turning toward her irena swiveled toward him one leg crooked onto the seat smilingover the separating gap i wont bite not unless im asked good what the hell was this all about careful against misinterpretation he warned himself whats natalia told you about me demanded irena very little she hasnt told me anything about you either so why dont you ask natalia why so shy i dont want to bore you like saul seems to have done i dont think you would he lifted the bottle irena nodded once thought charlie this might even have been fun how do you know i dont keep an account book im usually good at judging men saul was a mistake so what was irena a prick teaser or a pubic scalp collector one was potentially as dangerous as the other quite apart from the embassy connection that wasnt a danger now that it was over and he wasnt interested indidnt want to answereither of the other questions maybe this is a mistake what the smile was quite open now i think you are a very exciting woman beautiful said charlie who believed without conceit that hed perfected sinceresounding dishonesty into an art form at any other time i would have liked to have played these word gamesevery other sort of gamefor a very long time but im with your sister whom i love as i love sasha were wrongly met wrong time wrong circumstances lost opportunities jesus thought charlie there should have been violin music for that last bit so its got to be just friends okay before irena could answer the telephone jarred into the room and charlie thought saved by the bell and was right he replaced the receiver and said natalias on her way home no said irena no what frowned charlie momentarily lost no its not okay fuck you thought charlie at once he corrected himself no i wont despite the obvious offer there is an elite group of men who observe with what can best be described as tolerance the comings and goings of political parties in what are described as democratic elections in the countries of the west invariably the word secretary appears somewhere in their title which conveys totally the wrong impression of their absolute power and unparalleled influence a misconception they foster because these are men who if it were possible would choose physically to be as invisible as they metaphorically are it is they who irrespective of briefly passing governments and electorally promised policies ensure the stable passage of their respective countries through lifes stormy seas each is known personally to and operates with the other in a structure without name or written rules or constitution it is enough that they know which they do instinctively without the need to explain to one another they discuss such a man was kenton peters an urbane cultured american aristocrat of such independent means that his salary always went automatically to charity a man who joined the american state department during the nixon administration which he felt never would have ended as it did had he been in control and who was the first person an incoming secretary of state asked to see upon arrival at foggy bottom unaware that peters had approved his appointment before it had been offered another was james boyce whose family was traceable to the restoration of the english monarchy which one or other of its members had loyally served ever since boyce himself had entered the british foreign office of which he was now permanent secretary during the late premiership of edward heath of all this special elite throughout europe and north america kenton peters was the one with whom james boyce preferred to operatework would have been quite the wrong wordwhen the occasion demanded it was boyce who decided the yakutsk murders were such a demanding occasion and made contact with peters within an hour of the russian message arriving at the foreign office this is something we never expected opened boyce bit of a damned nuisance all round nothing we cant handle of course not how do you intend handling it from your end asked the american involve every intelligence department weve got to create the maximum confusion and insist i have access to everything so i know at all times whats going on and how to misguide if necessary you think we might have to stage a diversion such as questioned boyce if anyone were to get too close and have to die it could be blamed on the russians or people in yakutsk couldnt it i dont think theres the remotest chance of anyone getting close but its certainly something we should consider your person in moscow disposable theyre all disposable i could move someone in from here to do itsomeone nobody knows with no provable attachment to an agency or government offered peters lets make contingency plans agreed boyce and keep in touch absolutely how shouted natalia knowing she was taking out on charlie all the fears and frustrations of the meeting shed just left but unable to separate them from the shock of finding irena calmly sipping whiskey with him when shed gotten home and then having to sit through an hour of frigid conversation before it had been possible to get rid of the woman you gave her the bloody number and the address charlie shouted back she rang and said she had something for sasha and i told her to bring it around sometime i didnt expect her to come right away she had given irena the number natalia remembered did you tell her you were attached to the embassy not directly i let her think it was something to do with joint venture trading he wouldnt tell natalia that irena knew saul freeman im sorry apologized natalia im she stopped im not being a very nice person at the moment am i no answered charlie honestly but youre allowed the adjustment is bigger for you than it is for me and obviously youve got a lot of work pressure he waited hopefully but she didnt respond charlie muffin was on his first paper airplane of the daya new prototype with a separate tail sectionwhen the dustcovered telephone rang and sir rupert dean announced youll get everything on paper of course but i need you to understand a lot of things that arent written the most important is that the future of the departmentand your posting to moscowdepends on your getting everything right charlie had never wasted time over personal disappointmentsapart from the death of his first wife edith which would always be a personal disaster for which hed never forgive himselfbut there was a lasting surge of regret as he listened to the directorgeneral sadness came close behind and thensurprising himselfsympathy natalia hadnt been intentionally perverse hadnt tried in some way to trick or ridicule him maybe shed even thought the assignment wouldnt be given to him although he couldnt really accept that convenient though it would have been natalia was making a mess of it of everything of their being togetherliving togetherand by trying to keep separate their professional lives and by not being able to trust him for which he couldnt blame her and by trying to do everything her way wrongly was endangering all that they hoped to exist between them which was not the immediate consideration the immediate consideration was his need totally to concentrate and understand what he was being told every other agency is involved he demanded determined against the slightest misunderstanding every other agency has been asked to search their archives contributewhatever they can replied dean equally pedantic the investigation is ours which you see as a test were vulnerable everyone snapping at our heels weve got to answer all the questions find out who he was and what he was doing there we do thatyou do thatand ill be able to fight whatever survival battle were confronted with and if i dont then thats what it could become a battle for survival at best we could become a branch of some other agency what about my remaining here in moscow there was a pause from the london end there are arguments being put up against the posting theyd be hard to oppose gerald fucking williams guessed charlie why did the parsimonious bugger take as a personal insult charlies special interpretation of an expense account it wasnt as if it was williamss money perhaps thought charlie he should have considered the early challenges too long ago now to remember as more than the game he chose them to make it virtually challenging the man to catch him out bluntly he said i fail to solve it i get withdrawn my rolemy reason for being in moscowwont exist anymore it would certainly come up for very hard discussion from what you said these killings happened fifty years ago charlie pointed out i know accepted dean and no ones acknowledging our victims belonged to their department theyve only been checking for a few hours but so far no supposedly checking qualified charlie no ones going to want this coming out of the woodwork sis or military intelligence or christ knows who find theyre involved theyre going to bury it for another fifty years there was a further silence from london the edict from whitehalland downing streetis that there mustnt be any embarrassment no matter how long ago it happened whatever it was which means they dont want it solved protested charlie its impossible ridiculous were being set up thats why im calling you i do believe well stand or fall bythis youve personally got every support its possible for me to offer i wish there were more better and i know what im asking charlie wished he did slipping back on to yesteryear wordage charlie said whos my control you deal with me direct at all times stipulated the directorgeneral but lets stay with that control dont you even think of trying or doing anything without discussing it with me first one mistakeone miscalculationis all its going to take this time it was charlie who didnt speak at once eventually he said am i expected to work with sis and the military attache here let them know everything im doing not until youve talked whatever it is through with me first which is what theyre being told probably right now probably accepted dean again you know its hopeless before i start close to being hopeless allowed the older man theres not a lot left to say is there everything weve got from the russian foreign ministry is being faxed back right away and dont forget my personal support there wasnt any point in further protests or arguments a british officerand an americandead for fifty years without anyone wondering what happened to them and a woman too how the hell can you explain that i cant conceded sir rupert dean thats what youve got to do natalia recognized she was the most exposed of them all the one in the greatest danger although there was the outward cosmetic appearance of personal and authoritative involvement the presidential emissary and the deputy ministers all had their blameready intermediaries after whom there was the final buffer of natalia nikandrova herself it was she who provably had to select the russian investigatory team and just as provably had to propose the precise moment to invite washington and london to an international game of musical chairs and after that monitor from a distance of three thousand miles its progress in a timelost republic where everyone would be trying to pull the safe seats away from everyone else at every discordant note with one of its chairsnatching participants beingcharlie muffin whose feet were always too painful for any sort of musical dance it was a maze from which she desperately needed guidance and charlie was the obvious person to give it but if she did seek his guidance this early shed have to tell him why viskov distrusted her and she didnt want any reminders of alexei popov shed grossly stupidly overreacted the previous night to irena being at the apartment which had nothing at all to do with charlie but everything to do with other fearsmemoriesshe didnt want to share with him either she was going to have to share a lot of other things though hed hear today be told by london of the yakutsk murders and realize she could have warned him but hadnt maybe despite her aching loneliness and aching hope for her personal life at last to change it would have been better if charlie hadnt come back to moscow at all natalia physically shook herself as if sloughing off her personal reflections she had left charlie in bed to get to the interior ministry before eight determined to preempt viskov or travinor bothfrom imposing a squad of their choosing and their loyalty upon the investigation she worked wearily resigned to the fact that she would be judged from whomever she assigned and that she couldnt afford the slightest miscalculation and to miscalculate the honesty and loyalty of the moscow militia in which neither existed was the easiest possible mistake to make it was ironicand she hoped to her advantagethat the investigation would be in yakutsk and not here in moscow where virtually the entire militia would have been initially distracted by the automatic requirement for financial reward for doingor not doing depending upon the paymastera job they were paid supposedly to do anyway the disadvantage was that denied the usual bribery by both the obvious age of the crime and the inevitable hostility from the indigenous yakutsk and the gulag descendants finding anyone without an impossibletoleave workload could be more difficult than solving three fiftyyearold murders themselves for the militia homicide detective she went for comparative youth seeking out the most recently promoted someone she hoped only yet ankledeep in thecorruption swamp and she hoped even more still anxious to prove his ability it took natalia five interviews to reach colonel vadim leonidovich lestov she was immediately encouraged by the thirtyyearold mans downattheheel imitation leather shoes and lapelcurled dark gray suit shiny at the seat and elbows a clear indication that he had so far failed to establish a private tailoring allowance he was blond freshfaced and when he became enthusiastic as he did when natalia outlined the assignment and mentioned yakutskaya stammered in his eagerness to get his words out my grandfather is still alive a stalinist he insists the yakutskaya gulags never existed that they were an invention of stalins detractors there are several million people whod argue against him if they were still alive remarked natalia i want to go then you shall decided natalia olga erzin was natalias choice for the forensic pathologist the woman had impeccable medical qualifications five years experience of forensic medicine and a weight problem she appeared to be doing little to control natalia guessed the woman whom she knew from personnel records to be the same age as lestov and like the militia colonel unmarried weighed close to two hundred pounds it will be extremely uncomfortable warned natalia its the chance to become involved in an incredibly unique murder case which will attract attention to you i mean we cant afford any errors i wont make any if you dont said the younger woman i dont understand natalia frowned surprised at the near impertinence by choosing someone other than me said olga after so longand with so little information from which to judgenatalia was unsure if any worthwhile forensic evidence would remain and decided initially only to send one scientist to become team leader if his assessment was that a full sceneofcrime contingent was justified natalia was able to extend her age limitchoice because scientific technicians did not have the accessnor therefore the opportunityfor contorted handshakes in dark alleys lev fyodorovich denebin was a lugubrious fiftyfive years old whose pure white hair rose from his head as if in shock which hed never been whatever the brutality of the crimes hed investigated which since the kgb control of moscow had been virtually replaced by the mafia had been a lot denebin very obviously had that in mind when he said after natalia had outlined what she so far knew this could be fascinating very different his voice was blurred from a lifetimes addiction to tobacco and very difficult natalia warned once more the bastards want us to admit we havent got the facilities protested valentin polyakov theyre going by the book suggested yuri ryabov whod been summoned immediately after the cabinet session that polyakov had chaired acknowledging the degree of independence weve so far achieved its important the british and americans are coming decided polyakov his decision quite positive now we cant question moscows ultimate authority certainly as far as foreign policy said ryabov i dont intend to assured polyakov feeling very satisfied he was a huge towering man his size seemingly made greater by a nevertrimmed spade beard which ironically for a man who despised everything russian was allowed to grow fully down to his chest in the russian style of a man of deep religious orthodoxy which he wasnt polyakov looked intently at his police commissioner but they dont have the power of life or death like they had in the past like they had over my father and your father and everyone elses forefathers here now im in charge and heres what were going to do we show every consideration and help to whoever london and washington send in i want everyone they come into contact with to understand that ill actually receive them he stopped one idea following the other but we wont include the russians you understand what im saying i think so said the militia commissioner uncertainly but dont make it too obvious for your part continued the chief minister i want you as part of whatever investigation team moscow sends at all times its essential publicly to appear a joint investigation not a moscow take over and thats how i want our response to read that were inviting their assistance ryabov shifted his uncertainty growing why exactly because im going to ensure were the focus of world attention announced polyakov who was given to cliche in his attempt to appear statesmanlike moscow has asked for details of what was recovered from the bodies and photographs reminded ryabov polyakov smiled pleased with the way hed worked everything out moscow comes to us on our terms they wait until they get here to see what there is all right accepted the police chief uncomfortably you realize how fortunate we are having the media contacts we have in canada not really ryabov frowned you will promised polyakov alexei popovs replacement as natalias deputy was a taciturn sleekmannered sleekfeatured georgian the deputy interior minister had outmaneuvered an unsuspecting natalia to get petr pavlovich travin appointed making it obvious that after the popov debacle the interior ministry felt it necessary to have their own watchdog as close to the top of her department as possible which was in no way a guarantee of travins honesty or integrity an enshrined legacy of communism maybe even inherited by them from the tsars was that poachers made the best gamekeepers travin listened wordless and expressionless while natalia talked and still didnt immediately speak when shed finished and natalia whod first met charlie as his kgb debriefer when charlie had staged a false defection identified the familiar trick of extended silence to lure more from someone being interrogated with that awareness came curiosity that travin might already consider himself entitled to interrogate her finally the man said i expected to be involved from the very beginning selecting the russian team with you i might have had some suggestions the burly mustached man did consider himself her equalif not morenatalia recognized stressing the demand in her voice natalia said you will be in charge from here of overall liaison between us and the british and americans we expectin fact its been politically decided we wantthem to go to yakutsk what is the chain of command demanded travin virtually in open challenge mine is to dmitri borisovich nikulin the presidents chief of staff yours is to me its imperative from the outset that there are no misunderstandings between us i hope there wont be so do i said travin insolently how many times had she already said and thought those words wondered natalia and how many times was she going to repeat them in the immediate future she said the most important thing for you to understand is that whatever the outcome no blame or error should attach to our people ive understood that already assured travin thats good it was only when natalia was redrafting for the third time her bureaucratically necessary memorandum to dmitri nikulinwith copies to everyone else in the planning groupthat she accepted the first version had been quite adequate and that she was stupidly delaying her return to lesnaya and charlie im on my way she said into the telephone theres a lot to talk about said charlie i know its an opportunity insisted vitali novikov how why asked his wife therell be foreigners american and english what good will they be demanded marina i dont know not yet but ill find a way vitali maksimovich youve tried so hard for so long nothing works you want georgi and arseni to live like weve had to live you know i dont but there is no other way no way out my father was a clever man a meticulous man and youre clever too my darling but i cant see how americans or british can help us ill find a way repeated the medical examiner stubbornly even if i have to cheat and lie gerald williams examined his idea from as many aspects as he could think of before telephoning his fellow finance director across the river at vauxhall cross his second call was to richard cartright in moscow i thought i should introduce myself now that our two departments are going to be working together said williams the phrase that came to charlies mind was phony war although it didnt fit because he wasnt going to allow a war between himself and natalia phony or otherwise they were moving around the apartment overly attentive upon sasha overly polite toward each other with long periods of silence as if each were expecting the other to fire the first shot it was however natalia who proposed the armistice angry no charlie was on his second islay malt of the evening sasha already asleep what then disappointed it had to be this way from our foreign ministry to yours in london she shook her head to the wine he held up i know that you might just have mentioned something charlie was in fact very angry although not at natalia hed timed the telephone lecture from sir rupert dean at forty minutes immediately followed by the promised memorandum and after that there had been the personal visit from richard cartright with the insistence that he was sure they were all going to work together perfectly towhich charlie had thought bollocks and said he was just as sure ive got so much to mention i doubt ill remember it all said natalia turning his expression charlie looked at her curiously go on im not sure i can do it blurted natalia that we can do it keep secret what we have to ive almost gone mad and she still didnt intend to tell him everything it might have helped to talk he was glad he hadnt told her of irenas apparently brief affair with saul freeman glad too that thered been no personal contact from the woman after that one night which shed hinted at when hed walked her to the streetlevel door perhaps i just wanted to do it this way try some separation so that we couldnt be professionally accused of anything charlie smiled at her sadly i know i was a shit before but ill make you a solemn promise i will never ever cheat you or use you or expose you to any risk i can possibly avoid or put sasha at any risk natalia stayed silent for several minutes changing her mind and pouring her own wine i believe you about us she didnt charlie decided she wanted tomaybe would come to in timebut at the moment there was too much to forget he took sir rupert deans fax from his pocket and slid it across the table toward her now its official i suppose we can talk about it she smiled relieved it had been this easy reading it slowly not looking up for several minutes those are all the facts there are seems like it how do you feel about working with the sis she asked anticipating the answer i dont like working in groups cartright wont be the only person its an order charlie said natalia at once worried they wont know that will they they might even have their uses he sipped his whiskey read up on what i could about yakutskaya from the embassy library seems a hell of a place there was an embassy assessment from here in stalins time just at the suggestion of the gulags that was marked doubtful because the descriptions werent considered humanly possible even though stalins been denounced and disgraced public records stay sanitized said natalia i wont take a paperback and sun oil natalia refused the anxious flippancy be careful charlie waited when natalia didnt continue he said everyone and his dog out to screw me i wont let you be exposed to any risk i can possibly anticipate and prevent said natalia matching his earlier promise at once urgently charlie shook his head dont anticipate for me let me anticipate for myself so you dont trust me were not talking us insisted charlie were talking gutter survival ive been there lived my life there you havent not operationally leave me to watch my own back until i ask for help that way theres no confusion in his opinion she couldnt do without his help but he could do without hers judged natalia there isnt a score to even charlie im not balancing scores persisted charlie unhappy at her response this hasnt anything to do with your not talking to me before now he waved the london fax still lying between them you think the americans got the same positive so charlie said patiently although still with some urgency weve got fiftyyearold unreported totally unknown murders of apparent english and american officers weve got a hostile probably obstructive local authority weve got a resented moscow intrusion without doubt someone involved from america and in effect im working under monitor he paused trying to imagine anything hed left out unable to he went on each and every one of whomwith the possible exception of whoever america sendswill be trying to discredit each and everyone else theres no way from a distance of three thousand miles you could or can anticipate what will be going on not in a way to help me he gulped at his whiskey needing the pause who the fuck was going to help him then it was the worst possible scenario a buncha committeeof disorganized fractious warring people and committeesworking with them for them being part of themranked on charlies hate list equal to tight shoes ice in single malt and the need constantlyto justify his expenses maybe even a little higher than all three i wasnt thinking of three thousand miles away said natalia quietly i was thinking about back here in moscow charlie drank some more whiskey matching her seriousness id be grateful and need it maybe she needed it more than him thought natalia im frightened charlie nothings working out as it should it hasnt started yet im worried how its going to finish charlie responded before natalia when sasha cried out he was back within minutes from the childs bedroom after resettling her she had a bad dream im having them too said natalia and they dont go away when im awake it was charlies idea for he and natalia to test their intuition one against the other by refusing any prior opinion of the russian group with whom he would be going to yakutskaya not even to be told their names it meant his going to the interior ministry totally unprepared because there hadnt been the prior contact hed half expected from the american embassy and charlie hadnt called saul freeman there was no benefitnot yet at leastand he certainly didnt intend conveying even an impression of a joint operation despite sir rupert deans assurance that london and washington had agreed on complete cooperation charlies initial surprise on entering petr travins office was that it was miriam bell the fbi chiefs deputy and not saul freeman himself who was already there she had a yellow legal pad on a primly crossed leg the skirt of her severe business suit covering her knee the blond hair was in a tightly coiled chignon she gave the barest response to charlies greeting so too did the russian pathologist and the forensic scientist at travins introduction but vadim lestov stood smiled and insisted in experimental english that he was delighted to meet charlie seemingly reminded travin said there was an interpreter available if necessary miriam said it wasnt ahead of charlie that at least might make things easier commented travin at the moment very little else does id appreciate knowing what else there is beyond what was sent to my state department said miriam the ice maiden meets the ice mummies thought charlie sitting back contentedly except that was hardly miriam bells reputation according to freeman who enjoyed not only kissing but telling she swore like the devil and was more than willing to use the body of an angel to each and every advantage although she did have a figure made for underwear commercials it was in other ways he needed to know a lot more about her decided charlie he wondered idly if miriam had been as disappointed in freemans fuckbynumbers technique as irena to the side of the huge room there were two stenographers and an operator at a recording machine international crimefighting cooperation like justice had to be seen to be done charlie supposed during alexei popovs unsuspected tenure of an office very similar to this thered been vodka as well as tea from a traditional samovar for such encounters but then popov had hidden deceit behind friendliness there were some belongings on the bodies but nothing that could identify them offered travin what demanded charlie bluntly for the benefit of the record when it was necessary charlie was capable of oscar award performances personal items we dont know what admitted the russian tightly theyre not here persisted charlie no conceded the man tighter still the first publicly recorded indication of difficulties to come judged charlie making his own intentionally awkward contribution charlie looked between travin and lev denebin and said so youre quite confident of the forensic facilities in yakutsk denebin actually looked toward the notetakers before saying i dont think i can say that at all i dont know i mean i need to see whats there charlie was conscious of travin looking very intently at him charlie said i would have thought your facilities were better here in moscow until denebins startled reaction the three chosen russians had been sitting relaxed too obviously observers so theredbeen a separate earlier blameapportioning session they should have been better rehearsed to prevent the preparation being so obvious travin said the yakut authorities appear to think its better for what was recovered to remain there so you did ask for it pounced charlie the inquiry is at a very early stage floundered travin trapped the concentration has been upon assembling an investigation team advising your respective governments it was sufficient decided charlie allowing the pause which miriam bell hurriedly filled have the files been checked here for any records of an american or a british officer being in that region which i understand to have been a closed part of the old soviet union yes said travin grateful to escape both foreign and interior ministries there is nothing officially recorded what about photographs of the bodies said miriam travin shifted uncomfortably yakutsk have said there are some with the other material colonel lestov should have been asking questions thought charlie more bad rehearsal what about prison records virtually all of yakutskaya was a prison colony wasnt it travins face began to color it was but the records are very inadequate what do exist are being examined naturally there can be no question of british and american nationals being sentenced to this or any other region his face began to clear in realization of escape and as our advice to both your governments made clear these officers were dressed in their military uniforms and carried some personal items which would not have been allowed had they been prisoners too forcefully in his eagerness the man finished so a search of records would be pointless but you are still looking insisted charlie thats what you said what im trying to make clear is my governments total commitment to investigate these murders that very definitely was rehearsed recognized charlie just as rehearsed miriam said ive been authorized to offer every facility on behalf of my government might as well go for broke with those busy little pens and recordingtapes scratching away decided charlie i appreciate as im sure my american colleague does the cooperation youre offering i for my part want it to be understood that i see my role as an observeralthough prepared at all times to contribute in any way that i am askedto a russian investigation he allowed a long pause come on come on he thought although not looking at miriam yes came in the american as if on cue thats certainly how i see it too travin nodded to disguise the heavy swallow i see you all acting together as a team he tried we respect your ability dont expect you to hold back to be invited to give an opinion this is in fact going to be a unique investigation the precise words alexei popov had used in this very same room about a year earlier remembered charlie popov had been a far more adept bastard than his successor still wrong to be too confident too soon looking obviously at the notetakers charlie said i am impressed by the obvious efficiency with which this has all begun i will of course make available copies of all my reports to london for your murder dossiers and would like copies of yoursincluding that of this meetingto create my full file he smiled sideways at miriam thats the sort of arrangement to which youd agree wouldnt you she said yes that sounds fine miriam bell offered the drink and suggested the conveniently close intourist hotel and charlie accepted although he preferred the bar of the savoy after they were served she said you want to tell me what that was all about back there doing my best to prevent the back of my head from being blown off like some poor bastards was fifty years ago if hed added any more water to his whiskey after the barmans adulteration there wouldnt have been any taste at all not enough she protested the bolteddoor reserve wasnt the earlier suspected arrogance charlie decided it was getallbutsaynothing things go wrong they want scapegoats were it what if things go right same role i thought lestov seemed a nice enough guy well see what about you and i no reason for us to work in opposition what about together doesnt seem therell be an alternative he gestured for more drinks changing his to vodka there wasnt the need to dilute the cheaper local drink so much to get a three hundred percent markup but if there was youd prefer it dont want anyone else to suffer from my mistakes or suffer those of others yourself thats about it i suppose its also being honest he grinned at her you get the identity of your american first itll most likely lead me to my man wont it i think ive got the rules she sipped her drink shed chosen vodka from the beginning surprised its me not saul yes hes expecting to be called back to washington any minute didnt want to be off base so i get the big chance jesus thought charlie sneaky bastard didnt lie any better than irena described the way he fucked emptily he said thats what we all need the big chance this isnt my first overseas assignment she said in unasked defense ive worked manila and tokyo but nothing like this before is it too obvious charlie recognized the littlegirllost ploy not at all you all set to go i guess pack a lot of chiffon scarves what chiffon scarves pack as many as youve got the protection hed decided upon after reading about yakutskaya had arrived from harrods that morning in the embassys diplomatic shipment he could hardly wait for gerald williams to get the bill charlie assessed his score at ten out of ten he judged travin to be working to a separate agenda to which natalia limited her agreement but she did admit thered been a much longer separate briefing between her deputy and the three russians which was why theyd made the mistake of not asking questions and the yakut ruling council had refused to send any evidence in advance of the investigation teams arrival travins furious said natalia delighted with the recorded outcome of the mans encounter with charlie it could hardly have been better if she had told him the threat she believed herself to be under hes not very good it was unthinkable that he would make any comparison with popov dont underestimate him i dont underestimate anybody not this early in a case what about the woman what about her think youll have a problem working with her that wasnt at all what natalia meant charlie knew sadly i dont work with people if i can help it but theres every reasonevery advantagein cooperating here until it proves otherwise so i will he was about to make a joke of her real concern but abruptly stopped himself remembering the hurt of her past instead he continued seriously and i seem to remember promising that i would never ever cheat you and i meant cheat in every way so no im not going to try to seduce miriam bell or anyone else for that matter natalia smiled abashed im sorry so was he decided charlie one day he supposed the trust would be there he wondered when vitali maksimovich novikov straightened triumphantly from the attic box gazing down at what he considered the treasure it contained his father had been a meticulous man there had to be something good to hear your voice greeted kenton peters and yours said boyce everythings in place this end the confusion is absolute thats good and ive spoken to the man himself how is he as overconfident as always im glad the yakutskaya authorities are being awkward so am i like to know a little more of their thinking though we cant have everything james whos your disposable man odd name muffin an awkward bastard according to his file actually caused a lot of trouble in your cia a long time ago embarrassed your director as well as our directorgeneral deserves to be punished then quite you briefed anyone selected him havent briefed him yet too early better send me muffins file that cia business would be enemy of the state justification will do agreed boyce i think weve got everything under wraps dont you cant think of anything weve overlooked all of charlies forebodings were confirmed from the very outset there was no trace of their confirmed reservations on aeroflots ten am domodedovo airport departure for yakutsk until charlie offered his passport with a note folded inside that still however didnt guarantee a seat it was agony for him to have to run like everyone else but they got to the aircraft ahead of families with small children and the infirm while there were still unoccupied seats vadim leonidovich lestov determinedly elbowed his way through to get beside miriam bell and olga erzin and the russian forensic scientist remained stubbornly and protectively together which left charlie to fight for himself which suited him perfectly he hoped it would be a permanently established division he managed a seat next to a yakut who greeted him with a graveyardtoothed smile and a miasma of halitosis so bad charlie wastempted to surrender his place to a loudly demanding armwaving woman with an apparent official boarding pass there were however at least seven more identical arguments going on simultaneously throughout the aircraft which meant it was overbooked as aeroflot planes always were and that no other seat was available charlie was isolated as a dispensable foreigner by an androgynous stewardess whose arrival he greeted with another note which secured his occupation and got the pass of the stillprotesting woman torn up as she was escorted from the aircraft immediately after takeoff the passenger directly in front abruptly and without warning fully reclined his seat the back of which stopped just inches from charlies face even though he threw himself backward the frame of the inset meal table jammed tightly just below charlies knees threatening the blood supply the man ignored charlies shoulder tap and whispered plea to ease forward and told him to fuck off when he tapped harder the yakut obligingly made room for charlies legs despite his advanced tooth decay charlies companion chewed contentedly upon an appropriately turdshaped black and sinewy piece of pemmican he took unwrapped from inside an enveloping jacket aware of charlies interest the man smiled again and generously offered charlie a bite wet end first when the tepid mystery described as lunch was put before him charlie wasnt sure hed made the right decision refusing the chance of even previously chewed dried meat he offered the tray minus the vodka and wine to the yakut who eagerly accepted the manly stewardess was just as eager to serve him more vodka when she realized hed pay in dollars the visa kiosk at yakutsk airport was shuttered charlie stood back to let other passengers hammer and protest against the metal grill and miriam stayed with him so did the three russians and charlie frowned at the prospect of being the group tour guide it was only two in the afternoon but already it seemed to be darkening from twilight into night it took them more than an hour to progress into the customs hall their luggage was already waiting the pathologist and forensic scientists had tried to anticipate the equipment they might need with no way of knowing what would be locally available olga said at once im missing a case some saws spare scalpel blades youd better report started miriam before stopping abruptly embarrassed we are the police charlie reminded grinning at her there was no airconditioning within the terminal building and charlie felt his clothes melting around him in the humidity already there were a lot of flies and insects resigned olga said therell be no point will there none said lestov positively can you manage without im going to have to arent i yuri ryabov aleksandr kurshin and vitali novikov were waiting on the outside concourse the silverhaired urbanely mannered militia chief whod put on his neatly pressed and newest uniform for the occasion looked curiously at the disheveled although obviously westerndressed charlieparticularly at the snowshoesspread hush puppiesand said in russians whos that charlie said im the british investigator everyone able to speak russian will make it easier to work together charlie wasnt offendedhe never was when somebody underestimated himbut he was surprised at the stupidity he was sure hed caught the slight smirk of satisfaction from kurshin charlie was conscious of the intense examination from the third man in the group also in russian miriam said and im american hello ryabov looked more confused than embarrassed gesturing toward three waiting undesignated cars the local militia chief said youll want to settle in after such a long flight weve booked you into the ontario first stupid now clever thought charlie whod spent the intervening days since first being alerted to the murders preparing himself far more thoroughly than by simply buying a beekeepers hat that would be necessary in the summerlike temperatures in the short time outside the airport terminal hed already noted the preeminence of horsedrawn transport in his search for nonexistent taxis and knew the ontario hotel a canadian joint venture was a thirtyminute car ride from the yakutsk town center effectively they would be as imprisoned as the original russian exiles it was the thin intense man who at once introduced himself and maintained the aircraft division hurrying forward to usher charlie into his car which charlie allowed unprotesting but curious wonderingif novikov was intended to be his personal jailer ryabov shepherded miriam and lestov into his vehicle leaving the remaining russians to go with the local homicide investigator always ready to kiss as well as look a gift horse in the mouth charlie said is it always as dark at this in the proper summer its lighter maybe for two months of the year the cars body shell was a lada but the inside was cannibalized from other vehicles it smelled of longtime dampness charlie said you lived here all your life there was a quick look across the car regrettably i was born here charlie awarded himself ten out of ten again sometimes the gods whoever and from wherever they were truly smiled he said until a few days ago id never heard of yakutsk or the region few people ever have or want to charlie saw the pathologist was whiteknuckled from the tightness with which he was holding the wheel why wondered charlie had the arrival examination been so equally intense the man was blinking rapidly and perspiration was bubbled on his upper lip charlie moved to speak but before he could novikov said you have come especially from london the temptation to rushto try at once to use the advantage of being alone how he always preferred to bewas enormous but charlie held back i am permanently based in moscow i hope he added mentally officially queried the man then just as quickly he nervously answered his own question yes of course you must be the end of the old system i suppose its a very new arrangement agreed charlie there were times to push against the tide and times to go with the flow you are the first under that arrangement yes you must have been special chosen have influence maybe the man wanted him to be special why there were reasons he said seeking another guiding question to fill the emptiness of his reply are you attached to the british embassy in moscow yes where the hell was this going you must know important people charlie exaggerated the shrug of apparent modesty seeing the crack of light in the literal darkness i suppose i do things are very different in moscow now different in russia he gestured to the two cars in front once our being here like this would have been unimaginable as it was unimaginable that a british officer was here more than fifty years ago he thought novikov said very little changes here never for the better it was difficult to conceive that what little charlie could see outside the car could have been worse the countryside was unlike anything he had seen or experienced before ever imagined the stretchedtothe nearhorizon twilight was only broken by the stickdrawn blackness of skeletal leafnaked trees a childs pencil drawing abruptly denied by the suddenly vivid paintbox colors of rarely seen plants brought to life by the strange thaw most difficult of all was to believe that beneath such a barren infertile moonscape larger than the entire indian subcontinent lay the majority of the worlds reserves of oil gas coal gold and diamonds or that for so many stalin yearsand aftermen women and child slaves had little more than their bare hands and those stickthin tree branches for pit props to mine it charlie with difficulty remained silent his footthrobbing instinct telling him the other man had more to say but abruptly novikov had fallen silent although his hands were still whiteknuckled at the wheel and the perspiration still flecked his upper lip they entered yakutsk along the ploshchad druzhby charlie had read along with everything else of the melting effect of brick and concrete houses upon permanently frozen ground but hadnt anticipated the added effect of the unprecedented thaw one of sashas englishlearning nursery rhyme books had a doggerel about a little crooked man who lived in a little crooked house and charlie thought it could have been written about this place only the wooden buildings lifted free of the ground on stilts had any proper houselike shape everything of brick or concrete was lopsided tilting this way and that their walls fissured cracked and lined like old mens faces novikov turned on to prospekt lenina pointed to a series of buildings all close together and said my professional oppositionoutside of each were docile lines of men and women waiting for admission wrong to appear too ignorant decided charlie shamans novikov nodded healers and a lot more besides the local people dont understand whats happening with the weather it should be cold now minus twenty celcius at least possibly lower snow a meter two meters deep they think its a curse that the spirits are offended what will they do to placate them asked charlie novikov humped his shoulders there are rituals offerings he caught charlies quick sideways look no he said smiling for the first time no blood sacrifices but theyre linking these killings with it they know it would have been impossible for those bodies to have been where they were they say spirits put them there as a warning of what asked charlie thats what theyre asking the shamans to tell them through the topsyturvey buildings charlie occasionally glimpsed the lena river which became more visible muddy debrislittered and unusually fast as they began to clear the town hed kept a comparison between the number of motorized to horsedrawn vehicles and decided he was right about the choice of the ontario hotel as they entered the parking lot charlie said it wouldnt take him long to unpack and novikov said he wasnt in any hurry the hotel was properly built for the normal local climate and far better than a lot of hotels in which charlie had stayed in the eastern bloc during his operational days of the cold war there was no bribeprompting hindrance with their reservations all of which were on the third floor charlies room directly opposite miriams the shower worked and despite the promise to the waiting man downstairs charlie used it and changed convinced the jacket hed been wearing retained the odorous trace of his gaptoothed aircraft companion he took particular care to avoid snagging the mosquito net hed had shipped in with the special hat and doused the window area with insect spray the bath had a plug still attached to its chain so there had been no need for the spare hed packed from long experience everything he did however was automatic his mind upon the journey from the airport yakutsk might as well be on anotherplanet and its inhabitants aliens but charlie didnt have any doubt there were messages and meanings in the curious conversation hed had with the pathologist they would still have to come from the man himself someone clearly as nervous as novikov could easily be frightened away it was an uneasy gathering in the bar below an uneasiness which charlie did not have to work too hard to maintain vadim lestov remained siamesetwin close to an accepting miriam while the two local police officers tried hard but seemingly unsuccessfully to ingratiate themselves with olga erzin and the forensic scientist when charlie joined them vitali novikov was trying to talk to the moscow pathologist too her patronizing disinterest in the local medical examiner verged upon outright rudeness they ate reindeer steaks which charlie enjoyed identifying from its texture the dried turd the man beside him had chewed upon during the incoming flight the reserve was more noticeable during the meal from olga and the forensic scientist than from lestov although the militia colonel kept himself to one glass of canadianimported wine miriam tried hard but failed with the other woman and charlie concentrated determinedly upon vitali novikov holding the mans total attention with talk of london and moscow carefully interspersed with hints of the authority that seemed important to the doctor it was charlie who afterward suggested returning to the bar and its canadian whiskey which he considered an unexpected bonus everyone except charlie who was confident of his capacity and olga who appeared uncaring continued to limit their alcohol intake although as the evening progressed lestovs stammering became more pronounced using novikovs insistence that his wife was expecting him charlie broke the evening up walking with the local pathologist to the lobby where the elevators were charlie said thank you again for being at the airport i enjoyed our conversation i did too said novikov im looking forward to starting work tomorrow im going to be relying upon you a great deal i hope we can learn to work together that doesnt seem to be anyone elses idea im only interested in my own said charlie in case you need to contact me at all im in room thirtyseven ill remember that promised novikov charlie rode bemused silently to the third floor but made no effort to get into bed within fifteen minutes he heard miriams quick footsteps alone along the outside corridor and her door open and shut it was half an hour later when there was a second set of heavier footsteps and another quick opening and closing of the americans door with the sixhour time difference it was still only six in the evening in moscow but charlie failed to get a connection to the embassy when he tried to dial direct experimentally charlie booked the call through the hotel switchboard where it would be logged the connection was made immediately charlie smiled not surprised raymond mcdowell and richard cartright came anxiously on to a conference call together for the benefit of the suspected eavesdropper charlie exaggerated the total cooperation and assured the two men he had made the official request for the return of the body which had amounted to the only proper conversation that evening with the militia commander do you imagine any problem with that asked mcdowell no when are you meeting the council nothings been arranged which wasnt charlie had already decided an oversight he made up his mind to give the head of chancellery a gift of his special hat if mcdowell had personally to come from moscow whats it like there unusual london is concerned announced cartright the finding of the bodies got leaked it seems through canada and from there obviously to america theres a lot of media interest building up i can imagine said charlie ive promised a cable from here tomorrow ill try to give you something charlie hesitated if i havent come through to you by this time tomorrow you ring me telephone calls out arent easy charlie had just replaced the telephone when the knock came hesitantly at his door i hope you dont mind said the rapidly blinking novikov not at all said charlie opening the door more widely richard cartright was seeking not providing so it was right he crossed the river from the british embassy to the american legation on ulitza chaykovskovo and when saul freeman said he liked chinese food cartright suggested they simply walk the few blocks to the peking it was freeman who guided the way into the foreign currency section cartright deferred to the americans superior knowledge of a chinese menu written in russian too we heard from charlie in yakutsk offered cartright at once just arrived nothings started yet thats what miriam told me bizarre place apparently thought you might have gone yourself what about you hedged freeman would have done in the old days agreed cartright as if he were volunteering something seeing a way to follow mi in england is increasingly taking an fbi crimefighting role so it had to be charlie the winegeorgianwas poured without their being asked to taste it the surprise was that it was drinkable interesting guy said freeman which was precisely the reaction cartright wanted no one at the embassy quite knows how to take him lot of experience apparently bit unconventional like the second phone call from gerald williams was unconventional although it was a combined operation and cartright had checked that the two financial directors were talking to each other in london cartrights unease was not so much keeping an eye on a colleague as personal apprehension at that colleague being as odd and as unpredictable as he was finding charlie muffin to be one of our guys died in that nuclear business reminded freeman although without hostility there were some casualties although not physical at our embassy too recalled cartright nervously you ever go out socially with him find out what sort of guy he was freeman shook his head gather he and a gal from our technical department in washington got close on the nuclear thing but he doesnt seem particularly social apart from the odd drink got a hell of an apartment i understand never been there though neither have i cartright decided he was wasting his time got any interesting numbers to swap freeman smiled got to know a fantastic aeroflot stewardess worth a hello call wouldnt be telling you if she wasnt her names irena it must be widely known that there was a camp nearby pressed charlie there were so many how did you remember gulag my father you havent told anyone else not ryabov or kurshin no why not i want something they cant give me what makes you think i can im taking the biggest chance ive ever taken in my life in praying that you might be able to and until you do you dont get everything which is how i am protecting myself in a long and often uncertain life charlie muffin had met a lot of desperate men and recognized that vitali maksimovich novikov was a very desperate man indeed without any compunction charlie further decided it was an attitude to be taken every advantage of certainly until the doctor stopped playing games and spelled out the deal he wanted everyone had to live and to live it was first necessary to survive it was a very good beginning the transport division was the same as the previous day as theyassembled in the hotel parking lot charlie thought it was practical for olga erzin to have worn trousers but as big as she was it created an unfair comparison between the russian pathologist and the american whose jeans were actually tailored as the vehicles moved off novikov said its getting hotter hed follow the other mans pace at all times after the previous nights approach charlie decided settling in novikovs car which did not of course preclude a little prodding the sun was actually visible today and it was airless the roads were permanently wet with the seepage from the deeper thawing of the roadedge tundra and the insect swarms were much thicker and persistent charlie lowered the window hoping the rush of passing air would blow them away it didnt seem to help seizing the obvious opening charlie said when the weather is normal when you have your usual spring and summer here does it get as hot as this this would be a very hot day unusually so at the end of your summer after a period of warmth how deep into the ground does the thaw reach novikov gave one of his nervous sideways glances aware it was not a casual conversation about the weather about a meter i suppose maybe less why how deep was the grave novikov drove on in silence for several moments much deeper than that at least a meter and a half kurshin took measurements had anything been done to disinter the bodies before you arrived no but an arm was protruding yes how much of an arm to the wrist the elbow the shoulder asked charlie from the wrist not much of that they were among the higgledypiggledy nurseryrhyme buildings of the town again the lines seemed longer outside the shaman temples on prospekt lenina a lot of the people thereand on the other streetswere wearing their heavy winter clothes unbuttoned and undone expecting the phenomena to disappear at a finger snap or a shamans incantation although it was only ten in the morning there were already several men slumped drunkenly or sleeping against walls one lay in the gutter novikov said miners they come into town once a month to drink and fuck there have to be houses because normally its too cold but theyre hardly brothels just shelters theres three in the next street back by the vodka factory i suppose theres something significant that the factory is the biggest building in town charlie thought the red brickdust smear down an ocher wall looked like blood several moments before novikov identified it as their mortuary destination charlie made a mental note to pick up later on the mine conversation the transformation of olga erzin in the surroundings of a mortuary was almost visible she virtually expanded into an autocratic bully clipping her words and responses instinctively assuming superiority it was olga not novikov whose mortuary and laboratory it was who led the way up the rickety stairs into the building she stopped just inside the autopsy room exaggerating her disdain making no effort to help novikov or his two tentative assistants get the three naked corpses from the storage cupboards onto examination trolleys already on separate tables alongside each like produce displays at a village fete were the proper specimen containers augmented by village fete vegetable jars holding what charlie guessed to be every removable organ of each body behind each again on separate identifying tables were the uniforms and their contents at once charlie saw dismayed that nothing had been done to keep the uniforms or the womans clothes in the subzero temperature at which they had survived for so long already mold had begun to fur the fabric endangering possible stains or marks from the moment of death charlie said to novikov id appreciate it if you could keep it as simpleas nonmedically technicalas possible he smiled im going to need all the help i can get and youre the only person who might be able to provide it thats a hopeful expectation sniffed the moscow pathologist which im sure will be met said charlie still smiling id appreciate your nontechnical input too thats the understanding isnt it total and mutual cooperation the woman looked sharply at charlie aware of the rebuke she said ill look forward to your input as well the sooner we start the better then said charlie easily the woman made as if to respond but then apparently changed her mind instead she turned back to novikov and peremptorily said talk me through your examination to olga erzins obvious irritation novikov translated every medical technicality into laymans terms identifying each organ in each container charlie listened patiently to the recital waiting for the details of the actual injuries at the same time he tried his best to study the clothing conscious for the first time that a space at the bottom of the individual tables was allocated to sceneofcrime photographs they were either badly taken or badly printedor perhaps bothbut even from a distance of almost two meters charlie thought he isolated something curious he concentrated totally upon novikov when the man began to talk about the head wounds looking around anxiously for the recovered bullets relieved when he saw two in separate kidney bowls among the organ exhibits again before everyone else he said all three were shot in the back of the head yes confirmed the local medical examiner i can only see two bullets the one that killed the woman exited through the throat didnt you find it in the grave demanded denebin at once no admitted kurshin to the forensic scientists sigh were there any powder burns to the skulls to indicate the gun was held tightly against the head asked miriam all the skulls were shattered to varying degrees particularly around the point of entry said novikov what about fragments in the grave demanded olga from the pause and looks that passed between the local pathologist and aleksandr kurshin charlie guessed no proper search had been made kurshin said i was not able to recover any has the scene been secured ryabov looked to his homicide chief and quickly said you did put people there like i told you didnt you its intact said kurshin although unconvincingly charlie said what about shell casings in or around the grave kurshin shifted awkwardly i did not recover any to denebin charlie said the bullets in the kidney bowls are reasonably intact id say theyre ninemillimeter i think so agreed the forensic scientist easy enough to establish going back to novikov charlie said have you weighed the bullets everyone frowned at charlie in varying degrees novikov said theyre just bullets theyll be standard weight id like to know precisely said charlie surprised lestov looked confused thats what too much sex does for you my son charlie thought miriam bell actually reached out to turn over the hand of the man designated to be american was there any fingernail debris some grave dirt that i guess was forced beneath them when he pitched forward after being shot the nails are manicured said miriam almost to herself youve washed the hands did you take photographs before doing that instead of answering the pathologist shuffled through the pictures on the contents table and offered her two prints miriam studied them before offering them sideways to charlie who at once gestured for lestov to look ahead of him before he could do so lestov felt the dead hand miriam had turned and said its soft not blistered he didnt dig his own grave neither did the other two came in novikov quickly their hands are unmarked their hands would literally have been raw if they had even been made to try digging through concretehard ground acknowledged charlie which had been the point of his conversation in the car with the local pathologist he was sure he knew how the grave had been created and wondered if theyd worked it out the wrist bruising is very definitely linear said denebin taking the hand from the other russian handcuffs obviously were they still handcuffed demanded miriam no said kurshin why take them off wondered miriam charlie was sure he knew aloud he said and there were insects in the tracheae of all three novikov pointed to the microscope slides on the exhibition table there i want to carry out a second autopsy announced olga erzin where can i change for a moment novikov looked nonplussed theres a toilet along the corridor he managed at last sighing the woman stomped off at the order from novikov the two yakut attendants wheeled the trolley holding the corpse of the woman to the central examination table charlie stayed close to the uniforms their contents and the photographs although not at that moment making any tooobvious effort to study anything the clothing all heavily bloodstained around the collar was beginning to smell as well as go moldy olga swept back into the room in a trousered medical tunic like a barge in full sail charlie waited expectantly for her to insist the room be cleared but she didnt lev denebin appeared uncertain which group to join those at the exhibit tables or olga and novikov at the autopsy slab after a moments indecision the forensic scientist came to where charlie stood his back now to the second dissection of the female corpse beside him miriam said bizarre charlie didnt think so at all but he said certainly a strange situation he reached out then stopped he said to kurshin every hard surface has been checked for fingerprints i couldnt find anything said the local detective apologetically i doubt there would have been in the conditions said denebin without any discussion they divided according to nationality charlie by the table holding the english uniform miriam to the american and denebin and lestov going to where the clothing of the believed russian woman was laid out charlie carefully separated the coin from the paper and warscript money feeling the surge of satisfaction at his immediate find in predecimalization coin there were four pennies four half crowns and two florins protected as they had been in a trouserpocket none were affected from being buried for so long the brightest was a half crown dated the earliest date was on a florin therewas another possible time frame indicatorand a very positive direction to followfrom the inscription in the case containing six camel cigarettes sn a first from a proud father caught by the thought charlie turned to the corpse just as the attendants were moving it momentarily halting them while he examined each hand the mark where a signet ring had been was very obvious on the little finger of the left there was no inscription on the watch case it didnt have a date register either although an unspecified day of an unspecified month would have been a difficult clue it was difficult too to surmise anything from the stopping time of experimentally he tried winding it but the button was jammed if it had run on after the assassination it would only have been for less than twentyfour hours its significance was that it had still been on the mans wrist charlie decided he closely examined the keys the parker pen and the tie pin before going to the photographs before the actual clothing wanting a sequence the agonyrigored face was dirtsmeared but clearly recognizable particularly in comparison against the second facial set which from the background had been taken in this examination room just prior to the first postmortem fairhaired not clipped militarily short a highcheekboned aristocratic face badly swollen by insect bites moments before he died and agony too maybe disbelieving surprise which didnt square with the handcuff marks charlie put that impression on hold moving through the photographs getting the confirmation of something else within the first three frames he looked around seeing kurshin with the group by the russian woman can you help me he asked everyone at the other two tables immediately looked at him miriam said found something too anxious charlie thought so she was having difficulty i dont know yet pointing to the photograph he held charlie called to novikov thats how you found them in the grave you hadnt touched them thats how they were exactly the man called back charlie said theyre not properly dressed are they look the fly to the englishmans trousers is wrongly buttoned and two jacket buttons are undone as well as the shirt he was able to see the american too the shirt buttons are unfastened here too theyd been stripped of all official id said novikov no dog tags no military identification at all charlie turned to the bloodclotted uniform immediately seeing that there was no regiment designation on the brass buttons but that the shoulder insignia was that of a lieutenant as casually as he was able charlie gently opened the jacket where the makers name and customer details should have been was an empty cottonframed rectangle where it had been torn out the cloth had actually been ripped more so at the top where the initial cut probably with a knife was clean charlie went immediately but still attempting casualness to the trousers briefly pausing to locate the mud marks on the knees where the man had been forced to kneel to be executed which charlie had known anyway from the downward trajectory of the wound that novikov had already spelled out the tailors duplicate label upon which the owners name and measurements would have been recorded had been yanked off even more roughly than from the jacket a scrap of the label still remaining there was sufficient to make out what looked like a half c which was all charlie thought he needed he became even more confident when he found in the record of novikovs earlier autopsy the precise list of the dead mans measurements charlie doublechecked his examination to fill in the time not wanting the others to guess what he considered quick and unexpected success he even ventured to the adjoining table where miriam was still frowning over the displayed contents she looked up at his approach and said you think were ever going to be able to make sense of this not from what ive seen so far lied charlie who was sure he could identify the dead englishman just as he knew that the murder had been committed certainly with the knowledge of some people within the nkvd the wartime forerunner of the kgb although he guessed for a reason far removed from yakutsk his more startling convictionone he knew was going to cause an upheaval of seismic proportionswas that another englishman had in some way been involved in the killing which totally justified his keeping to an absolute minimum what hed so far worked out until he discovered much more hed even have to keep the english involvement from natalia who queried irena cartright richard cartright im a friend of saul freemans just arrived in moscow and trying to make some friends here you at the american embassy no the british irena smiled to herself what have you got in mind a drink dinner maybe sounds fun the mortuary and the militia headquarters were part of the same gradually sinking administration complex some of the corridors along which they silently followed the heavyfooted military commissioner noticeably inclined and even more steeply declined like the decks of a wallowing ship the crepesoled grip of the hush puppies helped and briefly charlies hammertoed feet were at peace charlie was more than content with the day so far no one else seemed to be charlie was happy about that too the most dissatisfied was olga erzin and the russian forensic scientist the woman because shed been unable substantially to improve on the first autopsy findings lev denebin because in the womans determination to find something the postmortems had occupied the entire day now it was almost six in the evening too late to go out to the grave which denebin had pressed for since midday to the visible annoyance of yuri ryabov whod refused to alter his prearranged schedule there was no clue to its normal use in the sagwindowed roominto which ryabov led them it was starkly bare except for a communal table against which the precise number of chairs were already arranged with a separate table and chair for the solemnly waiting secretary charlie dismissed his predictable committee claustrophobia for once rarely benefiting by being part of a group during the protracted time it had taken olga erzin to complete her examinations charlie had openly studied the clothing and the pocket contents of both russian and american victims maneuvering the opportunity by inviting the others to do the same with the belongings of the englishman confident theyd miss a lot of what was significant to him it was important now to discover precisely what they had learned even more important was finding out if there was something hed missed so for the moment ryabovs tight orchestration was not to his disadvantage in fact it was even more to his advantage than anyone elses charlie hoped he didnt have the slightest doubt that he had enough but that wasnt sufficient it never was charlie wanted it all each and every time i hope weve learned from our first days workmade progress opened the police chief from the very positively chosen head of the table he looked challengingly at lev denebin who sat totally withdrawn doodling on a pad refusing to take any part in the meeting ryabov shifted his attention going encouragingly toward the russian pathologist and that work has been largely yours i think quickly charlie said i was very impressed by the detail of the original examinations by dr novikov id certainly like to hear what additionally dr erzin discovered the russian medical examiner fixed him with the castinstone look that charlie expected and didnt care about with what charlie judged to be attemptedand doomedtofailureavoidance the woman said i have to subject all the organs to appropriate scientific examination which hasnt yet been properly done charlie snatched an opportunity he hadnt anticipated which you will over the coming days imagining an escape the woman said it will be necessary to take everything back to moscow for total analysis she smiled triumphantly what about your preliminary findings pressed charlie smiling not at the woman but at the tightly attentive vitali novikov the womans triumph faltered comparatively straightforward she conceded i believe however that there were burn markings to the skull fragments i extracted that the gun was placed directly against the backs of their heads which i could have told you thought charlie he said the preservation of the bodies is remarkable though isnt it no one was opposing his taking over the meeting and charlie was glad needing to be the ringmaster they probably expected him to disclose something in his apparent eagerness hope in vain he thought yes agreed the woman although questioningly so you were able to secure fingerprints despite the fact that they died so long ago yes said the woman again the reluctance was obvious and you also took photographs of the faces not distorted by rigor charlie had much earlier realized that the fogging of some of novikovs earlier sceneofcrime pictures was caused by insects blocking the camera lens not bad development it was all going remarkably well he decided he could have written the script himself in fact he realized at that moment that was virtually what he was doing you saw me do it said the woman impatiently so we have made progress declared charlie using the police chiefs expression you will be able to let my american colleague and i have fingerprints and photographsas they were when they diedof people we have to identify thats wonderful olga erzin didnt immediately reply aware not just of what shed been trapped into conceding but that she now had no way to avoid surrendering both tightlipped she said yes charlie continued to smile apparently grateful in reality anticipating the coup de grace as notes are being taken of this meetingwhich i know are going to be made as available as the fingerprints and the photographsi think it should also be made clear that the previous examination by dr novikov was totally thorough and complete wouldnt you say that dr erzin that is so conceded the verbally straitjacketed doctor charlie said id like my appreciation to be recorded as being expressed on behalf of the british government novikov beamed and charlie relaxed satisfied as assholecrawling went this had gone on long enough he hoped hed encouraged the local doctor beyond what the man had so far been willing to talk about i think what primarily has to be established is whether in your opinion the male bodies are those of british and american nationals said kurshin im sure they are said charlie so am i agreed miriam is there sufficient to identify them demanded lestov at once its far too early to give any opinion on that refused charlie theres more personally identifying material on the englishman insisted miriam not bad acknowledged charlie not enough to put him under any pressure though he said weve certainly got the initials of a name from the inscription on the cigarette case but that just gives us one very small needle in a huge haystack there has been an obvious attempt to remove any identification ripping out names from the uniforms and taking all the dog tags he waited for the challenge although he hadnt seen anyone examine the english victims inside trousers band why i wonder were any belongings left at all asked ryabov if you genuinely do wonder you shouldnt be chief of police thought charlie instead of spelling out the significancethat their being left proved a motive other than personal robbery an element of premeditation and that the killings had nothing whatsoever to do with the yakatskaya gulags to whose prisoners the articles would have represented a fortunecharlie said panic perhaps they took the obvious identification snapped neckties and hurriedly redressed the bodies anxious to get away from the scene he was conscious of miriam bell looking curiously at him what do you think that could be the reason replied the american although without conviction whats the inscription mean in the cigarette case whats a first another good try conceded charlie a high college pass so youve a direction she persisted shit thought charlie it could be from a hundred schools more than a hundred he lied and have been gained anywhen over a period as long as twelve years if we accept the top age estimate of thirtyfive its a search well have to make of course but im not hopeful he wasnt volunteering but he wasnt learning either which was significant enough in itself proving how determined everyone was not to share the smallest scrap why would an american officer carry a magnifying glass and tweezers asked lestov it was a question that charlie couldnt yet answer although he had a vague halfformed thought prompted by the fact that none of the uniforms carried regiment or corps crests on their buttons once again it was the absence of an article rather than its presence that charlie considered important wearing a sam browne proved the man wasnt armed would the other officer whom charlie was sure had been at the scene have been wearing a more practical battle dress complete with sidearm there were no markings on the uniform to show the american might have carried a weapon either whoever theyd been and whatever theyd been doing neither had belonged to a fighting unit which narrowed the possibilities miriam bell lifted and then dropped her shoulders at the moscow detectives question my only thought is that it could have something to do with a hobby people didnt bring their hobbies to yakutskaya then or now thought charlie it was the first slip miriam had made hoping to generate somethinganythingcharlie said we need more than weve got to take this inquiry forward to take it anywhere if he suggested a comparable photographic check against graduation pictures from americas military academy at west point she might come back at him with the british counterpart at sandhurst so he decided to leave it in view of the media interest there might be a response if the photographs that dr erzin took today were issued suggested kurshin there could charlie conceded be satellite television somewhere in the town but the ontario didnt have cnn because hed already checked so how apart from monitoring charlies british embassycall during which cartright had talked of the publicity leak could kurshin have learned of the media awareness charlie was glad he hadnt booked a traceable call to natalia through the hotel switchboard he wouldnt attempt to reach her while he was here and needed to be more careful than he had been the previous night when he next spoke to the moscow embassy charlie looked between the two doctors and said the russian woman had childbirth marks is there any way to establish how recent to her death shed had the baby it should be possible for a gynecologist novikov said at once its a test i intend to make when i get the organs back to moscow said olga something else i look forward to receiving from you reminded charlie the pathologist nodded but didnt speak the child could still be alive charlie pointed out conceivably so could the womans partner there could be an identification if her photograph was published in moscow ill suggest it agreed lestov charlie doubted that either london or washington would issue pictures until a reason was found for the two men being where they had been despite media pressure but it didnt hurt to go along with the local homicide chiefs suggestion now that weve agreed on the nationality of the victims i assume therell be no difficulty repatriating the bodies said miriam thats more a political decision avoided the police commander but you wont object to the release of the bodies pressed charlie hoping to infer something from the reply before either local man could respond olga erzin said i really do need to get all the organs back to moscow theres absolutely no reason for anything to remain here any longer it has to be the decision of the executive council said ryabov awkwardness for awkwardnesss sake or something else he couldnt at that moment fully understand charlies first thought would have been perverseness but now he wasnt totally sure there would have to have been some local official awareness all that time ago of a tweezercarrying american and an unarmed english officer being where no other westerner had been before and increasinglyas he tried to fit the pieces together charlie was getting a nagging feeling that the reason for their presence might be buried locally far more successfully than the bodies had been maybe it made sense after all for him to play diplomat and meet some local leaders he said perhaps we need personally to make the request that would be best agreed kurshin the convoy arrangements definitely established charlie lingered for vitali novikov when the meeting broke the man said thank you for what you said putting it on the record like that nothing that wasnt the truth flattered charlie youll want some protection from insects out at the grave tomorrow offered novikov trying to reciprocate exactly the sort of local knowledge i do need prompted charlie have you any arrangements for tonight asked the pathologist none said charlie at once my wife would be very happy for you to join us for dinner so would i be to accept charlie had completely orientated himself and knew they were driving north from the town center very quickly the brick houses for crooked people gave way to wooden ones on stilts securely upright without any subsidence although the connected streets were haphazardly disjointed afterthoughts to link places originally erected where the whim took the builder before roads were considered novikov said certain trades professions could get people out of the gulags a lot of people lied of course when they were found out they were shot publicly in front of the original camp from which theyd tried to escape as a warning to others being shot was another way of escaping who was it who was exiled here asked charlie picking up the lead my father was he a builder a doctor that was even better and why you became one too yes confirmed novikov at once there arent many safe professionseven now everything is the mines which is slave labor as its always been how close are they to the town the pathologist shrugged beside him in the car the nearest is maybe five or six kilometers what about prison camps much farther away but prisoners still work the mines until they die which they still do very quickly novikovs house was immaculate the wooden lining clearly insulated against the outer wall novikovs family was waiting in the main room in which a fire flickered from habit rather than need marina was plump and rosycheeked charlie guessed she was about forty although her hair was completely white the boys were fair like their father they were dressed in what was clearly their best and newest clothes the woman in a thick blue wool dress the boys in matching gray trousers and sweaters novikov had been sure he would accept the invitation before it was offered charlie acknowledged everyone embarrassingly remained standing until charlie sat the boys waiting after that for their fathers permission charlie estimated georgi to be about fourteen arseni maybe two years younger novikov served vodka for himself and charlie a purplecolored juice for his family charlies interrogation training and techniques had been honed by his new diplomatic environment and he used it all and improvised on top of that he coaxed the boys into talking about their schooling and their intention to be doctors like their father and flattered that hed guessed before being told by marina that her father had been the qualified architect who built the house charlie described where he lived in moscow as an ordinary apartment and showed the woman the photographs of herself and sasha that natalia had smuggled into his suitcase during the mealreindeer steak againcharlie elaborated stories of police investigations hed read about or occasionally seen in movies and insisted against novikovs protest that he didnt mind arsenis question but that hed never shot anyone dead both boys appeared disappointed charliemade a point of repeating several times that it had not really been necessary for moscow to send a pathologist so complete had novikovs examination and conclusions been if we solve this case it will be largely due to your father on their way back to the ontario hotel charlie said youve got a fine family you were very gracious said the doctor and flattering isnt it going to be largely due to you if ive any chance of finding out what this is all about asked charlie heavily turning sideways in the car toward the man probably returned novikov enigmatically your father was sentenced to gulag wasnt he yes but being a doctor he was allowed to move into the town almost immediately he was still responsible for gulag though and two more on the other side of yakutsk was gulag a special prison pressed charlie discarding that mornings decision to let things come at novikovs pace it was for intellectuals were the people in the grave connected with someone who might have been in the camp its possible but there arent any records anymore officially the genocide of yakutskaya never occurred the twinge in charlies feet told him he was missing something maybe a key to unlock more doors would you take me to surviving camps it wouldnt help it would give us a chance to talk more at least i am staying with the woman tomorrow while she carries out her tests maybe after youve been to the grave everyoneeven the two local militia officerswas waiting for him in the bar when charlie entered the hotel no one accepted his offered drink miriam said we kept dinner waiting decided to eat out said charlie should have told you yes said ryabov you should fuck you thought charlie being an enforced member of a committee wasnt as much of a problem as hed feared it might be the ice grave was a crater in an earthly moonscape and the protective headgear and face masks that everyone wore in various designs made them look appropriately like astronauts the insects rose in a solidly attacking mass charlies beekeepers hat was perfect but he wished hed taken novikovs advice about gloves the annoyance at his disappearance the previous night remained so much so that charlie suspected they would have left without him if he hadnt made a point to be first downstairs waiting and bustled in to take olgas place the moment kurshin arrived on the way to the burial spot lestov and kurshin had talkedthe moscow detective hoping the crime scene produced more than the autopsies appeared to haveignoring charlie in the back he trailed behind the last in line as they straggled toward the actual spot and no one paid any attention to him when he edged away from the huddledtogether mosquitoswatting gathering that assembled to watch lev denebin carry out his forensic examination charlie positioned himself with the scientist in his immediate line of sight and the others beyond able to see everything and everyone denebin was better protected against the insects than any of them helmeted gauzed gloved and with his sceneofcrime overalls tightly held at wrists and ankles charlie who admired professionalism was at once impressed by the russian before getting into the grave denebin exposed an entire role of film in advance of pegging its immediate surround using the markers to secure his tape for detailed exterior measurements ahead of stretching between them a crisscross of tape to section the depression into six designated search areas from novikovs earlier photographs it was obvious the ongoing thaw had deepened the grave still further from the depth at which the bodies had lain although he trod minimally and carefully denebin very quickly created an anklesucking sludge in places at the bottom of the depression the forensic expert was painstakingly thoroughgently digging with a small trowel particular always to sieve the earth back on to the place from which hed collected it not allowing any encroachment onto an unsearched tapedoff section it was only after watching the russian probe and sift with total concentration for thirty minutes that charlie appreciated the complete extent of his dismissal denebin appeared unaware and certainly uncaring of charlie but stood always with his back to the others for his body to obscure anything he didnt want them properly to see denebin had his specimen bags in a satchel slung around his neck returning to a separate compartment whatever he felt it necessary to collect he retrieved a lot of what looked to charlie like metal shards and a few pieces of blackened wood on the third cordonedoff section charlie was immediately aware of the mans body tightening and of denebin more obviously putting his back to the watching group when he straightened with something small enough to hold between his thumb and forefinger until then hed used one bag for several pieces of metal but this new find got a specimen container of its own none of those at the grave edge appeared aware of denebins stiffening all too distracted by the constant armwaving effort to disperse the persistent mosquitoes and midges despite kurshin lighting a cordon of ineffective repellent candles charlies hands and arms were ablaze from bites but he rigidly held himself against warding them off not wanting to attract the scientists attention within minutes he was glad hed endured the torture at the craters edge of the fifth section denebin actually grunted as he stooped abruptly troweling debris into his agitated sieve from where charlie stood the shell casing was obvious and in the few seconds it took denebin to bag it charlie decided it had not been from a mm bullet but a much smaller caliber it was turning out to be another good day charlie thought although maybe not for the worried british military attache colonel gallaway in faraway moscow not his problem charlie decided his job was to determine the circumstances and he hoped establish the facts not pretty them up behind the forensic scientist the rest of the group waved and slapped and charlie wondered what apart from insect bites they were gaining from just standing there quietly slowly charlie eased himself away it was a moonscapeempty kilometer after empty kilometer of treeless stunted scrubland in a few placesother smaller cratersthe rare warmth was making mist that hung wraithlike a place of far too many ghosts thought charlie of three in particular but of hundreds more but where had gulag been in which they had been kept when they had been pitifully alive the killings he supposed would have been a day very similar to this not as warm but summer the ground softening vehicles although not many a truck perhaps a car two at the most as few witnesses as possible it would have been during the halflight of day the killers would have needed to see what they were doing choose their spot and the insects had been swarming in the daytime heat like now to clog the mouths and throats after the executions there would have been panic and fear a lot of fear dont do this this is madness lets talk about it for gods sake english voiceshysterical voicesin a land that had never heard english no time to dig get it over with as quickly as possible get away the explosionsthere would have been several from the amount of metal denebin had collectedwould have been deafening no turning back after that all argument all pleas ended by the explosions they would have been manacled immobilized frightened people killing frightened people but why what could this desolate pitiless land of ghosts have or possess to justify the ritual coldblooded execution of these three unknown apparently unmourned people not the landthe placeitself charlie decided it would have been someone who was here in gulag maybe more than one a group like he was a reluctant part of a group now menmaybe women toowith a secret he had to examine that speculation further justify the reasoning hed seen the bodies each of them naked hand and ankle cuff marks clearly visible shattering bullet wounds to the back of the head but that was all no sign whatsoeverno bruises or burns or cutsof torture and men prepared to kill would have been as prepared to torture if the victims had possessed a secret so why hadnt they because they didnt have to charlie answered himself the executioners knew the secret what there was to gain but didnt want to share what was big enough rewarding enough to kill for theyd known each other victims and killers would have used firstnames when they pleaded calling upon friendship acquaintanceship charlie was sure he had a picture but it was misted much more deeply obscured than the occasionally shrouded expanse across which he was looking seeking but still not finding what he had expected to see the foundation marks of buildings perhaps even those built on stilts certainly evidence of proper graveyards he turned surprised at how far hed wandered on feet that normally cautioned against such excess denebin was clambering from the grave tidily winding up his marking tapes and retrieving the securing pegs when charlie got back to them he was in time to hear the forensic scientist say theres very little too much time has elapsed from the bodies being discovered animals have been there disturbing it all but there are some things questioned charlie i saw you collecting samples things i need to look at more closely said the scientist vaguely do we have to talk about it here protested the armflailing miriam shed suffered more than anyone with just chiffon scarves to wrap around her head and face im being eaten alive i want to get back to the hotel clean up of course agreed the attentive lestov at once ill need until tomorrow to get any opinion of what ive got said denebin awkwardly were meeting valentin polyakov in the morning reminded miriam another busy day then said charlie brightly no one acknowledged him already hurrying back toward the waiting vehicles it had been novikovs idea that they meet at the towns museum but the man wasnt there when kurshin dismissively dropped him off so charlie went inside the museum was far more a monument to russian persecution of russian than charlie had expected whole rooms given over to photographs and paraphernalia recording the establishment of the vast penal colony the photographs were almost uniformly of lines of deadeyed despaircrushed barely human figures the bechained walking dead men women and even children it was from a variety of the pictures that charlie believed hed answered one question and gotten a pointer to another the gulags were regimented haphazardly wirefenced with cornerplaced watchtowers some tilted like the subsiding buildings of today there were lists of the minimally subsistence diets upon which the exiles and prisoners had been expected to survive and occasional names particularly of political figures purged during and even after the stalin era charlie was intrigued several times to see a photograph of a gauntfeatured man with the same name as the chief minister with whom he had an appointment the following day charlie was standing in front of an exhibition of prison camp equipmentchainlinked manacles hand and ankle cuffs actual posts against which prisoners were tied for execution punishment whips and guard batonswhen the tall thin doctor found him what you expected asked novikov far more still want to go for a drive as much as ever they were driving north again charlie recognized deciding after the family encounter it was safe to try to guide the conversation charlie said what was your fathers supposed crime just being a doctor said novikov simply doctors were regarded as dangerous intellectuals especially those who werent members of the communist party which my father refused to join he snorted a laugh being a doctor got him sent here and then saved him once he arrived he only had to live in gulag for a few months even when he was inside he didnt have to do any manual labor in the mines thats why he trained me made me study basic forensics later that again was for necessity to make myself as indispensable as possible i cant ever return permanently to moscow of course anywhere else in russia for that matter why not charlie frowned the system said novikov people sent here were automatically stripped of their citizenship lost their russian nationality so have their descendants you need established residency in a russian city to be allowed to leave here and you can only get that by getting away from here to establish residency which you cant do without an internal passport which none of us is allowed to hold were imprisoned here as effectively as anyone in stalins day so everyone who ever came here was known recorded somewherethe town was falling away in the semidarkness more moonscape stretching out in front of them novikov nodded recognizing the reason for the question in theory somewhere in moscow i suppose what about here were there registers again in theory aleksandr andreevich asked the chief minister after the bodies were found polyakov said there werent any archives not any longer that theyd been destroyed when we got our limited autonomy and dont forget millions were sent here died here it would have needed a warehouse as big as yakutsk itself after the previous day there was no love lost between this man and olga erzin no need then to circumvent anything from todays examination the pathologist shook his head she tried to get me to agree that some grazes on the womans hands and on the americans right forearm were defense injuries where they tried to fight off whoever killed them but i wouldnt it doesnt fit with the close range at which they were shot in the back not the front of the head i believe theyre scratches from pitching forward into the grave frozen as it was it would have been like hitting concrete charlie thought so too it led perfectly to one of the questions he believed hed virtually resolved the restraint bruising to the wrists and ankles its very even isnt it and totally encircling without any interruption normal handcuffs wouldnt leave a band like that would they thered have been gaps novikov regarded him curiously i suppose so he allowed doubtfully there could have been some sideways lividity joining up the gaps whats the significance in the museum photographs the wrists are completely enclosed by a ushaped band that goes under the wrists the encirclement is completed by the straight bar that slots in at the top to be ratcheted down tightly to grip every part of the wrist i still dont understand the importance it would be the sort of prison equipment available at gulag wouldnt it yes novikov agreed at once of course it would just as quickly he said i understand things were found at the grave what demanded charlie questioning instead of answering i dont know said the other man when he came to collect the woman on their way back lestov said lev fyodorovich wanted to use what laboratory facilities i have i had to warn them i didnt have much he hesitated i thought you might know what it is he wants to examine or test denebin wouldnt say said charlie moving easily on to his other query have you managed to establish the weight of the bullets novikov smiled theres a slight variation between them the one that killed the englishman was ten grams the one i recovered from the americanwhich was more damagewas just over nine does that tell you anything it might if there was the third bullet for comparison said charlie and he was sure there was the uncertainty was whether denebin would admit to finding it there said novikov abruptly pointing through the gloom the gulag emerged like a mirage at first a skeletal outline it seemed a long time before they were able to distinguish buildings on the left of the approach road from the mine on the right that was brightly lit with two descent shaft derricks gold identified novikov theres three quite close together we wont be able to stop as it is my registration will be logged there are diamond and gold mines about thirty kilometers farther on as they slowed a straggled line of men emerged from the camp of singlestory wooden shacks elevated from the ground some had their hands on the shoulders of the man in front all walked head down scuffling in jangling ankle manacles crossing to the mine they all wore uniforms padded against a cold that didnt exist all the guards were armed one began waving novikovs car on urgently convicts queried charlie novikov nodded it will be the afternoon shift the mines are worked twentyfour hours charlie was concentrating on the camp the huts were in regimented lines five to a line charlie counted thirty there were two control towers like those hed seen in the photographs in the museum charlie frowned knowing he should be aware of something but unable to decide what then he said wire theres no wire there rarely is look where we are what this place is where isthere to run people tried of course still do theyre never chased it isnt worth the effort the locals find them frozen to death when the snow melts thats why run aways are called snow drop the cemetery was on the far side of the camp what appeared to be hundreds of lines of uniformed crosses they were close enough for charlie to see there were no names just numbers so this is what it was like no said novikov this is civilizedhumaneby comparison charlie had just finishing spraying the room with insecticide after another meaningless conversation with the moscow embassy when miriams knock came at his door charlie thought he kept any reaction from showing when she entered the room but he wasnt sure his own hands and arms were swollen from bites but the womans face was ballooned hamstercheeked and bumped and very red despite whatever cream shed smeared upon it there were still isolated globules she hadnt properly rubbed in meet the bride of frankenstein her skin was so stretched it was difficult for her to speak you dont need me to tell you im not coming down for dinner tonight no accepted charlie youve been playing quite a game she accused the consensus is youre a nohoper everyones entitled to an opinion its not mine she said saul filled me in before i left moscow its been fascinating watching you thats why i havent interfered as fascinating as its been watching you reflected charlie dont read too much into it ive come to warn you for a reason guessed charlie what our calls to moscow are being monitored theres a clever girl thought charlie who told you ryabov trying to get into my pants they know youre not getting anywhere it had to be getting pretty crowded inside miriams pants thought charlie there wouldnt have been room for him even if hed beeninterested how about you you got anything that gives any sort of lead miriam started to shake her head but abruptly stopped wincing at the discomfort lestov says there was something in the grave that hell tell me when he finds out and ill tell you obviously the locals havent got a clue they just want to get rid of us according to ryabov the russians arent going to be included in tomorrows meeting and he thinks polyakov is planning what he regards as a coup but ryabov doesnt know what it is she was wrapping up her eagerness very well charlie decided for his own amusement he said not sure i like being used you havent said what youve picked up prompted the woman a lot of isolated bits nothing making any sort of sense any picture avoided charlie i need to get back start putting the picture of the man to work there are a lot of checks that have got to be made with that and i dont just want to get the body and its organs back to london for our own pathologist theres the uniform too for forensic tests i thought you had more said the woman disbelievingly nothing crystallized yet we are working together on this arent we charlie pressed miriam i mean washington and london have agreed what i get youll get trust me thats what ive got to do agreed the girl learn to trust you perhaps things will pick up tomorrow miriam said id like to think so when it did neither of them was happy charlie was totally trapped miriam too he experienced every feeling beginning and ending with the same numbed disbelieving fury there was a lot of that in between too he was furious at being trickedand at not anticipating itand at not being sure what ifanything was salvageableand perhaps most of all at his helplessness because charlie muffin hated most of all being in a situation over which he had absolutely no control so a lot of the anger was directed at himself thered been no warning although maybe he should have suspected more from commissioner ryabovs hotel foyer announcement that the russians were excluded from the meeting with the yakutsk chief minister wrongly assuming that to be the something funny the militia commander had warned miriam about charlie had withdrawn to the sidelines of the inevitable argument from the moscow homicide detective uncertain whether to try to force novikovs hand by announcing his return to moscow after the formal release of the body which was the purpose of the meeting to which he and miriam were going hed actually checked the availability of late afternoon and evening flights there had been no indication either from their initial reception by valentin ivanovich polyakov the fullbearded towering chief minister had greeted them with handshakes samovar tea and cakes in what had to be the only room in the government complex not in imminent danger of collapse hed said he appreciated the cooperation there appeared to have been with the yakutsk force and in return charlie and miriam had promised its continuation after their return to moscow from where a lot more inquiries needed to be made and polyakov had agreed at once to the bodies and the possessions being returned to britain and america he had declared the yakutsk leader already officially informed london and washington and had the necessary papers prepared and ready even more preparedan indication charlie missedhe summoned a photographer to record the documentation formally being handed over charlie was speculating again about the last evening flight when polyakov rose unexpectedly from behind his ornately carved desk in what charlie first thought to be in dismissal but instead said now perhaps youd be good enough to come with me charlie followed imagining a courtesy meeting with the rest of the local ruling assembly smiling in expectation at the murmur of people when polyakov thrust open linking doors to a larger room charlie later decided when he saw the video that the fatuous grinfroze on his face as rigidlyand almost as terrorizedas those of the murder victims the lights from the television cameras that recorded his expression made it difficult for charlie to see the extent of the press conference from the immediate north americanaccented questions against which polyakov held up his hands charlie finally realized the surprise that ryabov had told miriam about was a press contingent flown in certainly from canada and probably from the united states as well and knew how the media leaks that cartright had warned of had come about charlie had spent his entire operational life trying always to be as amorphous as the graveside mist and until this appalling stomachdropping moment had succeeded so shockedbewilderedwas he by the abrupt exposure that for perhaps the first time in that operational life charlies mind went completely blank momentarily refusing to function he was conscious of polyakov the conniving manipulative bastard thanking the canadian and american media for flying in at such short notice and the inconvenience and of being introduced with miriam by name holy shit no as he was herded toward a table to sit upon a raised dais behind a hedge of microphones yuri vyacheslav ryabov and aleksandr andreevich kurshin were already seated waiting able at last to focus charlie saw translation booths along the left side of the room and that a lot of the waiting journalistsclose to thirty he guessed as well as two television teamswore earphones it was at that moment in reality only a hiatus of seconds that charlie began to function to try to assess and calculate and from whichever and whatever way he considered it he reached the same conclusion it was an absolute fuckup and worsening by the second steered inexorably toward further and greater disaster by valentin polyakov the yakustkaya chief minister had achieved his lifetimes ambition gaining an international audience to denounce successive russian leaders who perpetuated what stalin had begun by turning an entire country into a penal colony at last declared polyakov there was going to be the opportunity for the world to be made aware after half a century of the crimes against humanity exceeding those of the holocaust six million jews had perished in that attemptedgenocide double that number had been worked to death and put to death in the siberian gulags to charlies fidgeted discomfort polyakov inferred the two lieutenants brave fearless agents had been murdered because they had discovered the secrets of yakutskaya a secret terrible enough to have destroyed war time alliances at this point polyakov gestured to either side of him to include miriam and charlie now after so longtoo longtwo more brave fearless agents have come to this godforsaken country to rediscover and expose secrets russia even now would prefer kept hidden now at last the world will eventually be told the truth it was a disaster charlie recognized an utterly unparalleled irrevocable disaster his cover always the paramount consideration was blown which did not create the physical lifethreatening danger it once would have but as bad on every other level none of which was the most important consideration his new creed the doctrine constantly preached was never under any circumstances to become involved in a diplomatic incident and here he wasthey wereby association by sitting beside a ranting xenophobe denouncing russia and by so doing causing not a diplomatic incident but an inevitable devastating diplomatic sensation beyond thatworse than thateven it was potentially personally devastating this was of recall and dismissal magnitude the collapse of the house of cards as things were between them at the moment he didnt think natalia would bring sasha to london shed virtually said so and it was immaterial whether he was dismissed or resigned from the department hed be refused residency permission to remain in russia the immediate barrage of questions in english were all directed at charlie and miriam too many and too quick at first to isolate one from the other charlie didnt wait properly to hear desperate to limit the damage it was he insisted important to stress that it was neither an american nor english investigation he and his fbi colleague were observers on a joint inquiry being conducted by a moscow murder squad working with the local militia to the visible facehardening from polyakov earphoned for the translation from english charlie said the moscow teamto which polyakov had studiously not referredwas kept from the conference by continuing inquiries charlie spoke accepting that his qualifications would be overwhelmed by the carefully prepared drama of the chief ministersclaims but was not at that moment addressing the media he was talking to whoever later examined the transcript at whatever inquiry there would unquestionably be to decide his future there was an audibly shouted questionjust what were these guys doing all that time agodirected to miriam by name and charlie looked along the table unaware if she had already fully accepted their entrapment but conscious of her additional discomfort a lot of the previous nights swelling had gone and her face wasnt as purplered as it had been but it was still lumped in placesone eye was half closedand greasy from that mornings antiseptic balm she wore absolutely no makeup she sat apparently trying to shield her eyes from the camera lights in reality hoping to conceal as much of her face as possible and two still photographers crouched at the lip of the dais were repeatedly gesturing for her to lower her hands she still had difficulty in talking too as soon as she began to speak charlie recognized that in her anxiety to escape miriam bell was panicking offering far more than was necessary she repeated charlies insistence upon jurisdiction and cooperation and babbled on that they hadnt established a reason for the killings nor any victim identities although they had no doubt of nationality her disclosure of the method of execution at once prompted a shouted interjection wasnt a bullet in the back of the head the favorite killing method of russian intelligence in lubyanka yes agreed miriam so they were killed by russian intelligence we dont know who they were killed by intruded charlie still working damage limitation thats what the russian team is trying to establish why there is such excellent international cooperation he held back at a demand to know what specific leads they had curious for his own part how miriam would reply but she said there werent any whats your next move shouted a woman from the rear of the room analyzing the autopsy and forensic evidence charlie came in quickly anxious to be as vague as possible but polyakov added and the items found upon the bodies which at this moment we dont intend to make public persistedcharlie thank christ he hadnt discussed what he considered significant an enterprising journalist could still get a lot from the cigarette case inscription the thought lodged in his mind there hadnt so far been the concentrated questioning hed fearedno one for instance had asked about photographs of bodies perfectly preservedand he abruptly wondered how of and how far he could manipulate the situation into which hed been thrust he would be taking a hell of a risk by trying and if he got caught out it could go catastrophically wrong but they already had a catastrophe so there was very little more to lose we have he began probably one of the greatest unsolved mysteries of the second world war two allied officers a russian woman and a secret that has lain buried for fifty years he had them charlie decided there was scarcely a sound in the room the coughs muted charlie thought faster than he could remember in any previous backtothewall situation sifting the innocuous from anything that could give the slenderest clue to his real thinking determined to outexaggerate polyakov and spread as many false leads as he could make up on the spot he acknowledged that it had obviously been a covert mission what other reason for it remaining secret when it went wrong and invented the possibility of special german prisoners being incarcerated in special gulags in the remotest most unreachable part of the world hitler had mussolini snatched from captivity after the italian dictators overthrow what if held somewhere in yakutskaya there had been a german possibly several with the knowledge of a weapon or a developmentjet propulsion of which the peenemunde rockets had been the forerunner nuclear fission ahead of the americans los alamos developmentthat would have shortened the war enough charlie decided stop before he became a contender for the nobel prize for fantasy time to let his stillenraptured audience work up their own embellishments there was a fresh cacophony of demands from which he picked those most likely to mislead ignoring those that could have been pertinent after seeming to prevaricate he allowed himself to concede his belief that the three victims could have been an advance reconnaissance group and that there could be other victims in undiscovered graves he intentionally shifted questions about surviving registers of possible german prisoners to valentinpolyakov enjoying the mans difficulty admitting they had either been lost or intentionally destroyed quickly charlie picked up that there should be some files in british and american intelligence archives although finding them would undoubtedly be hard and conceivably impossible if the operation was covered by a special timerestricted security release polyakov made a determined effort to stop charlies takeover and to bring it back to the intended antirussian platform by switching the questioning to the local militia which was a mistake yuri ryabov was too excited by an international spotlight never managing to complete replies too convoluted for kurshin to finish for him and in his desperation the homicide chief seemed to agree that the investigation was concentrated as charlie had suggested and polyakov hurriedly tried to conclude the conference by repeating an apparent earlier undertaking to escort everyone to the grave site there was an immediate demand from both television teams for individual interviews with charlie and miriam miriam followed charlies lead by refusing and did so again when he insisted he would not be photographed near the grave either as they hurried back into polyakovs office miriam whispered in english we got well and truly suckered we got well and truly fucked corrected charlie charlie guessed polyakovs anger matched his but hoped his was better controlled hed had time now to rationalize his mistakes acknowledging that hed underestimated everything and everybody which had been foolishly arrogant he wasnt sure how much of a recovery hed managed but he had to go on working at it and at the same time not lose sight of the fact that devious conniving bastard though hed been valentin ivanovich polyakov was a diplomatically recognized head of a semiautonomous republic who had to be accorded the respect due to his title it didnt necessarily extend to the man himself of course only the three of them had returned to polyakovs suite leaving ryabov and kurshin to organize the transportation to the grave possibly his first advantage recognized charlie hed have to make sure he isolated all the others for that reason charlie waited for polyakov to speak but unexpectedly it was miriam who broke the angry silence that was monstrousi am going to make a full report to my embassy in moscow ask that protests are made from my state department in washington wrong thought charlie there was no threat in that polyakov whod caused the offense was the same man whod sit in judgment upon any diplomatic complaint about it dont get sore get even remembered charlie calling upon another dictum what other advantages were there the eavesdropping was a definite advantage there a signpost to follow in fact hed told mcdowell and gallaway he was getting nowhereprobably never wouldand the listening polyakov had believed him the bastard would never have chanced a trick like the one hed just pulled if hed known charlies bullshit was going to be spread thicker than his the benefits were stacking up what else he had the official release of the body and possessions snug in his inside pocket important to ensure those possessions including the uniform werent picked over by anyone else there were the lists of course carefully prepared by vitali novikov but the local medical examiner had not been able to read the english lettering of the cigarette case inscription so the danger was minimized there insufficient for a total recovery assessed charlie objectively publiclyin moscow and london and washingtonit would still probably be regarded as an unmitigated debacle requiring his head on a pole if he stood any chance at all of keeping it instead on his shoulders he had to solve all the mysteries not make up any more but not here at this precise moment at this precise moment he had verbally to manacle valentin bloody polyakov as effectively as the victims they were trying to identify and charlie thought he could do it calmly conversationallyno longer in fact furioushe said you should have told us prepared us for what you were going to do back there i achieved all i wanted charlie discerned the faint doubt shaking his head he said maybe if youd been more forthcoming we could have helped you make it better he refused to answer miriams abrupt look willing her not to say anything make any interruption until she understood what he was doing what do you mean demanded polyakov i mean that both of us have been aware from the beginning that all our contacts with moscow have been monitored said charlie easily which is why weve said nothing to indicate our thinking or what weve already been able to decide but most importantly theres been no discussion either of what was discovered in london or washington before we came here or whats been shared by moscow the other mans uncertainty was obvious now i want to know everything about this nazi business after what happened this morning i dont feel at liberty to tell you said charlie as far as im concerned thats something youll have officially to approach london about and washington as far as i am concerned came in miriam once more following in charlies footsteps your being allowed here was on the understanding of complete cooperation threatened polyakov inadequately that was our understanding too charlie nodded in the direction of the justleft room there wasnt much evidence of complete cooperation in there and i expect london to be outraged that what were official discussions between myself and my embassy were monitored washington too endorsed miriam again i think the whole episode was extremely unfortunate you would probably have been able to avoid a great deal of embarrassment by first discussing the claims and accusations you made today careful thought charlie worriedly polyakov said i demand to know everything thats been discovered elsewhere i have to refer you to london said charlie or my embassy in moscow you are both here with my permission under my sufferance further threatened the bearded chief minister its i who have to authorize the release of the bodies and their effects charlie thought polyakov and stalin would have gotten on well together he said you told us earlier youd already been in contact with london and washington agreeing that we were photographed being given the official release papers polyakovs face began to burn sure of herselfof charlies scriptmiriam said this really could get most unpleasant my embassy has an aircraft on standby to recover our national i think everything is out of our hands now any decision to hold the bodies will be taken on a diplomatic level the man was close to being out of his depth charlie guessed his mind still on limitation charlie said i agree i regretand i feel sure my government will very much regretwhat occurred today at my levelthe level of the investigationi think it would be most unwise if the media for whose invitation you are responsible were allowed any more information or facilities than they already have been given thats as far as i feel able to go guiding you about whats known elsewhere about this case i cant add to that said the woman the television teams had of course brought satellite communication equipment and the conference was instantly syndicated by their respective stations to be seen worldwide during the course of the day in london sir rupert dean turned to his assembled committee and said charlie muffin will need a damned good explanation for this for gerald williams it was a superhuman effort not to speak or keep the satisfaction from his face in moscow mcdowell gallaway and cartright looked between each other in matching incredulity gallaway said oh my god mcdowell said ive got to speak to the bloody man but at once corrected himself no i need to speak to london and in the lesnaya apartment sasha said thats daddy whats he talking about i dont know said natalia their situation had never stood a chance of succeeding not from the very beginning inconceivable protested james boyce definitely a need for some close control find out what the dangers are said kenton peters sounded awfully like your man knew something he shouldnt and your woman too said boyce yakutsk itself was always our greatest weakness a problem if the bodies were discovered not knowing ourselves precisely where the grave was never in a million years expected it would melt like that do you think muffin is getting too close ive absolutely no way of knowing not until he gets back to moscow ill get a full account then said boyce i think i should go personally said peters best you stay clear more to lose in some ways with your man still living and ive got a presidential problem because the damned idiot acted without consulting me which is unforgivable you stopping by on your way asked boyce think its best if i go to moscow first assess the degree of danger on the ground probably the better idea agreed boyce heavily he said you going alone muffin has to be identified reminded peters itll be the ideal opportunity try to make it on your way back urged boyce putting the boat in the water at the weekend that sounds nice it was miriam who suggested what was on the bodies and the clothes and charlie said yes and they went directly from the encounter with valentin polyakov to the mortuary it was several minutes before either realized that with the local militia officers acting as tour guides to the visiting media they were alone and unchaperoned i am going to look like frankensteins bride on film complained the woman id probably pass as frankensteins creation as well two dummies together im sure ryabov would have warned me if hed known too late now miriam said how much of what you told the media was kosher how much bullshit bullshit that fit said charlie you think polyakov bought the line afterwards most of it it helped you picking up as you did she shrugged were in a hell of a mess arent we you see a way out solving everything with no embarrassments to anyone would be a start so would a cure for cancer she said you really got a plane on standby small cargo freighter chartered from aeroflot this things getting a lot of play back home secret grave of the unknown soldier that sort of thing good bandwagon for a president with falling poll ratings to get on board any chance of sharing charlie was panting climbing up and down tilting corridors he wished she wouldnt walk so fast thats what i keep asking you remember avoided miriam making a point what did you get out of ryabov and lestov charlie countered nothing out of ryabov apart from the eavesdropping which id guessed anyway all he wanted was to get into my pants that was lestovs main aim too but he was prepared to trade to get there olga didnt get anything extra from the autopsies and is pissed about it denebin got a lot of metal out of the grave apparently grenades identified charlie simply miriam stopped turning to look at him grenades thats how the grave was made the quickest way throwing two or three grenades one after the other at the same place said charlie grateful for the chance to rest his feet and they were either german or russian the grenades both used during the war had wooden handles they could be thrown farther than the british and american pineapple type i saw denebin pick up quite a lot of burned wood fragments you sure about grenades youre not still bullshitting charlie began walking again no bullshit anything else you think there was fenced miriam denebin picked up a shell casing and i think the bullet that killed the woman you expect them to tell us that no were you going to tell me depends what you had to trade replied charlie honestly and she did have a convenient plane that magnifying glass and the tweezers are specialized not the sort stocked by a eleven or whatever convenience stores were called that long ago woolworths i guess our laboratories in washington might be able to narrow down the sort of thing they were used for give us a specialization he was very definitely a specialist agreed charlie it would be picked up by american forensic examination anyway and there wasnt anything to be gained holding it back from her the one unbroken lens in his spectacles was particularly thick your labs will be able to establish the degree of impairment but hed never have passed an army medical with eyesight as bad as his he was in uniform because there was a special need for whatever he did i missed that admitted miriam unoffended what about the uniform it didnt tell me anything again your forensic people might get something it wasnt tailored to fit not like your guys said the american i checked the measurements i guess our officers didnt go in for that sort of stuff charlie hadnt seen her do that it helped having a sounding board to bounce off and the echoes were coming back loud and clear i dont suppose they did would there have been a name on the label ripped out from your guys jacket yes said charlie waiting for the challenge nothing came instead miriam said shit think how easy it would have made things i already have assured charlie if my guy had special talents it follows that yours would have had too doesnt it i guess so agreed charlie cautiously so they were killed because of their expertise what they were here to use it for qualified charlie glad theywere approaching the mortuary you didnt say whether there was room on your plane i wouldnt leave my worst enemy in a place like this longer than i had to they were as surprised at all three russians being in the cramped and inadequate mortuary laboratory with novikov closely attentive as the russians appeared to be at their arrival charlie at once remembered denebins requested use of the facility and just as quickly accepted that the forensic examination such as was possible of the grave contents was the obvious place for all three to be he and miriam too the shockhaired scientist appeared to be clearing up when they walked in a second specimen satchel in addition to the one hed used at the scene already securely buckled all over then greeted charlie anything interesting denebin didnt respond instead lestov said what happened the attitude was hostile we were totally conned admitted miriam succinctly missing nothing but not elaborating either she recounted valentin polyakovs stagemanaged performance frequently quoting the chief minister verbatim which charlie noted he listened and watched with one hip lodged on a laboratory bench to ease his feet intent upon the russians olgas face was the most readable instant anger washed away just as quickly by dismayed awareness that the television coverage guaranteed moscow seeing it even the normally enigmatic forensic scientist shifted beside his samples his irritation needing movement although his features remained unmoving only lestov showed any objectivity he didnt mention us give a reason for our not being there charlie did said miriam just as succinctly she paraphrased charlies responses before she finished charlie was the sole object of attention wheres your evidence for all this special wartime prisoner conjecture denebin demanded doesnt what you recovered from the grave support that supposition charlie came back never the poker player to miss the chance to bluff no denied the man miriam was determinedly silent recognizing the game vitali novikovs eyes were everywhere seeking guidance and not getting it lestov and the other pathologist were equally lost but concealed it better what contradicts it demanded charlie the other man was playing well what supports it matched denebin it was a ninemillimeter bullet wasnt it tempted charlie no it blurted denebin too intent before realizing the admission that certainly knocks my theory said charlie in apparent defeat what was the caliber the bullet was too badly distorted for me to be certain said the scientist a lot of it had splintered against a rock showyourhand time decided charlie but the casing you recoveredwhat was it from that fourth section of the grave you taped off that wasnt damaged at all as far as i could see denebin stared directly at charlie for several moments redfaced throat moving there was no sound or movement from anyone else even the insect buzz seemed subdued finally the forensic scientist said it was now that really means ive misled everyone doesnt it but gives us a lot more to think about what conclusion have you reached about that i havent said the russian tightly seemingly aware for the first time of their audience it should all be downhill from now on charlie thought what about the shrapnel you must have a theory about that so much of it a bomb of some sort several small bombs grenades for instance possibly thats what i thought said charlie it was always essential to get a positive confirmation it wouldnt have taken them long to realize that neither german nor russian handguns of the second world war fired bullets but without the significance of the tornout trouser band label it would just be an additional mystery mostprobably dismissed as having come from a captured western weapon and still would be because he didnt intend telling them he turned to novikov offering the release papers could we call the american embassy from here get the aircraft on its way youve finished the pathologist frowned no said charlie weve scarcely started miriam emerged from novikovs office and said saul is already on his way here with the plane all hells broken loose the transportation coffins were remarkably well made but novikov embarrassed couldnt find anything better than newspaper to wrap the uniform to keep the recovered contents safe charlie put them back into tightly buttoned pockets and folded the clothing in upon itself miriam did the same it was all completed quickly enough for the russians to wait and accept novikovs offer to drive them all back to the ontario the ambushparticularly the alreadysetup television cameraswas visible some way from the hotel olga at once said no lestov turned to charlie ignoring her it happened just as you told us exactly how miriam said assured charlie then yes insisted the homicide detective they were briefly engulfed as they got out of the car and charlie swallowed against laughing there clearly hadnt been sufficient graveside protection and everyone was gargoylefaced from bites and stings some more bubbled and bumped than miriam had been at her worst one very badly swollen tv reporter was making a point of his appearance in a live introduction charlie heard hell on earth and decided the countryproud valentin ivanovich polyakov was going to be a very pissed off chief minister and that the bastard deserved it it got worse the moment lestov began talking but the melee helped cover lestovs initial stammering which quickly went he was glad said the militia colonel that the russian participation had been made clear at the earlier meeting he could not understand why they had been excluded from that meeting he could only assume a misunderstanding which was unfortunate or intentional obstructionwhich would be curious and which he understood even less he expected moscow to ask the yakutsk authorities for an explanation russian help having been very specifically asked for because of local investigative limitations it was fortunate the working relationship with the two western investigators had by comparison been so good it was only when lestov suggested that the yakutsk militia commissioner might be able to explain the problem that charlie became aware of ryabov and kurshin at the edge of the press pack the attention and the cameras immediately switched to the wordblocked local police chief vitali novikov hadnt moved from beside his car neither had charlie the pathologist said youre going back immediately charlie said yes i wanted more time there isnt any the pathologist swallowed not immediately finding the words then in a rush he said get us out me and marina and the boys please what have you got get us out first do you know the whole story most of it you dont do you challenged charlie more than anyone else i told you about the camp quickly charlie passed the man his official card with his direct embassy number i will do everything i can it would surely be easy natalia worked in the very ministry necessary to grant permission get us out and ill give you everything youd have to there were two waiting demands from raymond mcdowell for his calls to be immediately returned when charlie finally entered the hotel warding off as he walked repeated demands for individual interviews and photo opportunities his telephone was ringing as he entered his room mcdowell said this is terrible no its not contradicted charlie polyakov wouldnt have canceled the monitor london wants a full explanation at once for the benefit of the listening public charlie said im sure they do i think there should be an official note to the government here asking for one there was momentary silence what are you talking about our calls are tapped the silence this time was longer whats happening asked mcdowell less stridently im coming back tonight on an american charter with the body and what was found on it what shall i tell london that ill speak to them tomorrow and to go on watching television it took another note to persuade the hotel receptionist to summon a taxi which seemed to be collapsing as dramatically as most of the buildings they passed on their way to the airport the two coffins were already there the aeroflot charter wasnt its arrival was promised within thirty minutes both charlie and miriam chose to remain in the luggage shed with the bodies rather than go into the hardchaired tobaccofugged departure lounge they didnt find a lot to say they were both alert to the entry into the shed of any vehicle or uniformed official other than those handling the luggage of schedule flight passengers charlie thought his newspaperwrapped uniform was betterpackaged and tied than a lot of the items that went by on the arthritic conveyor belt miriam hadnt surrendered hers since bundling it up in the mortuary either the charter was an hour late saul freeman flurried officiously into the shed immediately set off balance by charlies presence beside a second coffin at once the fbi chief said theres no agreement about this weve got enough saul stopped the woman shut the fuck up were getting out together no discussion okay freeman looked hesitantly between miriam and charlie youvegot to understand he tried but again she cut him off saul youre not listening lets get the coffins on the plane and the plane off the ground while were still able im sure youve got a great speech prepared and i cant wait to hear it later but later there were some luggage handlers none asianfeatured superstitious yakuts hovering and charlie waved more notes like flags at a parade at once the coffins were loaded onto trolleys automatically miriam and charlie walked beside that for which they were responsible each with a protective hand resting on the lid there was only a very small passenger area beyond the hold but neither charlie nor miriam looked for it until after the coffins were not just roped securely into their carrying space but the loading bay ramp was raised both finally sagged with the click of its lock i want to know what went onis going on demanded freeman when they finally pushed aside the curtain separating the cargo bay and slumped into canvas bucket seats its a very long story that can wait said miriam charlie and i have a lot to talk about ourselves first before we can make any sense of anything so please lets wait until we can get our heads straight weve got people flying in from washington for christs sake said freeman awed good said miriam you brought anything to drink a little jack daniels admitted the bureau chief blinking miriam held out her hand unspeaking from the briefcase beside his seat freeman produced a bottle threequarters full and when she remained with her hand outstretched followed with polystyrene cups miriam drank deeply and looking out of the window at the moment of takeoff said its like being in one of those great escape movies she lifted her cup in a toast we made it i wasnt sure we would admitted charlie for gods sake will someone tell me whats going on implored freeman we got set up conceded miriam simply but out of ten id score our recovery at six thats about right agreed charlie and we got our unknown soldier back both of them miriamstretched out pushing herself as far back in the stiff canvas as she could now im pretty exhausted youre happy for this to be your thing is that right demanded freeman hopefully i guess thats it sighed miriam your choice said the man its your ass i just made it said miriam and the ass is intact they all settled as best they could trying to sleep but charlie was always subconsciously aware of being aboard a droning aircraft and gave up after about an hour as he thrust himself up in his seat he became aware of miriam sitting up too freeman snored on they didnt speak for a long time their refilled cups in their laps finally miriam said you know what i think what i think if some gal had something you needed badly enough to know and if to screw her was the way to get it youd screw her charlie said there a point to this conversation dont want you sitting in judgment on me like youve got the moral high ground okay okay said charlie there was a lot he liked about miriam bell i thought he did something dull something to do with trade said irena now i learn hes she waved her hands across the dinner table seeking a metaphor remembering a russiandubbed english series that had just ended on moscow television she finished a sherlock holmes probably not for much longer thought cartright glad he was on the absolute edge of the hurricane that was sweeping through the embassy he was still recovering from the revelation that charlie was living with irenas sister its kind of an unusual job howd he get an apartment like they have its in what used to be a palace incredible so i understand does everyone at the embassy live like that hes not properly attached to the embassy said cartright knowing from the military attache that deniability was already being considered i guess youd say he was freelance obviously a very successful one cartright was much better looking than the american and she hoped he would be better in bed too he obviously wasnt so mean the restaurant was just off the arbat called the here and now and was the social spot of the moment at which to be seen which she considered promising so was the imported champagne hed automatically ordered she was glad shed worn the donna karan shed bought in new york he couldnt keep his eyes off her cleavage hasnt natalia told you all about him questioned cartright trying to get the conversation on track were not particularly close dismissed irena she was sure the fiveman group at the bar were mafia one smiled at her she smiled back see a friend i thought i had it wasnt natalia probably considers herself very lucky able to live in an apartment like that accommodation isnt easy in moscow is it she had a pretty impressive place before irena didnt return the mafia mans smile this time if its as grand as you say they probably do a lot of entertaining i wouldnt know like i said were not close the quail was wonderful and from the attention she was attracting irena was sure the darkhaired girl whod just come in was the star of the gangster series getting the top tv ratings irena was enjoying herself the tuxedoed band began playing glen millers in the mood a girl could get jealous at someone being more interested in her sister than in her irena protested pushing her plate and her chair away at the same time come on lets dance and stop talking about natalia and charlie enough decided cartright there was absolutely no hurry she had the most spectacular tits and there was saul freemans recommendation during the evening the man she was sure was mafia intercepted irena on her way to the washroom and asked her if she needed rescuing she said no but added that she appreciated the gallantry and when he said anytime she gave him her telephone number cartright started to get out of his car when they got to her apartment in the moscow suburbs on the way conveniently to sheremetyevo airport but she stopped him lying that she had to be up very early the following morning for a flight perhaps next time she said maybe shed found herself someone with money like natalia discovering what he was like in bed could wait they had remained in conference practically the entire day broken only by sir rupert deans summons to downing street patrick pacey the departments political officer went with him the directorgeneral had also several times spoken to the moscow embassy by telephoneto the ambassador as well as to the head of chancelleryand when hed finally managed a connection to the ontario hotel in yakutsk it had been eight pm local time there and hed been told that charlie had checked out throughout the day the attitudes toward charlie muffin ebbed and flowed initially after his nazisecret declaration the criticism and accusations had been virtually unanimous determinedly led by an inwardly very satisfied gerald williams totally supported by the deputy directorgeneral a lot of the condemnation became mutedor stopped altogetherafter the second tv transmission of the hotel parking lot interview with colonel vadim lestov dean said we dont know enough to reach any conclusion or judgment and whose fault is that demanded the finance director muffin was repeatedly toldorderedto maintain the closest contact and report back everything we needed to know and at all costs avoid any reference to possible intelligence and difficult diplomatic situations hes done the total and complete opposite as he always does and as i have consistently warned that he would to relay a message telling us to watch television was arrogant impertinence made sense though to see and hear what the moscow detective said didnt it sighed jeremy simpson the legal adviser muffinalso told the moscow embassy his phone was tapped seems a good enough reason for saying nothing he said a lot on television pointed out jocelyn hamilton which remains the problem agreed patrick pacey knowing the political thinking from having attended the cabinet intelligence and security committee meeting at downing street with the directorgeneral the last thing the government wants is reminders of germanys wartime past now that were european partners or having one of our people sitting beside the yakutsk leader like that publicly associated with an antirussian attack made worse by drawing attention to the sort of place yakutskaya was persisted gerald williams i cant imagine russia wants that raked over from whichever way we look at it muffin has put usthis departmentin an appalling situation one in fact that weve already agreed we had to do everything to avoid with our whole future so uncertain endorsed hamilton there might be an explanation of sorts but ill need a lot to convince me it was justified thats a gross exaggeration argued the bald mustached lawyer quite obviously there were a lot of local problems we dont yet know anything about the moscow detective went out of his way to say how good the relationship was which was exactly what muffin was told to establish i think the enormous publicity is unfortunate said pacey echoing another concern from the earlier downing street crisis meeting thered been no public announcement of our being officially allowed to have a man in moscow the inference that russia needs western help to fight its crime isnt something we wanted to become too obvious which it didnt and hasnt insisted dean forcefully its entirely acceptable that someone from the ukwhose department was never identifiedshould have been in yakutsk looking into the murder of a british officer whenever the killing occurred it was never stated that charlie was based in moscow or that he had any intelligence agency background you inferred it was said because you know pacey flushed caught out no he remembered it wasnt was it williams felt a further fray in what hed been so sure was the noose from which charlie was at last going to dangle he said with anyone else it would not be necessary for us to be having this discussion having to defend ourselves cap in hand in downing street if this department becomes subsidiary to all those willing and eager to take over our traditional role it will be dated back to this episode the finance director looked to the required records taker none of us will be here in a years time for us to be reminded of the warning ive just given if on the other hand we were all hereand i called for a transcript of what youve said all dayyoud be shown to be an absolute fool wouldnt you gerald said simpson he stroked the drooping mustache and i will there youve got a whole year to work out an explanation for being so wrong i dont want this to become personal warned sir rupert dean unfortunatelyand usually unfairlyits always been personal between charlie muffin and gerald said simpson every complaint and every warning about this man has been justified by whats happened insisted williams its no pleasure for me to have been proven right you havent been said simpson not yet whens our first chance to speak to him properly asked hamilton tomorrow morning said dean every conceivable thing that could have gone wrong has gone wrong insisted gerald williams desperate for the last convincing word at that moment natalia was entering the russian analysis meeting thinking exactly the same thing she also suspected her personal survival could be at risk she hoped she hadnt miscalculated as she believed her opposition had it wouldnt take her long to find out outrageous declared dmitri nikulin internationally we have been made to look ridiculous by a tinpot quasi republic still living in the stone age how tell me how the head of the presidential secretariat talked directly to natalia who in turn looked to petr travin beside her she said my deputyhas had all the operational dealings today unfortunately there hasnt apparently been time for him to advise me travin had three times claimed he was too occupied talking direct to yakutsk to give her an account of what was happening an open challenge to her authority she knew the man wouldnt have attempted that without the backing of the deputy interior minister viktor viskov who sat opposite fixedfaced studiously avoiding the man hed personally appointed to be her deputy and his spy if this was their chosen moment for a coup theyd mistimed it this afternoons meeting had initially been scheduled for the following day which would possibly have given them the opportunity to complete whatever they were manipulating but nikulins unexpected decision to bring it forward gave her the most influential audience in front of which to fight turning travins evasion back upon the man by insistingin memoranda to the presidents chief of staffthat travin attend to explain his lack of contact and bringing the meeting so abruptly and unexpectedly forward hinted the intervention of the president himself which she guessed to be the main reason for viskovs discomfort from his implacable silence she decided presidential pressure was also the inference drawn by the deputy foreign minister mikhail suslov the fifth person in nikulins office nikulin frowned between natalia and her deputy and then said to travin whats going on here its been very difficult bad communications stumbled travin losing his usual smoothmannered control from what i understand there was no warning no agreement to meet the press the westerners imagined they were only going to see the chief minister possibly the executive council we were specifically excluded charlie had looked trapped natalia remembered why hadnt he called she would have been so much better prepared if theyd talked it was like trying to walk blindfolded in the dark but she was sure there was some high ground she could gain if war had been openly declared she said colonel lestov was my choice and i think hes proved to be a good one he made the whole episode which i accept we still have properly to have explained appear the mistakethe stupidityof the yakutsk authorities she looked directly attravin again he talked on television of our demanding an explanation what did he say to you about that we didnt go into that said her deputy uneasily at the moment theres some difficulty about the release of the body they believe to be that of a russian woman the americans and the english are on their way back with their nationals natalia avoided any surprised reaction to the news of charlies return our pathologist has conducted her own autopsy hasnt she she persisted not allowing travin any relief as far as i understand it yes said the man dont you know demanded nikulin exasperated yes blurted travin what about everything else is there anything more for them to do there demanded natalia i dont i thought they should wait to bring the body back to avoid it appearing that they werent in control the media are still there youve seen the headlines in our own press i gather its much more in the west i dont think they should wait at all said natalia looking more fully around the chief of staffs officelets use the media and the yakutsk stupidity recall our people having completed their investigation and let them announce their regret at the body being held and prevented from a civilized burial match it with a statement from here formally asking why that proper burial is being prevented of someone obviously the victim of a terrible crime yakutsk will be caught whichever way they respond if they return the body theyll be complying with our demand if they dont a proper burial there will also be what we demanded she looked at the deputy interior ministerdont you agree that publicly we would appear to be in control either way i suppose so perhaps conceded viskov reluctantly it sounds good to me said mikhail suslov i cant see a problem with it either said nikulin in fact i think its something we should do pointedly addressing her the presidential aide said and i think it is something that you should do personally natalia nikandrova brief colonel lestov and prepare our announcement from here travin was whitefaced staring accusingly at viskov who still refused to answer the look carefully trying to judge a safe contribution to the discussion the deputy foreign minister said what do we know about this englishmans story of wartime mysteries travin shifted the attention back upon him colonel lestov was only with him and the american woman for about two hours before they flew out it was the woman who gave them a resume of what hed said but not any explanationany factsto support it so we are dependent upon cooperation said nikulin as i have been from the beginning acknowledged natalia finally charlie would tell her all she needed to know to answer all the questions but most importantly to defend herselfthemselvesfrom any internal attack within the ministry refusing to give up on travin she said you brought them officially together as a group will there be sufficient cooperation imagining an escape travin said i dont believe theres been a lot of exchange so far i found the englishman belligerent obstructive the impression in yakutsk has been that hes ineffective charlies favorite chameleon color natalia recognized lets hope youre wrong what do we know about him asked nikulin abruptly natalia felt the first jump of concern quickly she said he was posted here by agreement about a year after the official assignment of fbi representation to cooperate on organized crime and was largely responsible for the breaking up of a nuclear smuggling incident involving natalia nikandrovas previous deputy came in viskov accusingly and other government officials fought back natalia hes here by our permission like the fbi queried nikulin yes agreed viskov then i dont see that we have a problem said the presidential adviser going to the deputy foreign minister if there isnt a full exchange we tell his government to withdraw him how much more impossible was it all going to get natalia wondered the man traveling on the state department plane with kenton peters lay charlie muffins file aside and said ornery sonofabitch there was a strong texan accent who did the agency a lot of harm in the past reminded peters you want it to be an accident or obvious the operational name on the passport was henry packer it was his own idea of a joke to describe himself as a pipeline specialist on his visa i havent decided yet at the moment youre just getting sight of the rabbit whatever you say does it matter one way or the other no said packer just want to provide maximum satisfaction i aim to please as well as aim straight that was another joke but peters didnt smile it was what muscovites call a napoleon day the dawn sun burning from a cloudless sky to set fire to moscows neardeserted streets as they really had been torched to drive out the briefly occupying french emperor charlie hoped it wasnt an omen the americans had transportationa van large enough for both coffinsat domodedovo airport and charlie continued to impose actually being driven first and direct to the riverbordering morisa toreza he parted from miriam bell in the british embassy forecourt with promises to talk later in the day make sure you do insisted the woman saul freeman barely waved the embassy watchman complained he hadnt been warned about the arrival of a corpse and wasnt sure about storage because he hadnt had to deal with a dead body since his posting the man couldnt find a cart and he and charlie needed several stops staggering with the coffin between them to the canteens walkin refrigeratorin the basement the watchman said the chef wouldnt like it and charlie agreed he probably wouldnt and promised to take the blame youve got a rotten job remarked the man charlie said he knew the night duty officer at the embassy switchboard was dozing when charlie walked in snuffling awake at charlies greeting it only took charlie minutes to discover what he wanted in the london telephone directory and he smiled at something proving easy for a change everything in his hutchlike officer was filmed with dust the paper plane prototype hed been working on lay forgotten under the desk the cleaners had obviously forgotten the room altogether there were three demands for immediate contact from sir rupert dean on his voice mail the last at ten the previous night charlie put messages on theirs for mcdowell the military attache and cartright telling them he was back so clear was everything in his mind that it only took charlie an hour to write what he intended telling london at that stage which wasnt everything there was for example no mention whatsoever of vitali maksimovich novikov only of gulag it was still only sixthirty when he made his way familiarly to the cipher room for his findings to be encoded satisfied that because of the time difference it would reach london to coincide with sir rupert deans arrival for his normal day charlie guessed he had about half an hour natalia answered on the first ring good to hear your voice my telephone was tapped natalia smiled bleakly to herself i guessed there was a reason hows sasha missing you how about you dont ask a silly question can i speak to her shes still asleep she wondered what you were doing on television a lot of people did and still do you all right he thought she sounded subdued theres another problem to go with all the others serious could be depends how i handle it connected with this people seeing an advantage in it whos ahead at the moment i think i am well keep it that way natalia smiled again warmed by the confidence i saw both television transmissions it looked chaotic something like that howd it work out pretty good i think well talk about it we need to she said pointedly the final goodbye to separating integrity he guessed it would be a giant leap forward i can keep you ahead believe me i hope he thought what about yakutsk itself unbelievable how was the american girl clever she looked a mess on tv charlie frowned at the obviousness thats why i didnt sleep with her you get the chance natalia i was joking charlie wasnt sure she had been but either way that was an improvement too past pressure or whatever had arisen now so was i when will you be home its going to be a busy day do you want to talk on the telephone it was a coded question maybe not so she wasnt sure if the lesnaya telephone was clean but it was his apartment if their telephone was tapped their being together had already been discovered natalia wasnt thinking clearly we could lunch maybe walk like we used to a long time ago she was worried charlie realized during his phony defection when their relationship would have meant automatic imprisonment or for her even worse theyd risked trysts in the botanical gardens on botanicheskiy sad noon he suggested it is good to have you back her relief was obvious for me too the second line on his console began flickering urgently ive got to go at last greeted the directorgeneral when charlie pressed the button no ones going to like the idea of another english officer being a killer criticized dean at once the man had the calm encouraging voice of the university professor hed once been inviting debate the inside of a uniform jacket would have been the obvious place to look for names the tailors or the owners set out charlie patiently the inside of a trouser band wouldnt be to anyone but another englishman who would know british military tailors duplicate like that only officers get their uniforms tailored only another officer would have known tenuous challenged the other man the russian military makarov fires bullets slightly larger than those of the ninemillimeter german walther from which its copied said charlie they weigh ten grams the weight and size of the two recovered from the male bodies the bullet that killed the woman was caliber the british army mark iv webley fires by the marker date on the coin in our mans pocketevery army was fighting with every other nations weapons i think a british caliber bullet is significant and i think its worth checking against the tailoring persisted charlie and we can check weve got sufficient label material for a positive identification and it shouldnt be particularly difficult take me through it demanded the directorgeneral there are only five military tailors in london i checked the london directory as soon as i got back here this morning and only one of those five has a name with an initial letter to match a scrap of the label left inside the trouser waistband its so small it looks like a c but its not i think its ggieves and hawkes at savile row london from the inscription in the cigarette case weve gotthe initials of the customers name s n and his specific measurements to help the trace it all sounds remarkably simple agreed dean the cigarette case inscription helps a lot apart from the initials suggested charlie youll know far better than me but i dont believe there were more than a handful of universities in england in when we know he graduated we know too that he got a first which should narrow the search down and we also knowfor whatever reasonthere was only a father no mother charlie heard the rustle of turning pages from the other end dean said the marks of a missing signet ring no wallet no military identification why take away the obvious identification but still leave enough from which we can possibly get a name anyway i dont have an answer to that admitted charlie maybe they thought they had it all did the obvious as you say but didnt look for other things they were killed in what passes for summer there the medical examiner found insects in all three bodies yet they had to use grenades to get them buried as deeply as they did perhaps they never thought thered be a thaw this severe there hasnt been for more than fifty years youre sure there would have had to be official russian knowledge of their being in yakutsk totally said charlie at once that was a closed penal colonynot even known about in the west during the war so how did a british and american officer come officially to be there and then get murdered another question on a long list i dont have the answer to said charlie in further admission something else i think we should bear in mind is our mans uniform buttons on officers uniforms usually carry their regiments insignia dont they i believe so agreed the directorgeneral the buttons on this lieutenants uniform dont reminded charlie you suggesting a secret intelligence unit im not ruling it out a british officer possibly intelligencelinked in a part of the soviet union where he had no right to beand therefore no permission to bekilled for being there mused sir rupert dean reflectivelyworking somehow in some way with an american of matching rank somewhere there has to be a record of the operation perhaps accepted charlie what would it say about their disappearance stalin was too paranoid ever to have allowed british and american intelligence into a place like yakustkaya insisted the sociopolitical professor whoever got them to yakutsk did it without kremlin knowledge or agreement so they just had to disappear without explanation it was wartime said dean reminding in return hundredsthousandsdisappeared without explanation stalin was our ally neither britain nor america could have admitted spying on him although of course we did thats all a long time ago said charlie but not to be dismissed until we know what they were doing there persisted the directorgeneral it is a long time ago all the history has been written tidied up as history always is two possible intelligence officers together as they were where they were is phenomenal if the secrets of what stalin had created in yakutskaya had leaked outafter the war had turned in our favorit could have been enough to break the wests alliance with russia and had the west split with stalin there wouldnt have been the division of europe at yalta and potsdam imagine that no soviet union no forty years of communist stranglehold on eastern europe no cold war no god knows what else he snorted a laugh unamused you could have been inches from the truth not fantasizing when you talked of wartime mysteries charlie muffin who prided himself as an olympicclass mental sprinter against his physical difficulty to reach a shuffling trot recognized that his academic controller was practically out of sight ahead of him struggling to keep upan unpleasant experiencecharlie said can we speculate that much this early we can imagine a possible scenario insisted the other man gulag is the obvious key i understand no records exist in yakutsk mosows the most likely suggested dean trial and deportation documents even i would think so how much of what youve told mewritten in your reportdo the american and the russians have or know demanded the directorgeneral the local autopsy reports detailing all the body marks were shared recounted charlie so were the lists of belongings found on each body but there was a mistake i didnt correct the inscription in the cigarette case is copperplate all swirls and curlicues the initials were copied down wrongly the sweeping old english frepresenting an swas taken really to be f so its inaccurate the russian forensic scientist has full and undistorted photographs of all three faces which we should get copies of we can get our own from our own body the two ninemillimeter bullets are common knowledge and the and the shrapnel from the grenades that made the grave im sure neither have the waistband label he hesitated thats all i think they would have seen the marks where the ring was missing on our lieutenant as i saw that things had been snatched or ripped from the other two bodies you havent mentioned gulag im going to need the russians to trace records said charlie i dont think the americans have it were supposed to be in tandem with washington reminded dean tell washington that you think theyre holding back i think for a situation involving so many people agencies and government departments theres an echoing lack of reciprocal information the same has occurred to me said dean until we start getting a little back it might be an idea to keep our hand covered you didnt offer anything interpret the fact they werent armed anything like that no assured charlie you got a lot charlieconcluded a lot praised dean and youre right we should be able to find a name this end but until we doand get an idea of what our dead man was doingi agree we should keep a tight lid on things how difficult might it be following that instruction and resolvingnatalias new as yet unknown problem everything had to be adjustable as long as it was in his favor he said the people at the embassy here will want an explanation sir rupert dean was silent for several moments and weve got to maintain a working relationship there he agreed there was another silence keep it all general without positively lying particularly test out gallaway when this first broke i expected it to be a military investigation but the defense ministry ran a mile not wanting to dirty their hands maybe they know something theyre not telling us will they tell us ever questioned charlie more to gauge the other mans thinking than for the answer he was pleased at the directorgenerals acceptance of what had until now only been a suspicion not if they dont want to or cant said dean simply its not just identifiable responsibility everyones running from the publicity is hysterical questions are being asked in the house daily demands for a statement from the prime minister its all getting out of hand ill have whoevers job it is get the body and belongings back today promised charlie there was another silence then dean said i might bring you back continue here what youve started there be ready if i do that would leave nataliaand sashaalone which he couldnt do not immediatelynot until hed sorted out whatever it was that was worrying her quickly charlie said shouldnt i first see what the americans and russians are prepared to share there seems to be some anxiety in the american embassy about people flying in from washington this has waited more than fifty years im not counting in days said dean he was thought charlie if there was any danger to his moscow appointment or to natalia and apart from the voice mail impatience and the directorgenerals initial greeting there hadnt been any rebuke praise even probingly he said im sorry i wasnt able to say more from yakutsk if it caused any problems nothing serious dismissed the directorgeneral certainly nothing that needs to be discussed after this conversation i got the impression of a lot of angst in london your only concern is my support and you have it charlie celebrated the moment of satisfaction by picking up the airplane with the separate tail section and on impulse tried a test flight at the moment colonel john gallaway flustered into the room the plane crashed at the military attaches feet the immaculate colognesmelling man frowned at the bristlechinned crumpled charlie and said what in gods name is going on just seeing if it would fly as well as my ideas said charlie it didnt said gallaway they gathered in gallaways office because that was where the six surviving wartime photographs had been assembled charlie carried with him the lieutenants uniform which he decided smelled only slightly worse than he did and everything it had contained while mcdowell gallaway and cartright prodded and poked among it all charlie took the pictures to the window where the suns early promise had been fulfilled with a brilliantly bright day the glare made him feel graveleyed from tiredness the photographs were grainy and sepiafaded from age among the recommendations hed already sent to londoncarefully retrieved from the cipher room with everything else on his way to gallaways suitewas that a foreign office and defense ministry archive search be made there for wartime pictures and charlie decided to ship gallaways trove back with the body of the dead man despite there being no one in the prints even vaguely resembling the longdead man in the basement refrigerator he didnt hurry providing a greatly edited account of yakutsk to the other three men he omitted completely his belief of there being a second british officer involved so he finished looking at the military attache thats my story whats yours from the ministry of defense files about an intelligence operation absolutely nothing declared gallaway glibly there wasnt one charlie let the silence settle until the others began to stir uncomfortably not understanding okay sighed charlie the body of an english officer wearing an english officers uniform is in agrenadecreated grave in a part of siberia no one fifty years ago could get to the defense ministry which inherited the war office has no record of any lieutenant being there or here charlie paused feeling another snatch of tiredness you tell me john you dont mind me calling you john do you id like you to call me charlie unable to anticipate what was coming gallaway shook his head thank you john charlie resumed so you tell me john what our man was doing there unless he was on a covert operation and then you try to convince mewith the amount of publicity that this is gettingthat your ministry hasnt gone through every bus ticket and postage stamp receipt of its archives of fifty years ago to find out why a british army lieutenant was where he was but before you do all thatjohnyou tell me what your brief is from london right nowcause if you dont im not going to share with you any more than im going to share with anyone else and the loserjohnwill be you you think about it charlie looked sideways to cartright and id like you to take that on board too richard strikes me im doing all the work being stung to buggery possibly in more ways than were obvious in yakutsk and getting very little back in return i shall most definitely report everything about this conversation to london said gallaway his face was puce but not totally there were isolated white blotches making him lizardskinned i obviously will too said cartright ive done everything i could think of to help you can read my cable traffic if you like i want all of you to do that encouraged charlie but ignoring the offer just as i want you all to know im not making any accusations against you personally its not the way those bastards on the top floor operate when you complain to london about me you also tell them that ive got a lot more theyd like to know but ive got to get a lot more in exchange gallaway was gulping for words when his telephone rang he answered without greeting and just as wordlessly handed it to the head of chancellery raymond mcdowells face contorted into disbelief the bodys in the canteen refrigerator none of the staff will go in to get the food for breakfast im sorry apologized charlie i havent got round to telling you gerald williams was right thought cartright this man was practically beyond belief natalia listened intently as colonel vadim lestov recited back to her the statement shed just dictated to him knowing even the intonation was important correcting the detective twice were going to issue something similar from here she said finally shed spent an hour that morning suggesting the phrasing with the deputy foreign minister mikhail suslov and a further hour waiting for any correction from their presidential adviser at the white house dmitri nikulin hadnt called there was only fortyfive minutes before her meeting with charlie im very sorry apologized lestov nothing has gone as it should have as it was intended youre not being held responsible why then is it you im being briefed by not colonel travin this is political as well as being operational said natalia cautiously politically survivable for whom she wondered belying the appearance of a man who always looked as if hed crawled out from under an ancient hedge charlie muffin was fastidiously clean the way he dressed was camouflage for him to be overlooked hopefully not even seen necessarily going back to lesnaya to shower shave and changeand even then make a telephone calldelayed him but charlie wouldnt anyway have arrived at the gardens ahead of natalia she had never been operational walking dark streets and even darker alleys couldnt instinctively recognize the difference between shadows and shade which after so long was second nature to charlie not yet knowing her latest concern he had to protect her ensure she was alone it had been natalia whod remembered their old rendezvous so shed remember the rules expect him to check fromsomewhere unseen and know that if he didnt approach after half an hour he wouldnt make the meeting not believing it safe she had to be wrong overreacting he told himself as he emerged from the botanicheskiy sad metro cloaked by the crowd this sort of thing had been necessary in the old paranoid past but one of the few real changes in russiamoscow particularlyhad been the ending of the kgbs spyuponspy internal control in addition to which officially natalia was no longer attached to an intelligence organization since her liaison transfer to the interior ministry his going through the charade of a clandestine meeting behaving in the ways of that old obsessive past was important though for what it told him natalia was becoming paranoid overpressured and overstrained trying to live as they were as they had no alternative but to live charlie tried unsuccessfully to recall the shakespeare quotation about a tangled web hed had to learn at school unable to remember if it was the same play that had the phrase about protesteth too much that had occurred to him that morning confronting the supposedly outraged diplomats and offended intelligence officer school had been a long time ago like so much else seemed to be but not tradecraft sure of the geography charlie eased into the park by the side gate the one that gave him immediate cover from the archroofed hothouse and the branchskirted gymnosperms he saw natalia at once she was sitting on what hed taught her to be their marker seat from which he could isolate the people around her seeking out the seemingly engrossed newspaper reader on adjoining benches or entwined lovers whose eyes never closed in ecstasy or pet owners whose dogs couldnt pee anymore dutifully natalia got up after a few minutes striding forcefully off toward the rear gate as if leaving a neverfail trigger to startle a watcher into movement two newspaper readers read on a third continued dozing the solitary dog walker went on in the opposite direction it was too early for lovers natalia sat as abruptly as shed risen on the seat closest to the first hothouse not more than five meters from where charlie stood beneath the tree canopy the gardens remained tranquil apart from the entry of a noisy school party of giggling girls who were giggling schoolgirls charlie still gave itanother five minutes smiling toward natalia as he eventually approached he said that was nostalgic i didnt need the memories youd better tell me about it natalia did at last in short tight sentences finally holding back nothing looking away from him most of the time charlie didnt speak for several moments after shed finished it was ridiculous stupid not to have told me from the beginning i know now i didnt guess how youd react at there being an overhang from the popov affair there was an official inquiry you were completely exonerated viktor ivanovich was a member of the tribunal she reminded charlie in turn he obviously didnt accept the finding there couldnt be any other reason not that i can think of and ive thought about it a very great deal charlie raised his hands warding off apology before he spoke you couldnt have misunderstood not after yesterday which you seem to have won this time i need to go on winning more than that even if theyre trying to destroy you youve got to destroy them im so tired of playing games our games their game anyones game were not playing games anymore insisted charlie were going to fight with what i was lucky yesterdaythe timing was in my favorbut it was a fluke if i dont stay ahead on this every step of the way ill be replaced charlie lapsed into silence again immersed in thought he wouldnt say itcouldnt say itbecause the resolve had been obvious for a very long time and theyd shaken it to death like two dogs holding on to a single bone but if natalia were forced to leave the ministryto become simply but allimportantly his proper legal wife sashas motherall their personal working difficulties wouldbe ended at a finger snap but natalia needed her job as much as he needed his until nowuncertain unsure nowboth their personal lives had been a litany of one disaster imploding upon another they were only confident about their professional ability and success clinging to it as a blind man tightly holds his stick to get through each day without colliding with unseen obstacles he said if they want a war well take it to them natalia said ive talked to lestov he thinks you had a lot you hadnt shared according to the american woman youre a sneaky sonofabitch her words that was an exaggeration but natalia had no difficulty with it so thought an unoffended charlie was miriam bell you knew that without being told have you got something i can fight with demanded natalia gazing steadily at him decision time charlie recognized shit or get off the pot loyalty to the department or loyalty to natalia the department had cheated him and been disastrously cheated in return and theyd cheat him again if it became expedient to do so natalia had never cheated himtried to even any scoredespite the times and the ways hed failed her nor he thought would she ever and was the job as important to him as hed tried to make out with his elaborate blind mans analogy charlie was surprised he even needed to pose himself the question he stood breathing in deeply offering his hand to bring her up with him and began slowly wandering the path toward the hothouses and as they walked charlie told natalia all he knew or thought he knew even toward the end his directorgenerals nowignored insistence that he offer as little as possible to gain as much as he could until a reason was established for the english lieutenant being in yakutsk miriam bells right you are a sneaky sonofabitch do you still have sufficient authority to try to find the records of gulag demanded charlie it would have been berias time the nkvd natalia recalled talking as much to herself as to charlie its said that for more than a layered mile beneath the lubyanka theres a virtual city beneath a city stretching as far as red square and the kremlin and ploshchadsverdlova under the bolshoi stalin had his own railway system to move around it one entire level is occupied by archives hundreds of millions of them yakutskaya was one of the biggest secrets so records might have been destroyed as they were in yakutsk itself but we wont know that until we look dont be specific warned charlie a general inquiry about camps is an obvious extension of the inquiry something youd be expected to do isolating a specific camp at the very beginning wouldnt be unless the information came from your own people charlie she protested pained if were not going to take chances were not going to take chances he said offering charlie muffin logic channel everything through you youll know what youre looking for dump the rest on travin drown him nikulin is your secret weaponso secret that he doesnt know it youre going to have to spell this out for me step by step protested natalia youll understand every little skirmish promised charlie recognize something she demanded stopping abruptly where they were charlie gazed around the huge glassed building with its giant roofsized fern leaves realizing for the first time theyd actually gone into one of the houses no he conceded its the same one you walked me to when you admitted your defection was phony and that youd lied identified natalia it was right here you told me you were going to abandon me and go back to london the recollectionand the remorsewas immediate charlie said i came back and this time im not abandoning you no accepted natalia its a good feeling going personally to the american embassy leaving the protection of his own territory for the uncertainty of theirs was as conscious a psychological act as dressing to be despised and therefore underrated despite miriam bells suspicion charlie didnt expect an identity for the murdered american to be freely offered if it had already been found but hed sense the nuance if there had been progress there were other considerations too the fbi quarters at ulitza chaykovskovowere far more extensive and certainly more luxurious than his badgers hole in which more than three people at any one time risked suffocation and the american embassy mess extended happy hour to two and on occasions three there was no drink price concession at all at the british bar charlie suspected gerald williams it had been miriams number hed called from the lesnaya apartment before leaving to meet natalia and the americans were waiting for him easily accommodated in saul freemans office it was little more than a passing impression that miriam had showered and washed her hair and tried makeup on a face showing scarcely any sign of the yakutsk ravages his immediate concentration was upon two men already in the room against a far wall almost as if they were not part of the intended gather charlie looked curiously invitingly to freeman who instead of introductions said coupla guys from state just sitting in the elder whitehaired man was clearskinned and tightbodied and beaknosed which combined with the length at which he wore his hair gave him a patrician appearance it was the second man who held charlies attention he was slightly built and unobtrusively dressed in muted gray and sat completely unmoving what registered most was washedout blue eyes that never blinked in charlies experience men with no name who didnt blink either wore sixguns in western movies or ear protectors on practice ranges where hed never been able to stop blinking and this man didnt look at all like an actor determinedly charlie said hi charlie muffin the two men nodded back but didnt speak freeman said must be good to get back great said charlie and waited good of you to come said freeman were all working together arent we charlie spoke looking at the two silent strangers able to see miriam at the same time she was subdued unsmiling like to think so agreed the fbi chief so would i said charlie everything escalated while you were away its been a media circus the presidents responded with an executive order demanding answers plans an arlington burial very impressive freeman shifted seemingly uncomfortable thought it might be useful to talk through everything weve got who thought wondered charlie id like to hear that too he took from his pocket a muchedited and sometimes altered version of the account hed earlier sent to london thats all ive got together at the moment freemans forced bonhomie faltered at being outmaneuvered his eyes flickered to the men against the wall miriam said im afraid i havent worked as fast as you all weve done is talk it through in very general terms charlie estimated it had been a full five minutes since the blueeyed man had blinked he wondered if he could make him now he said okay so lets talk it was clearly a combined intelligence mission records of american military intelligence g are stored at adelphi maryland with the urgency and authority of an executive order youll have accessed them by now so id appreciate knowing the result of that its too soon obviously to have got your own photographs of your body but youre quite clearly geared up to run graduation checks at west point what sort of time frame are you running on that you have a rapid physiognomy comparison facility at bureau headquarters dont you it shouldnt take long if you use that id be interested in your theories about the missing articles against what was left on the bodies weve quite a lot to talk about in fact havent we the stranger didnt blink but freeman did looking even more obviously at the washington visitors he said youve covered quite a lot of ground there i thought thats what we had to do said charlie whats come out of adelphi nothing so far said freeman but youre checking there so youve already decided it was intelligence accepted charlie smiling at the unintentional admission thats something i suppose means youre already wondering as i am how two officers could disappear like they obviously did for so long so youll be organizing a records search of your cia forerunner the office of strategic services he gestured to his specially prepared report lying unread and untouched on freemansdesk youll see were carrying out those sort of inquiries in london id appreciate your letting me have your results as soon as possible as youll see ive promised to let you have ours yes of course said freeman whats the state department guidance about possible embarrassment he asked directly addressing the two unspeaking men thats the big question tried freeman what was our guyyour guy toodoing there in the first place which wasnt even an attempt to answer the question charlie acknowledged an executive order from the president himself was certainly important enough for someone to have traveled all the way from washington but it was a very long way to come to sit and say nothingpractically like a performance in a bmovie unless they did know and their participation was turning into a damagelimitation exercise better planned than his at yakutsk as if aware of the reflection freeman said that nazi business really was a hell of a bluff thanks it was that wasnt it a bluff i mean like you told miriam it was absolutely or were they groping more than he believed if they were hed already achieved all there was to achieve misdirecting sufficiently and disclosing nothing he shouldnt have disclosed you really cant take itanythingany further everything ive got is there said charlie ill get something to you promised miriam with whatever there might be from washington added freeman thats about it then accepted charlie there wouldnt be the expected happy hour invitation today well keep in touch insisted freeman freeman had to accompany charlie to be officially signed past embassy security as they walked charlie said you want to tell me about that freeman said im sorry they made the rules which were thats how they wanted it done what are their names i cant tell you charlie and you expect me to cooperate how do you think i feel i dont know saul how do you feel like a prime cunt thats about right said charlie im sorry for you im sorry for myself the man straightened as he walked as if trying physically to cast off the episode actually smiling which he hadnt done so far he said dick cartright tells me a girl i introduced him to is related to the one youre with isnt that a fantastic coincidence fantastic agreed charlie without a pause sometimes gossip and an inferior mans need to boast was a wonderful thing ive never known arrogance like it protested kenton peters who hadnt from anyone who knew who he was the appalled indignation echoed over the line from the embassys secure communications bunker thats appalling sympathized james boyce but youve no doubt there is something hes keeping back not telling london none it cant be about there being a second officer ive seen what he sent today its there our people havent so he hasnt shared it so you could be right that hes got the connection is it time to eliminate him there was silence from moscow then peters said ill leave everything in place well take him anytime when it suits us maximum effect im not happy complained boyce neither am i damned nuisance yes natalia recognized that with the open supportat the moment at leastof dmitri borisovitch nikulin and the now totally shared guidance of charlie muffin she potentially held a very sharp twoedged sword the importance was properly using it against the attacks of the deputy interior minister and his acolyte not falling upon it herself which made charlie whom she could easily believe a reincarnation of machiavelli the more important the one from whom she had to learn it was certainly charlies survival plan for her that although incomplete sounded feasibly straightforward when he sketched it out in the botanical gardens but less certain when she was alone as she was now back in her echoing ministry office knowing that petr travin two doors along their shared corridor and viktor viskov on the floor above were plotting her overthrow with equal determination lead charlie had insisted that was the way for her to remain ahead from the front not by following from behind and shed substantially increased her lead she knew the moscow homicide detective had performed far better than shed expected at his departure press conference from yakutsknatalia made a note to congratulate the manand her unattributed statement accusing the yakutskaya authorities of inexplicable obstruction had chimed perfectly with it the overseas digest of the foreign press frenzycirculated to viskov as well as to herfrom the foreign ministry showed it quoted favorably by every major print and network television outlet in america canada and england as well as being widely reported throughout europe leading from the front did of course expose her back to be stabbed the cynicism actually surprised natalia more charlies mindset than hers maybe the way she had to thinktry to thinkif she could in the future no question of trying she told herself atonce there was sasha always sasha natalia had been too long alone ever completely to lose her most deeply rooted fear of all of being alone again which wasnt a consideration of the moment she decided rising positively from her desk the consideration of the moment was continuing to follow charlies script mountains can be made from bureaucratic bullshit which shed already initiated by a telephone call to the lubyanka now that had to be followed immediately by the personal visit because everything had to be in sequence she made a point of announcing to her secretariat that she was going out but not saying wherehappy for the gossip if not the positively offered information to permeate along the corridorand used the metro instead of an official car and driver by which and through whom she could have been quickly traced she got off at the bolshoi station preferring to walk the rest of the way seeing as she crossed the final square that the briefly removed glowering statue of felix dzerzhinsky the founder of the soviet intelligence service had been replaced in front of its yellowwashed headquarters building while so many other less despised reminders of communism had been removed fyodor lyulin the chief archivist to whom she had already spoken was obediently waiting he was a bespectacled anxioustoplease and unexpectedly young man apprehensive at personally being sought out by someone of natalias rank and authority which immediately registered with her as an advantage alien though it was for her to bully something else she perhaps had to learn lyulin believed there were records of yakutskaya nervously pointing out that it was all too long ago for him to have had anything personally to do with them and certainly for which he had no responsibility apart from their being somewhere in the intelligence service archives he did not know if they were completeindeed even where they might be keptbut he would of course search at once the man twitched more than blinked at natalias demand for details of gulags for the ten years between and ive no way of estimating at the moment of course but that could conceivably run into tenshundredsof thousands they might not be indexed in any chronological order material often isnt from that period better than she could have hoped thought natalia i want whatever existsall of it dont worry about indexing or chronology as theyre found i want them shipped immediately to me at the ministry just located and sent to you pedantically qualified the relaxing archivist seeing an insuperable job becoming comparatively easy thats all agreed natalia until i tell you to stop going through so much could be a monumental task for anyone for a team of people cautioned the relieved man i am organizing that its a survey that has to be made the instruction will be confirmed in writing requested lyulin protectively of course but i want the search begun at once it has the highest priority from the white house itself ill put every available person on it undertook lyulin but supervise it yourself nothing must be overlooked and each camp must be identified in a summary of each shipment understood completely assured the man there was a benefit natalia hadnt anticipated when she got back to the ministry later that afternoon dmitri nikulins congratulatory memorandum for the effectiveness of the previous days yakutsk statement was marked as having been copied to the deputy interior minister which forced a matching note from viskov within thirty minutes by which time natalia was dictating memos of her own to the presidents chief of staff she wrote that the reason for the murdered westerners being in yakutsk could well lie in the slave colonies that existed in the vicinity at the time of their deaths and that she intended as comprehensive a check as possible of all surviving records at lubyanka particularly for any western prisoners her deputy petr travin would be in personal charge of the search authorized to employ as many extra staff as necessary for it to be completed as soon as possible her instruction to travin was for a daily summary as well as a detailed assessment of the total number of camps that had existed around yakutsk and for any that had a specific purpose other than simply housing prisoners or exiles she dictated the authorization that the lubyanka archivist had asked for and duplicated everythingto everyoneincluding viskovsatisfied that she had effectively buried petr travin beneath charlies bullshit mountain that hopefully really would become her deputys career grave if camp the records of which shed sift firsthad held someone of linking significance to the dead officers natalia felt bettersaferat the end of the day than she had at its beginning especially when another memorandum was delivered just as she was leaving it had been a good evening theyd eaten scotch beef from the embassy commissary and gone through in detail all that natalia had done that afternoon to overwhelm petr pavlovich travin charlie insisted nikulins memo as shed been leaving the ministry praising her for making the gulag check prevented either her deputy or viktor viskov from maneuvering an escape youre not just ahead youre out of sight what happens if its petr pavlovich who comes up with something from one of the other camps questioned natalia still needing to be convinced it was still your idea charlie pointed out so its still your success whichever way it goes they went to bed early charlie having been awake for almost fortyeight hours but he wasnt too tired to make love and it was perfect as it always was afterward they lay side by side their bodies touching and natalia said yakutsk was the first time weve been apartyour not being in mosowfor over a year i know i didnt like it neither did i i hope it doesnt happen again too often me too he hadnt told her about sir rupert deans talk of his being recalled to london and decided not to or of the unspeaking men at the american embassy one trained not to blink he said you hear from irena while i was away he wasnt sure but charlie thought he felt natalia stiffen imperceptibly beside him in the darkness she said no why no particular reason youve never told me much about her there was definitely a stiffness theres nothing much to tell why didnt you see her for such a long time what is it charlie just curious this hadnt been the right moment he realized or had it she make a pass at you demanded natalia no lied charlie there was a long silence then natalia said konstantin left me for irena konstantin had been natalias first husband charlie remembered it had been so long since theyd talked about the man that charlie had forgotten the name he said what happened he felt natalia shrug he was a lecher like ive told you but hed never left me before she always wanted anything i had from when we were children how long did it last until i divorced him so he could marry her she didnt want him then she was quiet for several moments im sorry ive been so stupid about us i mean no real harm done there could have been i cant think how awful that would have been its over assured charlie irena knowing someone at the british embassy was something else he wouldnt tell natalia their holdingback roles had been reversed he realized im glad you called said miriam she really wasnt sure who was the better lover cartright or lestov which wasnt the most important comparison cartrights usefulness apart from in bed was what she could get from his involvement in the case its good to have you back said cartright it must have been appalling known better how did you get on with charlie miriam was surprised cartright had managed to hold out through dinner and the beforeandafter drinks fine he sure as hell knows how to operate hows that we wouldnt have gotten on that plane if he hadnt known how to flash dollars around he seems adept as making money work prompted cartright but i gave him a ride back so i guess were even what happened while i was away nothing of any consequence london doesnt seem to be able to find any trace of our man or why he should have been there how about you lots of questions no answers you think charlies being straight with you dont you no this is a joint operation anything i get from london im quite prepared to share with you we do have rather a special relationship dont we very special agreed miriam happy in every way with her nights work the first shipment from the lubyanka archivesyellowing crumbling folders and box files mostly handwritten and detailing five camps none gulag was waiting for natalia when she arrived at the ministry the following morning so too were all the replies from petr pavlovich travin to her previous days flurry of messages although none from the deputy foreign minister travins overall responseto complain of insufficient staff and inadequate funds temporarily to employ the extra people necessary for such a mammoth taskwas precisely what charlie had predicted but natalia felt a flicker of uncertainty at the next step just as quickly she realized there was no going back she ordered travin to withdraw clerk and office staff from every militia district station in moscow and volunteered three of her own secretariat suggesting that travin and viskov match the transferfrom their staff she proposed that travin organize a shift system extending until midnightaround the clock if it became necessaryand in a separate although copiedtoeveryone note asked the deputy interior minister to allocate emergency funding for the extra hours payment she reminded her deputy there was a planned meeting that afternoon with the returning colonel lestov and suggested they finalize the operation then her last message over which she hesitated longer than any other in the batch she enclosed to him invited dmitri nikulins suggestion upon anything she might have overlooked the speed of the deputy interior ministers return brought the stomachdropping realization of how carefully viskov and travin had set their imagined trapeven to corresponding through nikulinand how close she was to the final confrontation she wished charlie would be with her when it came it was to the presidential office that viktor viskovs memorandum was sent marked copied to her as a matter of courtesy and natalia accepted at once that viskovs denunciation was intended to be all the more effective by its careful understatement she was referred to throughout by her cumbersome official title interior ministry director of militia and internal security liaison nowhere was there a direct condemnation but to crush her as completely as possible by gaining an overwhelming support as well as an audience duplicates of the memorandum had also gone to the finance and foreign ministries viskov wrote that although the lubyanka search ordered by the liaison director had already begun it had not been possible for staff there accurately even to estimate the documentation involved it was certainly well in excess of a hundred thousand possibly treble that number none of it was indexed properly annotated or in any dated order the history of some camps occupied half a dozen dossiers others as many as twenty virtually the entire archival staff of the intelligence headquarters had been assigned to the recovery but it would be at least a month possibly longer before it would all be finally transferred to the ministry even then there was no guarantee everything would be included the archivistnatalia assumed it would have been fyodor lyulinhad warned the material would eventually occupy several thousand square meters of space the archivist had been given no indication or guidance by the liaison director concerning what was being hunted but thought it could takeas long as six months depending on the number of people allocated for everything to be readlonger if the search was for a specific individual the lists of names ran into the millions viskov estimated thirty clerks could be withdrawn from district militia posts to supplement a possible further twenty within the ministry as suggested by the liaison director their working a shift systemeven around the clock as also suggested by the liaison directorfor anything up to six months would cost three times the total yearly clerk and secretarial budget of the entire ministry it would also of course mean none of the normal work of those involved could be done which would require a further period of overtime working logically a further six months which would bring the budgetary overspending to four times the salary allocation a further but very practical problem was that in the ministry building there was insufficient storage space for the files the first of which had already arrived such a commitmentin terms of cost manpower time and spacewas unprecedented in the history of the moscow militia the intelligence agencies or the interior ministry nothing viskov had so far been told by the liaison director supported such an undertaking indeed he was still waiting to learn precisely what was being sought while in no way criticising the liaison directornor even less questioning its immediate endorsement by the presidents officeviskov urged serious reconsideration until they were convinced of the need and importance of an operation that quite clearly had not been properly thought through the deputy interior minister proposed that the already arranged meeting with colonel vadim leonidovich lestov be expanded to the whole committee for the liaison director personally to justify her actions until then and their confirmation by the full committee he had suspended the archival transfer natalia read and reread the denunciation knowing she could not afford to miss a single accusation it was far more detailed than charlie had predicted and for some time she felt hollowedfleetingly even angry at charliebefore gradually forcing the acceptance that viskov and travin had fallen into charlies trap not she into theirs and that it looked as if this really was the last battle in a sniping war of attrition she was frightened which she supposed people werebefore knowingly going into battle she hoped the very particular rules of engagement devised by herself at charlies direction proved sufficient they seemed to be so far but there was a long way to go her only real concession would be to admit a total inspection was impractical and that wasnt planned as an admission everything after that was to lure viskov on turning the mans blind determination back upon himself and he had been blinded or rather unable to see properly over the bullshit mountain possibly the politicians greatest weaknessdespite his attempted insistence to the contrarywas having no alternative but to link dmitri nikulin in the attack because of nikulins endorsement of natalia more than a weakness she corrected it was a very definite tactical error natalia used her private line to dial charlies direct embassy number anxious for his reassurance wincing when she finally got his voice mail she didnt leave a message she was sitting contemplatively at her desk when the announcement came from nikulins office that the afternoons meeting was being extended as requested by the deputy interior minister natalia was sure she had sufficient evidence to confront those trying to destroy her but following charlies dictum she wished she had more it wasnt until lestovs arrival that she considered she had it still a long way to go but the route was better lit at miriam bells entrance at least twenty male heads turned at the same time as if attached to the same wire charlie sat facing the door of the metropole hotels minsk restaurant and didnt have to make the effort but thought he might have just for the fun of it if hed had to charlie wasnt sure if the smile was all for him or had to be shared with her awareness of the effect she knew she was having throughout the room he said you ever get into any trouble you couldnt handle i hope i dont with you she wore a shimmering green silk trouser suit over a white silk blouse and he didnt think there was a bra her hair was bobbed much shorter than in yakutsk and all the swelling had gone from her face i dont mix business with pleasure i still believe what i said on the plane that you would if it wasnecessary and i could be sad you dont think its necessary now she said nodding acceptance to the vodka he offered from the carafe already on the table but that wasnt what i meant which i think you knew so we really do need to have this lunch dont we as they touched glasses charlie said who the fuck were the men of stone miriam shook her head in matching incredulity the old guys name was peters dont know his first name never got one at all for the second one peters only dealt with the ambassador who decreed every wish was ourand anybody elsescommand i guess state department god and presidential executive order is a pretty powerful combination the younger one wasnt state insisted charlie positively ive met people like him before recognize them as a type peters bodyguard identified miriam saul says state was taking seriously all the kidnapping and killing that happens here in moscow bodyguards got in the way of trouble or caused it decided charlie they didnt sit in on what mightbut hadnt beensensitive debriefings peters really that important you wouldnt believe how the ambassador and head of chancellery and freeman were shitting themselves practically a hygiene problem why the act the way he is apparently although i dont know how saul knows miriams responses were too ingenuous to be prepared but his warning feet were throbbing to the beat of drums where are they now gone quite an experience was it over he wondered havent we got other things to talk about demanded miriam could be encouraged charlie were working against each other charlie which doesnt make any sense you made it very clear in yakutsk you dont like company i didnt set out to do any deals either its going to be my tit in the wringer if this goes wrong however it goes wrong charlie poured more vodka for both of them and said letsorder after a speech like that when they hadmiriam with hurried disinteresthe said wrong like failing to solve it or wrong like peters would judge to be wrong her smile this time was ruefully admiring at charlies perception we got a kneejerk president with ratings in free fall without talking to anyone except his own reflection in the mirror to get the wet eyes right he declares an unknown wrongplace lieutenant to be a national hero whose death will be avenged and then has to be told the reason for his very own superman being where he was could be a monumental fuckedup embarrassment even after all these years and that hes tied the rock around his own neck and could be dragged down by it faster than he was already dropping charlie exhausted the vodka with the arrival of their caviar and ordered another carafe so if the reason for your guy being in yakutsk doesnt qualify for the arlington cemetery burial itll be interred with him to remain the great unsolved mystery it is going to be arlington confirmed miriam did peters stop in england on his way here asked charlie it looked as if london and washington were thinking with a single mind london with perhaps more reason if he was right about a second briton being involved hed never liked being part of diplomatic housetidying the dirt always had a habit of bulging the carpet under which it was swept according to saul he wanted to get as much as he could here first said miriam hes doing it on his way back seems like its all being settled at a much higher level than us miriam shook her head according to saul whos busy digging himself out from under peters didnt like your meeting doesnt think you told the whole truth and nothing but the truth and sometimestoo many timeswhat gets fixed at the top fucks up on its way down because no one has the full game plan wont want to play it even especially someone who doesnt like working in tandem in the first place this approach your idea or peters via saul mine she waited for her trout to be served not looking at himsquirting lemon onto her fishshe said you think that scrap left in the trouser band label is enough to identify your guy charlie laughed outright why didnt you call me a sneaky bastard i just have i wanted to choose my time to trade whatve you got a photograph or rather a piece of a photograph like its been cut in half because he didnt want the other piece hes in uniform in front of a building that could be a bank or a college its very big hes with a girl shes maybe thirty blond theres nothing written on it to say who she is or where it was taken you make a copy before it went to washington i back up everything negotiated miriam i have your word about the trouser label my word promised charlie miriam took the copy from her purse and slid it across the table to him with the supposed duplicate of her yakutsk report to washington charlie pocketed the envelope but studied the picture for several moments before putting that away you think theres enough of the background for your people to identify they hope so i watched you pretty carefully when you went through the clothes said charlie curiously like i watched you reminded miriam she put her hand to her waist there was a small pocket just here for tickets or small change i guess the picture must have been important to him it was all by itself in a little plastic wallet anything else you were right about the spectacles which you can see hes wearing in the photograph according to our laboratory guys in washington he suffered severe astigmatism particularly bad unequal cornea curvature whatever he did or knew he was in uniform for a very special reason what about the tweezers and the magnifying glass tweezers are medical theres no makers mark which is a bastard but our forensic guys think the magnifying glass was custommade by optical specialists they both finished eating at the same time and for several momentslooked steadily at each other across the table miriam said you want to call it a draw charlie didnt want to admit but had to okay we got a deal that wont be enough will it how so what about lestov and the russians and yakutsk for that matter it was polyakov who made the finding of the bodies public in the first place through canada and got badly burned doing it said miriam for russia to be a problem itll have to be something forensic lestov got nothing from the womans body that we didnt see you sure im sure she smiled he could have been lying he wasnt and if he had been it wouldnt matter acknowledged charlie because natalia would tell him he was edging toward his favorite position right in the middle of the spiders web with everything coming in his direction richard cartrights interest in natalias sister still had the irritation of an untrapped fly though throughout the lunch to which henry packer had followed miriam undetected from the embassy the man had sat at the bar watching them drinking mineral water and had seen the woman pass an envelope and what looked like a piece of a photograph to the man he had to kill which was all he had to do packer reminded himself it wasnt his business what they were exchanging they were supposed to be cooperating according to the meeting hed sat in on peters was an asshole imagining there could be any problems from that shambling hayrick whatever the mans file said there was only one professional between himself and charlie muffin and packer knew he was it he hoped he wouldnt have to wait long to prove it colonel vadim leonidovich lestov hid his apprehension well and had it not been for her earlier training and debriefing expertise it might have taken natalia longer to recognize it but hed arrived nervously fifteen minutes earlygiving natalia the advantage she hadnt expectedand phrased everything he initially said defensivelyit took several minutes for the stutter to subside natalia used every psychological trick she could remember to calm the man intent upon getting whatever she could for what was to follow and when it cameknowing that charlie didnt have it but realizing at once how it could be usedshe felt a warm spread of satisfaction at once she realized that it would destroy what charlie was trying to achieve but that was inevitable now at least she would be able to tell him youre sure she insisted absolutely said the man both uniforms were still at the mortuary when lev fyodorovich carried out his preliminary forensic examination in what passed there as a laboratory i counted specifically they were both complete thats very important charlie had talked about wandering away from the grave before the forensic search had finished looking for traces of gulag hed be annoyed with himself more than annoyed he was always furious at personal mistakes it was a forensic discovery i dont consider i did as well as was expected apologized the freshfaced man he was wearing the same shinedbyuse suit of their first meeting natalia said you did brilliantly far better than could have been expected under the circumstances you recovered completely from what was intended as a huge embarrassment she hesitated caught by an idea in fact this afternoons meeting has been expanded for what you did to be properly recognized could it be that she was becoming as devious as charlie when natalia told him who the additional officials would be lestov said doubtfully there must be other more important reasons the worldwide publicity has escalated everything natalia pointed out easily and theres been some misunderstandings nothing though to do with you because of what happened there wasnt any chance for me to discuss anything with the american or the englishman apart from his saying hed made up what he said at the press conference did you believe him broke in natalia recognizing again how perfectly what shed just learned fit everything else there was she thought such a thing as coincidence or was it luck i do believe he had no warning of the media the american was adamant neither of them knew it was very quickwitted of him which charlie was among so many other things natalia thought and which she had to be in the coming hours she said ive got my own ideas about that particularly after what youve just told me i wish i understood more admitted lestov im beginning to said natalia it continued far better than natalia could have hoped everyone except her deputy was already waiting when she led the homicide detective into the interior ministry conference room and she was halfway through the introductions before petr travin flustered in he got halfway through security told me before seeing lestov the colonel arrived early picked up natalia it gave me the opportunity personally to congratulate him as i am sure the rest of you would like to do she was pleased by the confusion petr travin looked to the deputy interior minister for guidance and mikhail suslov from the foreign ministry deferred to dmitri nikulin the presidents representative told lestov you came out well from what could have been a very embarrassing situation for us so yes congratulations are in order which is why i am proposing an official commendation said natalia looking at viskov youd support that wouldnt you deputy minister viskov was totally wrongfooted i thought yes i suppose of course first blood natalia decided conscious of nikulins frown is there something else deputy minister a lot i would have thought viskov came back eagerly indeed agreed natalia anxious to orchestrate as much as possible but surely we need logically to keep to the original agenda and hear first what colonel lestov has to tell us she felt confidently relaxed although properly so sure of her strengthsof being stronger in fact than shed imaginedbut not complacent viskov and his puppet might not have played their full hand yet although she believed they had that was the original intention of the meeting reminded nikulin this afternoons success or failure depended ultimately on the presidential aide his were the attitudes and nuances she had most accurately to gauge above all others she already knew those of her immediate superior and her intended replacement everyone else were unsuspecting spectators of course agreed viskov at once uncertain assessed natalia at once good she said perhaps colonel youd go through again what weve already discussed aware of travins face tightening at having missed out on the preliminary account calmed by that rehearsal and buoyed by an official commendation lestov spoke virtually without stammering the hesitations appearing to be more pauses to move from one episode to another than an impediment it was only when the man had been speaking for several minutes that natalia remembered everyone but herself was hearing the yakutsk story in full for the first time and that what she was listening to amounted to the final preparation for her own performance her concentration was absolute upon her two attackers alert for anything and everything their absorption in turn was entirely upon the homicide officer ignoring her if they were that attentive anxious for something more maybe they had shown their full hand everything depended upon how she played hers the slightest miscalculation intruding too soon before the detective finished risked confusion which could deflect her counterattack but if she waited until lestov completely finished the danger was viskov or travin realizing the significance of the homicide detectives revelation and possibly outmaneuvering her before she outmaneuvered them or was there that danger she had heard itor almost all of itbefore been able to analyze iteven listened to charlie analyze it talked it through with him step by step as shed demanded he do no one would be able to respond as quickly as she was tensed to certainly not viskov or travin whose determination to topple her she was increasingly coming to thinkalthough still not complacentlyexceeded their conspiring ability the right momentthe most effective destructive momentwould be at the very end which again she could anticipate natalia pounced the moment it came everything weve heard totally justifies the commendation weve already agreed she declaredand from what weve heard it also justifies the lubyanka inquiry she looked directly at the deputy interior minister im personally sorry you dont seem to have agreed to its need she stopped invitingly come on she thought jump into the gaping hole once more there was confusion throughout the room nikulin said i think we all might benefit from a detailed explanation the presidents official was cautious natalia gauged ready to change sides i am afraid there was a regrettable misunderstandingone thats easily resolvedbetween myself and the archival staff at the lubyanka said natalia and i take full responsibility for that but i did not ask for the entire records of yakutskaya that would your memorandum travin tried to stop does not ask for that stopped natalia in turn read it more thoroughly than you appear to have done so far there was concerted movement as everyone except lestov went to their dossiers the homicide colonel looked curiously at her natalia smiled back her stomach was churning there can be no other conclusionespecially with your suggestions on how a necessary staff can be assembled and the work routines establishedthan that you intended every record to be withdrawn insisted viskov triumphantly my first instruction to my deputy yesterday asks forand i quotea daily summary as well as a detailed assessment of the total number of camps that existed around yakutsk and even more specifically for any that might have held particular prisoners thats true said nikulin thats what it quite clearly says the man was taking his escape with her decided natalia relieved if this was indeed a battle then nikulin was her reinforcement more than that nikulin was the man who had to award the victory laurel natalia hesitated she might be acquiring charlies deviousness but she wasnt sure she could manage his final themorme killer instinct yes she could natalia decided at once there was sashaalways sasha color began to suffuse viskovs face the memorandum is contradictory i dont consider it is refused natalia directly addressing the presidential chief of staff at worst the request to the archives istoo general it could have been resolved by a simple telephone call to me from either the deputy minister or my deputy my deputy could in fact have simply walked along our linking corridor neither chose to talk to me instead from the correspondence that has been exchanged today it would appear there has been a positive attempt to undermine my authority and by suspending what i had already initiated an investigation that has the presidents personal interest has been seriously delayed possibly even jeopardized natalia stopped pleased with her concluding reference to the president which had only come to her as she talked and identified her unquestionably with dmitri nikulin committed she accepted in the middle of the battlefield openly wielding her twoedged sword with no retreat there was a strange comparison between the two men she was confronting viskovs face bulged and purple outraged veins pumping in his forehead travin ashen in his awareness that he was indeed caught up in a war zone im not at all sure what this dispute is all about or how it involves me or my department complained mikhail suslov easing himself as far away as he could from the firing wonderful thought natalia you are one of the most involved she told the deputy foreign minister there was always the need to look for foreign prisoners in the yakutsk camps which is why i suggested it and why by proposing the staffing i did it could be completed as quickly as possible certainly not over a period of six months as has been ridiculously claimed youve just heard from colonel lestov that our forensic examination of the grave uncovered a western uniform button natalias pause was intentional concentrating their attention you also heard from colonel lestov that the buttons on the uniforms of both the dead english and american lieutenants were complete it was the newly confident lestov who finished for her which can only mean that there was another westerner present during the murders perhaps someone in or on his way to a nearby camp the man hesitated or actually involved with the murders the detectives statement shocked the room into total silence natalia sat happy for it to continue for the awareness fully to settleonly breaking it when she saw nikulin move to speak to viskov she demanded now do you still oppose the limited lubyanka search it wasnt properly explained protested viskov he was flustered now sweating a lost man almost there thought natalia i wasnt asked for an explanation it seemed more important to denigrate the proposal and me along with it which is astonishing considering the englishmans press conference remark about the obviousness of a connection with the area itself natalia paused once more hoping for a questioning interruption although she was prepared to bulldoze on but the question did come from nikulin you think hemaybe the american as wellknows there was a second westerner there at the time i havent been told yet by my deputy what has come from either the english or the americans said natalia looking demandingly at travin she knew charlie was withholding even an edited account until after this connived challenge what they hadnt anticipated was that it would come so soon and now natalia thought charlies eventual offering couldnt be as edited as hed intended there has not yet been any exchange said travin trapped when did you ask for something pressed natalia youll have logged your request of course i was waiting for the return of colonel lestov tried travin desperately there was another long silence which again natalia ended softvoiced in apparent disbelief she said theyve been back for two days travin looked fervently for help from viskov the deputy minister ignored him travin said i have been too busy following your other instructions but you havent rejected natalia louder now in outrage i initiated lubyanka nothing arrived until today she feigned the sudden awareness of suslov and the homicide detective before looking to nikulin i dont consider this is the time or place to continue this conversation but i do think it should be continued i totally agree said nikulin charlie was sitting with sasha on his lap watching her permitted thirty minutes of english language cartoon when natalia got back to lesnaya well he asked i won declared natalia but they know a second officer was there at the murder oh shit said charlie unthinking sasha said whats shit mean maybe i could have done better conceded novikov i hadnt expected everything to end like that so quickly i wasnt properly prepared he seemed a good man allowed marina did he promise to help he told me to call said the doctor fingering the pasteboard on the table between them when will you soon when this business with the womans body is settled polyakov realizes hes been outsmarted still might try something do you think the englishman believed you had more ill hint what it is when we talk hes definitely working to an agenda of his own complained peters his hair was too long for sea trips blowing disordered around his face hurriedly he pulled on a sailing cap it hardly matters boyce pointed out at the helm whatever he keeps back from your woman you get from me just as you get whatever our other departments contribute we cant be caught out only by the russians theyre not likely to do anything are they theyre an uncertainty and i dont like uncertainties their reaction would be intriguing if we used muffin as a diversion thats increasingly what im thinking it would have to be an obvious assassination of course of course your man ready whenever i blow the whistle lets give it a day or two theres no urgency but then make a sensation out of it fine how was moscow appalling said peters dirty uncomfortable and the ambassador served the most disgusting food ive ever eaten which i didnt hardly it was good of you to go said boyce repeating the earlier gratitude necessary particularly in view of events said peters have you ever seen muffin personally of course not said boyce surprised at the question peculiar man looks like a bum wont be any loss at all to your service charlie let natalia feed and bathe the stilldemanding sasha if its a silly word why did you say it needing the escape more than the time he still used the time though it was necessary to rethink reevaluate it had been stupid leaving the grave when he diddownright bloody stupid not a disastereasily recoverable in factbut that wasnt the point the point was getting everythinggetting it allthe first time and he hadnt which was more arrogance hurt pride than professional objectivity so what was professionally objective londons secrecy intentionperhaps washingtons toowas now at moscows mercy a major reassessment but more a diplomatic consideration than his at operational ground level what was there at his level vadim lestov hadnt told all to miriam so much for pubic power which wasnt an irrelevant reflection told him something about the russian detective had to keep it in mind what else get it all this time which he could and would so that wasnt the point either the primary considerationthe sole considerationwas whether natalia had been as successful as she obviouslybelieved herself to have been everything else for the moment was secondary she accepted the wine he had waiting when she emerged from the bedroom corridor and said i told sasha youd be along in a minute to say good night that like so much else was becoming a ritual he enjoyed of course i had to tell her what shit meant she still thought it was silly im sorry apologized charlie is what denebin found a major problem charlie poured himself a second malt and said not even one were going to think about yet first priorities first you natalia smiled knowing the preference might have been difficult the triumph rehearsed during the homeward drive he listened leaning forward from his encompassing chair looking into the glass cupped between both hands but not drinking the silence unsettled natalia whod expectedwantedas much excitement as much enthusiasm as she felt charlie didnt immediately speak even when natalia had obviously finished natalia waited becoming more unsettled finally charlie said the adjournment was limited to just you viskov and travin and nikulin natalia nodded lestov was called back at the end when nikulin announced he was to take over operational control but he wasnt officially appointed by title as your deputy pressed charlie nikulin talked about there having to be changes but there was nothing official no letting them sweat i suppose which of them do you think nikulin was talking about demanded charlie natalia allowed another pause travin primarily reducing his responsibility to the lubyanka documentation was total humiliation for him and viskov after the way they dismissed it and tried to use it charlie had hoped for more a dismissal even are there any arrangements for you to see nikulin again by yourself natalia shook her head once more ask for a meeting urged charlie it might have been too muchto hope that by itself it would have been enough to get viskov moved as well as travin but youve definitely got to get rid of travin totally he and viskov have been humiliated as well as caught out theyre a threat as long as theyre still together in the same building able to plot maybe more so than before after what happened today theyre fighting for their very existence now the final vestiges of natalias excitement seeped away charlies killer instinct she remembered so i havent won not yet seeing her need charlie said but you will thats what we decided didnt we how she asked despondently unsure using what weve got he said inadequately now tell me about the button from the western uniform its not like those on the uniforms the dead men were wearingnot the same metal and its definitely not from a russian uniform were there any special markings on it asked charlie urgently there was another possibility that actually fit the way the english lieutenants had been dressed there were two uniforms dress and battle dress i havent seen it yet i will of course i need a photograph insisted charlie he fell silent then he said i made a bad mistakea stupid mistakeleaving the grave too early dont like fucking up like that youd decided there was someone else reminded natalia trying to help he had acknowledged charliefrom the bullet as well as another persons military knowledge of the waistband label charlie said it was a possibility that had to be considered this is proof he straightened positively dismissing the selfrecrimination at the same time topping up both their glasses the immediate future was more important than the immediate past natalias survival was still the priority what was decided to do about a second english officer natalia made an uncertain gesture i used it as an accusation as part of the argument turned it against travin that he hadnt approached you or the american to get your findings your idea remember what about disclosing it i challenged denebin in yakutsk about everything else i saw him recover they know you went off before denebin found the buttonsthat you dont know that the american doesnt know either so it comes down to what youand sheofficially offer said natalia maybe not even then its a hell of an advantage for us the worst imaginable as far as youre concerned she hurriedly stopped the worst imaginable for britain i didnt mean you personally was there a differentiation wondered charlie there shouldnt be logically but logic had very little to do with getting out from under when the toilet was flushed and charlie had a longtime aversion to getting covered in little brown bits his was the name on everything even on television the identified person at the bottom of the toilet bowl charlie said but i know and by knowing i can avoid a mistake he paused any more mistakes he added refusing himself an escape i hope said natalia at once wishing that she hadnt charlie didnt pick up on the remark he said lestov with whom i always had to liaise anyway is effectively your deputy he was the obvious choice natalia pointed out suddenly to have introduced anyone else as an operational controllerapart from his need to be totally rebriefedwould have shown our internal problem lestov getting the job can be explained even if theres a need to explain as a promotion which he rightly deserved and which he must get by title insisted charlie he hadnt done enough to reassure her he decided he really wasnt used to worrying about people and protecting people other than himself it meant a further delay in talking to natalia about novikov too her involvement in that was the last thing that could be risked with viskov and travin still in place and working against her which you still havent told me how were going to achieve prompted natalia you are still going to get the camp archives before travin i insisted upon it confirmed natalia said i wanted personally to be sure that a search neither travin nor viskov judged important was carried out properly excellent exaggerated charlie it would have heaped further humiliation increasing their determination to hit back im waiting protested natalia i already think colonel vadim leonidovich lestov is a good policeman said charlie were going to make him better he paused again remembering miriams lunchtime phrase superman in fact and when the great discovery comes from gulag petr pavlovich travin is going to miss it what if there isnt anything to discover about camp argued natalia raising at last one of her nagging doubts we dont even know that the records of every camp have survived the reason to get novikov and whatever the man had to moscow as soon as possible thought charlie we do know there was a gulag for special prisoners yes agreed natalia doubtfully none of whom after fiftyfour years will still be alive today i wouldnt have thought so natalia further agreed all we need is a name i can invent an importance supposedly from an english source said charlie simply what if there isnt a surviving file pressed natalia relentlessly the three bodies were where a special camp once existed werent they coaxed charlie the information from englandfrom mewill still be that it was vital to trace a prisoner there the failure to locate the file will be travins wont it natalia shook her head sometimes you lose me charlie thats something im never going to do he said using her remark she started at the strident sound of the streetlevel bell so did charlie shit he thought i forgot to tell you he apologized i invited irena to supper why charlie demanded natalia seriously im not sure yet ill tell you if i find out he answered obscurely maybe its nothing youre not making sense trust me natalia wished charlie wouldnt keep asking her to do that irenas last flight had been to japan where there is a theme park dedicated to the cartoon character and sashas present was a thomas the tank tshirt complete with a smilingfaced railway engine printed on the front sasha who was still waiting for charlie insisted upon putting it on and announced she was going to sleep in it no refused charlie you can wear it tomorrow shit sasha challenged in english irena sniggered turning away charlie said i told you that was a silly word i dont want you saying it again why did you then to see whether you would be silly and repeat it said charlie desperately or whether you were a big girl so now we know youre silly like the word and you cant sleep in the tshirt i want mummy take it off and go to sleep sasha sat in bed with her arms tightly folded not moving glaring although not directly at him her lips were tightly together too irena said i dont think i want to talk to silly girls ill come back later sashas bottom lip didnt stay tight charlie was hot sweating a neverlost man completely lost it was unthinkableliterallyto slap her charlie said im waiting sasha said i want mummy charlie didnt turn at natalias arrival natalia said what has daddy told you to do hes not my daddy said the child he is and you do what he tells you said natalia take the shirt off sasha started to pull it over her head and to cry at the same time pointedly offering it to natalia who didnt reach for it charlie held out his hand and after a moments hesitation sasha gave it to him natalia kissed sasha and left charlie in the room with her charlie said do i get a kiss no said sasha her voice muffled in the pillow her body rigid this isnt much fun is it there was no reply charlie leaned forward kissing sashas turned away head he saidi am your daddy and i love you very much it was a whisper but he still heard her say shit before he got to the door the two sisters were waiting for him in the smaller lounge irena already with the whiskey natalia had poured for her irena said what was that all about growing up said charlie sasha and i together he still felt hot disoriented by something he hadnt known how to handle or control and wished hadnt happened how difficult was the rest of the evening going to be its a learning curve i guess suggested irena maybe ive got more to learn than sasha conceded charlie i certainly have simpered irena learning the man my sisters involved with is an international detective was a hell of a surprise she was wearing one of her second skin outfits a black catsuit that didnt show panty or bra ridges because she wasnt wearing either i thought you looked terrific on television i didnt said natalia she was serious subdued what sort of policeman are you persisted the younger woman a clerk dismissed charlie his script ready in outline at least he should have prepared natalia prepared himself better another stupid mistake too late now i just exchange information between london and here irena made a sweeping gesture around the apartment clerks dont live in palaces there are ways he smiled would this eventually qualify as another learning curve he hoped so irena regarded him curiously like what always useful having access to foreign currency now irena smiled although uncertainly natalia was looking at him in bewilderment mouth slightly open irena said you dont do you you should know how to turn dollars around the best use of any foreign currency in the financial mess this countrys in he refilled irenas empty glass natalia shook her head irritably against any more he left his drink as it was with forced indignation irena said i dont deal in foreign currency i dont believe you challenged charlie expansively youd bea fool not to with the chances youve got weve got it made people like you and me irena looked at her sister is he telling the truth i dont know what he does or what hes saying natalia said with a shrug angrily softvoiced arent you worried it was still a question addressed to natalia if its on a scale to support this place i suppose i should be natalia was looking intently at charlie seeking a lead irena went back to charlie you could be arrested you show me a moscow policeman you cant bribe demanded charlie most of them would sell their mothers for fifty dollars and im on the inside as a liaison officer whos going to go up against me irena shook her head in bemusement you are serious arent you you shocked no of course im not shocked and youre right i have sold a few dollars here and there of course you have said charlie its the system the way the world goes round the arbats best ive found a lot of conmen hunting tourists he looked at natalia what about that prime scotch steak i brought home natalia hesitated before moving off into the kitchen irena waited until her sister had gone before saying i knew you and i had a lot in common and i told you i was in love with natalia he said hoping she could hear from the kitchen so far so good but this wasnt the way he wanted the conversation to go but hed play this different sort of word game if he had to you dont seem to be worrying very much about her doing what youve just told me what about her position charlie felt the icy fingers run up his back all the heat of his previous discomfort gone why the hell hadnt he talked to natalia first i dont understand couldnt she get into trouble if there was a problem you couldnt bribe your way out of suggested the woman of course not said charlie with seeming carelessness flourishing the bottle between the two of them i told you theres nevergoing to be a problem so the question doesnt arise theres still another unanswered question from last time irena smiled you got your answer then wheres the danger in a little adventure in setting out on it he was glad to see natalia emerge from the kitchen time for him to manipulate the guidance he hadnt given her natalia said ready when you are charlie said irenas worried youll be fired if someone blows the whistle on what im doing natalias pause retrieving her wineglass was far too imperceptible for irena to notice although charlie readily saw it i dont see how it could affect me even if it did happen it was enough and charlie felt a sweep of relief thats what i told her you work for the government dont you you did when the woman stumbled to a halt briefly flustered pensions jeered natalia id get a medal for finding money where there hasnt been any to give out for months charlie couldnt believe that until that moment hed never known moscow and london used pensions for the same cover so many learning curves he said see nothing can happen to us im fed up with this conversation stopped natalia lets eat a completely sober charlie continued playing the genially tipsy host but dropped the bombast refusing to talk any further about imaginary illegal currency transactions or what his supposed job entailed switching the conversation instead on to irena she responded with air stewardess anecdotes some genuinely amusing leading easily into charlies demand about irenas love life to natalias stifffaced concentration on her food and to irenas insistence that she wasnt involved with anyone in particular still looking for someone who lives in a palace charlie walked irena to the streetlevel door which she ignored when he opened it i dont give up when ive set my mind to something youre going to have to this time well see do i get kissed good night no natalia hadnt moved from the table by the time charlie returned looking steadily at him she said well shes got a situation with richard cartright said charlie you would have thought shed have mentioned it wouldnt you i would have expected you to mention to me what the fuck you were doing another silly word he tried hopefully stop it charlie she refused not telling me was stupidridiculous i didnt want to rehearse you make it look too obvious but i should have said something i know irena arrived before i expected her shes not a nice person charlie she hesitated looking directly at him shes bound to talk to cartright about us isnt she so what said charlie forcing the glibness what if he tells london why on earth should he and what would there be to tell that im living with someone who works for the russian pension authority i thought this had been a good day said natalia now i dont not any longer i didnt do very well with sasha did i it was a point in the relationship waiting to happen i hope it doesnt again so do i said natalia although not referring to sasha and charlie shed call irena she decided call her and warn the bitch that there wasnt going to be a repetition of what had happened with konstantin which wasnt natalia doubting charlie it was her awareness of her sisters determination theres something important i want you to do said charlie natalia listened her face furrowed into a deep frown you want me to check if he officially saw anyone at our foreign ministry no just use the name peters to trace that of the other man the visa should give us a hotel shouldnt it miriam said hed gone i just want to make sure he has what could he be here for i dont know lied charlie when he arrived at morisa toreza at eight the following morning there were already two demands from sir rupert dean on charlies voice mail the directorgeneral said the name of your man is simon norrington he was the elder son thirtyone when he died of sir william norrington the younger brother matthew automatically inherited the title upon the death of his father and is still alive what was tried charlie but dean talked over him according to the family simon norrington graduated with a double first in fine art from oxford university in he was attached to the war office from as liaison with de gaulles free french forces he was seconded in to provost company a specialized unit officially part of the military police with the rank of lieutenant to provide the necessary authority for what he had to do which was tried charlie again listen insisted dean the family believes simon norrington died in april and is buried in a commonwealth military cemetery in berlin charlie sighed at the familiarity of a mountain of questions and a molehill of answer not knowing the base camp of either he hoped they wouldnt be too difficult to locate but the body at yakutsk was simon norrington definitely said the directorgeneral sir matthew personally identified it at the mortuary not from afterdeath photographs gave us wartime pictures of his brother in his uniform to satisfy ourselves so whos in the berlin grave weve no idea said dean we want to exhume it of courseweve got to get a court order but the war graves commission says sir matthew is still legally the recorded next of kin and wants his legally granted authority prior to a court application and the lawyers are arguing about applying for that in camera which weve got to do to prevent any news leak the media pressure is bad enough as it is god knows what it would be like if this became public what was simon norringtons job after the war office tracing nazi looted art announced dean mystery upon mystery or the very slightest clarification one step at a time thought charlie needing a lieutenants rank for the necessary authority seems that way one forty provost company was composed mostly of civilian police with an occasional secondment of foreign office people the police had the investigatory expertise norrington was the art expert how extensive is his war office record there isnt one what all this comes from the family this is bollocks i dont like the word but i agree the sentiment what i dont like is that we seem to be all on our own neither do i gulag housed special prisoners remembered charlie artists and art historians would qualify as intellectuals it was at least a fit of sorts it most definitely took that particular archive beyond guessedat importance initially more so perhaps for natalia than for himself does the family have any idea what norrington was supposed to be doing in berlin what he did anywhere in fact after no said dean it seems norrington was fanatical about art recoverywas determined to restore everything he could to its rightful owners but the family cant offer much more than that weve got a mystery twice as big as the one we already had with even less chance of solving it there wasnt the frustration there should have been charlie determined the secrecy intention he guessed have you met the american from washington names peters kenton peters filled out dean im supposed to be seeing him either today or tomorrow depending on developments i gather from the foreign office you werent helpful i didnt think i was supposed to be said charlie pleased with the character assessment what about the other one what other one there was someone else with peters in moscow i didnt get a name i dont know anything about another man and im glad you didnt offer too much the decisions already been taken that their man is a hero whatever he was doing or had done said charlie they wont want anything to spoil the story i know what they want said the other man testily charlie didnt like the idea of manipulating sir rupert dean the first of a very long line of directorsgeneral not to look upon him as if hed crawled out of a primeval swamp but it was for both their eventual benefits although perhaps more for his than the directorgenerals because charlie was getting a very distinct impression that he was personally being very badly jerked around his feet ached which was always a sign and a very important charlie muffin rule was always to be the manipulator not the manipulated as far as the directorgeneral was concerned it was more persuading the man to be receptive to alternative reasoning seems pretty close to our thinking not ours yours mentally adjusted charlie who hated prearranged plans or decisions that all too often in the past had rebounded dangerously close to his crotch and this case had every hallmark of being the biggest ballbreaker ever which is why im being included in the foreign office discussions said dean coordinated intention everyone who might conceivably know something saying nothing about anything one of those anonymous whitehall gatherings playing verbal passtheparcel guessed charlie he very definitely didnt wantnor intendto be the parcel so our position hasnt changed at the moment our position is confused not just by a gap of fifty years qualified dean sir matthew has agreed not to make anypublic announcement but naturally he wants to bury his brother properly theres a family vault the norringtons are a prominent dynasty sir matthew got to be a permanent secretary to the treasury in the sixties and early seventies left early for the city on a bank of england committee for a while before being seconded to the imf in washington came back to directorships of quite a few major companies stately home in hampshire married three times with a penchant for actresses which makes him a favorite with the media he also gets a lot of coverage for opposing britains entry into the european monetary union the press will have a field day if it all gets out and theyre already crucifying us how likely do you think it is that as well as being useful for his art knowledge simon norrington might have worked for military intelligence or soe or mi ive already made the list charlie and the inquiries and then theres the ministry of defense who took over the war office none of which are acknowledging anything but all of which seem hugely interested in what were doing i know repeated dean theres something you dont yet know from here said charlie preparing the directorgeneral for the disclosure he couldnt at the moment openly make because he wasnt supposed to know it im pretty sure the russians believe like i do that there was another westerner at the murder not based solely on a bullet caliber rejected dean there could be something else i didnt see dont know about what makes you think that demanded dean their man lestov is back from yakutsk weve already spoken on the telephone lied charlie easily he said he expected the breakthrough to come from england there has to be a reason for his saying that cut in dean charlies pause had been intentional inviting the interruption of course there has thats why i suspect theres something i dont know about and wont unless i offer something in exchange ive just told you theres more reason than ever to keep everything under wraps charlie was disappointed although sir rupert had sounded halfheartedabout it if you dont first succeed try try again charlie told himself are the americans going to be told who our victim was ill listen to what they have to say first a sudden awareness of what berlin could mean swept over charlie so encompassing that for a few moments he couldnt totally absorb it when he did he decided at once it made as much logicmore perhapsas anything else so far but it was completely unsubstantiatednothing more than the wildest speculationand most definitely nothing he could suggest to the already distracted directorgeneral from whom he still needed to extract far more than he had so far he couldnt afford to be sidetracked from the primary consideration of selfprotection which from now on always had to go beyond self to include natalia and sasha quickly charlie went on miriam bell saw the waistband label expects an identification from it and their victim carried a photograph i didnt see her find either apparently it was taken with a girl against a background it might be possible to identify a big building charlie rememberedas likely to be a museum or an art gallery as a college whatever he did or knew he was in uniform for a very special reason miriams words there was the vague outline of a hidden picture beginning to form thought charlie enjoying the pun still wrong to be sidetracked although he was impatient now to think solely about his sudden theory she seems to have been remarkably forthcoming queried dean what did you tell her charlie frowned im trying to give some idea of what the americans haveso youll know how honest theyre being when you meet you already know i didnt give anything back point taken apologized dean getting there charlie thought hopefully if sir matthew norrington is a media figure theres the danger of this leaking you reminded me about the media and im sure the russians have something i dont charlie stopped the directorgeneral i hear what youre saying understand it too therell be no way to trace a leak protested charlie dont let it be traced to you from anything you might say tothe americans or the russians insisted dean not a millimeter too far charlie one slip and to preserve this department ill push you the rest of the way that clear very accepted charlie he shouldnt he supposed be offended at the bluntness indeed he supposed he should appreciate it at least this directorgeneral was honest enough to tell him he was the first and prepared sacrifice others hadnt and he had the leeway he wanted you have anything else to talk to me about asked dean are there any details of how the berlin body was identified as that of simon norrington pressed charlie it was a safe enough question without giving any hint of how his mind was working not yet have we asked for it weve asked for everything determined to leave the other mans perception as he wanted it charlie said the body itselfparticularly a recognizable facewould have suffered serious injury so it could only have been from personal belongings which would have been returned to the family could we ask sir matthew what they were maybe you should ask him yourself suggested the other man what asked charlie sharply im restricting the number of people who know all of whats going on disclosed the other man youre one of the fewcertainly the only fully operational officer i want you to handle it all from now on here germany america wherever understood yes sir accepted charlie keeping the reluctance from his voice very much the trussed and offered sacrifice he thought he couldntwouldntleave natalia alone in moscow at this stage of her ministry conflict norequally to protect her to continue his life with her and sashacould he afford to let anyone else get ahead of him and risk his very future in russia time to start using charlie muffin rules which allowed eyegouging and crotchcrunching allowed every dirty trick ever invented in fact providing he inflicted the damage first the temptation to be sidetracked now by the thought of following the investigation outside russia was greater than ever but charlieforced the concentration totally upon the idea that had so abruptly occurred to him and the more charlie thoughtputting up and then knocking down the counterargumentsthe more he became convinced that what had been taken from the yakutsk bodies had not been stolen to prevent identification it had been to provide it on the wrong bodies which created practically a mountain range of new questions this time without even the suggestion of a molehill where were the answers to start building one if he was right then there had to be one possibly two bodies in berlin cemeteries carrying the identification of the other two yakutsk victims theyd died together so their substitutes would have at least to be buried close to each other to account for their deaths from which it followed that the yakutsk murders were not panicked spurofthemoment killings but the complete reverse assassinations so carefully planned they amounted to a very positive and until now successful conspiracy neither had it been quick expediency to make a grave almost two meters deep by using grenades whoever had done that were local with local knowledge that the tundra never melted to a depth of two meters which it hadnt for more than fifty years until the onset of el nino the logic continued that the local killers had never expectedand certainly never intendedthe three victims to be found if theyd anticipated that possibility every identification would have been removed possibly even the uniforms the key had to be gulag charlie determined to open the door to what norringtons function was to trace art looted by the nazis about which he was fanatical were the special tweezers and magnifying glass that the sightimpaired american carried sufficient to suggest he was an art specialist too they were for the moment as far as charlie was concerned what about the woman a specialist or an official escort an unanswerable question for the time being along with so many others charlie stretched back in his chair unconsciously fashioning another deltawinged paper plane from whator wherewould come the proof an indication that his supposition was at least worth considering the most obvious would be finding bodies buried in berlinin the names of the stillunknown american and russian a culdesac charlie recognized if either identity was uncoveredand shared after thatit would be from washington or moscow not from any source available to him or was there a source norrington most definitely should not have been in yakutsk but for the man supposed to have been norrington to be buried in berlin surely proved the man should officially have been in the german capital so in early there would have been a proper filed in triplicate or however many copies army bureaucracy required order stating why he was there but hopefullyand at the moment more importantlywho he might have been with if norrington had been able covertly to go at least three thousand miles possibly more from where he was supposed to be someone in berlin had approved and known about it the american was germanbased too charlie accepted remembering the warscript dmarks among the dead mans belongings awareness piling upon awareness charlie recognized where he had to look not just for the american identitymaybe even the russian womans toobut for the second british officer whod been at the yakutsk murder but would anything still be in berlin he hoped he had an advantage in the amount of time hed spent and worked in the city over the cold war years when sometimes hed started out with less than he had now charlie stirred positively with things to do becoming fully aware of the absentmindedly constructed airplane he launched it as he stood it spun immediately into an arc and fell flat on its back charlie hoped it wasnt an augury the archives of the british embassy in moscow are part of its basement which have been tanked with two insulationseparated brick walls to prevent the incipient dampness of the moskva river from mildewing the documents stored there ahead of their eventual transfer to london in addition humidifiers are kept constantly running the artificial light the only source is harsh despite the brightness the curator a diminutive quickly moving man with spectacles pushed up into disordered hair blinked a lot like a furtive animal accustomed to living permanently underground the man whom charlie had not met before pedantically insisted upon telephoning personnel to check charlies authorization appearingdisappointed when it was confirmed he recovered the moment charlie asked for any records of a lieutenant simon norrington having been at the embassy in early dont have to look said the man cheerfully already have for colonel gallaway we dont have anything when asked charlie yesterday said the archivist told mr mcdowell and mr cartright this morning when they inquired this man norrington must have done something pretty unusual he did said charlie he died where he shouldnt have and ended up in the wrong grave cartright was standing in the corridor outside charlies office when charlie returned because there wasnt enough room with mcdowell and gallaway already inside both men were staring down at the paper plane charlie said pilot error that day they used mcdowells office which was larger than the military attaches the head of chancellery accorded charlie the padded leather chair ordered coffee and dolefully said seems like were all getting involved in this affair i thought we already were said charlie studying each of them in turn over the rim of his coffee cup mcdowell was an apprehensive firsttour diplomat frightened of any mistake up to and including breaking wind at the ambassadors cocktail party foreign office instructions would be holy writ never to be queried and certainly never modified by any personal initiative charlie had already judged gallaway a military dinosaur mistakenly laid to rest in moscow which the defense ministry was now probably regretting but which could very definitely be to his advantage the only uncertainty was cartright about whom he knew practically nothing but about whom he was most personally curious because of whatever was happening with irena professionally charlie was sure he could suck up the younger man and blow him out in bubbles and wondered if hed have to as he was sure he could the other two to begin with the use of each would be to relay back to their individual departments whatever he wanted circulated to mislead and confuse and to make them responsible for everything and anything he considered personallyor professionally dangerous the day was beginning to pick up very well indeed with luck it could even get better i dont want to repeat myself encouraged charlie easily so itll help if i know what between you youve already got from london the other three men looked among themselves mcdowell said i was simply asked what the embassy here had on an army officer named simon norrington the other two nodded in agreement without any reason questioned charlie just that he was the man in the grave said cartright but that hes supposed to be buried in berlin added gallaway wrong decided charlie in belated realization cartright was mi which was responsible to the foreign office so why the duplication to the head of chancellery mcdowell was a professional diplomat and professional diplomats were always separated from each and every sort of intelligence field activity to avoid embarrassment the molehill was taking shape returning to an earlier possibly more immediately relevant thought charlie said to the military attache now weve got a name your people should be able to find norringtons service record easily enough im not sure that they can said gallaway it was a long time ago how far could he take this wondered charlie as far as possible he decided they going to let you have it if its found it could be useful for me more than any of you he thought why demanded gallaway a soldier checking the barricades the russians are more convinced than me that there was another british officer there when norrington was killed within twentyfour hours that would become established as a positive fact within every necessary whitehall department its source lost in the retelling oh my god said gallaway thats appalling said mcdowell still not sufficient reason for mcdowell and cartright to double up charlie decided concentrating upon the attache he said youre in the hot seat john ill do all i can to help obviously but i do need everything you might get from your end and let me warn you john whitehall never makes a mistake its always down to us poorbastards on the ground weve got to look after ourselves every time he looked to cartright wouldnt you say that absolutely said the intelligence officer at once extending his hands palms up to include all three men charlie said for each of us to look after the other youll have to pass on all the guidance you get from london so im not caught out with the russians everyone prepared to go along with that i certainly am said gallaway eagerly me too accepted mcdowell cartwright said its strictly between us and these four walls right what had he done to please god so much this day thought charlie thats most important none of you must show me to be your source i wont tell you anything that im not a hundred percent sure about thank you said cartright you wont if i decide youre trying to find out things about natalia and i that dont concern you thought charlie charlie went as far as to suggest a records check on the wartime prison camps at yakutsk which vadim lestov agreed was worth considering instead of disclosing it was already under way and charlie openly wondered how a westerncaliber bullet had come to be in the yakutsk grave to lestovs shrugged insistence he had no idea charlie spent most of the time urging lestov to release the photograph of the dead russian woman which hed discussed at length with natalia as a possible way of confirming lestovs appointment as her deputy even if it achieved nothing the publicity was guaranteed to convey the impression that the russian was making a positive contribution charlie also provided his written impression of the yakutsk inquiry with only the waistband label omitted miriam only left out her discovery of the photograph and the fact that the dead americans eyesight would have normally failed him for military service in apparent exchange the russian handed over copies of the second autopsy report virtually identical to that of the first and announced that a photograph of the solongdead woman was being issued to moscow television and newspapers in the hope of an identification they hadnt before met in the deputy directors suite on the same floor as natalias whose closed door charlie had seen on arrival only slightly smaller than viskovs the room was ornately baroque and at least five times the size of charlies the homicide colonel hadnt yet adjusted to such surroundings actually on more than one occasion gazing around as if surprised to find himself there which charlie supposed he was when charlie asked directly about petr pavlovich travin the russian detective said the man was otherwise engaged which charlie acknowledged to be an absolutely honest reply miriam again suggested a drink as they left the ministry building and this time charlie insisted upon the savoy he still hadnt resolved the uncertainty of how much to tell the american of what had nagged him throughout the meeting simon norringtons identity would be known by at least three different officials from three separate whitehall departments at the foreign office meeting with kenton peters he reminded himself and miriam was his only possible moscow source for the dead americans name those who gave received he told himself miriam said you think travins working on something good could be said charlie jesus maybe youll have to try your very personal way to find out from lestov already in hand said the woman quite seriously and unembarrassed you were far more open with him than i expected you to be not really said charlie finally deciding miriam was gesturing for the second round she turned sharply back to charlie what heard from washington on the picture miriam shook her head but didnt speak itll have been taken outside an art gallery or museum he said go on charlie did telling her about simon norrington leaving out only the reference to berlin miriam finished her second drink before speaking and by then any astonishment had gone solemnly slowly she said you think were ever going to understand it all i dont know admitted charlie ill tell you what i do know said miriam positively something as complicated as this therell be a lot of people very anxious that we dont which is why ive thrown the stone into your pool to see how far the ripples spread thought charlie had natalias visa check not shown that kenton peterss companion whose name was given as henry packer was still in moscow staying at the national hotel charlie conceded he might just have missed the mans toohurried attentionattracting move from the table of the hotels pavement cafe although he preferred to think hed have still gotten it as it was he didnt hurry helping miriam into her car and then strolling along ohotnyj rjad to the metro over almost too long experience charlie knew just how much of a surveillance nightmare the lofty pillared and marbled halls of the moscow underground could be but today they were to his advantage within seconds of pulling himself behind one of the pillars charlie saw the openeyed packer fluster down the steps looking wildly around and chance getting on the train already at the platform which would in fact take him in the opposite direction in which charlie would normally have gone charlie went back up the stairs and into the savoy bar again with things to think about he told you that he speculated in currency demanded cartright in the darkness boasted about it said irena hed been very good the best for a long time the apartment was a disappointment though compared to lesnaya what about natalia something to do with pensions dismissed the woman she hesitated youre not going to tell anyone about charlie are you not to get him into trouble i mean not something i want to get involved in avoided cartright which was an honest answer hed taken a big enough risk agreeing in the first place to help gerald williams without fully understanding a reason now he was dependent upon charlies guidance and wasnt sure he could risk that either it was a mess irena was sure cartright would which would teach the blabbermouthedcharlieand natalia with her warning telephone callsnot to treat her like shit the most appropriate word she decided smiling at the memory of the episode with sasha charlie and natalia were still up in their apartment on the far side of moscow natalia said you will have to go everywhere else wont you leave us not until i cant any longer avoid it promised charlie dean said todays meeting ended as confused as it began no one telling anyone else what their part of the story was what are you going to do charlie what ive always done look after myself look after yourself challenged natalia us corrected charlie a man with staring blue eyes came immediately to mind the most worrying thing about henry packer was the ineptness of the surveillance to someone of charlies professionalism it was further proof that it was not the mans real job charlie no longer had any doubt what that was if it all does go wrongand youre dumped because of ititll all be over for us here wont it but it wouldnt be the end of the world qualified charlie no agreed natalia it would just seem like it its only been days protested charlie urgently the telephone had been ringing as hed entered his office that morning afternoon in yakutsk he calculated i have something about gulag said novikov i could arrange for you to come to moscow by yourself even that would be a risk charlie accepted only with marina and the boys and with the residency permits im doing everything i can said charlie make it soon as soon as i can the release of the russian victims photograph caused a continuing series of sensations far greater than charlie had anticipated although it made perfect something else he had in mind he hadnt really expected an identification either which was the ultimate phenomenon the predictable excitement from the existing press hysteria was the publication itself despite the written and verbal insistences that all three bodies had been preserved in their ice grave the first visual proof of just how perfect that preservation had been caused shock not just in moscow but throughout the west the new york times captionas if she died just hours not half a century agowas echoed in hundreds of newspapers and on television throughout the world it also brought about an unremitting media clamor for photographs of the british and american lieutenants as well as for charlie and miriam bell publicly to be again made available for interviews the fbis inept reason for refusingthat photographic publication or a press conference could possibly interfere with ongoing inquiriesbrought an even greater clamor to know what those inquiries were and within twentyfour hours newspapers in america and europe were speculating with ironic accuracy at a coverup encouraged by the american presidents already declared insistence that the american was a hero to be given a heros burial the freereined theorizing spiraled into total fantasy up to and includingdisregarding both the history of the time and the fact that yakutsk is three thousand miles from moscowthat it had been a mission to assassinate stalin to end communism prevent the division of europe and stop the cold war before it began germany and franceand charliepreferred the suggestion that it had been a joint operation to rescue princess anastasia from imprisonment in one of the yakutskaya gulags after escaping the ekaterinburg slaughter of the imperial russianfamily in april claimed former gulag inmates recounted stories of a beautiful woman with black hair to her waist living in moonscaped isolation in her own crenellated barbedwireenclosed dacha guarded by watch towers and an elite cossack troop brighton beach on new jerseys atlantic coast is a ghetto of russian emigres although demographically the majority are ukrainian by birth or ancestry they also represent the broad spectrum of russian mafia in the united states it was from the beachthe waterfront avenue itselfthat the first claim came from a man insisting the victim was his mothers sister with whom theyd lost contact after leaving her the custodian of priceless heirlooms including a selection of icons for which he now sought reward or compensation from the russian government the virtually immediate fbi location of a threepage rap sheet for fraud criminal deception and larceny didnt prevent a day of headlines in the nearby new york newspapers there were three similar deception attempts in moscow two of which drew heavily upon the anastasia invention the third stretching it with the assertion that the victim was the secret daughter of rasputin each demanded money always in dollars for their stories and family photographs all of which were faded and blurred and none anything like the dead woman even before scientific examination charlie made his own very personal contribution to the media frenzy on the third day deciding it might be physically dangerous to delay any longer although he hadnt again picked up henry packer despite walking far more than he normally did and always going through a series of cutout detours to get back to lesnaya pointless though that belated caution might be on the morning of that third day he got to his office early wanting packer still to be at the national hotel the series of quickly dialed and even more quickly disconnected telephone calls only took thirty minutes and packer was actually breakfasting in the hotel dining room when the anonymously alerted moscowbased international press corps descended en masse such was packers reaction and the momentum of the yakutsk mystery so selfperpetuating that the entireand continuingconfrontation ran on television almost in its entirety during the course of the day and what was cut was easily filled in from the blazonednewspaper headlines and charlies various conversations with miriam and natalia the dining room corner into which packer had protectively placed himself became instead a trap from which he couldnt escape through the solid pack of journalists and cameras and most of the television footage actually showed him wide eyed like an animal in a snare charlies calls had identified packer as an american state department official on a secret mission to moscow personally to explain to the russian president the mystery of yakutsk packer visibly cowered under the welter of questions at first doing nothing but shake his head when he did speakin a surprisingly highpitched new england voicehe appeared to confirm the suggestion in his panic he babbled about speaking with washington too late remembering his pipeline engineer cover which fell apart when he said he couldnt remember the russian company hed come to moscow to see when his panic worsened he tried to force his way through the wall of people confronting him and when they wouldnt move lashed out physically trying to fight his way through at first that was panicked but when he was shoved in return he openly tried to catch one thrusting reporter with an upward blow to the chin with the heel of his hand which if it had connectedwhich it didnt because of the madhouse scenewould have snapped the mans neck he chopped and jabbed several more times very professionally but again because of the jostling just one cameraman was hurt a rib broken because the knuckled punch again missed the fatal heart spot at least six reporters and cameramen went down with packer when he fell struggling and he was gouging his way out of the melee when the militia arrived at the police station according to newspapers and later confirmed by miriam packer first claimed diplomatic immunity which immediately involved the embassy and then claimed he was the victim of assault miriam told charlie it took less than an hour for the state department in washington to disclaim any knowledge of the man and insist he in no way qualified for any immunity it was midafternoon according to natalia before vadim lestov got to militia post to question packer about yakutsk fully recovered the man insisted he knew nothing whatsoever about the television and newspaper stories running by then nor why theyshould have imagined he did just as doggedly he maintained hed come speculatively to moscow as a pipeline engineer but had not yet been able to make contact with any oil exploration companies he now demanded to leave the country immediately the colonel in charge of militia post consulted with the foreign ministry after a junior counselor from the american embassy talked of an irritating diplomatic incident and packers visa was revoked packers luggage being collected from the national hotel by a second counselor who also paid the mans bill would have been clue enough for the waiting press pack even without the telephone calls from militia post police on the media payroll packer arrived at sheremetyevo airport in an embassy car to another press ambush which provided more footage of packer fleeing across the concourse knocking two people over as he ran it was when charlie was assuring miriam that evening he had no idea how the press had discovered packers presencereminding her shed told him the man had returned with kenton petersthat he learned of washingtons disavowal the goddamned embassys in an uproar the ambassador didnt know what to do charlie guessed it had been a badly conceived independent cia operation which was the explanation he later put to natalia when he put the suggestion to sir rupert dean the directorgeneral said you really think so you saw the way he fought on television and he definitely had you under surveillance definitely insisted charlie i think it should be officially logged so do i and it will be and ill ask washington for an explanation through the foreign office itll all be denials and claims of misunderstanding of course there was a pause you think youve removed the danger the publicity will have frightened peters i hope thought charlie wonder how the moscow press got on to him no idea said charlie the confirmed recognition of the woman in the yakutsk grave came on the fourth day after the publication of her photograph and literallyrelegated the henry packer fiasco to a oneday wonder the identification came from a man who walked into the offices of the englishlanguage moscow news which with admirable journalistic initiative obtained what they believed to be everything it was conceivably possible to get from fyodor ivanovich belous before contacting either their local militia station or the interior ministry and in addition to what belous had to tell which upon analysis was quite meager the welldocumented background ensured a story that within a further twentyfour hours brought the announcement of movie intentions from a leading hollywood studio one of the photographs belous produced of his mother raisa even appeared to show her in the same white shirt dark jacket and skirt she had been wearing when her body had been found belouss story was of never having known either his father or mother his entire knowledge of them had come from his nowdead maternal grandparents who had brought him up in moscow where he had lived his entire life mostly as a clerk in the central division office of the communist party and latterly as a bookkeeper at the moskva hotel his father ivan had died in just days before the end of the germans ninehundredday siege of leningrad his mother had fled unaware of being pregnant one week before the siege began in september she had worked in the curators department at tsarskoe selo the tsars village of five spectacular palaces established on the outskirts of st petersburg by its founder peter the great raisa belouss particular responsibility had been the palace of catherine the great it had been her job to organize the rescue convoy to moscow of as much of the catherine palace treasure as she could in advance of the nazi army and its einsatzstab reichsleiter rosenberg fur die besetzten gebiete named after alfred rosenberg who in had been personally appointed by hitler to confiscate loot or steal every work of art from nazioccupied territory for the worlds most complete museum hitler planned for his linz birthplace it was a matter of historical record that the catherine palace had housed one of the worlds greatest but now lost art treasures the amber room presented to peter the great in by the prussian warriorking friedrich wilhelm and that hitler had personally orderedthat the twentyone honeyyellow amber panels four goldframed with jeweled landscapes picked out in florentine mosaic the others carved in flower and fruit motif should be restored to their original splendor in east prussias konigsberg castle in what he intended to be his personal study according to belouss grandparents his mothers greatest regret had been her failure to strip the threehundredyearold amber from the catherine palace walls to prevent it from falling into the hands of the nazi err looters as it was for what she had saved raisa belous was made a hero of the soviet union by stalin it was to let as many people knownot just in moscow but in the westthat his mother had been such a heroine that he had approached an englishlanguage publication as well as the photograph of his mother dressed in what she had been found in the yakutsk grave belous produced four others one of her standing in the middle of the amber room showing it in the dazzling glory that earned it a nineteenth century british ambassadors description as the eighth wonder of the world there was also the official notification of his mothers death which he now didnt understand and wanted explained it was recorded as having occurred in berlin in early april raisa belous had died according to the notice in an antipersonnel mine explosion which will have caused severe facial injuries predicted charlie during one of the twicedaily telephone conversations he maintained with london i think you should come out of moscow pick up things here said sir rupert dean i want to speak to belous myself avoided charlie and theres gulag the inmate register of which building up the impression of a momentum landed on natalias desk the following day it was one of a batch of ten all former camps in the immediate vicinity of yakutsk itself and was one of the few to have been divided between male and female prisoners the batch brought to fiftythree the number through which petr pavlovich travin was supervising the searchalready extended since the emergence of fyodor belousfor anyone whose history hinted german english or american connections or art or antique links the gulag records were among the largest and certainly the most complete so far delivered the main dossier running to three hundred pages annexed to which were the personal files of what from the dates appeared to be the last inmates sentenced before the camps destruction only the names remained in faded sepiabrown ink of the original thirty artists writers and teachers who with little more than their frostbitten hands had built the original camp in five were registered as having died during the construction against the names of alland the majority who had followed in the subsequent nineteen and a half yearswere listed unspecified crimes against the state fifteen years appeared to be the minimum sentence thirty the maximum hard labor within the dozens of mines was mandatory without exception permanent exile followed every jail sentence charlie and natalia had exhaustively researched the discovery the year of the coins found on norrington and the april dates for the berlin burial provided a yearlong time frame for natalia to work within from that period she gleaned the names of fiftyfive men and thirtyseven women whose recordsspanning a range of art art history and academic professorshipsuggested people or occupations that might have been sufficient to lure the three murder victims to yakutsk among the men were fifteen whose names and details identified them as german there were no personal records for any of those fifteen nor any reason for their imprisonment each was simply described as being of special category twelve were marked as having died before the closure of the camp the location to which the other three had been transferred was not given following the stepbystep preparation she had gone through with charlie natalia delayed sending the gulag dossier to the man who was still her official deputy needing to copy what she considered relevant sections with the rest she sent a note duplicated to everyone involved reminding him the concentration upon anyone with fine art or antique expertise was now even more important in view of raisa belouss history because it was also a connected part of the necessary further undermining of viktor romanovich viskov and petr pavlovich travin she ambiguously worded her agreement tolestov sharing with the british and american investigators that afternoons interview with fyodor belous as if it were the homicide colonels idea rather than hers curious if charlie would again be proved right he was to viskovs anticipated withinthehour objection copied to the same circulation list to which she had also sent hers was attached the minutes of their very first coordinating meeting at which dmitri nikulin had specifically forbidden such cooperation viskovs memo demanded an explanation for her disregarding the instruction of the presidential aide natalias rebuttal was even quicker than viskovs to her shed had it already prepared complete with her marked version of the same initial meeting dmitri borisovich nikulin had also specifically ordered that everything should be done to discover the undisclosed progress of the two western investigators which they might be able to estimate by carefully monitoring a shared interview with someone whose story was already public knowledge unable to prevent the bubble of uncertainty natalia wrote that she regarded the intervention of the deputy interior minister even more counterproductive than his brief cancellation of the gulag search as the authority of dmitri borisovich had been invoked in both their exchanges she was of course prepared to defer to his judgment but unless she heard from the presidents chief of staff she intended the shared encounter with belous to go ahead as planned no intervention came from nikulin charlies invitation to the interior ministry personally telephoned by lestov was the prearranged signal that natalia had won another battle it would not be difficult for him seemingly to let something slip apparently to show lestov to be making all the right moves charlie wondered if out of it all hed be able to extract a little in return he expected to because he hadnt wasted the intervening personally unproductive days hed read quite a lot about specific war history charlie muffin was a diligent reader of body language too and believed there was initially a lot to be learned in the first few nearwordless moments of the encounter with vadim lestov charliesimmediate impression was of the russian colonel himself charlie knew from natalia there had been further recognition from dmitri nikulin for lestov achieving an identification by releasing raisa belouss photograph the change in lestov was practically visible as if he had grown in stature filling out becoming taller there was nothing left of the earlier closetooverwhelmed reserve in the official surroundings of the ministry instead there was a smiled greeting without any stammer and teaalthough no vodkaand the easy acceptance of charlies congratulation at the quick discovery of raisa belous without any acknowledgment that the picturerelease idea had been charlies the russian even wore a newer suit that didnt shine with wear at the elbows fyodor ivanovich belouss did the striped jacket had once been part of a longagodivided suit and the gray trousers were bagged and shapeless but here again there was no awkwardness and remembering the moscow news details of the mans communist party past charlie guessed the confidence lingered from belous once having been partalbeit a very small cogof the ruling machine the handshake was firm the eye contact direct through rimless spectacles when lestov complained mildly at belous telling his story first to a media outlet belous at once said hed explained his reason for doing that in the article and charlie further guessed the mans imperiousness would have exceeded his position in a mourned regime belous would clearly have welcomed back charlie also suspected belouss going to a newspaper had as much to do with a personal protest against the supposed and resented new order as it did with establishing his unknown mothers reputation there was a stenographer at a side table and lestov carefully took the man through what at the first telling was virtually a repetition of his newspaper account belous also produced the originals of his nowmuchcopied souvenir photographs along with raisa belouss award citation thats all i can tell you concluded the man lets see said lestov the homicide colonels questioning was thorough although unimaginative and charlie decided the man would make an excellent support deputy for natalia the lateral thinking might come with timeand encouragement belous was discomfited conceding that his mothers personal belongings had been disposed of after her deathrefusing to use the word sold when lestov talked of jewelry and the hero medal itselfand insisted he didnt know what his grandparents might have done with any letters or documents apart from the medal certificate certainly nothing had survived belous couldnt remember any discussion ever about his maternal grandparents and had always assumed theyd died before he was born where did your fathers parents tell you she was buried demanded lestov they didnt i mean they didnt know they said thered just been a notification that shed been killed where persisted the russian detective i dont know that either they never said charlie deferred to miriam when lestov invited them to join the questioning as always wanting the benefit of everyone elses input before making his own and was disappointed even wondering if miriam was using the same ploy to hold back for his contribution before making hers charlie took his time actually repeating some of lestovs questions hopefully to lessen the slightest edge of resistance he detected in belouss response to the american your grandparents were extremely proud of your mother he asked edging toward his own agenda rightfully so said belous he had wispy receding hair and the pallor of a permanent indoor worker indeed agreed charlie wondering at the defensiveness but they were your fathers parents belous frowned so did lestov questioningly belous said yes werent they proud of a son who died in one of the most heroic episodes of the great patriotic war of course they were replied belous indignantly none of your photographs show him with your mother the newspaper appeal was for information about her not him so you do have photographs of them together not now what happened to them i dont know my grandparents showed me some when they were telling me about my parents i dont know what happened to them after my grandparents died what were they photographs of demanded miriam their wedding when was that june how many were there charlie bustled in he didnt believe parents would dispose of photographs of their son but keep those of their daughterinlaw four i think doing what the man shrugged they were wearing the same clothes in each so i guess they were all taken at the same time there was one i remember showing them relaxing nothing in the background it was dated june the other two showed the catherine palace behind them so it had to be tsarskoe selo where they worked they worked seized charlie you hadnt told us that what did your father do belous flushed he was the senior restorer at the palace thats how they met when my mother joined the curators staff the man shifted uncomfortably charlies feet gave a psychosomatic twinge a usual body and mind indicator that he was going in the right direction even if he didnt know what the destination might be lestov and miriam sat unmoving waiting as if they expected to learn something too cautiously charlie said i think we might have gone too quickly over what you told the moscow news and us earlier id like to make sure ive got everything right your mother and father worked together at tsarskoe selo until the german invasion in your mother escaped rescuing a substantial amount of the catherine palace treasures and your father stayed behind and died just before the siege lifted in no said belous shifting again the paper got that wrong made it a better story i suppose my father was drafted into the army long before the invasion he left st petersburgor leningrad as it then wasalmost immediately after he and my mother marriedaccording to my grandparents they got married because he was being moved so where did your father die came in miriam again they were never quite sure my mother never showed them the official notice they thought it was somewhere near the polish border lvov in the ukraine or on the other side near lublin you told us your grandparents virtually brought you up by themselves after your mother came to moscow probed charlie hoping miriam wouldnt interrupt again too quickly i believe so i cant remember my mother not ever having been with you no what age would you have been when they told you about her and your father im not sure seven eight ninesomething around that age is that when you saw the photographs of your mother and father together that would have been the first time i suppose yes charlie was intrigued at the mans apparent selective memory this was turning out to be a far different encounter than hed imagined they were proud of her talked about her a lot yes belous relaxed slightly when they told you about her for the first time did they tell you she was away a lot charlie was aware of the other man relaxing further so what had made him tense she had an important job they said doing what demanded lestov they never told me you dont have any photographs of your mother in any sort of uniform belous was lying charlie knew to have told her bereaved son what his mother had done would have been the first thing proud grandparents would have done no what about your father any photographs of him in his army uniform belous hesitated it looked like a uniform in the pictures in tsarskoe selo im not sure he was charlie decided werent you ever told what army group or unit he was in belous shrugged he was killed at a battlefront he must have been a soldier mustnt he no thought charlie who from his previous days study and the emerging attitude of fyodor belous believed he had a good idea of the wartime employment of both the mans parents the outside bits of the jigsaw were beginning to fit but the center of the picture remained blank he was curious if miriam and lestov thought the same you were seventeen when your grandparents died within a month of each other said charlie picking up on what had been established in lestovs earlier questioning yes said the man and you lived all that time in an apartment at ulitza kirova yes theyre impressive apartments big said charlie whod specifically gone there on his way to the ministry your grandfather must have been an influential man a party worker like yourself perhaps belous stared back warily unspeaking for several moments it was allocated to my mother as a reward for what she did in leningrad they were allowed to keep it after she died and was honored why is this important were trying to discover how and why your mother was murdered reminded charlie everythings important tell us about things you remember in the apartment were there pictures prints on the walls ornaments around the place i dont understand that question protested the man your mother worked in the palace of catherine the great enjoyed things of rare beauty said charlie whose reading had extended to studying the illustrated masterpiece catalogue i would have expected her to try to decorate such a special apartment with things of special beauty you are suggesting my mother stole things not at all lied charlie anything from the catherine palace would have been too well known too well documented for anyone to have kept them in russia your mother would not have beenhonored as she was if there had been the slightest doubt about her honesty belous regarded him doubtfully there were some pictures i suppose a few ornaments nothing i remember particularly back to the selective memory charlie recognized do you still have any of them no said the man too quickly they were sold demanded charlie directly i dont know if they werent sold youd still have them wouldnt you i dont remember they just werent there after my grandfather died not even the medal about which they were particularly proud no charlie leaned forward picking up the citation caught by a sudden thought hoping but not expecting to find what he did your mother got to moscow with everything she saved from the palace in late yes said the son swallowing and was made a hero of the soviet union for doing it thats what the citation says no it doesnt corrected charlie its for special services to the soviet union and is dated december that would have been almost four years after she saved what she did from the palace wouldnt it if those are the dates conceded the man things take a long time to get done in a bureaucracy particularly in wartime there would have been treasures charlie knew maybe from the catherine palace or from whatand whereraisa did for the remainder of the war after maybe even small works of other peoples and other countries art how much and how many would have been hoarded by raisa belous and gradually disposed of by this man over the years for a few rubleskopeks maybe even a prized medal which charlie now doubted shed gotten for what shed done at leningrad but for a far greater contribution afterward belous was looking fixedly at him apprehensively the man hadnt gone to an englishlanguage newspaper to honor his motherhe would have demanded to be paid probably had been and by some of the foreign correspondents hed spoken to as well there wasnt anything to be gained challenging the man charlie recognized hed gotten all he wanted it had in fact been a far more productive afternoon than hed expected he hoped lestov had as well it was as much for the russians benefitand ultimately natalias as it was for him his curiosity about miriam could wait charlie said thank you its been very helpful belous blinked surprised you think you can find who killed my mother from what ive told you belous would have been prompted by the moscow news charlie guessed maybe by some of the western correspondents too not by itself but its added a lot to what we already know what was she doing at yakutsk with the officers thats one of the things we dont yet know said charlie but im getting closer by the day he thought natalia was for once already at lesnaya when charlie got home sasha was bathed and settled in bed and his islay and glass were set out in readiness natalia said weve got gulag as well as a lot of other obvious possibilities charlie sipped his whiskey knowing she hadnt finished enjoying her excitement guess who was sent there as well as the fifteen germans she demanded who asked charlie dutifully larisa yaklovich krotkov who was on the curators staff at tsarskoe selo the complete staff list still exists i ran a comparison with the names at gulag and there she was charlie stopped drinking what was she jailed for assisting the enemy any details coincidence or another piece of the jigsaw not so far we can use it insisted charlie you can use it how youve sent the gulag file on to travin she nodded in this afternoons consignment but how can lestovbe shown to discover it when hes not examining the camp material until this moment it had been a problem charlie hadnt known how to overcome but now he did did lestov pick up on the interview with fyodor belous you made it clear enough hes having belouss place raided tonight to see if theres anything the man hasnt already sold and raisa was trophy brigade so was her husband from the very beginning one thing at a time said charlie have lestov do what youve already done run a check on all the curator staff at tsarskoe selo which he could logically do after todays interview itll throw up larisa krotkovs imprisonment and where she served it yes agreed natalia distantly thatll do it wont it its them or you urged charlie knowing her difficulty them or us i know arrange a personal meeting with nikulin include lestov for him to get the credit advised charlie but you make the direct accusation against viskov and travin i know that too said natalia and im as frightened as hell there wasnt the hissvoiced fury of kenton peterss first telephone calls a loss of control boyce had never before known now the anger was in the frustrated determination to find out how henry packer had been exposed only you and i knew he was still in moscow and neither of us made the calls said boyce it was cartright whod discovered the anonymous contacts and there wasnt any way charlie muffin could avoid recognizing him after the amount of television coverage still damned impudent of dean to put what he did in the exchanges it would have been wrong for me to intervene i quite understand said peters i dont know or understand how but the information must have come from a russian source from which it follows that moscow has more than we suspected or guessed about raisa belous and yakutsk suggested boyce ill not give up insisted peters ill go on until i do find out we both will but shouldnt we move on a little i dont like norrington being identified said kenton peters taking the suggestion im not letting it be made public assured boyce im surprised the russians allowed the photograph to be published to let raisa belous be identified continued peters ive always said theyre the uncertainty didnt i this and packer confirm it you didnt know your president was going to make his hero announcement until it was too late gently reminded boyce what the president did will never occur again said peters he knows just how annoyed i am about that ive told him enough to understand what the effect could be hes terrified i was merely pointing out that oversights can happen and we can hardly remind moscow can we were not supposed to know unable to move his mind for long from what came close to being the first embarrassment of his career kenton peters said the agency lost a good man in packer hes useless now that hes been so publicly identified boyce said well have to put on hold any move against muffin for the time being nothing too close ive asked for someone else to be selected disclosed peters muffins an uncertainty and you know i dont like uncertainties again it was the absence of anything positive or worthwhile that confirmed for charlie a suspicion he didnt need proved any further it wasnt even the faultor obstructionof the other three with whom hed yet again gathered in the military attaches office they were as much puppets as he was intendedchosento be the difference was they didnt know how their strings were being pulled charlie did and was thoroughly pissed off at the realization withhis feet dancing was a dirty word anyway it was equally forbidden when he was the puppet my people cant trace anything on a lieutenant simon norrington either by name or by the army serial number his family gave apologized gallaway nor any crossreference to a raisa belous whatever existed must have been destroyed what about an art squad persisted charlie as a test already knowing that one existed i only filed that request yesterday said the attache im still waiting so am i said cartright so far i havent even had an acknowledgment as far as i know sis didnt have an interest from that mornings conversation with london charlie knew sir rupert dean was also still waiting for a reply to his inquiry made even earlier the directorgeneral hadnt argued with charlies open accusation that they were being played with by every other interested government ministry and department instead hed told charlie he wanted him back in london by the end of the week its put a lot of extra pressure on me complained raymond mcdowell the biggest continuing diplomatic dispute between germany and russia is stolen or disputed wartime art even after all these years ive averaged four cables a day from london since raisa belous was identified sos the ambassador i thought everyone was supposed to be fighting a war after said gallaway the limited military attache probably did accepted charlie he decided to excuse himself as soon as possible from this aimless discussion he wanted to be at the end of a telephone if natalia called there was even more to talk about after deans weeksend ultimatum mcdowell said the nazi treasure looting was more efficiently organized than the final solution there was even a connection of sorts hitler considered the people of eastern europe subhuman he didnt intend just to eradicate the jewish race eastern europeans were to go too become a vast slave resource while the germans expanded eastwards to take over their countries anything of any cultural artistic or historical significance was seized by alfred rosenbergs err organization entire museums libraries and notjust by them goering whose favorite was nudes had hitlers permission to take whatever he wanted from occupied countries for an art gallery that was to be as big as hitlers in linz hitler had the plan and model of it with him when he committed suicide in the berlin bunker the speciality was to have been heroic aryan portraits and sculptures himmler bormann and von ribbentrop each had their art squads von ribbentrop took every renaissance painting he could lay his hands on in italy he had his own artscavenging battalion with three companies from it working exclusively for him in russia alone charlie began to concentrate looking at the lecturing head of chancellery with sudden interest it obviously all came from london and the detail was surprising maybe even more surprising was that the foreign office clearly considered it necessary to provide such an intense briefing calling upon his own specific selfimposed modern history lesson hopefully to encourage the diplomat further charlie said and the soviet union had the sort of trophy brigades that ivan and raisa belous belonged to with every front line regiment the soviet trophy brigades virtually trawled the countriesgermany particularlywhen the war turned against hitler the almost obscene irony is that the nazis made it easy for them theyd stolen and got a lot of it conveniently together for the russians simply to pick up germany has officially listed something like three hundred thousand heritage treasures russia refuses to give back moscow claims theyre war reparation gallaway snorted a laugh how can anyone argue the legality of that london did and washington deflated mcdowell americas oss formed a special art loss looting investigation unit president truman personally signed the order to ship two hundred european paintings to america to go on touring exhibition the intention was to hold on to them until germany made its financial reparation the paintings were only returned after american and european academics and art historians pointed out that america could be accused of the same cultural rape as the nazis not all take and no give thought charlie not a wasted morning either he hadnt known of the existence of an american unit but the fbi would from which it logically followed that miriam bellwould too it had been almost fortyeight hours since raisa belous had been named and her art connection established time enough to have had the photograph miriam had recovered from the bodyand more recent ones of the corpse itselfchecked through oss archives it might even account for the womans seemingly casual questioning of fyodor belous the previous afternoon and why for the first time she hadnt wanted to talk things through after leaving the russian ministry if she already knew who her victim waswhat he had been doing evenall she would have needed to do was sit and listen during the meeting with belous to ensure nothing emerged to endanger washingtons coverup in fact thought charlie warming to his speculation it all made perfect sense of that intended coverup and what hed guessed to be the runaround to which he was being subjected still encouraging he said to mcdowell youre remarkably well informed so are you challenged the man homework here after the moscow news account said charlie more or less honestly i didnt learn all you appear to have i asked for as much guidance as possible admitted mcdowell the foreign office suddenly seems to have a lot of information available suggested charlie mcdowell made an uncertain gesture its a sensitive area particularly after all that business with switzerland and holocaust gold and bank accounts of jewish concentration camp victims thats spreading the net a bit wide isnt it questioned cartright i can hardly imagine there was art treasure or looted nazi gold in the prison colonies of yakutsk charlie suddenly realized from the previous nights conversation with natalia what could have been there and was irritated for not thinking of it sooner natalia had even shown the way maybe at last there were a few pieces becoming clearer for the center of the jigsaw there was actually an immediate directionand reasonfor his taking up the investigation away from moscow as soon as possible although not immediately to london hed already considered berlin the place to go where hopefully something no matter how small might have been overlooked he said it occurred to any of you were being jerked around in one bloody great coverup ours is not to reason why irritatingly cliched gallaway weve got to obey orders charlie said id like to think that if i got shot in the back of the head somebody somewhere someday would try to find out why orders or no orders just the sort of cocky bloodymindedness gerald williams had warned him to look out for cartright recognized and by which his career could be badly affectedruinedinvolved as he now was in this damned affair and then there was that currency speculation business that the gorgeous and willing irena had told him about definitely things he needed to talk about with williams maybe even with his own department too gallaway was right if there was a coverup there was a good reason and it wasnt their business herecertainly not charlie muffinsto question it the only sound in the white house suite of dmitri borisovich nikulin was the faintest rustle as the presidents chief of staff turned the pages of what natalia had placed before him thirty minutes earlier now she sat unmoving outwardly in complete control inwardly in turmoil she knewhad known for monthsthat this moment was inevitable but it had seemed so much easierfoolprooftalking it through with charlie at lesnaya than it did now making the accusation to one of the most influential members of the russian government about a deputy minister in that same government the fact that the accusation was trueonly this last hopefully decisive device connivedwasnt a reassurance nikulin had only moved travin sideways what if the presidential aide was a friend of viktor romanovich viskov or viskov had a protector even more influential and powerful than nikulin beside her colonel vadim lestov sat similarly statued no longer awed or illatease in such baroque surroundings although natalia had no doubt he was as inwardly agitated by the sudden awareness of what she had directly involved him in lestov had easily and professionally followed natalias lead not needing anything more than the initial prompt to make the same intriguing discovery about the yakutsk jailing of a former catherine palace curator employee but only natalias insistence that there wereother previous circumstances of which he was unaware stopped the man from positively arguing her determined conclusion it had been an impromptu gesture to show lestov her memorandum recommending his official appointment as her deputy she hoped ambitionand of being in nikulins presence only a few meters from the president himselfwould prevent the man from voicing any further doubt the chief of staff looked up at last pushing the folder slightly away from him youve no doubt it has been deliberately withheld demanded the harshfeatured emotionless man none whatsoever said natalia pleased with the strength of her own voice there is no proof of course not she accepted at once im asking you to judge it with what you know to have happened since this began its been a campaign of positive personal obstruction a permanent vendetta against me the inquiry itselfthe need to protect this government which was your specific instructionhas been totally and consistently disregarded natalia gestured sideways everything positive we have suggested has been opposed to erode my authority the camp search which from colonel lestovs discovery is proved to have been essential needed your order to be reintroduced after its arbitrary cancellation she hesitated at a prepared accusation i actually wonder to which government or country the deputy minister and petr pavlovich who still holds the title of my deputy are giving their true allegiance thats an astonishing allegation protested nikulin genuinely shocked and one i do not make lightly said natalia she felt numb striving to keep control i do not believe its possible to continue this investigationto achieve everything its necessary to achieveunder these conditions which is why i am making this a formal official complaint nikulin stared down at the closed folder on his desk for several moments before coming up to lestov do you feel yourself to have been positively obstructed natalia felt a fresh jump of apprehension i do not know all the circumstances that have been referred to the homicide detective began to hedge have you had any contact from petr pavlovich about gulag broke in natalia no said lestov the presidential aide said what contact has there been between yourself and petr pavlovich we speak daily confirmed lestov who calls whom seized natalia knowing the answer i call him he has never initiated an approach queried nikulin not since the rearrangement of responsibility without explanation nikulin picked up the telephone dialing the number himself it wasnt until he began to speak that natalia realized hed called the deputy interior minister natalias emotions switchbacked momentarily her mind blanked refusing any thought then she heard how nikulin was speaking and gauged that he was favoring her against the man nikulin said nothing about her or her accusation instead asking about the progress of the investigation and particularly the assembly and search of camp records and from nikulins next question accepted that in his determination still to denigrate the idea viktor viskov must have continued to belittle its purpose its being carried out though nikulin was saying viskov must have assured him that it was because the chief of staff next said completely up to date thats good nikulin redialed immediately the conversation with petr pavlovich travin was virtually a repetition of that with the deputy minister except for nikulin demanding a second time to be assured that there was no backlog in the prison file examination nikulin replaced the telephone for the second time and natalia waited hopefully with creaking formality the man said im sure youre very busy as i am thank you for bringing the matter to my attention natalias numbness wasnt as bad but it was still there gerald williams had always been sure hed win it had been his strategy that had been wrong which hed recognized and adjusted hed never imagined that in front of embassy witnesses the arrogant bastard would openly infer his intention to question or disobey a definite instruction or better still boast of currency speculation a virtual admission of the blatant robbery he was so determined to expose hed found the achilles heel in charlie muffins ridiculous shoes the weakness with which finally hed bring the man down the ideal mused williamsthe absolute orgasmic ultimatewould be for the man to be arrested in the act by the russian authorities williams sat transfixed at his office desk at which he had just concluded his telephone conversation with richard cartright consumed by the idea it was a very different and exciting strategy indeed and such a perfect one so excited was he by it that on his way home he abandoned his usual train to stop at a westminster wine bar to buy himself a small glass of sparkling wine savoring it as if it had been an roederer cristal by coincidence there were two other real champagne celebrations that night both separate and both in moscow i had lunch with him said boyce and he complained about the wine which was lafite god hes insufferable i wasnt asking about the wine he said we were worrying too much peters sighed you know what id like to do yes said boyce and id like to help you do it maybe we should and stop thinking of muffin reflected peters you won said charlie we won said natalia charlie waved dismissively curious at how subdued she was his news rather than hers he supposed more than won he said topping her qualification travin exiled to the chertanovo militia station not even the colonelincharge so far removed it might as well be to yakutsk itself rather than a moscow suburb and viskov dismissed youre safe viskov is still a member of the duma in parliament where hell stay powerless its you whos got the ear of nikulin and more it would have been the president who sacked viskov natalia smiled faintly its going to take time adjusting to it yet again she thought she finally sipped the champagne charlie had insisted on opening when shed told him of nikulins late afternoon announcement charlie had allowed sasha a thimble measure before shed been put to bed demanding to know if shed get a party for being clever like her mother which had been charlies explanation for the celebration hed said maybe natalias smile quickly faded now how long will you be away no longer than absolutely necessary charlie promised he was as satisfied with his afternoon as he was with natalias the directorgenerals announcement of the exhumation of the supposed grave of simon norrington had given charlie a valid reason for going to berlin which after a lot more embassy library reading hed decided was more important initially than anywhere else i dont like doing business this way dean had protested its the way everyone else is doing theirs it was you who warned me at the beginning that this could destroy the departmentmight even be intended for that purpose certainly things havent been done properly but i cant believe that i can you dont want anyone to know where youre going qualified dean not even within our own department ill overlook the impertinence of that but only just i wouldnt ask if i didnt consider it necessary the military attache is going to be the official representative maybe with others from the embassy ill fix everything myself from here which will make it my personal responsibility if you get it wrong itll be mine as well so obvious was natalias continued uncertainty about surviving her own internal war that charlie decided against telling her his suspicion of being a chosen victim in another neither would he ever admit to her his impatience to pursue the investigation outside russia from her reaction already to his going he knew she could never have been convinced his eagerness was entirely professional a determination to at last become the hunter not the hunted which didnt quite fit but was good enough in his own mind perhaps a better analogy would be getting off a stage upon which everyone else had been watching his blindfolded performance without taking part themselves i shall miss you natalia said so will sasha you dont need me to tell you the same i do natalia said urgently my lifes perfect here and this is where my life is from now on with you and sasha dont put it in danger then natalia urged how charlie frowned go with the system darling not against it even if you do find out everything go along with the coverup if thats whats demanded the three of us are more important than anything else i will said charlie the problem was having to take every conceivable risk to find out the truth only then would he have any protection from unblinking men like henry packer miriam handed the champagne to lestov lifting her own glass in a toast congratulations the russian said i still cant believe it there seemed in fact a lot of personal benefits he still had problems believing the most pleasant of all being in miriam bells apartment drinking miriam bells wine and knowing that eventually that night he would share miriam bells always welcoming bed he hoped too to share other things which meant he would not even be neglecting his professional duties miriam was having her difficulty understanding the dismissals that had accompanied lestovs promotion but needed to because of the obvious connection with the investigation it happened just like that she questioned snapping her fingers there was a previous episode i was only partially involved in and dont know enough about something to do with the deputy minister opposing the prison camp search and didnt that turn out to be a good idea flattered miriam she grinned ill show you later just how grateful i am getting the outcome of that she picked her glass up to take to the kitchen come and talk to me while i cook her persistence wouldnt seem so blatant there preparing dinner lestov followed dutifully happy for miriam to consider herself the leader he leaned casually against the food bar dividing the kitchen in two watching her and anticipating the prospect of that familiar body under the concealingly loose caftan if only he fully understood that mornings white house meeting hed be a very happy and contented man im not sure i shouldnt tell charlie he seems to have been pretty open with us you at least which amounts to the same thing only as much as it suits him objected miriam and you thought lestov curious how much there was she hadnt told him you think there are things hes kept back im sure of it shed expected something from the oss archives by now she hoped the bastards in washington werent working the wellknown needtoknow shell game to sideline her she still didnt fully understand the business with henry packer charlie insisted he didnt understand it either although there was the suggestion of a separate cia operation which the agency people at the embassy denied which of course they would if it had or if it hadnt been he might offer something back was she sleeping with charlie muffin as well lets wait see what you get from following up the larisa krotkov lead suggested miriam always best to negotiate from a position of strength miriam lived outside the embassy compound and from the kitchen of the apartment there was paradoxically a superb nighttime view of moscows catherine palace nodding through the window lestov said i had that checked hoping someone there might have known raisa belous or larisa krotkov he shook his head no one did although some of the stuff rescued from st petersburg was stored there until the end of the war and there was definitely nothing in fyodor belouss apartment when you went there pressed miriam not that we found i think he would have been expecting us hidden things away i might wait awhile and jump him again lestov topped up her glass leaning immediately forward to kiss her and miriam kissed him back enjoying it like she enjoyed the man himself as well as being sure charlie was still keeping something to himselfdespite chestclutching denialsshe was equally sure she was ahead of everyone largely as a result of sharing her favorite hobby with this militia colonel who was better than a lot in the past with whom it had been necessary to sleep in the call of duty and miriam jane bells personal advancement vadim lestov hadnt so far failed to make the chimes ring in bed and was more interesting than most on the embassy fuck circuit including richard cartright who hadnt offered anything worthwhile outside the sheets either what objectively are the chances of finding larisa krotkovs trial records lestov shrugged with his back to her doubtful you honestly think there might be something in them to account for raisa being in yakutsk questioned miriam going back to a suggestion lestov had offered when hed told her of the gulag discovery anything else would be too much of a coincidence wouldnt it he was disappointed that the totally logical speculation hadnt encouraged a more forthcoming response from her it was always questions never answers so where do the two lieutenants come in miriam hadnt given lestov the englishmans name or told him of the oss possibility she served the steak and handed lestov the napa valley chardonnay to open if i knew that it would be the end of the mystery exaggerated lestov he really had hoped to get moreor the hint of morefrom her he hesitated a little longer from making the commitment that had occurred to him on the way to miriams apartment he hadnt wanted to disclose the german names but hed exhausted all possible russian sources but the fbi would have access to more so the sacrifice was necessary he said fifteen germans were sent to gulag in april she looked fixedly at him across the table you got the names for yours and my information only absolutely agreed miriam at once all this and a good fuck too vitali maksimovich novikov identified charlie hes got a wife and two boys natalia had relaxed during dinner laughing more readily and genuinely than charlie could remember for a long time the last few weeks had been a greater strain upon her than hed fully realized the yakutsk doctor she remembered at once he claims to have more the exchange is to get him and his family out you promised him i said id do what i could without him i wouldnt have known about gulag which we used to destroy viskov and travin it was one of the camps novikovs father looked after was originally sentenced to ive got to know what it is hes got we both have she agreed charlies telephone call to vitali novikov was the last of several he made from his embassy office the next morning before leaving for the airport miriam bell was not among them novikov said i was beginning to think i wouldnt hear from you again just make the application its being supported through the embassy lied charlie dont mention that of course how can i thank you you know reminded charlie charlie gazed through the window as the plane banked for landing feeling the usual surge of nostalgia for a city in which hed worked so often that berlin had once seemed more like home than london he couldnt pick out the odd memorial scraps of the wall but didnt anyway need markers for where like a bloated aorta along which so much real blood had run it had gone through the heart of the city he didnt see the commonwealth war cemetery either he didnt bother trying to locate from the air the other building he was anxious to get to knowing very well where it was what embarrassmentwhat needcould there be after all these years for not one but two countries to be so determined to cover it up as america and england appeared to be something both had combined upon clearly big then mammoth even all securely hidden for fiftyfour years never ever intended to be revealed as the bodies had never been intended to be discovered a shared secret of one agency or several each in some way involved in some small part would the telephone calls hed made and the ambiguous conversations hed initiated in the last few days spreading the inquiry too wide he hoped for anyone to see a direction be sufficient or would whoever the puppet masters were have been too clever getting there ahead of himyears ahead of him he was pinning a lot of hope on bureaucracy getting in its own way which in his experience it nearly always did and on the fact that hed worked in berlin so often and knew so well just how many institutions had been created there in the immediate post and cold war years he hoped most of all that his memory and knowledge were better than any whitehallor washington chairbound keeper of secrets and kenton peters had another secret now not one to keep but to discover charlies whereabouts persuading sir rupert dean not to disclose his movements was as personally selfprotective as it was to guard the department more so the american mistakepeterss arrogancehad been letting him know what henry packer looked like not knowing how well tuned charlies antenna was it was going to be much harder to recognize packers replacement if one was sent charlie had made his reservation at the bristol kempinski the hotel in which he always stayed without asking the current prices not thinking until he was checking in of the distress it would cause gerald williams to authorize these expenses as well as maintaining the rent on the lesnaya apartment letting the thought drift charlie acknowledged it had been several weeks since any expenditure inquisition from the zealously attentive financial controller hed almost been disappointed that the cost of his beekeepers hat hadnt been queried perhaps mulled charlie the man had given up then again perhaps he hadnt natalia had insisted on packing for him everything laid out in his case in meticulous comparison to his customary haphazard effort and when he lifted out the spare jacket charlie knew why there were two notes with another framed photograph of natalia and sasha natalias note said simply hurry home sashas was much longer the laboriously printed english attempt interspersed with cyrillic letters each line dipping dramatically at its end literally falling away it said i love you and miss you and i am sorry about that silly word charlie liked best that it was addressed to daddy he was at the room bureau writing an immediate reply on a hotel postcard when the telephone jarred startling him by its nearness with a befitting machinegun delivery the voice said jackson here thought we should meet as you suggested downstairs when youre ready lieutenant colonel rupert jacksons ageat least half that of gallaway charlie guessedmarked him at once as the complete antithesis of the ineffectual moscow attache a fasttrack career professional for whom the promotional escalator would never rise fast enough he came up from the barstool like a spring the flick of fair hair that would give him problems on parade days falling over hisleft eye he managed to push it back and shake hands at the same time the handshake was firm but not arm wrestling orange juice charlie noted automatically ordering islay malt knowing the hotel stocked it which was another reason for staying there a tables probably better charlie suggested moving away from the bar at which there were only two other people anyway and they at its far end of course sir you want me to call you lieutenant colonel the man frowned confused no then its charlie the frown became a grin not sure what the form is with you chaps he looked down at himself thought mufti was best the trouser crease of jacksons muted checked suit would have been dangerous to the touch and the man risked severing an artery moving his head too quickly against the stiff collar the burnished brogues reflected sufficient light to send sos signals fine said charlie aware for the first time that natalia must have pressed his trousers too it still amounted to a beforeandafter comparison sorry to barge in like this at the last moment glad to have you aboard saw the television from siberia cant have been much fun thered been a reference from the attache to seeing him on television when theyd spoken from moscow charlie hoped that had been sufficient official identification without the man feeling it necessary to check with the defense ministry in london if he hadand thered been objectionsjackson would hardly have kept the suggested meeting or been so amenable charlie said it was pretty rough any idea yet what happened to the poor bastards open sesame thought charlie not a complete picture what guidance have you got from london none said the other man apologetically just told to attend as official military observer bugger it thought charlie whats the setup havent arranged anything waited for you got a car outside thought you might like to look around what about the exhumation theres a security blackout on it of course ministry insistence fortunately the commonwealth cemetery at charlottenburg is under military jurisdiction makes it easy the section we want has already been sealed off the grave itself has been screened the workmen havent been told whose grave it is theyre opening apart from them therell just be us the embassy padre a medical examiner and someone from the berlin coroners office there might be someone from the war graves commission theyre not sure yet what to do about the grave marker now they know its not simon norrington he paused you know what youre looking for not yet said charlie hopefully he added anything else london had you do dont want any confusion between the briefings little risk of that assured jackson still apologetic hed been told the gieves and hawkes customer archive had provided the address of the family seat in hampshire and sir matthew norrington had produced the war offices notification of his brothers death and burial in berlin having visited it sir matthew had even known the plot number he had it seemed considered it fitting his brother remain in a soldiers grave rather than be reinterred in the family vault in england located the grave myself from the plot number said jackson usual inscription rank name unit date of death everything based on what the family supplied queried charlie disappointed what about from the ministry itself family told the ministry the ministry told me said the attache nothing more than that afraid not was the provost company properly established here when norrington was supposed to have died asked charlie i doubt it that early from what i gather no one knew where anybody was in berlin in april whole regiments split up platoons and squadrons fighting on their own and the russians were here first of course what about wartime archives here military police headquarters are at rheindahlen you might try there what about records of stolen art theres an art recovery center at the university here others atthe universities of bremen and dresden too he stopped thinking the grave of the american wouldnt be here in berlin there arent any military cemeteries here charlie felt a sink of further disappointment where are the american dead buried there are a lot of cemeteries throughout europe i wouldnt even like to guess do you have a name no a unit no lied charlie not wanting any destroying or concealing visits ahead of his own but you do have a photograph of the american body found in yakutsk know what he looks like yes said charlie thats something perhaps but not enough said charlie deciding upon the need for another lie anyway its norrington im interested in not the american charlie was surprised momentarily bewildered at his feeling of deja vu upon entering the military cemetery until the comparison came to him between the regimented pattern of so many headstones and crosses and the stunted numberonly wooden markers by the yakutsk gold mine the control office was in the middle of the cemetery the grave areas radiating out like spokes in a wheel there were manicured trees bordering the paths initially he and jackson ignored the building going instead to the grave jackson confidently leading the way some of the trees would anyway have partially concealed it but screens more than two meters high completely encircled it the cross naming simon norrington was still in place but there had been some digging at its base to lift it about a third of a meter of topsoil had already been dug out at least thought charlie there werent any maneating mosquitoes jackson said what was the yakutsk grave like a bomb crater they used grenades whoever this was had a proper burial but was probably killed to order jackson regarded him quizzically you sure about that no admitted charlie im still not sure about anything the duty registration clerk in the control office was a rigidly coiffed rigidfaced woman who just as tightly demanded the military attaches identification despite their having met earlier when she had been informed of the exhumation and who regarded charlie with disdain and his moscow embassy accreditation with suspicion she insisted on telephoning some unidentified official in another cemetery office before accepting charlies right to examine records and stood at each mans shoulder to ensure they fully completed the perforated holepunched entry slips with their names and details of their official identity documents considering the outside appearance of hundreds of graves the archive vaults were surprisingly small two linked rooms about fifty meters long and half as wide totally bare except for central tables and row upon row of filing cabinets against every available wall space on both tables in memoriam books were set out in symmetry matching that of the grave markers in alphabetical order to replace the current pageaday book displayed in its glass case in the entrance to the british lodge house charlie supposed there was an index system linking name and burial place but they didnt need to consult it already knowing the plot number which enabled the clerk to lead them at once to a cabinet halfway along the first room she insisted upon retrieving and finding the norrington entry herself not trusting them to handle the paperaged ledger and laid it open on the central table clearly unhappy at disturbing the neat arrangement of the waiting commemorative books she said the papers fragile id appreciate your not touching it the entries were listed in numerical order by plot allocation norringtons plot was a third of the way down a righthand page the details occupying just one line each fact fit into a designated box there was his army officers sixdigit serial numberrank full namesimon st john norringtonunit and finally a date under the box headed cause was kia the number three was written in a final farrighthand column there were various numbers against other names above and below in that column charlie said kia killed in action yes sighed the clerk confirming the obvious whats the three refer to visitors asking to examine the register the mans entry has been read three times since his interment london told me sir matthew said hed been here reminded jackson charlies feet twinged a physical response to the feeling of expectation that had been all too rare on this operation gesturing back toward the outer office he said is it regulations that everyone who wants to see the registration has to complete an entry slip of course said the woman impatiently there is a responsibility to the dead as well as to the living which im sure you fulfill admirably flattered charlie what happens to the slips the clerk frowned at him making vague movements toward the stillopen drawer each is quite properly transferred to the cabinet log as it should be of course id like to see the log and the slips said charlie im not sure i can permit that said the woman and im sure you can said jackson at once you need authority make another phone call the clerk hesitated face burning before taking a separate thicker book from the bottom of the cabinet again she carefully turned the crackling pages appearing to find her place but then turning one sheet back and forth several times she finally looked up frowning more genuinely this time i dont understand that no slips anticipated charlie you knew she challenged guessed said charlie this is against all regulations ill have to report it yes agreed charlie you should no one can get access without accredited authority can they no you saw the procedure what about another nationality i dont understand the question she protested immediately after the war when berlin was occupied by the four powers and later when it was divided coaxed charlie couldsay an american or a russian have examined the entry needed to complete a slip like we did the woman digested the question i suppose so she said although doubtfully ive been here fifteen years and its never happened while ive been on duty this is very irregular therell be an inquiry it wont stop here it probably will predicted charlie as they got back into jacksons car the attache said bureaucratic cockups happen every day but this isnt one of them said charlie who was hoping fervently for others what then a second much deeper burial that this time wont be affected by freak weather the bastard exclaimed miriam no reason at all just that hed been recalled immediately he didnt know why or for how long and that hed either call from london or be in touch as soon as he got back the savoy barman ignored lestovs rublewaving effort to attract attention concentrating upon the dollartipping americans at the other end of the bar thats bullshit of course he knows why i already worked that out said lestov pained in her fury miriam missed the sarcasm it had to be something very dramatic indeed for charlie to have been called back like this so she wasnt ahead of everyone after all the opposite way behind but why hadnt the sonofabitch called making a point obviously bastard and why was washington closing her out insisting they couldnt locate the relevant oss files or trace any of the german names shed asked to be identified which she didnt think lestov had believed when shed told him who the fucks side were they on she grew angrier at her impotence petulantly she said so much for share and share alike all right by me ill play his rules from now on cut him out well aware by now of miriams stopatnothing ambition lestov was not surprised at her peevishness but thought she sounded vaguely ridiculous dont you think we should wait to see if we can afford to the russian was right miriam accepted lets take a rain check on tonight darling i need to get back to the embassy and tell washington straightaway she couldnt think of a way to avoid admitting charlie had gone off without telling her and knew she was going to appear pretty damned stupid lestov wasnt surprised at that announcement either his own possible benefit already worked out he said one thing this should prove to us is the importance of you and i exchanging absolutely everything no holding back whatever we might be officially told to do i thought that was our understanding already said miriam she probably would have to do so if she stood any chance of catching up and saving her ass its certainly mine said lestov he wasnt particularly upset at miriam canceling the evening on his way to the hotel hed become excited by an idea he had no intention whatsoever of discussing with her as well as an oversight that needed correcting now he could go back to the ministry and start working at once the barman finally condescended to move toward them it gave lestov a lot of satisfaction to walk away before the man reached them he didnt leave a tip for the previous drinks either at the lesnaya apartment sasha handed the telephone back for natalia to finish the conversation with charlie and afterward said he is going to stay my daddy isnt he he is coming back yes said natalia hes going to stay your daddy forever good said the child positively i dont want anybody else neither do i said natalia the foreign office has been told by the state department charlie muffin is here in england protested patrick pacey the political officer according to the ministry of defense hes turned up in berlin both want explanations why they werent informed charlie must have detoured said dean easily and have a reason and were not required to advise departments either in advance or after initiating an inquiry in an investigation that were officially in charge of the ministry of defense and washington can go to hell he should have advised us said hamilton he just cant go wandering off i warned you said gerald williams warned everyone the man does what he likes and well all suffer because of it charlie had been right about the reaction from the rest of whitehall thought dean reflectively and why was it so important to america berlin is quite safe insisted boyce we tidied it up when it all began where exactly is the damned man england or germany dean thinks hes moving somewhere between the two thinks why doesnt he know i dont like this man doing what he likes when he likes were not properly in control objected peters ive got a replacement for packer i dont think we should wait any longer it wouldnt look right so soon dont forget what dean put on record hes too independent hed make a fuss im still seeing everything thats coming in muffins still way off course well let him continue going around in circles its actually causing more confusion than wed hoped to create im going to close down my end decided peters i think you should do the same not yet kenton said the other man who disliked the americans need always to be in complete charge well let my end run on for the moment it rained very softly a drenching mist the ground had become soaked before they tried to extend the surrounding plastic for some overhead protection there wasnt enough sheeting all it had done was narrow the gap through which the water came adding to themorass in which they stood the mud of the partially redug grave came up to the diggers ankles and the surrounding grass was quickly churned into mire beneath the shuffling feet of the rest of them jacksons inappropriately bright red and white golf umbrella kept their heads and shoulders dry but charlie could feel the dampness seeping in through his spreadapart shoes the need to wear them into comfortable collapse was always a problem in the wet there had been formal introductions at the cemetery lodge but no conversation afterward the german officials hunched under their own umbrellas the plump medical examiner whose name charlie had caught as wagner kept looking accusingly at charlie as if their dawn misery was his personal fault the embassy padre now occupied in headbent prayer had earlier looked equally upset at jacksons umbrella the priest himself didnt have any covering his hair and nose dripped it was more crowded than originally intended inside the dank enclosure because of charlies visit the previous day charlie and jackson had gone directly from the cemetery to the embassy and failed to find any official approach to account for the three recorded but untraceable visits which inexplicably in charlies opinion had caused the head of chancellery to send a second secretary today his attendance had in turn ensured that of the previous days registration clerk no longer patronizingly hostile but instead anxious for them to know she had gone through the entire ledger to ensure the slips hadnt been wrongly indexed which they hadnt been and a nervous official from the war graves commission whod assured charlie there was nothing in their local berlin directories either but that a full search was being carried out in london charlie acknowledged that the official motions had to be gone through and didnt tell them they were wasting their time he also didnt tell jackson the diggers were even more deeply immersed when they located the coffin which they did at first by feel and sunk even farther up to their elbows groping into the quagmire to slip lifting canvas beneath the casket there was a muffled shouldershrugging conversation between the german officials before wagner said to charlie what are you looking for charlie shrugged back whatevers there anything of forensic importance could be destroyed attempting a preliminary examination in these conditions dont lets try then said charlie whod already decided that as hed also decided that remote though the possibility would have been anything outside the coffin at the bottom of the grave would have been lost too the embassy padre invited them all to pray as the slimecoated coffin came into view with a slurped sucking sound and charlie dutifully bent his head with everyone else wondering idly where god had been when simon norringtons head had been blown off in siberia or indeed throughout the entire second world war perhaps hed been busy instead of edging back against the sweating plastic to make room for the box charlie led the way out the ambulance attendants whod so far remained dry inside their vehicle emerged reluctantly to accept the body jackson promised the medical examiner he knew the way to the mortuary and the registration clerk and the war graves officially repeated that theyd go on looking for the missing dockets and charlie said he appreciated their continuing efforts the cemetery official exchanged signed documents with the medical examiner their wetness inside the bmw caused the windows to steam when jackson put the heater on full charlie knew it wouldnt be sufficient to dry his feet he was lucky he supposed not to suffer from rheumatism jackson said you think youll learn anything from whatevers inside the coffin just confirmation of what i already suspect if indeed there is a body the car swerved slightly at the attaches snatched sideways look you think it might be empty i wouldnt be speechless if it were but it wasnt the skeleton largely in its expected shape was still inside the nowopened coffin being extensively photographed when charlie and jackson were shown into the glassed observation annex raised above the forensic pathology examination room because of the elevationcharlie could see almost everything inside the box what remained of the hairless skull was on its left side horizontal to the shoulder area which also appeared disarranged there were isolated wisps of a thin gauzelike cloth that charlie presumed to be the shroud the medical examiner was standing back for the photographs and saw them enter he was gowned despite there being no risk of outside contamination of a corpse so long dead only when the germans voice echoed into the viewing chamber theres communication between us there are permanent microphones on the ledge in front of you did charlie see the pathologist was wearing a headset and voicepiece anything specific you want to establish wagner added extent of the injuries that killed him set out charlie his list mentally prepared every possible body measurement and height your opinion if you can reach it about his possible body weight it looks from where i am as if all the hair has gone but if there are traces id like to know the color any orthodontistry which might help any indication from the bones of injury prior to his death broken leg or arms something like that anything obviously that might be in the coffin that you wouldnt expect particularly personal objects and anything else you can think of and i havent jackson sniggered at charlies final remark wagner didnt after a pause the german said i will talk as i examine the pathologist worked alone lifting what sometimes appeared bone only a few millimeters in either length or diameter virtually dismembering and reassembling the entire skeleton everything was measured and weighed in the transfer every piece identified by its proper medical name its size and weight itemized what charlie regarded as of major significance registered very early in the examination but he did not interrupt until the pathologist finished the reconstruction severe physiogmatic trauma echoed charlie thats what i said would the face have been destroyed beyond recognition without any doubt theres no trace of either cheekbone or the left jawbone including the eye socket surround any teeth that remained have been shattered beyond any orthodontic comparison theres no nasal formation whatsoever in my opinion he got hitdirectly in the face death would have been instantaneous you also used the word severe to describe the hand injuries said charlie you can see for yourself from where you are said wagner from where i am it looks as if both hands were totally smashed they have been agreed the doctor there is no right thumb or index finger what about the tips of fingers wagner had been looking toward the panoramic window separating them briefly he turned to bend over the examination table before coming back to them no fingernor the left thumbextends its full length to the final joint perhaps he put his hands in front of his face at the last minute to shield himself from whatever hit him it was a further two hours before the examination was complete it was established that the unknown dead man had been one and threequarter meters tall and from chest and body structure reasonably thickset the dead man had suffered no bone damage injury prior to his death there was no surviving hair nor any unexpected personal objects in the coffin it was still only midday when they emerged from the mortuary the rain had changed driven down in solid walls by a wind that hadnt been blowing earlier charlie didnt think the graveside plastic would have survived if it had been his feet got soaked again on his way to the car well queried jackson once they were inside sometimes its not what you find but what you dont said charlie natalia was thinking the same in moscow she looked up from the yellowed sheets that lestov had set out in front of her it could simply have failed to be recorded the homicide colonel bristlechinned and lightheaded from a totally sleepless night at his desk shook his head it was my first chance fully to examine the records of gulag after getting them back from travin we all missed something important theyre perfect no omissions no gaps it was a very special camp indeed at least while it existed so demanded natalia look at the plot numbering urged the man its consecutive a name recorded against every plot in a cemetery that no longer exists there isnt an entry for larisa krotkov she was sentenced to life imprisonment but theres no record of her dying there or being buried there what possible connection could there be with the disappearance of the visitors slips in berlin natalia wondered remembering the previous nights telephone conversation with charlie gulag was closed very soon after stalins death inmates were either released or transferred she wouldnt have been released for conspiring with the enemy he gestured to the mound of papers in front of natalia two hundred people were transferred every name is there larisa krotkovs isnt what have you done about it asked st petersburg for trial depositions there arent any for her there are for five others all men accused of the same crime directly after the siege was lifted the sentence was mandatory execution natalia had spread the papers across her desk for comparison slowly she began stacking them one on top of the other conclusion larisa krotkov wasnt sentenced to gulag she was sent there a supposed prisoner for a reason and the only possible reason is something connected with tsarskoe selo which links her with raisa belous it was wildly speculative thought natalia but then so was everything else it could only have been with the knowledgethe positive directionof the nkvd a search would need your authority lestov pointed out always looking backward thought natalia weve got a name and a date it shouldnt be too difficult to locate if anything exists she could even still be alive all we need to understand it all is someone living not dead agreed lestov im station chief yelled saul freeman and im the person you were happy to assign to this becauseyou were too fucking frightened of all the political implications to get involved yourself miriam shouted back she was redfaced sweating needing to support herself as she leaned across his desk to confront him which was what shed been waiting to do when hed entered the office that day her overnight cable to washington and its response lay between them i dont remember you putting up much of a fight im putting one up now its totally political isnt it she put a flat hand close to her chin right up to here and im the fall guy if anything goes wrongso fucking anxious to get there fight for everything that i didnt see the curve you bastard freeman picked up the cables miriams read demand immediate oss identification of american victim which understand british already have further understand london about to go public freeman said you should have cleared this with me if id known what the fuck was going on i would have and thats what im going to tell each and every inquiry when i get back to washington as ordered freeman made a warding off movement toward miriam ignoring all the rules first cabling then calling kenton peters direct at the state department instead of going through headquarters was unforgivable you know that what else did you expect what i expectedbut sure as hell didnt getwas to be properly treated as a special agent of the federal bureau of investigation and told the true reason for monitoring an investigation by britain and russia which i was not intended in any way to contribute to and obstructed as much as possible so that i couldnt what did peters tell you sighed freeman that i didnt have to bother that russia would never find out and if they did would admit nothing and that whatever charlie muffin and his department came up with would stay as buried as it had been for the last fifty years and that they were fall guys too and then he realized what hed saidincluding me as a fall guyand said he hadnt meant it the way it had sounded and that i was to forget that too freeman indicated miriams justreplaced telephone and then you called him a sonofabitch and to kiss your ass and enjoyed doing it he qualifies he might it was still the worst career move you ever made you going to tell me what its really aboutnot some shit about saving the current president i dont know peters said it would embarrass the president now although it was a long time ago that it was all i needed to knowthat anyone needed to know you feel good about this about screwing me like this freeman lifted and let drop miriams cable you sent it i wouldnt have let you conscience clear right conscience clear say hello to washington for me you can kiss my ass too i did remember all i remember is that you were a lousy fuck at the time it was just a physical judgment not now the bastard would shit himself if he knew what she had but she wanted a bigger reaction than the one shed get from saul freeman directly after the war and the control division of berlin between the four allied powers america created the most comprehensive archive of the taking of the city and its postwar history right up to the bringing down of the wall in it was called simply the document center and after america made a gift of it to germany there were more than a million photographs included in the material the hair of the archivist who greeted charlie appeared to have receded in equal proportion to his beard as if it had simply slipped from the top to the bottom of his face his english was faultless but sibilant he said weve had researchers come for a month work for more than a year theres so much here ive got quite a narrow time frame said charlie and a positive direction that should certainly help agreed the man i hope it will said charlie it would be good not having to work in the rain although not for more than a year we understand each other demanded kenton peters who had come personally to pennsylvania avenue rather than have the fbidirector come to him at foggy bottom which was unprecedented yes sir said the director its totally unforgivable i agree and you understand about the investigation yes i want this to be the last i hear about it from this bureau it will be assured the other man there was still too much furyfueled adrenaline for miriam bell to feel tired although she would have liked to shower but the car was waiting at dulles as shed been told it would be so the stripdown in the aircraft toilet would have to do she hadnt slept at all during the flight using the time and was glad she was thinking very differently now much surer of herself than she had been during the initial confrontation with saul freeman wished indeed she could turn the clock back for a rerun shed thought of a lot of better answers after it was too late to rebuff saultheshithead that was there was still the confrontation to which she was going where the inflight rehearsaland what shed brought with her from moscowcould hopefully be put to better and more effective use at least shed been thinking more clearlyleaving things as they should have been leftwhen shed spoken to lestov washington seemed oddly colder than moscow although there was a pale sun but there was a lot more color from the trees on the parkway and once they crossed the potomac by the key bridge everything appeared much cleaner and people on the sidewalk seemed to move with much more purpose when she said so to the driver he remarked that moscow must be a godawful place to live miriam said it had its moments there was an escort waiting for her at the reception desk of the fbi headquarters which was completely unnecessary because sheprobably knew the building as well as he did but she guessed it was part of the disapproval she was supposed to be aware of from the beginning which she was but she was not intimidated by it there was in fact still a lot of anger but well controlled now she was ready and believed herself prepared to fight back nathaniel brindsley the bureau deputy director in charge of overseas personnel was a balding fat man whose cheeks puffed when he breathed because of emphysema hed transferred to the bureau after ten years with the cia which permanently tagged him an outsider despite his working twice that long at pennsylvania avenue considering his official title and position it was also considered unusual that brindsley had never served outside washington not even in a local fbi office within america brindsley so snugly fit his chair that miriam thought the man would have brought it up with him like a permanent appendage if hed politely risen at her entry but he didnt instead as she sat in the chair he indicated with an impatient head jerk he said as foulups go youre scoring ten and rising youand whoevers pulling the stringsare way ahead with ten as crisis meltdown youre at twenty with some irony miriam estimated shed been roughly over yakutsk crossing siberia before shed properly acknowledged she was flying into a putuporshutup survival situation with no second chance and decided to put up youre forgetting our respective positions and authority here committed now miriam determined question for question youve forgotten how you were staking me out in the sun leaving me to sweat with a totally inadequate briefing you were briefed to the extent you needed to be bullshit nat which you know it is we got a longago secret to keep that way i need to know what it is need to know what i have to hide if one of the otherstoo many of the otherscome up with it you sent me blindfolded and naked into the ring with a target on my fanny which makes you a bastard you swear at me its insubornation i swear at you its sexual harassment you try and drop me because i offended some sphincterstricken cocksucker who considered i was a disposal item then youand heare looking at a lot more than a complaint of sexual harassment hardly any of this was part of the rehearsed script she might nothave anything more to lose but this wasnt put up it was personal put down a suicide jump brindsley was initially speechless when he did speak he said you have any idea just how far out of line you are you tell metell me honestly for the first time youve broken every protocol in the book and then some kenton peters is the state department doesnt matter who the secretary is or whos in the white house and you told him to kiss your ass used those very words and you know what he told me he told me i was a fall guy used those very words the sigh puffed brindsleys cheeks more fully than usual he doesnt remember saying that he knows official telephone conversations to and from the moscow office are recorded as a matter of routine the only sound in the room for several moments was the rasping of the deputy directors heavy breathing im going to forget you said thatalong with its implications and remind you whose property any tape is recorded on fbi material on fbi premises miriam took the tiny cassette from her handbag and tossed it onto the mans desk just thought youd like to hear the conversation for yourself the speed with which the man grabbed the recording was surprising for someone of his size his hand snatching out to enclose it like a lizards tongue plucking an insect in midflight this the only copy with two messages one thats on it one that isnt i dont think i want to hear the second you do insisted miriam and so does peters and anyone else who thinks theyve got the lid on whatever it is that has to be locked away forever theres too many peopletoo many chances for the smallest fuckupshe nodded in the direction of the desk drawer into which brindsley was putting the tapelike an illconsidered remark being recordedfor anyone to believe they can control things from a distance of eight or ten thousand miles this way the way peters wants to work and how youve been telling me to work theresgoing to be something that someone doesnt know theyre saying or doing and all the demons are going to come out of pandoras box and land right in your laps peters is sure hes emptied the box how can he be demanded miriam careless of the exasperation its his job to be you going to tell me what its really all about i dont know protested the man thats how tight its being kept i pass everything you send to the director the director liaises with peters peters tells the director how to respond i tell you and i dont like it any more than you do but im five years from pension so i dont tell peters to kiss my ass he want me fired yes miriam felt the stir of apprehension a hollowness you going to you got a good argument against it peters sure hes got the british under control totally seems theyve got as much to hide as we have but he cant have the russians she extended a cupped hand closing her fingers but i have colonel vadim leonidovich lestov right here in the palm of my hand you cant afford to put anyone else on the case not at this stage it would be even greater madness than the way its being run at the moment brindsleys smile was of resignation thats what i told the director even without knowing about lestov what did he say that we didnt have a choice but that your future with the bureau after this hangs on the thinnest thread you ever saw and that you had to be brought all the way from moscow to be told that in person so youd believe it so tell me you believe it i believe it she was going to survive and dont you ever again foulmouth me like you have today im sorry and i wont it wasnt nathaniel brindsley who was the cocksucker it was kenton peters another thing you wont ever do again is communicate outside this bureau to anyone about anything i wont promised miriam but nat i need more than im getting for all the reasons were talking about it is oss and their artlooting investigation unit isnt it that seemed to ring the alarm bell agreed brindsley and because the oss became the cia after the war thats where the records are or were and why peters is sure everythings either gone or locked away forever who was henry packer agency said brindsley and was is the word hes out any idea how he was blown miriam shook her head none could it have been the brit muffin i dont see how as far as i was aware packer was peterss bodyguard what was he really supposed to do your guess is as good as mine miriam felt a sudden coldness youre kidding i didnt say anything dont know anything its got to be a hell of a thing they want to stay covered up you still need me to tell you that does peters know who the guy is in the yakutsk grave i guess so i dont and what he was doing in yakutsk brindsley shrugged i dont know miriam extended her hands again a gesture of helplessness this time what the hell am i supposed to do exactly what you have been doing passing back everything giving away nothing monitoring not investigating i could have been told that in the beginning now you have been what about the englishman maybe you should tell peters he was withdrawn to london the day before me left without telling me she made a vague gesture again toward the drawer containing the tape cassette i dont understand how peterss remark about the british being fall guys squares with your telling me theyve got as much to hide as us and are cooperating neither do i admitted the man miserably like i said i dont enjoy working like this any more than you do she was safe miriam abruptly realized she might have gotten the thinthread lecture but after today she couldnt be blamed for the failure of an investigation that had been intended to fail from the very beginning as the awareness settled she said hows this going to be marked on my file im not sure that it is going to be marked said the department chief he hesitated is there another copy of the tape no lied miriam altogether she decided everything had turned out very satisfactorily indeed it would still be nice to have peters kiss her ass something in fact to look forward to with the tape shed copied it would be good to have more to get which she needed to go on poking around despite what she had been officially ordered to do do a charlie muffin in fact there was no way she could try to access the old oss files without the bureau finding out but there were the nazi prisoners at yakutsk and new york was only an hour away from washington on the shuttle before her transfer to the overseas division miriam bell had been attached to the fbis new york office and had twice found the records of the world jewish congress on madison avenue a mine of information about nazi germany and the holocaust during war crime inquiries she was directed to the desk of a man whose nameplate said e ray lewis he was a small balding bearded man whose vaguely distracted ambience of an academic changed at once to obvious daydreams at her approach miriam was glad shed worn the sweater that accentuated her cleavage he promised to do whatever he could to help her when she showed him her bureau shield and miriam knew how he would have liked her to help him his fantasies went abruptly the moment she produced her list he said i know without checking who most of them are the others would be the same you know what happened to them i think so can you tell me what they did immediately said lewis and he did the afternoon sessions had become routine an examination and often reexamination of everything from the previous twentyfour hours unless there was something lestov considered more urgent which hedid the recall of miriam bell so soon after charlie muffins departure you think theres a connection demanded natalia who knew well enough from charlies berlin calls there wasnt would charlie have come up with anything by the time they next spoke its too much of a coincidence insisted lestov what did she say that shed been summoned to a reevaluation conference in washington how good has her cooperation been until now she wants more than she gives id guess were holding back in equal measure what do you think about this the most obvious is that theyve identified their victim maybe even know why he was there suggested the man knowing from charlie of the soft latenight knocks on miriam bells yakutsk hotel room door natalia said whos cooperated the most out of the two of them nothing in it judged lestov at once so a reevaluation conference is a lie inevitably accepted lestov what do we do natalia invited london and washington have got to think weve got more than we have yes agreed natalia doubtfully has there been any response about larisa krotkov nothing why dont we use it questioned lestov use what how natalia frowned issue a statement without naming larisa krotkov of a further mysterious connection with tsarskoe selo generate the sort of publicity we did with the photograph of raisa belous maybe hint it has something to do with a second woman itll bring them back force them into an exchange yes agreed natalia needing only to know what the americans had it would wouldnt it in berlin charlie eased back in the tiny cubicle that had been made available to him at the former american document center gazing down tiredeyed but briefly euphoric at the photograph included in the comparatively small amount of material devoted to the american oss period in the city prior to the cia so small in fact that it probably shouldnt have been there at all and more probably still was unknown to the cia which grew from the office of strategic services or any other washington department certainly none overseen by the ubiquitous kenton peters incredibly it was the instant recognition of the girl not of the heavily bespectacled man that had first registered with charlie from the copied scrap miriam found but this print was intact not cut as it had been to fit into the dead americans pocket in the yakutsk grave there were a further seven men and two other girls smiling out at the camera charlies second instant identification was of a dressuniformed simon norrington without having to read the captioned name he didnt need the caption either to pick out raisa belous as one of the other two girls there was none of the previous days frigidness from the cemetery registration clerk when charlie shuffled into her office two hours later she said at once nervously im sorry we still havent sorted it out im sure youre trying soothed charlie i was wondering if you could do me a slightly unofficial favor maybe the woman said doubtfully youve got contacts with your american counterparts in their battle monuments department yes do they have their second world war dead on computer yes she said again to save me time could you give them a call to see where lieutenant george timpson is buried could it help with our problem over the three missing visits she asked anxiously it very well could said charlie smoothly i like to know about visits to timpsons grave too the clerk only had to hold for the time it took the americanofficial to check his arlington virginia register alphabetically lieutenant george timpson had been killed according to the file on the same day as simon norrington and was supposedly buried in plot in the american cemetery at margraten in the netherlands into the telephone the woman said no we dont understand it here either of course ill let you know she put the telephone down and said to charlie they dont have any supporting dockets for the five visits to timpsons grave either this is incredible something like that agreed charlie she nodded to the telephone you wont tell anyone i did that will you i wont if you wont when charlie got back to the kempinski lieutenant colonel rupert jackson was in the foyer and charlie decided hed already learned more from the mans presence than the military attache was going to discover from waiting so patiently charlie parted from the military attache after an hour and two malts insisting he was flying directly back to moscow and used the public telephones in the lobby to avoid the switchboard natalia answered at once expectantly hearing charlie through to the end before bringing him up to date i agree with lestov said charlie two people at the same time from tsarskoe selo cant be a coincidence whats her name charlies hesitation at being told lasted so long that natalia thought theyd been disconnected calling his name charlie said larisa krotkov is the woman next to timpson in the photograph ive got in front of me right now now it was natalias turn to remain silent for several moments what about the statement lestov suggested make it said charlie its true isnt it but have lestov get back to tsarskoe selo for anything they might have about her hes already doing that this make anything clearer to you not yet what about novikov and his family could the lead come from whatever the doctor knew shouldnt take any time at all ive approved his application sufficient for me to go to london though he was still unsurewhether it would be necessary to go to america so he decided against mentioning it he was glad he had when natalia said but not for any longer than necessary remember the directorgeneral was just as quick personally answering his direct line and like natalia let charlie talk without interruption thats preposterous it fits prove it allow me to sir rupert deans hampstead house adjoined the heath and had an expansive garden of its own adding to the intended country impression as he walked up the long low hedgelined path charlie saw a woman wearing a shapeless gardening hat and gloves among a jungle of largeleafed greenery in a conservatory attached to the right of the house it was she who answered the door a trowel still in her hand the hair beneath the hat was gray and a face that had never known makeup was unlined and tranquil she smiled as if he were an old friend hes expecting you she said when charlie identified himself appearing aware of the trowel she said repotting xerophytes theyre not as hardy as everyone thinks they are you know you need to be careful i wouldnt know i dont have a garden said charlie following her into the house he wondered if shed have any use for the nowredundant beekeepers hat the room to which she directed charlie was a true bibliophiles library every available space was shelved from floor to ceiling but there was no obvious order to their packedtogether oneontopoftheother contents books of every size hodgepodged unevenly togetherwaiting to be read or reread not assembled for wall decoration others overflowed onto the floor forming tiny battlements dean sat beneath a bright reading lamp in front of a dead fireplace its emptiness unsurprisingly filled with a profusion of still more greenery the book was bastardsized the cover print original german the disheveled former university professor nodded charlie toward a chair on the opposite side of the fireplace on a table alongside was a clothcovered plate dean said you wont have eaten jane made sandwiches thats very kind said charlie they were cheese and pickle her idea not mine said the directorgeneral its scotch isnt it charlie saw that was what dean was drinking thank you i wont say cheers refused dean im not sure weve got anything to be cheerful about probably not said charlie i dont want a full summation ordered the older man that can wait until tomorrow i want an explanation for what you told me on the telephone the department has been set up all of us repeated charlie weve never been expected to solve or discover anything we were told from the outset there would be a coverup if it turned out to be embarrassing stopped dean they know what the embarrassment is insisted charlie have from the beginning not from the finding of the bodies but long before then and it has been covered up for god knows how long the yakutsk grave was an inconvenience something never expected to happen there has had to be the appearance of an investigation particularly because of all the publicity but not the sort we thought there was what weve been doingive been doingis proving whether or not the coverup is going to hold the directorgeneral raised his hand stop who are they i dont know admitted charlie a government department ministry but i dont know which one our own people thats what i believe as i believe the moment we find somethingtaking us where were not supposed to go theyll clean it up before we get there america has to be involved too picked up charlie again i dont know how or again which department or agency you basing this entirely on some missing cemetery records charlie offered the berlin group photograph hed been allowed to copy at the document center youll recognize the man on the left as the american found in yakutsk his name was george timpson his phony grave is in a dutch cemetery i dont know why the netherlands i was told there arent any american war cemeteries in berlin timpson is supposed to have died the same day as norrington all evidence of five visits to timpsons grave has disappeared just like those to norrington there could be a far more reasonable explanation a lot differenttotally differentfrom what youre drawing dont forget the number of departments and ministries whove got a hand in this im not forgetting that for a moment said charlie urgently im asking why okay a lot of other departments have a legitimate interest but weve been given the investigation so whys it stayed as diverse as it has youve shared everything weve discovered right right agreed dean thoughtfully those are my instructions whats been reciprocated from here let alone america demanded charlie the only echo weve got as far as i understand is that all the records and files have either been destroyed or cant be found he paused gulping his drink if we hadnt had that scrap of label that took us to gieves and hawkes we wouldnt have got norringtons name and if we hadnt done thatand got the family through itwed be no further forward than the day we began because the only information about norrington has come from his family we havent been offered a single thing from another single supposedly interested or involved department here in england or from america according to the military attache in berlin the ministry of defense is in uproar because i went to the exhumation theyre sending in their own investigators with so many peoplecountries already in on the act theres not a chance in hell ofgetting close enough to understand anythingthe perfect way to create the perfect confusion dean leaned forward adding to charlies glass its an argument he conceded reluctantly the sort of argument that builds unsupported conspiracy theories into accepted fact i thought the journalists in that hotel dining room were lucky not to be more badly hurtkilled evenby henry packer didnt you dean sighed nodding youre asking me to trust you over my own operational group knowinglyconsciouslyto deceive them patrick pacey is the political officer listed charlie his function is to liaise politically with the very departmentsand the intelligence committee itselfwho arent reciprocating to us jeremy simpson would have to consider everything legally your deputy is your deputy subservient to you gerald williams is only concerned with finance wouldnt normally be part of the group charlie paused all im asking for is timetime to work without knowing someones going to be ahead of me every step of the way charlie paused to make his point if id wanted to deceive themand youi could have you ordered me back to investigate anywhere i felt it necessary im telling you why i think its necessary how do you intend using this time youre asking for ive got names from berlin and others germans from the gulag i want to establish the connection im sure exists and i want to speak to norringtons family and i want to do it without people knowing in advance that im going to without meeting packers successor when the directorgeneral didnt speak charlie said all im asking to be allowed to do is work by the same rules as everyone else and not have to put forward my interpretation that were being blocked by our own people im not sure anyone else would have given you as much time to argue that interpretation as i already have said the directorgeneral charlie said theres a second interpretation i believe you should consider what demanded dean our departmentnow your departmentwasnt in any way apart of whatever happened before or after when these murders were committed once more dean did not respond so after fifty years with an undecided remit and an even more undecided future we were the obvious choice when the bodies were found werent we continued charlie a test for us desperate to prove ourselves a test for otherswhoever they areanxious to know if the concealment thus far is good enough to withstand an investigation remain a mystery forever but not that anxious theyve got the final say before it becomes final if we get too close they can misdirect or close it all down citing without explanation the embarrassment theyve already insisted to be the primary concern but to keep everything properly hidden no one is going to be able to know what the embarrassment is are they so theres an easy answer were made to be seen to fail which makes us even more vulnerable to everyone snapping at our heels thats pretty convoluted logic protested dean but it is logic for the environment we live in insisted charlie not even in national archives closed for the next fifty or a hundred years will there be an admission of a secret thats literally been buried for the last fifty itll be our inability properly to fulfill the investigatory role were trying to establish against all the other competing agencies how about a secondor even thirdagenda if we dont get beyond all the obstruction of our own peoplequite apart from that of america or russiato find out everything theres every reason to disband us were set to be the losers any which way there was a further long silence this time for the incredulous directorgeneral to find the words he eventually said you have any more conspiracy theories or is this the last thats it said charlie our only protection is to find out everything only by knowing it all can we defend ourselves but more importantly defend myself and natalia and sasha although not in that order or priority im compromised arent i by having agreed to meet you like this no said charlie this meeting never took place would you swear to that under oath if this evening was ever discovered and put before a tribunal inquiry yes said charlie at once if its morallyand philosophicallyright for a wartime general knowingly to sacrifice the lives of eight hundred men to save those of eight thousand isnt it morallyand philosophicallyright to tell a small lie to establish a more important truth no refused the other man just as quickly your morality and your philosophy dont work any more than your logic they do if i discover that truth insisted charlie thats whats going to keep us in existence and me in moscow he thought what happens if you fail to discover it i wont because i cant charlie mentally added you havent eaten your sandwiches said the older man theyre very good charlie said politely beginning at last the pickles homemade said dean jane does her own she likes growing things i cant get anything like this in moscow perhaps she could find you a pot before you leave that would be very kind dont ever imagine that this evening has established any special backchannel situation between us will you no sir good never take my inexperience for softheartedness after more than a week of being starved of any apparent progress the moscow announcement of a further although unspecified development caused the renewed media uproar that vadim lestov had predicted having finally returned to give us an explanation you cant explain it attacked gerald williams eagerly and at once hed definitely made his mind up anything he could do to show up the mans inability would all contribute to what he intended at the end cunt thought charlie the seating arrangements put him at the bottom of the table with the control group pincering him from either side which charlie supposed would be the composition of the sort of tribunal sir rupert dean had talked about the previous night to which hed said hed have no difficulty lying under oath charlie remembered doing just that without an oath he said not abouttodays announcement no but as it has been announced ill obviously be told wont i will you demanded williams for the most fleeting of moments charlie allowed himself to imagine the effect upon the overweight man if hed said just how sure he now was of being told and by whom he contented himselfonly justby saying trust me the financial directors face mottled at the awareness of being mocked but before he could speak jocelyn hamilton said weve heard through the foreign office that the fbi has been on from the american embassy in moscow wanting to speak to you shes been on to cartright too hurried in williams determined that nothing should be left out so it could be a breakthrough finished the deputy directorgeneral if its that important perhaps this is a mistimed visit i ordered the recall reminded dean it will be easy enough for me to return miriam bells call from here later said charlie it wasnt miriam bells style to chase like this so she was panicking so too were the foreign office and mi everyone running around like chickens with their heads cut off but who was wielding the ax considering your apparent belief that another english officer was involved you seem remarkably relaxed suggested hamilton that above all else is what we need to discuss said patrick pacey the political officer perhaps wed get a more comprehensive picture if we let charlie talk without so much interruption proposed the directorgeneral a comprehensive picture would be very welcomed if its at all possible said williams overstressing the condescension fuck you like you want so badly to fuck me thought charlie while he sat waiting he decided that although he scarcely needed any preparation the previous nights neverhappened encounter with the directorgeneral had been more than a useful rehearsal sifting in his mind the gold nuggets to keep back from the obscuring silt reminded by the same conversation charlie decided that so many organizations agencies and people were involved that there was absolutely no risk of his inadvertently even hinting at his very specialsource abruptly disconcertingly charlie was seized by the thought that hed missed something failed to realize or recognize something that he should have the men at the table began to shift impatientlyjeremy simpson very obviously looking questioningly at the political officerand charlie tried to push the unsettling impression aside but only partially succeeded he had to force the intended ridicule i thought id wait to make sure the finance director had finished gerald williamss face flooded red before the man could speak dean said tightly i think were all waiting and charlie acknowledged hed gone too far he still thought fuck it then he thought bullshit baffles brains and set out his encapsulation in what appeared great detail beginning chronologically from the reindeer herders discovery of the bodies he went through the first and second autopsies itemizing what hadand had notbeen found in the grave and on the bodies he gave a lot of time to the entrapping press conferenceconscious of gerald williamss smirk at the admission of being trickedto illustrate the animosity between yakutskaya and russia he talked of gulag being a special prison although keeping back his first nugget the names of the fifteen german prisoners who had been there in neither did he say anything about his full discovery from the document center in berlin and he didnt disclose the name of the dead american as george timpson with their artconnected background the presence of raisa belous and simon norrington had in some way to be linked to looted nazi art treasure a suggestion charlie offered with the reminder that raisa had belonged to the specially formed russian trophy brigade that matched and at times exceeded the nazis in moscows indiscriminate art rape of europe the injuries to the skeleton in the berlin grave proved charlie insisted that the man had been killed to provide the identity for simon norrington from dog tags and personal items stripped at yakutsk and put on the berlin body the face of the victim had been destroyed beyond recognition all teeth smashed and no finger endsand therefore no possible fingerprintsleft killed to order demanded jeremy simpson the prescient lawyer are you suggesting norrington was killed to order a farreaching carefully calculated conspiracy it fits asserted charlie unworried by the obvious disbelief from everyone in the room even shared maybe by sir rupert himself what concerned charlie more was the still persistent intrusive feeling of having overlooked something stuff and nonsense sneered williams who never swore addressing the lawyer williams said is there anything weve been told this morning that youd be prepared to argue in a court and expect to be taken seriously id like better proof conceded simpson uncomfortable at being charlies critic instead of his defender pedantically he said your main premise that there was another englishman at the murder scene is the apparent finding in the grave of a button from a british officers battledress uniform as well as a tornout label and britishcaliber bullet but we dont definitely know about the button thats based on a remark the yakutsk pathologist thinks he overheard the russian forensic scientist make when the man was using his laboratory facilities yes said charlie accepting it to be his weakest evasion but with no way of telling them how he knew the button to exist what on earth does a yakutsk medical examiner know about an english officers battle dress or its fastenings demanded hamilton absolutely nothing snatched charlie which is why he couldnt have misheard or imagined the remark moscow knew it was an apparent british officer before sending their forensic expert who would obviously have been chosen for knowledge beyond his particular discipline he would have known what a british uniformand its buttonslooked like on second thought maybe it wasnt as weak as it had initially sounded the rehearsal really had been useful i think the suggestion is absurd rejected williams does the report of the berlin pathologist state that the body in norringtons grave was murdered this really was going far better than he could have hoped williams thought the man was being made to look ridiculous no admitted charlie that would be impossible after so long so its purely your interpretation sneered williams the body was chosen to be that of simon norringtonhad themans identity planted on it charlie pointed out if gerald williams hadnt existed he would have had to be invented the mans unthinking determination to oppose and argue with everything was taking all their minds from any awkward questions most importantly charlie was able so far to avoid volunteering anything new you think it could have been the russians who tampered with the visitors records at the cemetery asked patrick pacey it could even have been possible charlie accepted but he had to be careful with the reply the russians took berlintotally controlled it initiallyand were responsible i suppose for the burials during those early days but the four powers were in control when the allied cemetery was created if thered been colored ribbons and a stake tall enough he could have led everyone a merry dance around the maypole he was aware of the directorgeneral regarding him quizzically i dont consider theres anything to support the idea of another british officer being involved in this insisted the political officer siding with williams i expected a lot more from this meeting so did i said hamilton in fact said williams recognizing his support i think you should go back to moscow as soon as possible pick up whatever crumbs drop from the table of others and leave us to reach far more sensible and acceptable conclusions than youre offering charlie gazed unspeaking at the fat man for several seconds aware at last what had been nagging him the feeling at once relief more than apprehension quietly almost humbly he said there are some more inquiries i want to make here first which ive approved came in the directorgeneral quickly ahead of any opposing argument theres certainly the need to speak again to sir matthew norrington isnt the more immediate urgency finding out what the fbi in moscow wants as well as what this latest russian declaration is all about demanded hamilton charlie was almost sad at the adjournment so well did he consider the encounter to have been going but it gave him time fully to consider gerald williamss slip the assertion to sir rupert dean the previous night that williamss participation was entirely financial was unarguable how then could williams have known that miriambell had been in contact with richard cartright unless he in turn had been in direct touch with the sis officer in moscow cartrights communication route was through his own separate department which in turn according to regulations should have advised the directorgeneralas the foreign office had told the political officernot the finance director so gerald williams was talking unofficially to richard cartright who in moscow had formed some relationship with natalias sister what silly men charlie thought what silly silly men the connection from a side office off the directorgenerals suite was immediate miriam said you dont write you dont phone you dont send flowers forced cool judged charlie you called you didnt before you left it was a rush you still in london keep the pot bubbling decided charlie people arent happy maintaining the pretense he said particularly when im here and moscows issuing enigmatic statements its something to do with tsarskoe selo is all i know i dont know how it fits if it fits at all although i suppose its got to somehow lestov wants to know when youre getting back charlie frowned not just at the immediately volunteered informationwhich he knew from natalia to be accuratebut more at the tone of miriams voice whats the matter problems with washington i could do with your being back here talk through some stuff when are you getting back a few things to sort out here first you want to talk now later but not too much later and you watch your back you hear you think i need to asked charlie seriously yeah i think you need to maybe we both do you think this new tsarskoe selo stuff is important charlie pushed on lestov says itll take a few days to sort out there was his excuse for not immediately returning charlie recognized still more possibly you called the embassy twice thought we had a deal wondered what happened to it ignoring her implied question he said you spoke to cartright my call got redirected anything wrong not at all assured charlie who hadnt initiated such an arrangement obvious person to backstop there really are things to talk about when you get back now that she was working to her own different agenda there was no reason why she shouldnt tell charlie of the conversation with kenton peters although she wouldnt throw it away she wouldnt offer too quickly what shed gotten from the world jewish congress either she had a lot of things to trade to buy insurance with by the time charlie got back to the conference room the coffee was cold they didnt bother to reassemble for the result of his phone call it seems very much like the blind leading the blind said williams but wholl be seeing more clearly by the time its all over wondered charlie richard cartright wasnt happy with the way things had evolved it was for all intents and purposes a combined operation that initially and on the face of it had made quite acceptable his talking as he had with gerald williams but he wasnt sure any longer from the sheer restriction of anything and everything he was begrudgingly being allowed to know by his own departmentagainst their constant and unremitting demands for any scrap from himit had become increasingly obvious this was a very important assignment indeed for someone on his first tour of duty and that it was anything but the combined operation hed first imagined it to be and now he was trapped on the one hand hed already cooperated too much with someone from another department suddenly to seek authorization for doing so from his own controllers which too late he now realized he should have done from the start on the other and by the same measure he didnt see how he could abruptly refuse not knowing how much power or influence gerald williams possessed youre not saying a lot complained irena the man she believed to be mafia was in the restaurant again and if the evening didnt pick up soon she was considering changing partners sorry things on my mind seen natalia lately irena shrugged we had a row so you didnt know charlie was back in london permanently just a discussion recall as far as i know probably banking his profits suggested irena not a bank id trust in this city cartright regretted most of all telling williams of charlie muffin boasting of currency speculation i cant think youre right about that you imagine he could afford that apartment any other way it was difficult acknowledged cartright although if charlie muffin was doing something as bloody silly as that it did justify his cooperation with the mans finance controller it was a total mess and he desperately wanted to be out of it after driving parallel to it for what seemed forever charlie decided that the redbricked perimeter of sir matthew norringtons kingsclere estate must have been modeled on the great wall of china although probably went on for much longer the gate he finally located opened noiselessly to his identifying himself at the security voice box and closed just as quickly behind him the wall was lined inside by trees and there were more meticulously cultivated on either side of the paved drive that ribboned away ahead of him he could not see the house through the trees to his left there was a herd of disinterested unafraid deer he thought there were some white ones but wasnt sure to his right sheep grazed far beyond them too far away to distinguish man from machine a figure rode a disappearing tractor over the brow of a hill tufted with more trees would this have been the scene of perfect safe tranquillity that simon norrington thought about kneeling in front of a grenademade grave on the outskirts of yakutsk waiting for a pistol shot not suspecting its length charlie had not timed how long it took to circumnavigate the outer wall it was a full five minutes before the house came into view a huge square pilegeorgian charlie guessedwith creeperclad walls and a flagpole on the central turret for the proudly flying red cross on white pennant the whole thing a monument to the permanence of the english landed class sir matthew norrington waited by one of three parked range rovers whitehaired tweedsuited and brogued the spectacles were hornrimmed as he got out of the rented car charlie decided it was impossible to decide between his or the other mans whose suit was the more comfortably shapeless norrington said at once glad to see you i want to understand what this is all about the voice was firm like the handshake i dont fully understand myself but ill do my best promised charlie but you are definitely in charge of the investigation thats what sir rupert said on the phone there was an impatience in the question yes said charlie i wish he thought the house into which the elderly man led him was as comfortably lived in as the suit and charlie decided that perhaps it wasnt a monument to anything after all the cavernous flagstoned entrance hall was lined with oil paintings which continued along a paneled corridor aware of charlies interest norrington said the holbein and the reynolds are ancestral but a lot of the more modern collection was simons choice its thought to be quite remarkable the door at which norrington stopped was halfway along the hall from the far end of whichor maybe from another roomthere was the sound of people a dog barked very briefly the library into which norrington took charlie was more neatly arranged than sir rupert deans but at the same time more obviously occupied there were more framed oils men in ermine and robes bejeweled women and velvetdressed children with ringlets and spaniel pets but there was an obvious working desk dominating the window looking out over the rolling grounds charlie was immediately aware of a lot of photographs on its top and even more practically overcrowding on side tables at either end of the huge inglenooked fireplace he recognized a lot of simon norrington two in the uniform the man hadbeen wearing in the yakutsk ice tomb another had him in graduation gown with a man charlie assumed to be his father whod looked remarkably similar to sir matthew norrington now there was a photograph of a teenage matthew smiling up toward simon in visible bigger brother admiration the chairs also by the fireplace were leather which creaked when they sat norrington said tell me what this is all about it was the voice of a man accustomed to being obeyed charlie left out all his supposition and suspicions and anything about a second english officer so it only took minutes id expected more the dissatisfied baronet said at once with a frown i wish there were more apologized charlie meaning it they were planned killings of my brother and the man in his grave in berlin undoubtedly why him i dont yet know how or why but i believe art is the most obvious factor something to do with its looting but not that by itself theres a lot more simon despised the nazis rosenbergs lot for what they did to art and the russians trophy brigades judged one as bad as the other he knew it would be impossible to reassemble the european art heritage no matter how hard he and others like him tried the man stopped pointedly you imagine youll ever find out who killed him charlie hesitated who committed the actual murders probably not not after fifty years they would have been functionaries which was true he realized it had been a russian bullet that killed simon norrington what about the people who ordered it thats who im trying to find if i do well know why norrington stirred in his chair which creaked again what are your chances a lie wouldnt help and charlie didnt want to slip sideways into his theories and guesses either id like them to be better id appreciate a lot of your time norrington shrugged as much as you need he got up i drink gin whiskey the old man returned from a separate side table with their drinks settled noisily and said so you were what sixteen when it happened charlie spoke looking at the young matthew gazing up at his elder brother just seventeen at the wars end felt cheated was an officer cadet at eton all ready to go wanted to go even more when simon was killed thought it had been in action then of course imagined id find the actual person who did it the man snorted humorlessly some irony about that now isnt there lets hope not said charlie you can remember everything about the time not simply the death but immediately before and afterwards all of it everything from the family recalled charlie remembering the berlin conversation with the military attache charlie indicated the photographs of simon norrington on the table closest to him and said he wasisobviously deeply mourned my father was devastated we all were naturally but my father took it dreadfully the war was over for gods sake charlie thought it was too much to hope but he hoped just the same how did you learn the older man frowned letter official notification june third that was encouraging thought charlie there were some personal belongings returned arrived much later from his unit cigarette lighterit matched a case my father gave simon when he graduatedhis wallet family ring there was a personal letter of regret too of course from his commanding officer and then there was the notification of the burial coaxed charlie there was another snorted empty laugh of the wrong man but you visited the grave once with my father he was annoyed that we hadnt been asked about the body that it had been already buried weve got our own chapel and vault here in the grounds but there was a dedicationservice in berlin and afterwards we decided to leave simon we thought it was simon where he was how many times did you go just the once with my father for the service it was an official affair for a lot of families with relatives there charlie was immediately alert to the qualification was there any sort of registration at the official ceremony not then but i went again by myself on the first supposed anniversary my father was ill by then couldnt travel there was some formfilling nonsense that time charlie realized hed drifted away from the directions in which hed been heading but decided to finish this now how many other times did you go need to fill in the visitors form that was the only occasion said norrington father had a commemorative plaque put into the chapel we could mourn well enough here which almost brought him back on track charlie recognized who else from the family apart from you visited the grave you thought was simons no one the man frowned why do you ask im trying to build up as complete a picture as i can charlie avoided not wanting to enter stillunexplored territory quickly he said you mourned here yes charlie indicated the picturecrowded tables and desk again you kept a lot of photographs yes there was a defensive sharpness in the questioning reply what about other things did you keep the notification of simons deaththe personal things that were returned i told you my father was devastated in the first two or three years it was almost a shrine it worried me sometimes it worked to hope against hope charlie decided do you still have it all yes father kept everything so i did too dont rush charlie warned himself it still might be another blind alley this was going far better than hed expected and there stillmight be more norrington could help with and there were the names from berlin later when weve talked some more could i see it all norrington hesitated could it help you find the people youre looking for its my best chance so far replied charlie honestly some of the letters are personal letters i told you father kept a lot of stuff letters that simon wrote when he got posted abroad and before now it was charlie who hesitated and when he spoke he did so slowly not wanting to lose the chance sir matthew i have what could be leads to whoever murdered your brother but i dont know how to follow them how in fact to take this investigation very much further what you have of your brothers might show me then you must see it all agreed norrington at once now lets talk a little more said charlie there had to be something in what was promised by the sheer law of averages and the way his luck was running there had to be something that took him forward which made waiting a minutea second close to impossibly difficult but he kept to the determination not to hurry get it all he reminded himself an inch at a time a step at a time what else can i tell you questioned the baronet he got up to go to the drinks tray charlie shook his head against the gestured invitation it was big jump wasnt it from free french liaison at the war office to a special artlooting unit norrington frowned on his way back to his chair you dont know anything at all about simon do you he didnt and it made this encounter too long overdue charlie conceded although refusing completely to blame his personal situation in moscow there had been reason enough to remain there as long as he had the ministry of defense cant find any records about your brother norringtons smile was slow an expression of belated understanding he didnt tell me that it came close to charlies breath being taken away by a deluge offittingly iced water who didnt tell you what sir norrington got up again went to his desk and took the small rectangle of pasteboard from a top drawer burbage lionel burbage defense ministry said there was a confusion about the records which was why he wanted what i had the icedwater feeling stayed with charlie did he take them asked to but i wouldnt let him like im not going to let you allowed him to read them as you can thats all charlie began to feel warm again not just at the reassurance but at his determination not to hurry when was this four days ago hed met lieutenant colonel rupert jackson the military attache in berlin five days ago it fit the urgency of the ministry of defense panic did you make your brothers letter available to him didnt come into the conversation he asked specifically about the official war office communications and thats all he saw thats why i asked you when you got here if you were in charge of the investigation although sir rupert had already told me you were when he telephoned what did burbage tell you that he was i am insisted charlie its been a problem from the beginning too many departments getting in each others way norrington nodded in further understanding burbage asked me to tell him if anyone else approached me about simon did you tell him i was coming norrington shook his head i didnt know you were then decided to wait see you first hear what you had to say i certainly dont know of him but it makes sense to stop this duplication which i will can i have burbages number norrington carried the card back with the whiskey decanter adding unasked to charlies glass all that was listed was the name and a telephone number no ministry was identified neither was any department norrington said you havent told me what youve got to say mr muffin not properly not why for instance sir rupert asked me when we originally spoke to keep secret the discovery of my brothers body in some place id never heard of nor make anypublic announcement about finally burying him as he should be buried after all these years i think ive been remarkably patient but now that patience has gone shit thought charlie shit shit shit family pride he told himself desperately family pride and honor your brother was officially in berlin his death there was accepted his being in yakutsk is considered even now something that shouldnt be made public until we find out why and how he came to be thereto be one of at least four victims in a planned killingits still considered a potential national problem thats very difficult for me to accept or understand its even more difficult for me to ask you to accept or understand pleaded charlie which is why im asking you for all the help i can get my brother would not under any circumstances have done anything wrong illegal or unofficial he was proud to be an officer to serve his country an opening charlie recognized he couldnt have been where he was unofficially he was obeying an order which was what i told you when we first began talking what im trying to do is find out who gave that order which it would seem the ministry of defense is also trying to find out if burbage was from the ministry of defense which charlie now doubted according to the newspapers the americans consider their officer to have been a hero theres a heros burial planned why hasnt the same been saidplannedabout simon and why was i asked to say nothing do nothing about burying him the american is being buried as an unknown victim seized charlie your brother wont be after ive found out the truth then maybe hell be accorded the honor hes due no agreed norrington quietly simon wont be buried as an unknown and i dont want any maybes about his being accorded every honor to which hes entitled im not given to threats mr muffinthe need to prove myself so what i am going to say isnt a threat its a statement of fact i am not without official influenceaccess to private as well as public platforms i am prepared totally and fully to cooperate with you in every way i am asked but with a time limit unless i am convinced otherwiseand you must understandi will take a very great deal of convincingi will announce two weeks from today that it was simons body in the yakutsk grave i will disclose that somebody else was killed to fill a grave in his name in berlin and i shall demand a public inquiry into the circumstances of both deaths and although it will offend me deeply i shall turn my brothers burial here into a media event i dont of course expect you to be the messenger ill telephone sir rupert to tell him myself do you think what ive said is unreasonable charlie said i think youve already shown a great deal of patience and im grateful for another two weeks in your position id have probably kept it to one norringtons smile was abrupt and open interesting reply when i said roughly the same to burbage he said hed stop me doing anything under the official secrets act and when i told him i wasnt a signatory to it he told me i didnt know what i was talking about and that it didnt matter whether id signed it or not thats the real reason i didnt call him when i agreed to your coming didnt like the fellow very rude but far more important very stupidly indiscreet bullying like that suddenly reminded of richard cartright charlie decided the standard was definitely going down charlie refused the offer of lunch from norringtons willowy blond fourth wife who said to call her davinia and whom he guessed to be half the baronets age instead he accepted rare beef sandwiches he didnt get around to eating at the borrowed library desk working steadily through the two wooden boxes of personal effects under the frozen smiling gaze from three pictures of the man whose mysteries he was trying to solve he did so careful to retain the exact order in which each item had been kept not removing one until that which preceded it had been replaced the crocodile wallet was an early disappointment it contained simon norringtons english driving license and visiting cards in his own nameboth necessary and easy identification charlie acknowledgedbut no one elses cards letters photographs or anything connecting him to berlin or his unit his army pay book was endorsed for his pay to be credited automatically to a coutts bank account on the strand and although he didnt expect it to lead to thelonglost army records charlie made a note of the pay book number charlie looked over it all laid out on the desk in front of him every item perfectly preserved intact and undamaged despite its age how he asked himself could it have been accepted apparently without a single question carried as it would have been in the breast or inside pockets of the uniform it shouldand wouldhave all been totally destroyed by the massive force of whatever had killed the substitute berlin victim the official notification of simon norringtons death was as cold as the grave in which the man had lain for fifty years a formal printed notice with the choice of striking out sir or madam whichever was inappropriate and gaps in the text for the details of names relationship and date of death to be inserted by hand charlie got the first of what he considered important information from the handwritten letter of condolence to the father from norringtons commanding officer a colonel who signed himself john parnell and which was dated july after the predictable eulogy of norringtons bravery and dedication to duty it read i cannot of course disclose the nature of simons very special work in these most recent months but i can say he was the only person in the unit with the very necessary qualifications to carry it out neither can i give any precise details of how or when he died although of course we have made strenuous efforts to discover both his body was returned to us from a russianoccupied part of the city the russian documentation merely indicates that he was found dead by russian troops on or around may you will be aware that at that time there was still sporadic fighting in berlin an indication of the bravery of your noncombatant son to which i have already referred so much and yet so little agonized charlie easing briefly back into the bucket chair which creaked like all the other leather furniture what was the work so very special that only the noncombatant lieutenant simon norrington was able to undertake it in the russian sector of berlin in which there was still fighting but who hadnt been there at all but thousands of miles away there were thirtytwo letters all still in their envelopes and all indated sequence which was how charlie read them searching for people with whom norrington had worked particularly for references to the names hed gotten from the berlin photograph a jessica appeared in the third letter addressed from london when norrington was clearly still attached to the war office and by the fourth it was obvious she was employed there with him from the way the next was written shed spent a weekend at kingsclere norrington had been glad his father liked her as much as he did but she disappeared from the correspondence just before norringtons transfer to the artloss unit norrington was relieved at the transfer bloody french go on all the time as if i was personally responsible for dunkirk and seem to forget we got almost as many of their soldiers out as we did our own there wasnt another name until charlie was halfway through and then it was clearly a nickname scotty norrington described him as a good man salt of the earth but hard there were frequent references after that but none of them hinted at particular friendship more admiration then there was someone identified only as j and as more single initials followed charlie guessed disappointed at norringtons own effort to obey wartime censorship rules j was a tyrant but fair who knows his art hh was a bully whod clearly made an early choice about being a criminal himself and decided to step the other way over the line and then there was the appearance of g at which charlie felt the tingle of recognition as he read the letter was dated february g was brilliant i sit at his feet g saw telltale brush detaildespite his problemwhich norrington missed three fakes in one day its good to know the nazis were cheated but it would have been even better if we thought theyd paid good money instead of stealing them by march they were a twoman team with the highest identification rate in the combined group it was exhilarating to be so immediately close to it all but the scale of the pillaging is indescribable so much lost that will never be recovered practically every letter written after norrington had been posted to europe exhorted his father to keep matthew from enlisting whatever you have to do war was filthy men were animals it was inconceivable what one could do to another i dont want matthew seeing what ive seen hearing what ive heard doing what ive done to conform and despised myself for not being brave enough not to do it the lastletter was dated april the concluding sentence read it truly will be over soon i shall be coming home finally after fiftyfour years thought charlie hardly soon enough well demanded sir matthew norrington from the doorway your brother probably does deserve a heros recognition said charlie give it to him then i need to talk more said charlie always more he thought tell me about your brother asked charlie simply simon was the golden boy declared norrington at once and admiringly there was nothing he couldnt do or achieve usually twice as quickly and twice as well as anybody else everything came naturally easily to him our mother was french so we grew up bilingual i stopped there but simon didnt he was practically as fluent in german and went on from greekwhich he took as part of art historyto more than passable russian he spoke german and russian seized charlie there was a reassuring foot twinge both very well confirmed norrington abruptly recalling what now seemed a longago half thought charlie said what about reading it of course said norrington appearing surprised at the qualification he read both as well as he spoke both he left the war office at the end of to join the specialized art unit yes but obviously didnt go to europe until after june after the invasion almost immediately after before the end of june that was his job trying to identify the national heritages that had been plundered and trace where theyd gone he needed quick access to captured germans before they were dispersed as fifteen germans were dispersed to yakutsk recalled charlie did he ever get leave come home after being posted abroad once said norrington december father had his first heart attack simon was in belgium then i think wherever hewangled a compassionate trip just fortyeight hours did you talk about what he was doing of course it upset him the degree of nazi looting it was so complete whole museums galleries stripped charlie paused unsure how to phrase his question hoping for the answer he wanted but not wanting to lead what about anything else norrington who had resumed his former seat stared steadily across at charlie you need to explain that did you ever get the impression from anything that simon said that his function had been in any way expandedthat hed been given a role beyond the location and recovery of looted art norrington took a long time to answer nothing specific the man said finally what wasnt specific persisted charlie refusing to give up there was something about the languages he could speakthat he was often called upon by other people in other units to help them did he say which other units the older man shook his head not that i can remember he couldnt avoid leading charlie accepted nothing about military intelligence intelligence of any sort no said norrington positively who was jessica demanded charlie abandoning one direction for another one of the personal things i mentioned charlie waited someone he met in london there was talk of an engagement they had a flat in pimlico he had to interpret one night at a reception churchill de gaulle a lot of roosevelts staff america was in the war by late remember there was an air raid when he got back to pimlico their block had been destroyed by a land mine jessica was one of the ten who died what about people simon worked with charlie hurried on did he talk about any in particular refer to anyone as a friend again norrington took his time there were things in the letters but not until after he went back for the last time that december i never knew who they were i want to put some names to you said charlie taking from his pocket the list from the berlin group photograph i know it was a long time ago but one might trigger something i doubt it but lets try wilson no allison no larisa krotkov russian yes i dont ever remember him talking of working with russians what about using the language no smith no raisa belous shes the woman found in the grave the russian woman yes i suppose he must have known her mustnt he you dont remember his ever mentioning her no bellamy no timpson no dunne no jacobson no silence fell between them norrington said who are they people i believe simon worked with whered you get the names america said charlie which was close enough to the truth some of them were american he worked with the russian women as well there was a connection i dont know what not yet would he ever charlie asked himself im sorry apologized norrington he gestured over his shoulder toward the two repacked boxes i know everything there by heart if thered been a hint i would have recognized it i was waiting for an obvious scots name for scotty the man paused ive already spoken to sir rupert told him what i told you about my time limit what did he say that he hoped youd meet the deadline so do i said charlie the media release brought the american woman back but not the englishman demanded nikulin yes said natalia there were just the two of them in the chief of staffs office hed served tea and sweetmeats and he hasnt been in contact not since the day he left it had been a bad mistake for charlie not to have telephoned lestov theres no doubt that the button found in the grave was british none said natalia uncomfortably they must know who the second man was have an identity they want to hide possibly everyone knows stalin was a monster that the regime then is not the government of today why dont we turn the announcement of this new discovery into the finding of the evidence of a second mystery briton put pressure upon them we could even keep our understanding of cooperation tell london what were going to do before we do it and wed have to tell them direct if their man isnt here wouldnt we exposing charlie to every sort of criticism natalia thought how could she manipulate a delay i dont understand how the woman larisa krotkov can have disappeared so completely you think youre being blocked yes exaggerated natalia eagerly then lets see if the obstruction extends to the presidents office accepted nikulin perhaps we should wait until we establish thatand a reason if it is the casebefore moving on the british idea not for much longer determined the man so far weve been ahead in virtually everything thats how i want us to stay on the other side of moscow fyodor ivanovich belous nervously opened the door of his apartment only sufficiently to see it was vadim lestov backed by a threeman squad dont be shy fyodor ivanovich said the militia colonel weve come back for a second look the telephone was lifted at the first ring a mans voice toneless and nameless said yes charlie said i understand youre interested in a lieutenant simon norrington who died a long time ago a very long way from home who is this it would be a dedicated line and number equipped for instant trace but there would be no one in place and charlie had chosen a telephone on the platform of the euston underground station and estimated it would take them as much as thirty minutes maybe more to get anywhere near him and by then he would have gone as far as they were concerned in any of a dozen different directions someone else whos interested are you sure youve got the right number trying to prolong the conversation to get the trace all the buttons would have been pressed everyone mobilized waiting for the location charlie felt a flicker of nostalgia you tell me charlie was timing the call fortyfive seconds so far where did you get this number its been left with quite a few people hasnt it who gave it to you someone who was as interested in lieutenant norrington as we are the burbage identity would have only been on the card given to sir matthew and then logged personally against the baronet the contact pseudonym providing an instant trace to the source i meant the name of the person i know you did you seem well informed about certain things a full minute charlie noted it would be a mistake to disclose too much tradecraft he didnt try to speak over the loudspeaker announcement of a southbound train terminating at the oval which would be automatically recorded by the specially equipped telephone and mislead them to the northern line and about lieutenant norrington in particular i think we need to meet so did i they might just alert a local police stationthe transport police evenfor him to be held without explanation until they arrived hed allow himself another thirty seconds shall i come to you no ill come to you theyd imagine hed made a mistake where somewhere open obviously how about waterloo station thats convenient said charlie for them to imagine another slip how shall i recognize you tell me how to recognize you there was a pause ill wear a light fawn raincoat unbelted and i carry a closed umbrella as well as a copy of the evening standard in the same hand the left the old ways were still the best reflected charlie nostalgic again whereabouts on the station directly opposite platform fifteen time one oclock i wont be late lied charlie neither will i charlie cleaned the receiver which was sure to be checked for fingerprints with the handkerchief with which hed been careful toinsert the coins before briefly returning to ground level to cross to euston square for the circle line he made it before his feet began to protest one oclock gave them two and a half hours to get into position which was a lot a big team then a highalert designation theyd already be swamping the nothern line imagining from his convenience remark that he would use it to reach waterloo from euston it was immaterial in which direction he went the only need now to get away from euston as quickly as possible the first train to arrive was heading east and he got on settling himself for the long circuitous loop to the south it was only the beginning but charlie was pleased with the way it had gone he would obviously go through it entirely although he was already sure hed been speaking to an mi section controller he hoped things were going as well at his own headquarters building on the other side of the thames sir rupert dean had promised a team and there were only five obvious britons from their uniforms in the berlin photograph hopefully it would not be difficult to trace any who might still be alive charlie would still have preferred to do it himselftrusting no one but himself to do anything properlybut had deferred to the directorgenerals argument that the search and the sources were routine and that this had priority he checked his watch as the train turned south at liverpool street a third of the way in twelve minutes faster than hed estimated some would already be at waterloo by now getting into position gaining vantage points borrowing uniforms parking offduty taxis that would never ply for hire how many more charlie wondered were doomed to a days travel up and down the northern line and how many more than that would spend an even more frustrating day sitting on each of the intermediary stations between edgeware and morden mentally promising themselves if they ever discovered his name the pleasure of slowly castrating with a blunt and rusty penknife the bastard whod caused them such misery even with the necessary change at the embankment charlie still reached waterloo with an hour and threequarters to spare before the appointment he had no intention of keeping he ambled easily along the concourse establishing from the indicator board that trains from platform served local suburban stations equally casually he bought himself a ticket to windsor and on his way to the firstfloorstation bar purchased a selection of that days newspapers he had to drink standing at the bar for fifteen minutes before a table became vacant at the panoramic window overlooking the concourse itself immediately checking adjoining tables with the same view for anyone as prepared as himself for a long wait there wasnt anyone charlie worked his way through three disappointingly blended scotches four newspapersall of which kept the mystery russian announcement on their front pagesand was sure hed definitely identified a yellowjacketed cleaner sweeping the same stretch of the concourse a station attendant who didnt seem to know the answer to anyones question and a shuffling bottleclutching wino as the immediate watchers by twelve fortyfive when the fawnraincoated man with the evening standard and a tightly furled umbrella in his left hand actually emerged from platform on an arriving train and began studiously studying the display board almost at once the uniformed station attendant passed close and the sweeper chose a patch by the adjoining platform and charlie thought again that standards were definitely dropping the waiting mans impatience showed almost at once in constant attention to his watch and headtwisted checks to the station clock charlie remained where he was until onefifteen abandoning his newspapers when he moved as he went across to the designated platform he wondered if the easily spotted group had ever learned the old adage that the most successful way to follow was to be in front he went on to platform without pausing settling himself in the rear car to see each person coming onto the platform to board the train after him neither the man in the fawn raincoat nor the others hed isolated did which he hadnt really expected so soon at vauxhall he explained to the ticket collector hed changed his mind about going to windsor and made his way unhurriedly toward the antennaehaired edifice by the river at vauxhall cross to get into position himself he had to wait two hours on an embankment bench sympathizing afresh with those who would still be buried underground before he saw the raincoated man coming from the direction of the station the waterloo sweeper was with him but they werent talking neither looked happy the two others hed identified were in the first of two returning taxis so our colleagues across the river are running a rival operationaccepted sir rupert dean an hour later and you were right well done theres certainly an operation agreed charlie id like to know what its purpose is its another blank wall with your names said the directorgeneral norringtons unit was nominally military police all of your five were in fact seconded from civilian forces every one of them is dead he paused and as far as we know are in their proper graves i guess that only leaves you with your americans and we know that one of them is dead too dont we charlie felt a sink of disappointment which almost at once became embarrassment at his having to concede an oversight so quickly after being congratulated maybe not he said i left one out john parnell wasnt on my list he was norringtons commanding officer who wrote the letter of condolence a colonel it took two hours to locate a colonel john wesley parnell on the retired officers list with an address in rye in sussex the quiveringvoiced man answered the phone himself and said if it was important of course hed see charlie that night hed enjoy the company but apologized for not being able to offer dinner charlie said he wouldnt think of imposing as charlie headed south across the river yet again this time in the rented car and slowed by evening rushhour traffic he thought happily that when youre on a roll youre on a roll and it was one of the better feelings he probably wouldnt have time to call natalia but shed know there was a working reason would be pleased to hear tomorrow that at long last there seemed to be some movement as he had going to and from sir matthew norringtons hampshire estate charlie drove constantly checking his rearview mirror for any obviously following cars there werent any would henry packer have been replaced in moscow charlies being in london meant natalia and sasha were safe he realized relieved it was a small house its only attribute in daylight a partial view of the distant sea from what had to be the last road from which it would have been possible the final stop of a lonely widower to genteel poverty charlie guessed the grandfather clock with the sticky heartbeat tick in the hall and a few pieces of silver and engraved glass inthe openfronted cabinet were all there was left to sell and thought of fyodor belous in moscow charlie guessed too that the rugs that covered most of the furniture were to hide the splits and escape of their stuffing it wouldnt have been difficult to make a prosecution for gross indecency against the anally intrusive chair upon which he was sitting with some twisted difficulty charlie was taking only token sips of the supermarket sherry retired colonel john parnell had insisted on serving from a decanter not because it wasnt any good but because he didnt like sherry he didnt imagine the old man was eating any dinner that night either charlie remained silent and uncomfortable while the old soldier pored over the photographs charlie produced of the yakutsk grave the bodies inside it the mortuary shots of the corpses and the group copy of the artrecovery squad hed obtained in berlin there were what appeared to be a lot of wartime photographs in the stark room in which they were sitting but charlie hadnt been able to locate any of the people in whom he was interested from where he was sitting it was a long time before parnell finally looked up incredible absolutely incredible the voice was frail like the man himself he was thin and bald shrunk with age inside an enveloping cardigan heavily and badly darned at both elbows such a good fine man unbelievable incredible and unbelievable had been the constant interjection during charlies recitation of yet another edited account of the discovery of lieutenant simon norringtons body you commanded the unit began charlie gently know everyone in the berlin photographs only commanded the britons although i knew george timpson and harry dunne who everyone called hank but i didnt know either of the women you say the darkhaired one at the end was found in the grave with simon incredible i didnt know the fraternization was quite that close neither did i to tell you the truth us and the americans certainly good working relationship for our particular job but then most of them were only token soldiers really professional policemen and art experts like norrington and timpson and dunne surprised i didnt hear about the women so youve never seen them before no idea of their names afraid not when do you think that photograph might have been taken right at the very end obviously we were always at the sharp end needed to be there before people and what they stole got dispersed difficult enough to track stuff down as it was can you recognize the building in the background parnell pursed his lips squinting down at the picture could be the pergamon museum which contains the fantastic greek altar its the most impressive building in the entire museumsinsel complex but isnt that in what was east berlin pressed charlie the mistake intentional this really was like trying to sieve mud in search of a gold nugget the actual partition hadnt happened then but it would certainly have been in that part of the city the russians controlled and later occupied explains the two russian women i suppose simon and the others would have had to be there by invitation have permission certainly without a doubt agreed parnell at once so it must have been very early almost from the first days they occupied the east of the city the russians established patrols checking everyone turning people back even though officially they had no right always amazed me how the rest of the allies seemed surprised by everything the russians did afterwards i thought from the beginning their intention was to take berlin entirely which they would have done if it hadnt been for the airlift sir matthew let me read your letter of condolence about simon to his father never enough right words to say what you properly mean complained the old man in your letter you said simons body was returned by the russians i dont understand what he was doing there if the russians were turning nonrussians back youve got to understand the chaos that was there even after the supposed surrender it was total not everyone got turned backjust those that couldnt satisfy the intercepting patrols and simon was unique in our section had russian as well as german and enough charm to use either language to talk himself into and out of anythingi gave him the assignment to go into the eastern part as well as all the accreditation i could think of it was coming slowly awkwardly but it was coming when was that the old man shrugged difficult to be precise to a date first day or two of may something like that was there still fighting in berlin then not in the way i think you mean but a lot of shooting certainly mostly in the russian sector hate to sound like the nazi propaganda machine but the russians really were subhuman the way they took their revenge wasnt it dangerous for norrington to go in he was an allied officer with all the necessary accreditation and authorization officially he had the right he was a very confident young man and i sent all these in the picture in with him although as i said i didnt know anything about the americans or the russian women being there too cant understand that what was the assignment because of the way the russians were behaving there was a huge exodus of people from what became east berlin everyone trying to justify their right to stay in the west youve heard what an art rapist goering was literally looting museums by the trainload charlie nodded there was intelligence from three separate sources that goering had an enormous amount of art he hadnt been able to ship to carinhall his hunting estate north of berlin stored in the basement of the air ministry i sent simon and his group to see if it was true on may first or second pressed charlie as far as i can recall it was certainly very early in the month how soon after may first or second did you hear from simon norrington the myopic man shook his head im not sure i did personally there was some communication as far as i remember although its difficult to be precise after all this time something about his following up some information as far as i recall i had other search groups in munich and hamburg but all the message exchanges will be in ministry records ours was regarded as an important unit which iswhy ill never understand why they kept us so short of staff records were important though everything was kept filed i insisted on that even though we had to keep a pretty loose command by the very nature of the job here there and everywhere i was actually off base in munich for most of may thats when the message came from headquarters that simons body had been found terribly injured do you remember the date asked charlie parnell shook his head itll all be in war office records you need to look them up yes said charlie not bothering to explain the disappearance to the older man do you remember how his body was returned parnell frowned at the question offering more sherry to which charlie shook his head of course i do star of my unit only lost two during the entire war and him when the bloody thing was officially over the body was in a coffin damned awful thing too changed it of course at once the injuries were terrible the old man shuddered wouldnt have known a thing thank god what about belongings not as much as i would have expected decided at the time the bastard russians had stolen a lot of stuff money certainly i clearly remember there wasnt any money suppose we were lucky to get back what we did uniform parnell shook his head there wouldnt have been anything left after the injuries he suffered it was a shroud the old man stopped in abrupt realization but it wasnt simon was it no charlie had decided it was easier for the man to speak as he had been doing so the body i saw with simons things was someone else yes do you know who no i dont expect we ever will bodies were easy to come by remembered the former soldier with an unexpected hardness that surprised charlie was it simply a body or someone killed specially the question surprised charlie even more killed specially i would think like simon in yakutsk supplied charlie yes killed specially he straightened refusing the maudlin drift there are some things that trouble me simon norrington went into east berlin on the first or second day of may theres a message you didnt personally receive about his following up something there and the next at the end of the month is that hes been killed thats as i remember it what about the squad that went into the east with him at the beginning of may parnell frowned i cant properly remember as i say i wasnt there there was something about their coming back but i cant recall whether simon was with them or not obviously he wasnt wasnt there a need to keep in closer touch than that apart from myself and one or two other officers we were one of those gypsy units chosen for a particular expertisein this case a knowledge of artand an investigatory ability thats why officially we came under the aegis of the military police and why there were so many civilian police officers seconded to us it took me and other professional officers a long time to get used to it in the endcertainly by the time we got to berlinthere was an odd pride at being regarded as cowboys it all went with the camaraderie of winning the war and of being part of a special unit he got to his feet with difficulty and went to a carefully arranged photographic display on a wall too far away for charlie to have focused from where he sat there was a startlingly clean square against the agedarkened wallpaper when parnell took the photograph down to carry back to charlie there we all are he said proudly all thought we were pretty special then recovered a hell of a lot of stuff not enough of course but far more than we expected the old man gazed nostalgically down at the photograph before handing it to charlie there was a halfhearted attempt to keep in touch afterwards but as i said most of them were enlisted policemen from all over the country so it could never have really worked it got down to exchanging christmas cards and then gradually that stopped there was another nostalgic pause as far as i know peter and i are the only two of the original team still alive parnell finally offered the print to charlie it was one of thosevaguely selfconscious group photographs the officers in the foreground the unit behind them parnell himself and norrington were in the front with two other officers flanking them the five men whom charlie recognized from the berlin picture were lined behind there were a further five whom he didnt charlie said which ones peter the old man pointed to a saturnine unsmiling man seated next to him in the picture sir peter mason seconded to us from the foreign office because what we were doing had all sorts of political dimensions trying to decide who owned what art that sort of thing ended up a permanent secretary we kept in touch for a while but it drifted off like these things do but hes still alive he was three months ago saw him on television newsnight something about loss of sovereignty in the european union like it always is what was he in your unit secondincommand i suppose kind of selfappointed actually but he was a very able administrator incredibly hardworking would he have been the person norrington would have dealt with in may when you were in munich possibly difficult to remember after all this time i really think youd stand more chance going back through the war office records of course avoided charlie again what happened demanded the old man abruptly to simon i mean and the poor bugger who ended up in his grave what was it all about thats what were trying to find out parnell shook his head murdered unbelievable you told me you knew timpson wonderful man not as personable as simon but they got on very well together timpson had the most terrible eyesight but it didnt seem to get in his way doing what he did he and simon were great friends always thought simon had a great admiration for george thought george was better at what he did than he was himself what about dunne was he an art expert too parnell shook his head political adviser like peter god knows why everyone thought it was so important to be politically correct that was a phrase even then he and peter palled up like simon and george as far as i remember cant actually recall the going of them charlie said youve been very helpful like to think it would help find whoever killed simon said the former soldier how on earth could he and timpson have been where they really were in the middle of russia before charlie could respond parnell said in sudden awareness whatever simon said while i was in munich would probably give you a clue would it yes agreed charlie it probably would vadim leonidovich lestov was a clever man becoming cleverer with each passing day and had known from the moment of the first discovery how most quickly to break fyodor belous a fervent party zealot well awareuntil now perhaps even an admirerof how information could be extracted from an unwilling informer lestov simply left the man in total soundless isolation to feed off his own fear throughout the first night of his detention and most of the following day belous was also denied food or water or lavatory facilities which made the interview distasteful because belous had shit himself at least twice by the time he was led into the interview cell already laid out on the table between them were some prints a small singleframed icon the oil portrait of a woman what appeared to be a goldframed religious triptych missing its third panel a single goldframed pastoral scene picked out in precious stones two rings both set with heavy red stones and a ribbonsuspended medal there were also four photographs the first showed raisa belous at what was obviously an official ceremony the medal on her chest the second was of the woman alone in front of the catherine palace the third was of her with a blond woman featured in the first picture and the last showed raisa yet again with the woman and the american who had been found in the grave in yakutsk the american and the blond woman had their arms around each other laughing and raisa appeared to be looking on approvingly the display was set out to face belous when he sat down whichhe did uncomfortably further to demean the man lestov exaggerated his disgust at the smell belous said you cant do this to me his voice was hoarse from dehydration i am doing it lestov pointed out logically and i will go on as long as it suits me he splayed his hand over what was set out on the table youre obviously a thief a burglar you know theyre my mothers things not if i want to jail you for ten fifteen years i dont a thief from a church or a museum theyre my mothers repeated the man whimpering you recognize anyone in that first photograph apart from her i think i do i think the man with the heavy mustache was most often known as joseph stalin and the balding man next to him wearing glasses is lavrenty beria who headed stalins secret police the nkvd you recognize them fyodor ivanovich it was when she was acknowledged as a hero of the soviet union he briefly touched the medal my grandparents told me lestov picked up the jeweled pictures do you know where this was from the catherine palace part of the amber room was there more persisted lestov i think there was my grandparents sold things to survive what have you sold nothing liar the stinking man touched the two rings just some jewelry like this do you know who the man is in the picture with your mother and the other woman the american from the grave lestov nodded why did you keep these things i thought i could sell themthe pictures i mean i wanted the american to be identified before i approached the american reporters who came to me after the moscow news story i was going to say id discovered all this sell them the photographs and see if there was a reward for the amber room stuff that everyone wrote about after my mother was identified lestov decided it was too pitiful to challenge there would have been some papers documents belonging to your mother beria tried to gain power after stalin died was purged my grandparents were frightened destroyed everything they thought might dangerously connect them to the man so your mother was nkvd i think so thats what it was known as then wasnt it do you know who the woman is with the american and your mother did your grandparents ever tell you a name no youre in serious trouble fyodor ivanovich if i discover youre still lying i shall be very angry i dont know anything more please give me something to drink let me clean myself this isnt right lestov shook his head im going to let you live in your own shit so that you can think extremely hard to make sure you havent forgotten to tell me all that you know please wailed the man this is how people were treated all the time in the old daysthat time you admire so much enjoy it while you can marina novikov stood with the official notification in her hand her eyes too blurred to read it again she said i never imagined this day would come neither did i said the doctor im frightened so am i admitted novikov marina looked around the room my father built this house its still the best in yakutsk then itll be easy to sell what will moscow be like big i expect difficult to understand at first but we will promised novikov im frightened she repeated weve got the boys out said novikov they wont have to live the lives that weve had to no she accepted thats whats important do you think your side of the bargain with the englishman will be enough weve got the official notice insisted the man actually taking it from her what if what you have isnt enough and its canceled she asked novikov shook his head in refusal against her doubt but he didnt reply the instruction had been for charlie not to be late and hed set out from london before the early morning rush hour although not to comply with sir peter masons autocratic demand after his even earlier telephone conversation with natalia in a threehourtimedifference moscow charlies impression was of events closing in upon him in everconstricting circles without his being able to orchestrate the process and it was always necessary for charlie to be the one with the baton in his hand which was why driving unhurriedly and still constantly checking his mirror through the low norfolk countryside he wasnt happy and why he needed the time properly to analyze what he and natalia had discussed to rearrange the score to his own tune not that of the other players unquestionably to charlies benefit was the virtually speedoflight granting of moscow residency for vitali novikov and his family which would bring them into the city and the alreadyprovided apartment in the next two or three days even more unquestionable was that he had to be ready and waiting when the yakutsk doctor arrived finally to learn what the man knew about the murders if anything that nagging persistent uncertainty was charlies primary concern as it had been from the first initially unexplained approach from the thin intense man charlie accepted with novikov that he was in an allornothing situation all if the doctor had enough to unravel the riddles nothing if hed fallen for the desperate bluff of an innocent exile whod greatly exaggerated his knowledge of a longagoeradicated camp and its special prisoners the only thing hecould dohad ever been able to dowas call that bluff if thats what it was which meant delaying his going on to washington to try to find out if an american named harry dunne was still alive and had a nugget or two to contribute in addition to trying equally hard to discover either there or in london the obvious although unknown importance of fifteen germans imprisoned in the very last month of the war in a barely living hell on earth was a shortcut possible with the germans charlie knewalthough she wasnt aware of his knowingthat miriam bell had the fifteen names when shed gone back to washington was prepared even to believe her return might well have been connected with that identification she could after all easily have gotten the fbi in washington to make the inquiry on her behalf but charlie whod objectively seen similarities between himself and the american gauged miriam bells ambition to be such that like him it was always necessary for her to do things herself rather than rely upon others could he trick her into disclosing whatever shed found out if indeed shed discovered anything he could certainly try shed even been anxious for him to get back to moscow and given a warning he hadnt really needed about watching his back he had timpsons name as well as that of hank dunne more than sufficient to bargain with it was certainly something to consider at least until all the greater uncertainties about vitali novikov were resolved letting the reflection run charlie acknowledged the very practical argument beyond anything the yakutsk doctor might or might not have for his going back to moscow immediately according to natalia that morning nikulins threat to go public about a second british officer had been prompted by charlies unspecified london recall and continued absence which made it possible to delay any public announcement by going back charlie reckoned he certainly knew enough from natalia to invent a plausibly fictitious reason for the london return he could even infuse something in the negotiations with miriam for her to pillow talk about to vadim lestov to keep all the balls juggling in the air perhaps not as difficult to orchestrate to his own personally composed tune as hed initially thought what about even an entirely different concert convinced as hewas that he and his fightingtosurvive department were being buggered about by their own gods on high charlie abruptly wondered what or who might fall out of the woodwork if russia did disclose the presence of a second british officer his not being in moscow at the time of any announcement would avoid any personal or departmental blame all he had to do was not warn the directorgeneral of his prior knowledge at once the counterargument presented itself if he didnt give the easily explained warning he could stand accusedalmost inevitably by gerald williams another unresolved problemof not being properly on top of the moscow end of the investigation whether he was physically there or not not an alternative then he definitely had to go back charlie accepted as he began picking up the signs to east dereham but without the intended american detour on the way quickly to get upon the rostrum baton in hand and now with the score set out more clearly in front of him than it had been at this journeys beginning the estate of sir peter mason a former government mandarin of her britannic majesty was minuscule by comparison to that of sir matthew norrington but still impressive to someone born in a terraced council house which charlie had been the period of its construction which favored a confusing mix of towers and castellated battlements was indeterminate but charlie had the impression that it was far more recent than the hampshire mansion and the grounds didnt have their grazing herds but even to charlies philistine eye the paintings and artwork appeared comparable sir peter mason was an intimidatingly large man immaculate in the sort of waistcoated dark pinstripe complete with fresh rose buttonhole that charlie imagined the man would have worn every day of his working life in whitehall and couldnt bear to abandon in retirement the virgin white shirt was hardcollared the tie charlie guessed to be the carlton club although he wasnt sure there was scarcely any gray in the long polished black hair the advantage of either remarkable genes or an equally remarkable dyeadept barber the face was so pink and smooth it could have been genes the man only just managed to stop himself from checking charlies arrival timekeeping he remained seated behind the sort of desk charliecould believe permanent secretaries had made from the plans of aircraft carrier flight decks there was no offer of a handshake as well as several oils the study was festooned with photographs of sir peter mason with every world political leader charlie could remember and some he couldnt there didnt appear to be any of mason in military uniform though the man said i talked to sir matthew after your call this is a dreadful business youll understand then why i need your help said charlie of course although im not sure i did at first last night or what ill be able to give you today mason was leaning intently forward on his desk one hand cupped protectively over the other looked out what might help but id like to hear as much as there is from you first a man accustomed always to power and obedience charlie recognized velvetcovered condescension charlie said you remember simon norrington of course wonderful man as well as being superb at his job firstrate mind the voice was measured carefully modulated there was a nod in the direction of the oil paintings would have appreciated his opinion of some of these and george timpson the former civil service supremo frowned creasing an uncreased forehead not so well american wasnt he an art expert like norrington colonel parnell described them as friends they were said the large man he lounged back at his desk hands deep in his pockets timpson had very bad eyesight as i remember although it didnt seem to affect his work had no idea they were the two referred to in the newspapers with the russian woman all the fuss has been about werent they instead of answering charlie offered novikovs grainy insectblurred photographs of the bodies in the grave and then the better more professionally taken ones after the recovery from yakutsk mason physically shuddered and said horrible how much else have you been able to discover so far mason listened to charlies now almost automatic recitation gazing down at the photographs occasionally shaking his head in apparentdisbelief he looked up inquiringly at the end of charlies account ensuring it was over before saying now tell me how i can help which i will of course in any way i can the month of may identified charlie norrington went into the eastern sector of berlin with a squad to check intelligence that goering had an art cache somewhere in the air ministry mason frowned it was a very long time ago for a recollection as definite as that i certainly remember the goering information it was thought to be very reliable and exciting but not simon being sent to check it he would have been the most obvious choice with the expertise and the languages but i dont specifically recollect it no there was so much happening or not happening youve no idea what berlingermanywas like no administration no utilities total devastation so i keep being told said charlie covering the sigh colonel parnell was in munich virtually all of may and norrington doesnt seem to have come back from the russian sector he cant remember about the squad either but he is sure there was a message maybe a reason why norrington stayed there perhaps even why he went on to yakutsk mason slowly shook his head that doesnt mean anything to menothing that i can recall except that it wouldnt have been anything to do with yakutsk we were assigned to germany it would have needed supreme allied command authorization to have gone into russia the man hesitated shaking his head not even sure that would have been sufficient dont tell me it was impossible for norrington and timpson to be where they were found pleaded charlie none of this makes sense i keep being told that too you said youd looked something out to help mason groped into an unseen drawer at his side of the desk taking out a faded brown leathercovered pocketbook kept my wartime diaries a log really this is he finished the sentence looking down as he fingered lefthandedly through the pages exclaimed ah and went back to turn the pages more slowly may you say yes confirmed charlie hopefully went to hamburg on may sixth got back into berlin on the twentyeighth he looked up smiling with what looked to be natural teeth and here it is he looked down again to quote verbatim may simon goering strong louvre possibility thats all pressed charlie disappointed no said the man triumphantly may goering unsubstantiated squad back squad back echoed charlie what about simon norrington mason offered the sepiabrown pages i didnt make a note doesnt look to have been my decision i usually put in a lot more detail for my fuller reports later colonel parnell issued the order just before he went to munich confirmed charlie so both of you were away there was still a support staff running the office stressed mason organized it myself anything that came in while we were away would have been automatically and immediately passed on to headquarters parnell was a stickler for records insisted that we were trying to restore the art heritage of europe which we were of course had every damned telephone call logged he waved the leathercovered diary again thats why i kept this parnell had to know where everyone was what they were doing every minute of the day he smiled again confidently so you dont have a problem you go to war office records and youll get every scrap of paperwork that ever passed through our unit including any message from norrington even if it was telephoned youll know exactly what happenedor was supposed to be happeningto the man weve already done that sir disclosed charlie there are no records covering norrington during may not until his body was returned for a very long time sir peter mason regarded charlie over the huge desk then he said do you know what i did after the war i understand you were a permanent secretary at the foreign office ventured charlie the permanent secretary to the foreign secretary for fifteen years i know about government files then youll know that these have been destroyed said charlie bluntly that is impossible it cannot be done it has been done so it is possible what are you suggesting i dont know enough to suggest anything admitted charlie honestly all i can tell you is that files that should still be in existenceas you believe they should still existhave disappeared government files go automatically into the public records office at kew after a prescribed period of time insisted the expert even if the release time is extended beyond the normal fiftyyear period it is noted at kew has there been the proper check i understand so said charlie who truly didnt an illegal act has been committed if theyve been tampered with or unless a special exclusion or extensionofrelease order has been imposed they no longer exist insisted charlie he really was wasting his time there wasnt any reason to delay his moscow return sir peter mason lapsed into renewed silence do you imagine youll ever fully get to the bottom of it all at this precise moment i doubt it admitted charlie honest again and hating the admission everything has been dispersed between too many separate departments here in england and is compounded by supposedly shared but in fact quite separate and conflicting investigations by america and russia in may we received a body with simon norringtons identification from the russian authorities in berlin stated mason more to himself than to charlie the three in yakutskand whoever it was in berlinwere killed by russians who else could it have been the russians have evidence of another british officer having been present declared charlie flatly the present british government knows this yes what evidence a bullet from a british gun a button forensically proven to be from a british battledress uniform that potentially is appalling unthinkable you should have told me about this last night i still have friends in government people i could have spoken to got a better understanding careless of his desperation showing charlie said dont you rememberanything about norrington around that month his death thats all suddenly being told by the russians that they had his body and were returning it wasnt any inquiry made about the circumstances colonel parnell says your unit only ever lost two people during its entire existence of course said the older man i do recall discussing that very fully with parnell obviously it went higher to headquarters for them to use their authority to demand an explanation all we got back was that his body had been found by a russian patrol with no evidence of how hed been killed what charlie wondered had been the explanation given to the americans for the death of the man theyd believed to be george timpson is it conceivable norrington would have gone to russia without telling anyone totally inconceivable insisted the other man okay we were an irregular unit and maybe did things in an irregular way but as i said parnell was a stickler and everyone followed his rules if they didnt necessarily strictly follow army regulations to the letter for norrington to have decided off his own bat to go to yakutsk would have amounted to desertion and how could he have gone of his own accord there were only military flights in and out of both berlin airports and those flights were checked by nationals of whichever country the plane belonged to the one fact i am positive about is that the only way norrington and timpson would have got to yakutsk would have been as prisoners of the russians who were then prepared to murder to cover up what they had done the man paused at a new awareness is there a phony grave in berlin for timpson an american war cemetery in the netherlands why on earth isnt the governmentamerica toodemanding an explanation the possible embarrassment of a second involved briton rubbish preposterous rubbish rejected the man by there were millions of british handguns all over the place and tens of millions of uniform bits and pieces and it doesnt matter whether there were one or two british officers the unalterable unchallengeable fact has to be they were prisoners of the russians withoutwhom they wouldnt have been there in the first place he paused close to being breathless instead of inventing conspiracies and spying missions and possible international embarrassments has anyone thought that even if there was a second british officer his body might be somewhere else in another unmarked unknown grave i dont believe they have conceded charlie he certainly hadnt until now which he should have a second body in a second grave would make nonsense of a lot of his theories and arguments so far it could even he further conceded refute a russian accusation suggest it insisted mason at the same time as suggesting an explanation is demanded from the russians for whats clearly coldblooded murder charlie said i appreciate the time youve given me its been very useful put forward different perspectives i dont at all like the sound of how this is being handled said the other man youve got my number anything else comes up you think i might be able to help you with you let me know youve no idea what the russians were like in berlin colonel parnell tried to give me some idea mason shook his head dismissively you had to be there truly to believe it there was a further more vehement head shake and i cant believe how this is being treated now when charlie phoned from a public kiosk in the center of east dereham sir rupert dean insisted it should be a full meeting not confined just to the two of them in moscow dmitri nikulin announced the same decision and natalia traveled to the white house in the same car as colonel vadim lestov she was curious at the strange harshness there had been in the presidential chief of staffs voice when hed summoned them apprehensive of what it might mean youre sure you seized everything belous had hidden demanded the tall austere man after finding what we did we virtually stripped the apartment assured the militia colonel theres absolutely nothing more where is it now nikulin appeared distracted looking around his huge office as if he expected to see it laid out for inspection all in my personal office safe fyodor belous in custody in lefortovo held on suspicion of theft said natalia nikulin said the nkvd accreditation is the most important its with everything else guaranteed lestov i want you personally to bring it to me today ordered nikulin he hesitated looking away from them his mouth moving in apparent rehearsal for what he was about to say then coming back to them he said as of today this moment the investigation into the yakutsk murders and the apparent disappearance of larisa krotkov is ended neither of you will take any further active part and certainly make no contribution he looked directly at lestov you will appear to continue working with the american and the englishman to monitor everything they do or might discover until such time as they announce the case unsolvable at that time well devise a public announcement which at this stage isnt something that has to be considered natalia broke the stunned silence that followed stumbling to arrange her own words but we surely need there will be no professional reflection upon either of you interrupted the presidential aide misunderstanding in fact both your records will be personally endorsed by me that your investigation has been exemplary and the confirmation of your promotion vadim leonidovich will also be endorsed with presidential approval we have already issued a statement of a potential breakthrough hinting at tsarskoe selo reminded lestov uncomfortable that it had been his idea which we can easily make it to be said nikulin another decision already made we can produce everything else you found in belouss apartment and disclose it as art she saved from being plundered by the nazis continue building raisa belous into a heroine which she was and well keep the man silent by using his fear of security organizations tell him if he as much as speaks to the press again hell spend the rest of his life in a yakutskaya labor camp are we to be told why and how raisa belous became a heroine larisa krotkov too presumably demanded natalia her thoughts in order now once more nikulin hesitated they were both instrumental in one of the greatestever services to the motherland which continued to benefit for decades but which will never ever be revealed when demanded aleksandr andreevich kurshin immediately said vitali novikov everythings fixed full citizenship residency permission groped kurshin everything but you never said talked about it complained the local homicide detective i would have expected you know how many times i applied before i thought id be refused again said the doctor close to the truth it was midafternoon in the mortuary laboratory and kurshin had already consumed one flask of vodka squinting to focus and to understand befuddled he said youll be gone forever i shall miss you too old friend kurshin came awkwardly forward arms outstretched and the two men bearhugged novikov felt his boyhood friend shaking kurshin said a farewell drink of course accepted novikov several he had a lot to celebrate everything in fact a total waste of time in fact judged gerald williams wearily predictable the moment charlie stopped talking no denied charlie there was no way of our knowing until id spoken to all three what there might have been which made it essential that i come back to do it charlie whod never had to hold up a wetted finger to gauge which way the wind was blowing discerned a changed attitude in everyone in the conference room during the last confrontation only days ago sir rupert dean himself had intervened to remind the constant attacker that hed ordered the withdrawal and having spoken to them you learned nothing no charlie was forced to admit so there hasnt been the slightest step forward persisted the committed finance director because williamss attitude was so predictable charlie had withheld sir peter masons alternative theory about a second officer to which the fat mans reaction was for the first time slower it was the directorgeneral who said that would certainly be a total rejection of any russian claim put us in the driving seat perhaps more than that encouraged charlie whod prepared his second presentation during the drive back to london more interested in the maximum benefit than in its absolute accuracy as ive already told you i believe the accusation of a second british officer is whats being threatened by the russians if we in advancetoday evenmade the demand for a russian explanation wed completely preempt them hed only spent a few minutesfive at the mostwith sir rupert dean before coming into the conference room but it had been enough to detect the mans misgivings at previously allowing so much to be withheld from the people now ranged around the table against him it was therefore the directorgeneralupon whom above all others his future in moscow dependedthat charlie was the most anxious to convince or reassure or both unless they know more about another officer than we do countered patrick pacey in which case wed be admitting a spying mission in advance of being accused of it the political officer shook his head its too risky a strategy and theres a lot of other people whod agree with me im sure which brings us back as we are always brought back to how little has been achieved during this entire mishandled investigation williams said the opinion is not mine conceded charlie unhappy at what sounded like an excuse it was suggested most strongly by sir peter mason who was the permanent secretary to the foreign office a long time ago deflated pacey the cold war eyeballtoeyeball confrontations are things of the past perhaps unfortunately as far as our future is concerned remarked jeremy simpson i accept all the political arguments butspeaking as a lawyer theres a lot in the cliche of attack being the best form of defense charlie at once saw the opportunity further to allay the directorgenerals discomfort sir peter also insisted that it is impossiblehis wordfor simon norringtons records to have disappeared according to him its an inviolable whitehall regulation that everything is transferred to kew even if something is withheld for reasons of sensitivity the fact that it is being withheld is publicly noted are you suggesting theres been positive obstruction demanded dean sharply what everyone else would believe to be outrage charlie recognized as the mans relief at his committee having belatedly put in front of them a lot of what he and charlie had earlier kept to themselves im telling you the opinion of someone who knows the system charlie said following the older mans lead so unproductive had the interviews with the three men been that the latitude dean had allowed did seem pointless now it irked charlie to have to agree even only to himself with gerald williamss assessment its most definitely something to be raised at the next meeting of the intelligence committee acknowledged the political officer if it is positively being withheld or has been destroyed against the governments procedural rules then there is something extremely serious to hide the deputy directorgeneral jocelyn hamilton began to warn before he could continue the finance director quickly intruded which means there is a very severe embarrassment and that we cant risk demanding explanations from russia so here we are again in a full circle and back to where we began precisely nowhere with nothing charlie realized he very definitely wasnt getting the support hed become used to especially from jeremy simpson he wondered if dean was going to pick up on the suggestion of internal obstruction by pointing out how disastrously failure could affect the future of the entire department but when no guidance came charlie decided against putting it forward himself instead deciding it might be an occasion to keep his head as low as possible behind the parapet charlie said wouldnt we still be able to get an indication of thatby posing the question at the next combined meeting of the involved agencies presenting yourself as our representative at downing street now goaded williams overeager no rejected charlie at once presenting myself as the field officer most directly involved and therefore most in need of positive guidance youve already been given all the positive guidance that should be necessary came in hamilton aggressively youre surely not suggesting obstruction from us oh to have had sufficient proof to reply as hed like to have thought charlie looking directly at gerald williams he said of course not im simply reflecting the views of a highly experienced civil servant who found what i told him inexplicable enough charlie determined if the directorgeneral wasnt going to present the doubt outright then charlie certainly shouldnt the conclusion had to be that dean had changed his mind hamilton said dont we have another problem to consider what are we to do about sir matthew norringtons ultimatum with just ten days of it to go the first thing to accept here and now is that theres no chance whatsoever of our being able to meet it suggested williams shouldnt we wait for the ten days to elapse before conceding it questioned simpson i dont think theres any point in wasting any more time said williams i propose we start making contingency plans at once an excellent idea enthused simpson happy for his antipathy to show at last toward the financial director lets hear what yours are gerald so that we can talk them through to get ideas of our own im suggesting the need for serious discussion not offering formulated proposals williams flushed its only been an hour since weve been told of the ultimatum a staged pause and that our part of the investigation is totally stalemated so you dont yet have any positive ideas persisted the lawyer williamss redness remained at his awareness of being mocked lets hope you can find things so amusing in a few days time he said stiffly in a few days time we could know all about everything wondering even why it was such a mystery at all said simpson at the same time as standing over there at the window watching pigs fly over the river williams came back ten days really is a very short period of time so lets not waste it said the directorgeneral stopping the exchange and the meeting in his office immediately afterward the directorgeneral said that wasnt very good give me the ten days urged charlie make that your deadline too for letting me work as weve agreed i dont want it to go on that long insisted the older man before the ten days are up i want some idea at the very least what the hells going on dean paused then he said you did very well last time this time it doesnt seem to be working out as it should in fact it doesnt seem to be working out at all charlie was tempted to buy a dewyeyed giraffe bigger than sasha herself but remembered natalias injunction not to try too hard as well as realizing hed have to take an additional passenger seat to get it back to moscow he settled for its more easily transported baby which was still awkward handlugged he bought natalia a white and yellow gold love bracelet with a key to lock it permanently on her wrist miriam bell insisted they had a lot to talk about when he called from the hotel and lestov said he was interested in hearing what progress charlies london visit had achieved and agreed to a meeting for the following day without offering anything about the enigmatic press release that charlie finally went through the pretense of asking about charlie thought he detected an uncertainty in the mans voice so much so he called miriam back she said the sonofabitch had been avoiding her for the past three days a problem the russian had probably contracted from him charlie thought her suggested gettogether the following day ahead of that already agreed with the russian was a good idea charlie didnt call natalia because the interior ministry number would be logged on his hotel bill which had to be submitted with his expenses to gerald williams determining on his way to the airport that the situation with the finance director was something thathad to be resolved although still not knowing how after today charlie wasnt even sure of the confidence of the rest of the group particularly jocelyn hamilton all or nothing he thought again his mind fixing on the meeting with vitali maksimovich novikov we still need to know what the russians have got reminded kenton peters theyre hardly going to do anything about whatever it is they think theyve got when they dig deeper are they questioned boyce in return dont like frayed ends said the american but youre quite confident now as far as britain is concerned totally so we just let it all seep away into the sand wasnt that the intention from the beginning not often it works out exactly right though kenton said boyce in london how many times in your very distinguished career has anything not gone exactly as you intended from the very start in washington the american chuckled into the telephone enjoying the flattery theres always a first time i didnt want thisof all things to be it things got too close at times because of that damned man muffin but not close enough but youre right about muffin no need to dispose of him as we intended but i think he should be put out to grass ill see to it you were the one under the real pressure james commiserated the other man returning the mutual appreciation but you who personally intervened when it was necessary said boyce only too pleased to help assured peters its been a useful exercise but not one im anxious to repeat too soon the american laughed more positively i suppose we can look back on this as our own very special meltdown like the russians had chernobyl boyce laughed with him without any contaminating fallout asyou came to me last time i thought id come to you to wrap it all up make a weekend of it we can go down to virginia suggested the american wonderful id like that you get a call from charlie that hes on his way back no miriam felt cartright turn toward her in the darkness and was glad she hadnt told him earlier it might have distracted him from the main reason he was in bed with her on balance he was better than lestovenjoyed longer foreplay as she didbut she still intended to end it soon it was one of several decisions shed made the most important was to manipulate the nowestablished onetoone association with nathaniel brindsley to get a transfer somewhere more civilized than moscow this episode had soured russia for her it was still instinctive though for her to go on picking and probing right now to decide if cartright was lying about not having heard from charlie to prepare herself for the following days lunch i asked him what sort of trip hed had and he said pretty goodthat there were a lot of things to talk about but not apparently to mea colleague miriam thought the indignation sounded genuine enough and although it had lessened there had been those odd questions about charlie when shed first gotten back from yakutsk you two guys have a problem hes the one heading for a problem said cartright unthinking in his bitterness with convoluted reasoning that defied logic or sense cartright was now blaming charlie for his own mistake of getting involved with gerald williams if he hadnt avoided williamss call late that afternoon hed have probably known about the damned mans return but he didnt care he was sick and tired of the whole damned mess charlie most of all what do you mean by that questioned miriam nothing said cartright belatedly realizing his indiscretion he moved toward her and miriam responded at once but her mind wasnt immediately on what he was doing pleasant though thehardness of his tongue was maybe it was time to make another decision several in fact she still hadnt devised a way for kenton peters to kiss her asswhich cartright was close to doing at that momentwithout the bastard knowing it was she making him do it by chance charlie had been given the same table in the minsk restaurant as before and as before miriams arrival in a severely tailored trousers suit caused the same headswiveling contortions the suit material was close to matching that of sir peter masons but there wasnt a fresh rose buttonhole charlie stood to greet her aware of the palpable envy throughout the room but not enjoying it as much as at their last lunch now with too much else to think about mostly the homecoming announcement he hadnt expected as miriam sat he poured the vodka unasked they touched glasses and miriam said i missed you which isnt a pass im better at making them than that i mean workwise surprise upon surprise thought charlie not as much surprise though as there had been at natalias news bewilderment tinged with suspicion fit that better he tried to reassure himself that if natalia was reverting to the earlier nonsense she wouldnt in the first place have created the atmosphere between them by telling him the russian investigation had been officially ended but insisting she didnt know the reason upon reflection it even seemed to meshalthough he didnt know howwith the official runaround he was convinced to be going on in london again without his knowing how or why which elevated this lunch to more than hopefully learning what miriam might have found out about the german pows in yakutsk now to complete the circle he had to gauge if he could whether america too had from the beginning only ever been interested in suppressing instead of solving murders they already knew about but if it did mesh itcreated an even bigger mystery what was the secret so overwhelming after more than fifty years that all three involved countries were determined it remain forever concealed with the delicacy of a man tightropewalking across a snake pit charlie said i should have kept in closer touch but there really was a lot to do didnt you find that in washington no said miriam shortly charlie was playing the same old game she recognized did it matter a fuck anymore why didnt she come straight out and tell him shed been closed down that she was thoroughly pissed off about it and that from now on she was just going along for the ride without knowing who was driving where because she had to know she answered herself at once washingtonthe cocksucker kenton peters in particular the lapdog bureau director and nathaniel brindsley in generalwas treating her like a dummy it didnt matter a damn what was written on her record to which she anyway didnt have access to confirm shed still be remembered by those who knew for obediently rolling over and dying far better for her pride and reputation and career to prove to brindsleyand anyone elseshe could close a case and make them the rollover dummies doing nothing about it shit thought charlie disappointed how long were you there coupla days useful bits and pieces how about you bits and pieces whos going to blink first she smiled letting him know she understood charlie held up the empty vodka carafe toward their passing waiter every reason for her to think it would be him if thats what she wanted he could imply a lot of what hed learned from natalia to have come from london that shed know to be true from the coitus conversations with lestov my people have come up with the names of some germans imprisoned in a camp that existed close to where the bodies were found necessary for him not to think that was a trade so have mine that why you were recalled to washington yes she said straightfaced when the waiter returned with the vodka they ordered quicklyto get rid of the interruption to hint his awareness of the real source charlie said lestov give you any lead on what the development is maybe theyve identified the germans too the first blink isolated charlie identifying went beyond knowing the names so were all three making progress are we this was becoming a struggle i think so said charlie what could he afford to volunteer to edge her further forward im not so sure the moment to convince you then thought charlie you think its time for us to stop playing silly buggers it might help seems to me were almost starting from scratch again and i thought wed come to an understanding blitzkrieg decided charlie the pun intentional i thought so too weve got the germans we know who your guy was both of them in fact and we can make a lot of very informed guessesnot actual proof i know but enough to take us a long way forwardso why are we fucking about like this he was pleased of the feigned irritation he managed at the end miriam was glad the blintzes arrived although shed forgotten shed ordered them needing the recovery and the time to assess shed heard enough to know he hadnt been positively closed down as she had point one he knew about the pows which she knew vadim lestov hadnt told him so london must have another maybe better source point two proof of that better source was his saying he knew who both americans were when shed only been trying to find the name of the one in the grave which she still didnt have point three and the biggest of all and if london had that much they had to be nearer to knowing a damned sight more which put charlieenglandway over the horizon thank christ shed played it this way so far how to raise the bidding appeal to his macho the male need to boast what was between his legs she offered her glass clinking it once more against charlies like i said on the telephone weve got a lot to talk about somewhere hed hit a target but which one not the time to stop the bombardment and the next shot was easy you first fuck she thought he was too goodtoo cleverto try any sortof bluff she could only play the cards she held i think the coincidence is incredible your being so right at that goddamned press conference not as good as hed hoped but he still believed himself ahead id liked to have found out earlier or rather that london had been quicker whom do your people regard the most important miriam frowned dont you think its frederich dollmann he was the chief secretary in the bunker charlie felt the slow warming burn move through him it still wasnt an answer but the middle of the jigsaw was beginning to fill at last im not making the analysis london is as washington obviously is with you all i got was the names and a thumbnail sketch of what theyd so far come up with plucking a name at random from the list charlie went on our guys seemed to think werner von bittrick was important an aidedecamp admittedly said miriam but it was dollmann and buhle who saw him every day took the dictation franz buhle completed charlie as he filled in a lot more at least three of the fifteen germans had spent the last months of the war in daily contacttwo of them taking the dictationwith the demented adolf hitler fighting battles already lost with armies that no longer existed the bunker that the russians were the first to seize as they were the first to seize berlin forcing the casualness as well as the conversationbut letting his mind run aheadcharlie said lets face it the combined knowledge of everyone who was there would have been astonishing but to historians i know the problem broke in miriam which charlie had hoped she would why art experts i could understand practically anyone else except them whenor howwas she going to get the american names charlie believed he could understand partially at least if he was right it was the conspiracy to beat all conspiracies ever conceived reducing those of the courts of rome tudor england the borgias and machiavelli to children painting by numbers caught by his silence and her belief in his greater knowledge miriam said but you can distantly virtually thinking aloud charlie said they wouldnt have known would they what were the right words miriam thought desperately maybe to follow with another question known what what they were going to find in yakutsk why they were being allowed there suggested charlie still thinking aloud we cant look at it from todays perspective weve got to look at it as they would have in berlin in march or april or may total chaos total confusion suddenly to have made available the last support staff around hitler people who knew intimately every moment of every day in the last months of one of historys greatest monsters people who knew where all the treasures were that would have been too much to have considered rationally there was no rationale but there werent any art treasures in the bunker protested miriam you sure of that demanded charlie they wouldnt have been not then im still not sure now after half a century now it was miriam who remained silent pushing the blintzes away charlie didnt speak either needing to think as much as the woman eventually miriam said youre saying they didnt go to yakutsk because of hitlers staff no denied charlie they went because of hitlers staff but thats not what they were taken there for there was another reason there couldnt have been another reason protested miriam belatedly accepting charlies earlier argument to get to the germans would have been incredible that was only part of it said charlie there has to be more otherwise none of it makes sense they ateboth duckbut were unaware of what they were eating and neither properly tasted the wine either each engrossed in private thoughts hands and mouths working automatically charlie felt instinctively that he was close maybe close enough to reach out and touch but there were still too many bits missing his mindhis hopewas on vitali novikov who according to natalia was arriving the following day all or nothing throbbed through charlies head like a drumbeat it wouldntcouldntbe absolutely nothing he reassured himself no matter how desperate the man wouldnt have risked a total and outright lienot someone as aware as novikov was of the return expected for his freedom from theinherited exile of an innocent father a bargain in fact that the doctor himself had volunteered miriam was more confused now than when shed arrived nothing that seemed to make sense to charlie was even vaguely comprehensibleguessable evento her so he was still out of sight and she couldnt see a way to catch up richard cartright suddenly came into her mind richard cartright with the tooready questions inexplicable then and even more inexplicable now if london was operating with the sort of harmony charlie was inferring tentatively she said howd you find the attitude in london attitude queried charlie when the fuck was she going to get a halfuseful answer instead of another wrongposition question thought maybe you might have heard something about peterss visit on his way back from here no she didnt charlie recognized at once concentrating fully it was a pretty big meeting i gather theres a lot of different interests in londontoo many in my opinion i didnt hear in any specific detail how it went with your guy what playback did you get a way at last to avoid the question i didnt as such but i kinda got the impression there was the apparent search for the word wasnt necessarysome rivalry in england how charlies demand was as unhelpful as shed tried to make hers in the beginning i will keep to our agreement said miriam and for me i guess its easier its been left entirely to meokay so my heads on the blockbut at least i dont have the irritation of someone riding shotgun on me thats how mistakes happen cartright had tried to use her as shed been happy to use him before realizing that he knew nothing this was just getting a repayment for what hed gotten in another way could he risk the guess no a guess even though he was sure of the answer would change the balance weighing the scales to her advantage not another blitzkrieg a softeningup salvo to continue her belief in his superior firepower there was only one thing she could be missing apart from the full answer which she clearly hadnt gotten he said ive got both american names and i know wherethe grave is of the one who was really buried in yakutsk and waited miriam said cartright personal very much so carried out badly too your lieutenant was george timpson buried in the american cemetery at margraten in holland the second american was a harry dunne he survived the war as far as i know ive no idea if hes still alive charlie was glad the encounter with miriam was the first of a busy day and that hed fought off the embassy ambush earlier that day this come to your people from washington she shouldnt need to ask that no have they been told if they had she in turn wouldor shouldhave been told so her question manifestly showed that she hadnt been no need even to guess now have you been cut out entirely or sidelined abruptlyfrighteninglymiriam felt the emotion flood through her her eyes briefly blurring her recovery was as quick as the nearcollapse he knew too muchwas too intuitiveto go on with the charade anymore and in any case she was too tired and dispirited and pissed off and pissed over to try anymore entirely bitterly she added you know what that motherfucker peters told me he said i was the fall guy that you were too both of us at the bottom of the heap to take the shit if it came down denies it of course but i taped the sonofabitch miriams emotions switchbacked again this time she was suffused by an enormous feeling of relief thats it charlie all of it i dont have anything more to tell you nothing held back he use my name or was it by inference miriam considered the question by inference i guess but you were the only person he could have been referring to that what you meant about watching my back miriam looked steadily at charlie for several moments i think packer was a hit man im sure packer was a hit man who it wouldnt have been you charlie said which only leaves you charlie decided he didnt want to go any further i still think it was a separate agency thing its past i hope what do you think i should do now you sleeping with cartright and lestov yes said miriam at once totally without embarrassment tell lestov youve been cut out and that you dont know why and if natalia relayed that to him from lestov he might be better able to decide if natalia was being truthful or troubled by integrity again decided charlie whatll that achieve therell have to be some reaction lets see what it is what about cartright charlie thought about it maybe we should satisfy his curiosity a name even you mind being the messenger in your own special way she sniggered it was my decision to begin with wasnt it i guess now it makes you my unpaid pimp charlie smiled back ive always accepted that was what people like you and i are whores and pimps the professional ones just get treated better charlie went through all the required motions with vadim leonidovich lestov talking of assessments and reevaluations and complaining there appeared to be very little progress and even conveyed some irritation at lestovs refusal there are still facts to be checked before any disclosures can be made to hint at the intended russian announcement charlie actually went as far as asking if there was any official russian impatience which lestov countered by asking about londons attitude after insisting that as far as he was aware moscow was prepared for the investigation to continue indefinitely charlie said he hadnt detected any london restlessness he was back at the embassy an hour before the scheduled meeting with mcdowell cartright and gallaway he considered passing on to london what hed learned about the german pows but decided against it until after the encounter with vitali novikov the following day he limited himself to cabling that the russians were still refusingto disclose their intended media release and occupied the remainder of the time deep in paperplanebuilding reflection he ended it even more instinctively sure that only one or two doors remained closed against his understanding virtually everything charlie put on a very positive performance in the head of chancellerys office guessing at progress in washington as well as that the impending russian announcement would be startling but admitting that london had been an entirely unproductive embarrassing expedition he was further conceded charlie anxious for whatever input any of them might have jackson called from berlin some crossed wires with london about your going there said the military attache he thought you learned a lot that someone else had been murdered to fill norringtons grave said charlie well never know who it was but the russians did it said cartright they returned a body lured charlie im not sure they can be blamed for the murder who else could have done it demanded mcdowell there wasnt any law order or anything else in berlin at the time said charlie it was a perfect place for a perfect murder dont forget the second officer at yakutsk im keeping an open mind did you tell london that asked cartright charlie shrugged no reason to fill their heads with theories i couldnt substantiate the three other men looked uncomfortably between themselves cartright said youre telling us why didnt you tell them because theyve got to act upon what i tell them so they need facts not impressions theres no reason why i shouldnt tell working colleagues something about which theyre not going to act is there ive got quite a few others im keeping to myself too like what pressed cartright it doesnt matter refused charlie he only wanted to see how far one red herring would swim whats the general feeling in london asked mcdowell i dont know about a general feeling i dont think my own department imagine ive got a clue which is why im going to surprisethem no reason why one red herring shouldnt be channeled in the right direction vitali maksimovich novikov stood slightly apart from his family as if wishing to disassociate himself from them his eyes moving toward anyone in uniform his wife fidgeted tightly with their two sons stringtied packs of belongings between them the larger cases had already been loaded no one talked the elder boy georgi looked constantly and unblinkingly at the arthritic indicator board everyone jumped at the sharp metallic departure announcement novikov joined his family at last ready marina nodded saying nothing the boys began collecting the packages novikov had not put down a bulging briefcase since their arrival at the airport as they walked toward the departure ramp marina said were never coming back are we never promised novikov you havent forgotten anything the woman said looking at the briefcase nothing natalia stared at charlie letting the shock show why she demanded all i want is a name theyll all be on file wont they why repeated natalia insistently i am not going to trade currency said charlie equally insistent i just want the name of one of the biggest dealers thats all might be necessary to mislead someone whos taking an irritating interest in me vitali maksimovich novikov kept the door on its security chain easing it open just sufficiently to see it was charlie the man hesitated before opening it as charlie entered the doctor said you are very quick so was your residency permission i meant were glad to see you said novikov instantly apologetic we never i know stopped charlie but it has happened youre here it was a wide but short entrance hall leading directly into the one living room cases and tied bundles were piled in its center marina and the boys were grouped around their belongings as if awaiting permission to unpack still wearing the quilted outer coats that were normal for yakutsk it was another napoleon day outside charlie said welcome to moscow we didnt expect it to be so big said marina hurriedly correcting an oversight she said thank you we all want to thank you the boys on either side of her nodded a tiny kitchen was to the left already furnished with a cooker and cupboards and a table although only with two chairs there was also a glassfronted cabinet and a fabricfaded woodenarmed settee in the living room there was a door to the right that charlie assumed to be to the one bedroom and wondered where the boys would sleep the entrance hall was big enough he supposed aware of charlies examination novikov said its a wonderful apartment ive already met the concierge he wants to sell me some allotment space in the garden at the back the apartment was on the eighth floor of one of the brezhnevera blocks that ring moscowthis one in the lyublino suburblike decaying teeth in need of treatment vegetablegrowing allotment spaces came automatically with each flat but charlie decided against telling the doctor there was nothing to be gained by alienating theconcierge by challenging his private enterprise novikov and his family had to learn for themselves how to live in the big city he handed the macallan whiskey to novikov and offered the chocolates to the woman housewarming presents he said the man said thank you his wife accepted the box and said its all we ever seem to do to thank you theres so much her voice faltered she swallowed heavily and said ill make some tea i feel numb said novikov we all do the man was blinking more rapidly than charlie remembered he said i kept my promise we both have said charlie lets talk in the kitchen invited the doctor leading the way it was cramped with the three of them in it until the two men sat facing each other across the table marina put their tea in front of them and left at once defensively novikov said i only ever told you i might be able to help i remember everything you told me said charlie what is it you have at last he thought what would it be all or nothing my father was originally sentenced to gulag you told me that too even after he was allowed to transfer to the town he remained the camp doctor in interrupted charlie impatiently yes charlie felt the stir of anticipation what did he tell you he didnt tell me anything he was a doctor he kept medical notes there are conditions particularly prevalent to the region frostbite the most obvious a lot of crush injuries from the mines in my fathers day he often had to improvise treatment he kept records to help me charlie sipped his milkless tea letting the man talk how many missing pieces would novikov have charlie said you read them all ive got them all declared novikov simply id not read every single entry never intended to until the bodies were found then i did for any reference to a camp near yakutsk in and i knew camp existed knew my father had been sentenced to serve there but i never knew its exact location got them echoed charlie you mean you brought them with you here to moscow instead of answering novikov leaned beneath the kitchen table to a briefcase charlie hadnt been aware of until then there was a marker in the scuffed hardback ledger the man lifted on to the table rotating it for charlies convenience novikov said the first date you need is may fourth read on from there the brittle easily split paper would have been the cheapest and the ink would probably have been watered to make it go further it was already beginning to fade in places quite badly but the handwriting was legible missing letters and words easily filled in where they had become unreadable may camp pm infirmary emptied ordered by moscow officials unidentified woman early s blond well nourished severe abdominal trauma extensive venous hemorrhage blood in wound and mouth very

counteracting chlordiazepoxide accepted after moscow contact permanent line established noone allowed in the infirmary except myself patient spasmic killing fixation charlie lifted and replaced the cup without drinking conscious of novikov still sitting before him motionless there wasnt any sound from the other room either it had to be larisa krotkov and hank dunne some intentionally put to death some intentionally allowed to live nothing about hitlers bunker staff in the same camp wouldnt be charlie acknowledged irritated at the intrusion this was a doctors log nothing more he had to

also noted were temperatures and blood pressure counts ironically marked under the believed nationalities as the mans son had itemized his findings against the bodies of the yakutsk grave more than fifty years later it was the same incident wasnt it demanded novikov anxiously yes so there were witnesses others involved which hed already known thought charlie there was nothing new nothing that took him one stepone millimeterfurther forward and yet his mind remained blank trying too hard hoping too hard nowhere else to go nowhere else to look theres nothing more novikovs face was ashen this is not enough id hoped for more charlie heard the faintest of noises from the entrance hall behind him and guessed marina had eased herself to within hearing it wont affect your being here the man opposite him visibly sagged with relief im sorry i thought it was valuable would help instead of immediately replying charlie went back to the notes reading everything for a fortnight prior to may and for a full month after may camp was not mentioned again it became a repetitive catalogue of mine injuries often resulting in amputation and of illness and disabilities caused by the climate there were a lot of deaths recorded and frequent complaints of moscows refusal or inability to provide drugs at last charlie said id like to take this ledger for the may entries novikovs concern was immediate it would have been an offense for my father to make notes like that still would be for me to have kept them the references to moscow officials they had to be security didnt they the narodny komitet vnutrennikh del then no one else will ever see it but me and i already know you have it you are asking me to trust you putting ourselves in your hands you did that in yakutsk abruptly a man making an impulsive gesture he might quickly regret novikov thrust the log farther across the table toward charlie promise me that no one else will ever see it and that when you no longer need it you will destroy it i promise said charlie putting the log into his own briefcase before the doctor could change his mind will i see you again i dont know perhaps not thank you then for the last time i think of you as a good man that wasnt charlies impression of himself riding the metro back into the center of moscow with his briefcase clutched to his chest at that precise moment he thought of himself as a failed man not knowing where else to look what else to do and yet he physically shrugged aside the unanswerable selfquestion irritated by it and the foot twinge that came with it and which he never usually ignored this time for once it had to be wrong charlie didnt like not knowing what to do it was obviously something you had to know immediately said lestov of course accepted natalia shed accepted nikulins refusal to disclose any reason for the russian decision because shed had no alternative had secretly been relieved at the thought of the whole thing drifting to an inconclusive end just as long as it ended without any danger to her and charlieand sashapersonally now in minutes everything was thrown into total confusion again she wouldnt say why lestov shook his head just that it was an official instruction from washington it could be a trick suggested natalia wheres the trick lulling you into believing you could safely share with her something you might be withholding guessed natalia lestov shifted uncomfortably i dont think so natalia got up from her desk walking head bent toward the huge ministry window she arrived in time to see a gia traffic policeman on foot extract payment from a flaggeddown motorist preferring to pay an instant bribe rather than waste a day in court protesting an invented speeding offense charlie hadnt told her anything about the american withdrawal hed insisted nothing had emerged from the lunch with miriam bell claimed to be worried about the lack of progress the american girl was sleeping with lestov according to charlie maybe shed told her lover but not charlie or charlie was keeping things back from her in the belief that shed lied about not knowing why the russian decision had been made which took themback to their distrustful beginning her fault thenher decision she acknowledged surely it wasnt necessary for charlie to balance everything like for like over her shoulder natalia said what about the englishman he claims the london visit was for reevaluation said lestov he didnt offer anything new yesterday you believe him no so hes still actively investigating he gave every impression of doing so kept pressing about what our announcement was going to be are you going to tell dmitri borisovich natalia turned back into the room thats why i asked to see you dmitri borisovich intends to issue the press release today wants to know about belous hes still in custody have you told him what will happen to him if he says anything about his mother being nkvd lestov nodded and he believes me keep him in custody for the next few days just the same are you going to tell dmitri borisovich about america pressed lestov he was where he was nowliked being where he was nowbecause of some earlier internal intrigue he still didnt properly understand as the bearer of the message he didnt himself want to become a victim by its not being passed on to everyone who should know searching for the persuasion he said it might affect his making the release i know said natalia coming back to her desk to pick up the telephone openly boasting to colleagues in the embassy of deceiving his own department thought gerald williams triumphantly colleagues who could be called as witnesses if an internal tribunal could be convened thered be no way rupert dean or jeremy simpson could go on protecting their precious pet monkey once that was brought out it all came very nicely on the back of muffins appearance before them earlier in the week even dean and the legal adviser had been hardpressed to support the man then and the deputy directorgeneralhad certainly been receptive to the suggestion afterward that the investigation was going to fizzle out inconclusively exposing the department to criticism if not open ridicule in fact everything was coming together very nicely indeed kenton peterss weekend house was original old colonial white columned and with an encircling veranda overlooking the immediate oaktreed grounds and the paddocks and stables beyond where the arabians were bred there was a stallion and three mares in the nearest one peters and boyce sat savoring the tranquillity and privilege in shared contentment and in matching highbacked wicker chairs that crackled slightly when they moved their highballs on the separating table between them it was their second they were still dressed for golf which had ended an hour earlier boyce had intentionally taken five on a par four on the back nine to let peters win their wager boyce knew the american would have done the same for him if theyd been in england everything in their ordered lives had understood rules peters said had some trouble with the damned woman in moscow towards the end impudent had her fired boyce said really i had the impression from some of the message traffic ive seen that she was still on station she hadnt better be said the american indignantly he made a mental note to check was there any resentment from the bureau or the cia or your military people i simply told the agency and the military to keep out of it the military are getting their arlington glory with the president so theyre happy bureau director was a bit stiff at first but hes a political appointee and they do as theyre told in the end particularly if they get to like the job which most of them do as i said when all this began it was your difficulty i sympathized with used the principle of divide and rule reminded boyce toying idly with the tee he found in his pocket knew all the archives were clean so i just told each of them a little about the need to avoid difficulties if they had any skeletons in their department cupboards and left them to stumble around and get in each others way to cause as much confusion as possible with deans people whom i had the intelligence committee supposedly give the full investigation it was all a bit of a farce really none of them knew they were performing in one of course the butler came inquiringly on to the veranda and peters nodded to more drinks to boyce he said eight suit you for dinner perfect accepted the englishman peters said ive officially told the bureau the investigation is over was it wise to do so officially queried boyce being professionally curious is the job of most of these people peters coaxed a slim but long cheroot into life expelling a perfect smoke ring toward the distant horses i told the director it was national security that most convenient of panaceas and for everyone below it was on a needtoknow basis and they had no need to know the number of people that i had to deal with has given me a problem there admitted boyce im just going to let them thrash around until they themselves have to admit defeat might be necessary to initiate an internal inquiry to apportion responsibility for failure its the sort of thing that would be expected they stopped talking while the drinks were served as the butler left peters said that mean youre not entirely sure your archives are clean boyce smiled it means i dont like losing control and that everything is going to appear to have been done properly and fully now the american laughed losing control is a sin we neither of us will ever be accused of he sipped the new drink and said you spoken to your man day before i flew here and hes fine quite remarkable for his age no risk of his giving way why should he thats the last thing hed allow of course accepted the american media have been more of a nuisance than i expected still are in fact you thought what to do about that not really conceded the other man future role of deans department is a bit uncertain so theyre convenient if public scapegoats are necessary muffins the obvious choice he was on television from yakutsk remember hes identifible useful really that we didnt go ahead with the other idea always good to get the maximum benefit agreed the american whens your arlington ceremony next friday itll stoke the media pressure i guess but it cant be helped you wont be there of course of course not said peters actually surprised at being asked if hed ever appear at any public mediarecorded event you know said boyce while all this has been going on ive thought several times how much id like to have met clarence mitchell the man who set the whole thing up on our side peabody did it from here supplied peters samuel h peabody hell of a brain both of them for devising it and keeping it going for so long said boyce that was the true brilliance genius agreed peters and it cant be said weve failed them said boyce selfcongratulatory it could have gone very badly wrong if we hadnt acted as quickly and so effectively as we did true agreed peters very true indeed i wouldnt want it any other way but sometimes i wish people knew what we did to keep them safe in their beds boyce gestured expansively encompassing the house and grounds it has its rewards my own money not a penny from the taxpayer reminded peters were eating pheasant tonight shot them myself been hanging just long enough wonderful said boyce why demanded the presidential aide as he already had several times theres no logic no rationale he was pacing the room sometimes driving his fist into the palm of his other hand it was the first time natalia had witnessed nikulin display any sort of emotion and she wondered if shed get any clue why the man had ended the inquiry it was obviously something she knew vadim leonidovich would report back to which we would have to react too clumsy argued nikulin i believe theres a personal relationship nikulin stopped pacing why did he he began outraged for benefits beyond sex id guess said natalia it was something that had to be taken into their consideration which was why shed met nikulin alone might not she be doing it for the same reason thats why i mentioned it it wasnt the primary reason she wanted time the opportunity to talk it through with charlie before the release of the art recovery staged though it was intended to be im glad you did its very confusing though as it is my not knowing the reason for our decision said natalia openly it was one of the greatestand most secretof coups confided nikulin and it must always remain secret even from someone like you natalia nodded resigned it wasnt something shed tell charlie she decided the american would have known hed have to act upon it natalia repeated so its intentional to confuse us shouldnt we consider delaying the announcement about what was recovered from belous it has no significance dismissed the presidential aide can we be sure of that not knowing what this is about where is belous in custody ive ordered he stay there until we decide otherwise nikulin finally sat down whatever the americans are up to has no affect whatsoever upon our decision which stands we go ahead with the release gerald williams realized how totally he was committing himself and he was nervous about doing so he wished he belonged to the sortof club to which jocelyn hamilton had taken him which seemed the proper venue for such discussions instead of a public restaurant even one close enough to westminster to be the favorite of mps and cabinet minsters williams had spotted three and a minister within minutes of his arrival he filled the time waiting for the deputy directorgenerals arrival studying the menu horrified at the prices hamilton was greeted as a regular by the restaurant manager who had initially regarded williams as an unwelcomed intruder and on his way to the table hamilton stopped to talk to the cabinet minister and after that to an mp frequently quoted in newspapers as an espionage expert hamilton finally arrived with flurried apologies for being late and as he was seated told the manager to ensure thered be that days special available from his study of the menu williams knew that was lamb chops and ordered the same he chose margaux too remembering it was what hamilton had selected entertaining him at the reform club whats all the mystery about demanded the department deputy the moment they were alone not mystery said williams concern although williams had spent a long time sanitizing his account hamilton said the moment hed finished youve been talking like this to the people across the river i spoke to my counterpart horlick once to assure him the expenditure was coming off our budget not his which i consider it should because were heading the investigation with his agreement i talked direct to cartright in moscow didnt want anyone imagining unlimited expenses and have done a few times since to make sure costs remain under control what ive told you has come up in general conversation it doesnt sound like general conversation to me refused hamilton to me it sounds pretty specificimproper in fact im prepared to make allowance for that said williams im far more worried at the greater danger which weve talked about too many times to need repeating this man is openly talking in moscow of treating us like fools you saw for yourself what it was like just days ago somethings got to be done why are you telling me like this why not officially to sir rupert because it is only gossip and all right improper gossip at that any case against muffin has got to be backed by a proper inquiry supported by fact witnesses so persisted the other man ive become involved in this by accident im the financial director ive done my bit auditing accounts that virtually prove the money dealing which amounts to a criminal act youre operational im suggesting for the sake of the departmentfor us allyou ask cartrights people to authorize his providing an official account factually checking what the hell muffins up to hamilton sat with the lamb halfway to his mouth regarding williams across the table in disbelief are you serious deadly serious i dont like it i like less the thought of what will happen if we dont move i need to think about it very seriously indeed said hamilton the time for thinking is over insisted williams now weve got to do something positive charlie was kept at the embassy cabling the full text of the russian release to london and afterward answering the queries that came back which distilled down into contributing nothing new and natalia was at lesnaya when he got home sasha already asleep there was still the reservation of the previous nightthe uncertainty thered been at the beginningalthough not quite so awkward charlie told her about the encounter with vitali novikov and then showed her the log while she read it he made drinks when he returned to the main room she said this isnt anything just confirmation of what we already believed i know ive read it a hundred times trying to find something he decided against telling her the nagging feeling that kept pricking at him there were enough mysteries without the need to invent more natalia said what did you tell novikov that it wont affect their residency natalia looked at her watch lets see the result of the russian contribution the russian announcement was the lead item on all the englishlanguage satellite news programs through which charlie flicked photographs of the recovered art had been issued with the release claiming them as further proof of raisa belouss heroic wartime work keeping russias heritageparticularly actual treasure from the amber roomout of nazi hands fyodor belous was included in the eulogy for returning the safeguarded articles the moment hed discovered the truth about his mother cnn and the bbc also carried footage outside belouss empty apartment with reporters quoting official sources suggesting the man was helping the authorities search further for things still hidden inevitably every program carried library pictures of the treasures of the catherine palace and the other royal residences at tsarskoe selo as well as film of the devastation after the nazi occupation of the park just as inevitably there was speculation that the further lost art that belous was helping locate was the missing amber room itself i tried to get it delayed disclosed natalia why charlie frowned the expression remained as she talked although more in guilt at his disbelieving herand at setting the test she was at that moment passingthan at anything else charlie was glad natalia would never know hed doubted her he said nikulin was right whatever brought about the american decision wont be influenced by the art announcement that was only bait in the first place all thats going to happen is america refusing to bite and a lot of renewed publicity natalia offered the log back to charlie you were relying on that werent you yes he admitted what now i dont know charlie forced himself to admit and then in a rush and without warning he thought he did he had sufficient about the mystery english officer at least and most of it allowed the pieces to fit what demanded natalia seeing the expression on charlies face instead of immediately answering charlie flicked the televisionback to the permanently running cnn leaning forward intently to study the pictures of what had been recovered from belous and then he told natalia are you sure positive he looked down at the log of novikovs father and said and it was here all the time charlies satisfaction ebbed by the following day sitting in his shoebox office surrounded by a squadron of reflectively folded paper airplanes charlie acknowledged reluctantly that natalia was right his conclusioneven more positively confirmed by examining in detail the tsarskoe selo treasure catalogue of catherine the greats palacedidnt explain america and russia quite independently closing the investigation down and there was only one way to try to prove what he now did know with no guarantee that hed succeed and after henry packer possibly physically dangerous if he made the attempt and it went wrong by just one millimetereven excluding the packertype riskhed be dismissed and withdrawn from moscow on top of which he couldnt discuss it with the directorgeneral who couldnt possibly condone it even if the mans personal support hadnt been wavering as much as charlie knew it was so hed be totally disregardingdefying the department and going off station without authority which was very definitely a firing offense but what choice did he have it was the only way forward it did fit sufficiently for him to be sure of at least part and there was kenton peters on tape describing him as a fall guy if one was necessary so he was damned if he went solo and damned if he didnt he refused to think about being dead charlie forced his mind from the negative to the positive it was physically possible to fly to england and back in one day leaving on the first morning plane and returning on the last at night so hedonly be away for twelve hours at the most and it wouldnt be difficult to give london an excuse in advance for his absence from the embassy the newspaper coverage of the art recoveryparticularly the speculation that fyodor belous was guiding the authorities to more treasure possibly even the amber roomhad been enormous but charlie already knew from natalia there wasnt going to be anything more london might panic about so that wasnt a bar to his going what else an ally he decided now that he and miriam had resolved their personal war shed been described as a fall guy too it would require slight adjustment to his dislike of being dependent on someone else but charlie muffins rules of engagement were always adjustable to suit his needs and at that moment he judged his need to be quite extreme the positive fell far short of outweighing the negative but there was a balance of sorts and he took as an omen the fact that when he inquired there was availability on both the outgoing and incoming british airways flights the following day he made reservations and then set about establishing the cover for his absence which would be easy he could use the art recovery charlie was later to remember the startled look with which richard cartright greeted him when he entered the mi mans office i dont like this objected the military attache at once looking to raymond mcdowell for support neither do i agreed the head of chancellery do you think i do demanded richard cartright theyre my instructions from london why asked gallaway they were in the military attaches office and theatrically the man got up and locked the door cartrights relief at being told officially by his own department to assess charlie muffins investigation was limited it had briefly been shattered by the scruffy mans arrival in his office an hour earlier which cartright had at first thought frightened to be a confrontation since then hed tried to rationalize what there was to work from and realized how limited that was too apart from the contempt with which charlie muffin had dismissed his superiors on his return from london everything else remained totally unsupported mostly bedroomtittletattle but what increased cartrights unease was being asked in the authorizing message from his operational officer that morning if the man had boasted of making misleading telephone calls during his london recall or had ever referred to someone named lionel burbage a confused cartright was still awaiting clarification on that his explanation prepared for the inevitable question from one or the other of them cartright said i didnt like his attitude when he came back behaving as if what were all supposed to be doing wasnt important i asked london if anything had happened there to sort the whole business out when they asked me why i told them seeing the look on the faces of the other two men cartright added i dont consider that disloyal i see it as selfprotection for us all he looked pointedly at mcdowell you forgotten what happened to your predecessor muffin certainly hasnt tried very hard to be a team player conceded the diplomat and from what i gather he caused jackson some embarrassment in berlin me too for that matter joined in gallaway i had the ministry on demanding to know why i wasnt aware of his going there looked a bit of a bloody fool having to admit he hadnt told me after id already assured them we were working well together which is another joke this time on us insisted cartright he came to see me this morning said he thought there might be something in this russian statement and when i asked him what said he couldnt tell me until hed looked into it properly you think we should tell london asked gallaway at once im certainly going to cover myself said cartright nothing specific because i cant be just an advisory that there might be something thats what he said he was doing probably a good idea for us all to do the same said mcdowell he paused i suppose its true to say hes treated us all a bit shabbily but im still not sure it justifies an official inquiry not by itself perhaps cartright admitted but i think there are things going on in london we dont know about which lets face it has been our problem all along not properly knowing whats going on i think what ive been asked is part of a far deeper inquiryinto how the investigation has been conducted from the start as far as we know its got nowhere i for one dont intend having any responsibility for failure offloaded on me the other two men shifted uncomfortably gallaway said i understand your point of view mcdowell said yes quite pleased with the way it was going cartright said all im asking is to be able to say you were with me when he said what he did and to know youll support me if you get asked about it from london direct it would be the truth would it accepted mcdowell he did say what he did in front of all three of us virtually made a joke of it in fact think maybe i should tell the ambassador though not exactly conducive to the smooth running of the embassy probably wise to make our position clear said gallaway thank you im glad were agreed said cartright he hoped it would go on being this easy he hoped irena wasnt on a longhaul flight it would be bettermore convincingif he had a russian with him he shouldnt forget miriam either i thought wed stopped all this shit protested the american the reaction from the highclass hookersimagining unequal competitionto her entry at the savoy hotel bar was only just subsiding they had charlie remembered agreed on his role as miriams pimp it would be a job with career prospects if it goes wrong you dont want to know about it said charlie my plane arrives back at ten local time ill call you by eleven if theres time i might check in during the day if it goes right youll know it all by tomorrow night enough assured charlie once hed always needed to know it all he remembered another adjustable rule if anyone asks youre following up something about this art recovery but havent told me what it is miriam clarified thats all its an odd coincidence what is asked charlie richard cartrights called invited me to dinner you going i stalled waited to see what you wanted first what are you going to do miriam shrugged a gals got to eat you never did give me a name incidently orgnev supplied charlie glad of the reminder arkadi orgnev operates from a pitch near the buratino cafe in the arbat charlie spent longer than necessary assuring sasha that the giraffes neck hadnt been stretched by someone pulling its head hoping natalias concerndriven anger would have lessened by the time he went back into the living room it hadnt youre trying to convince yourself as much as me she accused dont you think i have to go i think its madness you dont know anyones going to try to make you a scapegoat and even if they do you stand more chance of surviving than risking everything which is what youre doing risking us i dont think so i love you charlie i love you and sasha loves you and i really do want us to spend the rest of our lives together but i dont know how much longer i can go on like this thats why i have to go to get the whole damned thing over make us safe i dont think were ever going to be safe thats why it might be better to make a decision about us now stop putting it off no refused charlie ill get it right and well survive that night they lay stiffly side by side untouching and charlie knew every time he woke up which he did often that natalia was awake too she remained stiff even when he tried to kiss her goodbye only just responding it meant he spent more time thinking about himself and natalia on the flight to london than about what he had to do when he got there but there was time during the drive sir peter mason personally opened the door the man said you didnt ring for an appointment charlie said you might have refused to see me i still could but you wont will you despite the totally unexpected intrusion sir peter mason was as immaculate as he had been at charlies first visit even to the fresh rose buttonhole although todays pinstripe was blue not gray the hair was as neatly barbered and in place too which made the last detail for which charlie was looking easy to find although he would have missed it as hed missed it before if he hadnt specifically looked and todays walk to the library had provided all the confirmation hed really needed the man sat easily on the far side of the desk big enough charlie reckoned for a real delta wing not a paper reproduction and in the chair in which hed been placed opposite charlie tried to appear as relaxed the man said well now how is it you think i can help you further there was just the faintest unctuousness charlie curbed the tingling euphoria knowing the confirmation was only significant to him and that to get the admission he wanted the conversation to followwith a man whose entire life had been listening and talking in nuances and doublespeakhad to be the cleverest he himself had ever conducted in a lifetime of nuance and doublespeak you could give me your own version of what happened at yakutsk to compare with the one i have the laugh was of disbelief the one word stretched in astonishment what i know declared charlie hopefully the other mans face was stiff now i havent the slightest idea what youre talking about youre clearly suffering some mental aberration and i think it best that you leave before i call the police the tone was controlled unemotional just mildly irritated could he risk it wondered charlie that might be an idea they could take your statement officially he decided against completing the threat ive asked you to leave the moment to hit hard judged charlie it was your battledress button wasnt it and the casing from your service revolver this is madness he hadnt reached for the telephone or threatened to call sir rupert dean to whom hed referred intimidatingly several times at the previous meeting no sir peter its fact forensically proven evidential fact which youve communicateddiscussedto others the first crack of course said charlie it wasnt an actual lie only the inference that sir peter mason had been connected with it wasnt true in writing yes then youre guilty of libel not the first crack at all which youd need to take me into a court of law to prosecute said charlie you sure you can afford to appear in court sir peter more im sure than you in every meaning of the word afford bullyingpompousbut that was all assessed charlie still far short you havent called the police im more interested now in the total extent of your aberration and your libel that was a crack although again not sufficient cleverly outtalking him in fact charlie conceded the bastard was trying to learn how much he knew was larisa already dead when they found you and brought you back to the camp infirmary larisa who larisa krotkov ive never heard of anyone named larisa krotkov nor do i know what camp youre referring to there was no euphoria or satisfaction left charlie was hot perspiring aware he was losing gulag that means nothing to me what about raisa i did not know raisa belous the hardest hit he could think of charlie decided shes the woman you killed shot in the back of the head to go first into thegrave before simon norrington and george timpson were thrown on top mason actually jerked back in his chair his face bloodred eyes bulged hands no longer cupped but splayed against the desktop to support himself his mouth moved several times but there were no immediate words and when they finally came they were strained wheezing from the man i will see to it that you are prosecuted put away your life everything is over finished hed been within a hairbreadth charlie recognized hed rocked the man had him teetering on the edge but at the last minute mason had pulled back turning the nearcollapse into apparent outrage he had to push again charlie acknowledgedpush with everything else he had to topple the man on the second attempt the uncertainty was not being sure just how much there really was left charlie said i cant imagine what it must have been like no one can not surprising that you ran like you did no one could blame you for wanting to get away remarkable that you managed to get so far although not that they didnt shoot they had other more longterm needs for you of course as they had for harry dunne didnt stop them from shooting larisa though but then shed served her purpose hadnt she georgi he suddenly remembered how larisa in her dying delerium would have referred by the russian name to george timpson whod carried the cutoff photograph of them both together and larisa did try to stop george timpson from getting shot didnt she he guessed got hit herself doing it couldnt be saved he nodded to masons hands and the deformed fingers still splayed on the desk not like your fingers were saved despite the frostbite he was a good doctor wasnt he if i hadnt known hed had to amputate your earlobeparticularly looked when you opened the door to me todayi wouldnt have known youd lost it im sure not many people have all these years it didnt work sir peter mason retained his rigidly affronted stance although his color went and his voice returned to nearnormal ive heard enoughtoo muchof this absurdity youll leave my house immediately i intend contacting sir rupert at once to carry out the threats ive made about every report youve filed the controlwent at the end color abruptly suffused the mans face again and he roared crackvoiced get out and rose actually pointing toward the door and charlie did charlie drove obliviously thoughts in free fall for several miles before the most essential awareness forced its way to the forefront of his mind how muchhow badlyhad he lost it didnt matter that sir peter mason without any doubt in charlies mind was the murdering second officer or what the obvious implications were of his having been all his life at the heart of british government hed failed to get an admission and the log of a longdead doctor was insufficient evidence what about the rest he needed a jury charlie decided a tribunal at least and there was no way hed get that now mason would have an explanation no matter how thin the man would complain to the directorgeneral probably to a lot of other people as well there wasnt a defense against confronting mason but charlie needed to get his explanationand what little was leftto sir rupert dean first what was initially indefensible was his being unofficially in england at all which he knew and the consequences of which he had to accept by the end of the day hed doubtless have had confirmed what he already knew them to be so he could wait until then to call natalia would she give up everything and bring sasha to live in london or would she look upon it as the obvious breaking point that shed virtually declared during last nights row as always too many questions with too few answers the first stepwhich professionally would be his lastwas to get through the encounter with sir rupert so totally upon that was charlies concentration that he wasnt aware of the siren or of the flashing lights of the police car until it actually came up alongside with the observer waving him into the roadside charlies first thought was of henry packer he kept the window closed and the locks down pointless though that would have been until he was satisfied the two uniformed men walking back toward him really were policemen and not armed when charlie finally wound down the window the observer said every unit in norfolk is looking for this car and this number idont know what youve done my son but its upset a lot of important people i know said charlie he gave the same reply to the special branch officers who greeted him at norwich police headquarters with the practically identical remark i thought we were going to do some ourselves protested irena of course not said cartright irritably there was a virtual sea of tourists washing around the arbat and it really was like forcing their way against a fastrunning current he felt more disoriented than discomfited what are you going to do then find a particular man ask him to identify the photograph he patted the pocket containing the picture of charlie muffin to reassure himself it was still there thered be a lot of pickpockets in a crowd like this why did you want me to come demanded irena still protesting the man im looking for will feel more comfortable with a russian than with a foreigner they have some nice jewelry in the foreign outlet store on serebryany well look afterwards sighed cartright whats the name arkadi orgnev he works around the buratino there it is she said pointing to the cafe with the illustrations of pinocchio after which it was named cartright prompted irena to ask and they were misdirected to two people before a short rotund man in a baseball cap tshirt and levis jeans was pointed out to them arkadi orgnev asked cartright taking over maybe said the man i think you might be able to help me how much cartright pulled the money from his pocket sufficiently for the man to see it was dollars of course im prepared to pay for what i want the man put a whistle in his mouth and blew it and five menmaterialized from the crowd surrounding them one was the second person irena had asked to point out the moneychanger how did the cocksucker find out i hadnt been fired demanded miriam i dont know said nathaniel brindsley in washington asked the director outright apparently the director didnt have any alternative the sonofabitch im sorry honey really sorry when kenton peters comes on the line god takes the call what am i to do miriam suddenly felt lost pack up close your apartment well do our best about severance personal word of the director himself fuck you fuck all of you miriam shouted down the telephone know how you feel sympathized the bureaus overseas director you know fuckall like the rest of them said miriam there was instant professionaltoprofessional recognition and they didnt ask charlie why theyd had to arrest him and charlie didnt offer any explanation which would have been difficult anyway his not being precisely sure there was bound to be a wide choice under the official secrets act the policemen tried with soccer to which charlie couldnt contribute because he didnt follow it on his satellite sports channels and eventually they found common ground with movies agreeing there was too much sex and violence the driver mourned the passing of those wonderful musicals and admitted an unrequited passion for doris day charlies curiosity was answered when they passed between the headquarters of both intelligence agencies on opposing sides of the thames to sweep into the entrance tunnel of the foreign office as charlie was signed into the custody of a foreign office uniformedcustodian like the special delivery he supposed he was one of the special branch officers wished him luck and charlie thanked him as the custodian escorted charlie along darkened corridors and into noiseless elevators the man said charlie would probably need it because james boyce was a bastard charlie didnt bother to reply passingly surprised at the indiscretion more immediately aware that his not being escorted into the building by the special branchbeing brought in fact to the foreign office instead of a police stationmeant he wasnt under arrest it was essential for whatever was awaiting him to seize every pointer like that the corner office on the fourth floor overlooking the statued square the houses of parliament and across westminster bridge immediately designated the sleek diminutive man behind the regulation landingstrip desk as a permanent secretary charlie assumed him to be james boyce although once more there were no introductions there were six other men already waiting sir rupert and patrick pacey the departments political officer both sat stonefaced unsympathetic mourners at a funeral charlie guessed the only way sir peter mason could have arrived ahead of him after giving special branch the rented car number was by helicopter which was significant it put the final piece in the puzzle to make everything crystal clear charlie had only once before a long time ago been involved with a traitor who had been given amnesty in exchange for all that hed known and done for the other side it had been one of the few occasionsapart from now with natalia which was totally differentthat hed been unable to separate business from personal animosity he could recite backward all the professional justification for turning a traitor back upon his masters but it was one of the few established practices of a totally amoral professional that was anathema to charlie he assumed from the proprietorial way mason sat easily in one of the encompassing leather armchairs by the parliament square windows that the room had once been the mans own it was not the tribunal charlie had expected and with this new and complete realization he wondered how much advantage he could maneuver out of it follow their lead he told himself but not necessarily subserviently which was always inherently difficult anyway and would be especially so now that he understood all he neededabout mason what else could he read from the situation before it began they clearly believed he did know it all to have picked him up and to have arraigned him at this level of authority and were shitscared there was obviously no question of his relaxing but charlie began to feel vaguely comfortable boyce said you appear to have made very serious allegations i am carrying out an assignment said charlie the bastards were going to make him stand which was stupid to their disadvantage not his it put him on the orchestra podium baton ready it was not part of your assignment to leave moscow without authorization like a lot of small men boyce was a bully charlie guessed he was also a lousy interrogator if indeed thats what the man saw his function to be there was no hurry let them set out their battle formations i was authorized ten days ago to come here from moscow to carry out inquiries as part of that assignment i considered my going back to moscow for the russian announcement merely an interruption of that original authorization i had not finished the inquiries i came here to complete now i have charlie hoped the directorgeneral appreciated not having any responsibility offloaded thats a fatuous explanation rejected the permanent secretary blustering deciding charlie he wondered how many times pompous men at this echelon were openly opposed not often he wouldnt have thought then that must be your judgment mine is that by coming back today i have totally obeyed my directorgenerals instructions to find out howand whya british lieutenant with others was murdered fiftyfour years ago in a remote part of what was then the soviet union he turned slightly to look directly at mason wouldnt you agree that to be a reasonable assessment sir peter it became so quiet charlie could hear the sound of the longcased clock even its tick was respectful he thought the chill that permeated the room would be akin to that at the depth of winter in yakutsk itself when the climate was at its subzero worst they really did have to be shitscared to be staging this performance boyce said id like your response to what i said about your making serious allegations against sir peter thinice time charlie said i put a number of points to sir peter as part of my investigation points you claim to have communicated to others said boyce briefly looking directly at the directorgeneral yet sir rupert does not appear to be aware of them the bloody fools were seeking damage limitation charlie accepted i was responding to a question from sir peter about a battledress button and a shell casing from a revolver said charlie both of which formed part of a very early report to london that is so cut in sir rupert dean from the side from my battle dress and revolver interjected mason why apart from overwhelming pomposity was the man this confident looking around the room charlie estimated that the man whom he knew from the whos who entry to be close to eightyfive had to be at least twenty years older than anyone else ill take that as the confirmation you didnt provide earlier i meant thats what you claimed them to be flustered the man one of the unidentified men leaned briefly to his companion whispered and then said more loudly this isnt getting us very far is it lets discuss it more directly shall we i think you should tell us everything you know ordered boyce if he hadnt been one hundred and one percent right about sir peter mason he wouldnt be standing on increasingly painful feet in front of this star chamber charlie knew so he could be far more accusative than he had been trying to trap the man into an admission earlier how much further could he go he could bring in the hitler bunker staff although cautiously and the fact that larisa krotkov and raisa belous had switched from art conservators to trophy brigade looters to nkvd intelligence officers using their art expertise as a cover for their association with norrington and timpson and what about mason too charlie reminded himself he still wasnt sure how to bring that accusation in charlie talked not to the assembled men but to the former permanent secretary intentionally in the manner of a prosecutor careless of the personal contempt being obvious he embellished the scene hed read about in the log of novikovs father confident from the references to the mental collapse of both mason and harry dunne that mason wouldnt clearly remember very quickly charliebecame alert to masons reaction it wasnt the bombastic refusal of earlier in the day although his face grew red again and his body stiffened mason was hardly looking at him instead his eyeflickering concentration was upon everyone else in the room men who with the possible exception of james boyce were for the first time hearing a full and detailed account of the yakutsk incident with those awarenesses came a further understanding mason so sure and cocooned for so many years felt himself humiliated particularly by the contempt with which the accusations were being leveled briefly charlie turned back into the room and caught expressions of disdain on the faces of two of the unidentified men boyce was gazing pointedly down at his desk standing as he was at that moment charlie missed the moment when mason broke brought back to the man by the nearshout it wasnt like that at all the bastard thought he could justify it charlie recognized amazed maybe you should tell it instead of me im going to insisted the man still looking beyond charlie to the others in the room youve got to know the real truth not this understand how it happened behind him charlie heard the stir move through the room but didnt look back again his total attention upon the man straightening commandingly before him he couldnt be wrong charlie told himself it was impossible yet it was the political opportunity of the entire war of the century began mason forcefully something that couldnt have been ignored hitlers staff the men and women who knew everything where all the documentation was all that hitler had done and said in the last months of the war his actual will which the russians seized still have gold literally for dunne and myself and the hiding places of the nazi loot for norrington and timpson mason paused swallowing the color was lessening the man would have made hundreds of presentations in this room but none so impassioned as this charlie was sure not since maybe the first time hed been called upon to explain we knew it was genuine mason picked up the russians got to the bunker first had all the staff names which checked out against those we had tricked norrington and timpson to begin with linked them up with the women when they went into the russiansector to check out the goering rumor which wasnt true of course promised them everything that was stolen from tsarskoe selo even the amber room then they talked about all the political material i didnt know then didnt know for a long time that theyd identified dunne and myself as political officers commissars they called us i took the call from norrington dunne spoke to timpson special clearance they said no problem with documentation for russia norrington was perfect had both languages according to the russians the bunker staff had agreed to cooperatetell them where everything was from tsarskoe selo and make hitlers will available to usin return for being transferred away from yakutsk but they wanted the guaranteed safety of british and american officers to ensure they wouldnt be cheated all be over in two or three days they said there was certainly no problem for any of us to take off for two or three days made our own rules everyone did mason stopped again as if to judge the reception charlies feet began to throb there were a lot of russians but only norrington could properly talk to them resumed the old man they were very friendly a lot of drinking toasts to friendship lent us protective clothes for the flight and for when we got there they said it was summer but ive never known anywhere so cold he parted his cupped hands briefly to cover the ear that had been frostbitten as if he could still feel pain separated us when we got there dunne and i were by ourselves thats the way it had to be they said politics for us art for them hitlers bunker staff were all assembled dollmann buhle staubwasswe stoelin the russians said norrington and timpson were elsewhere with the rest we talked through russian interpreters the germans were willing to tell us all they could to get away from the place that was the first weanyoneknew that hitlers last will and testament had survived the proper discussion was planned to begin the following day dunne and i slept in a barrack in the prison camp when we asked about the others we were told they were in another part with the hitler staff who knew all about the einsatzstab reichsleiter rosenberg fur die besetzten gebiete there was a van waiting to take us to what they said would be a conference room it had been dark when we arrivedit was dark practically all the timebut there wasenough light in the morning for us to see prisoners in another section the interpreters said theyd committed very serious offenses mostly war crimes it was light enough too to realize that we were being taken out of the camp then we heard some explosions and saw smoke up ahead mason trailed off bringing a handkerchief up to his mouth head bowed his voice was cracked when he started to speak again ill never forget that scene cant there was still a lot of smoke around the crater debris still falling and russians i dont know how many but at first too many to see that norrington and timpson were shackled and kneeling by the hole with the woman larisa wasnt shackled but she was crying everyone around them had guns and the men in the van pulled guns on us too they made us get out and i thought we were going to be shot as well norrington was talking in russian loudly arguing raisa was crying timpson didnt see us until we got very close because of his eyes but when he did he shouted out said he didnt know why but they were going to be killed told us to make them stop mason abruptly sobbed then coughed and boyce said peter you dont have to but the old man waved the deformed hand and said i do i wont be wrongly accused he looked up swallowing for the first time looking steadily at charlie they took my revolver put one of theirs literally to my head the barrel touching me made me stand directly behind raisa and said i had to kill her put my gun back in my hand and told me to press the trigger i refused told them to kill me there was a terrible explosion and then another and i thought they had but someone had shot timpson i saw him thrown forward into the crater and there was another flash but no sound and i saw there were photographers on the other side of the hole taking pictures larisa was on the ground screaming they told me again to kill raisa but i wouldnt norrington was yelling in russian the next shot killed him knocking him into the grave on top of timpson i think they were still shouting for me to fire but i couldnt hear properly because the shots had been very close someone grabbed me from behindput their hand over mine and pressed the trigger and raisas head seemed to split in half and there were more photographs and then i was let go there was a further gulping break i stood there waiting to beshot but nothing happened there was a lot of confusion dunne just stood there i dont know if hed been made to fire or not everyone was concentrating upon burying the bodies i got back to the truck i remember being sick then running i just ran anywhere i dont know where it had got very dark again and cold dear god it was so very cold i couldnt find any road kept falling over and in the end i couldnt get up anymore so i lay there knowing i was going to die i didnt hear men only dogs that were brought from the camp thats what i remember next being in the camp being wrapped in blankets and looked at by a doctor the hand went up to his ear again being operated upon we were flown out that night back to berlin the gaze totally upon charlie was defiant they had the photographs of us by the graveside but not of russians theyd been painted out they planned to blackmail us as killers of our fellow officers enough stopped boyce at last therell be no more sir peter is not on trial has nothing whatsoever to answer for all thats necessary for each of you to know further is that sir peter has performed for this countryhis countryone of the bravest and most successful services in its postwar history at any time in history for a full twenty years until his retirement sir peterwith harry dunne who provided what appeared to be confirmation from the state department in washingtonfed moscow with whatever we wanted them to believe while all the time they understood they were receiving information from a priceless source for fifteen of those years from the permanent secretary to the foreign office himself in effect for twenty years we and the americans ran russias foreign policy as and how we wished not just in espionage terms but politically as well we conducted the coup of this or any other century because the discovery of the bodies was made publicly known an investigation had to be publicly staged as of this moment it is officially closed as i can tell you it has been by america he looked at charlie except for you you learned far too much i want your sources and i want a total and complete apology demanded sir peter mason he looked pointedly across the room to sir rupert dean and other assurances to go with it one at a time said charlie to the directorgenerals undisguised wince the source first there is nothing that cannot be bought or bribed in moscow for the right price apart from what i deduced for myself in yakutsk and what littlefar too little to matterwas shared by the fbi everything came from russian intelligence archives sir peter was not named but there were details of his frostbite injuries to his ears and hand which i recognized when we met did you understand from the archives you read that the russians still believe everything they were told was genuine demanded the permanent secretary yes said charlie how much of it do the americans know the cooperation wasnt good im not sure it doesnt matter everything has concluded very satisfactorily declared boyce except for an apology reminded mason theres just one or two things that arent clear said charlie ignoring the demand there are photographs of the bodies as they were found in the grave which show that raisa belous was shot first was at the very bottom not the top in fact when the grave was first uncovered the local investigators only thought there were two bodies not three that confuse you like it confuses me sir peter it happened as ive said it did insisted the man something else pressed charlie you sure there wasnt a third british officer at yakutsk as far as i can see there would have had to be from what youve told us according to you they immediately started filling in the grave after shooting raisa who do you think told them where to find the duplicate tailors label in the trouser waistband that enabled me to trace simon norrington and stripped the body to provide the identification in berlin you will stop this said boyce im confused about the start charlie bulldozed on youand harry dunnereported what had happened to military intelligence the moment you got back to the western sector of berlin in late may of course said mason flushed again it was before i left berlinthat the planning began to deceive the russians which we did for so long easily recalling the dates from his whos who reading charlie said planning that wasnt put into operation until fiveor was it ten years later not until you became part of the foreign office secretariat i wont be subjected to interrogation said mason and ive told you to stop shouted boyce this is important now that we know everything has to remain the secret its always been ignored charlie again we know because hes just told us that sir peter didnt know raisa belous before meeting her in may in the russiancontrolled eastern section of berlin but youve seen the russian photographs released a couple of days ago of some art objects that raisa belous saved from catherine the greats palace one of the prints was a durer which is the next in sequence to the one i saw this morningand on my first visit although i didnt connect it thenin sir peters house in east dereham and theres a small pastoral scenei think its a watteaujust at the beginning of the hallway corridor which makes a pair with the one also in the photograph charlie felt the chill begin to settle in the room again and it might not be a good idea to offer for sale on the open market the small canvas of sophia of anhaltzerbst hanging just inside your study door sir peter that was catherine the greats maiden title before her marriage and is listed in the palace catalogue as one of the masterpieces still missing this meeting is ended announced boyce not until you supercilious bastards know just how firmly ive got you by the balls charlie decided to boyce he said i take it youll explain everything to sir matthew norrington i wouldnt want to tell him anything he shouldnt know youve gained us a lot of enemies yourself more than anyone said sir rupert dean before charlie could respond patrick pacey said but guaranteed the continuance of the department in my opinion dont you ever again as much as think of going awol as you did threatened the directorgeneral ill accept no excuse no apologyit wouldnt be politically acceptable for me to fire you after today if i could i would and still might find a reason for doing so dont think of your survival as anything other than a temporary postponement he never had thought charlie theyd walked back from the foreign office and his feet were on fire i understand at no time did i intend any disrespect to you personally or to the department i said i didnt want to hear any of that youre not going back to moscow theres another problem to deal with first first seized charlie so his return was only a postponement too can i ask what richard cartright was arrested by the russians some nonsense about currencydealing diplomatic immunity was invoked to get the bloody fool out but hes implicating one of us who asked charlie just for the pleasure of hearing the name gerald williams said the political officer incidently said dean how much did you pay to get to the intelligence archives it wasnt a lumpsum payment said charlie anticipating what was to come im keeping the man on a permanent retainer its expensive but proved invaluable in this instance alone on the telephone natalia sounded as subdued as desultory even as she had that morning she accepted his remaining in london without asking why and told him not to bother when he asked what she thought he should bring back for sasha natalia added that she didnt want anything for herself either when he said everything had turned out perfectly and that he loved her she said good but didnt say she loved him in return it took several moments for charlie to pick through the obscenities when he spoke to miriam bell not immediately understanding what she was telling him stop off in london charlie said and tell your people youd like to meet peters in person to talk about harry dunne and sir peter mason they going to save my life they just saved mine whats the story with cartright he kept on that night we met about how i imagined you really got the money to afford the apartment so i suggested the name of the man at the arbat and then anonymously telephoned the local militia post ill buy dinner when you get here promised charlie it was scheduled as a tribunal hearing into the civilian arrest of richard cartright but within the first hour of the first day gerald williams virtually became a coaccused with jocelyn hamilton and sis case officer malcolm covington only just avoiding an indictment desperately cartright insisted his arbat approachwhich had not been to a money dealer named arkadi orgnev but a posing militia currency investigatorhad been part of an investigation into the activities of charlie muffin officially authorized by sis case officer malcolm covington and that he had the moscow cable to prove it the dollars he had shown the russian had not been to trade but to pay for the identification from a photograph hed been carrying of muffin as a client he had not known his woman companion an aeroflot stewardess was carrying shed admitted to the militia shed intended to sell cartright produced a diary of every conversationand what was discussedwith gerald williams and called as a witness his departments financial director to confirm his having checked williamss london conversation with the man about expenses claims from which hed assumed he was at liberty to talk to williams on a combined agency investigation miriam bell arrived in london that afternoon took a room on the floor below charlies at the dorchester and was waiting in the foyer when charlie got back she said im pissed off been here half an hour and havent got propositioned once and smiled this is london not moscow it shouldnt make any difference charlie took her to the rib room because he thought shed like the steaks which she did she agreed that cartright sounded like a prick but didnt deserve to be dismissed but williams did charlie said that if hed had any pity which he didnt it would have been pitiful to listen to her steak covered half her plate as his did and shed eaten it by the time he finished filling in all the details of the yakutsk murders she said jesus h christ that was an operation and a half who dyou think got caught and turned first peter mason or harry dunne i dont know whoever it was immediately shopped the other great idea turning them and maintaining them for so long she said admiringly i wonder if it balanced out the damage they did before they got caught how am i supposed to know about this i told them we didnt cooperatethat i didnt know what you had no reason why you shouldnt have found out about timpson like i did or that theres a grave in holland no reason either why you cant have established a paid source at lubyanka square id have had to share a source like that with saul hes the bureau chief youve got a hell of an inside track there one im going to guard with my life id do the same if i was that lucky what feedback did you get from washington panic demands for a full explanation what did you say that id give it in person when i saw peters im not sure thisll save me but its going to be better than any lay ive ever had to make kenton peters kiss my ass never thought id be able to keep the promise to myself so thanks a whole lot you think youll come back to moscow if you survive miriam shook her head i dont want to if it goes good im going to ask for a reassignment somewhere warm and nice australia or spain maybe because it was miriams first time in london and she wanted to charlie actually compromised to windowshop past harvey nicholsand harrodsdeciding to look in both before going back to moscow despite natalia telling him not to buy presentsbut they hailed a taxi after about half an hour they had a nightcaptwo in factat the dorchester bar and during the second miriam said you know something what ive just decided it would spoil things if you and i went to bed together yes agreed charlie it would you want to know something else what ive never felt like that about a guy before not sure if it makes you special or what special i think the tribunal lasted a further two days extended by the determination of everyone involved completely to exonerate themselves the foreign office cited the expense for refusing to recall raymond mcdowell and colonel john gallaway from moscow to recount charlies disparaging conversation insisting instead upon signed affadavits and williams produced his carefully amassed examples of unsupported expense claims which charlie said hed already talked about with the directorgeneral who at once insisted the explanation was totally satisfactory upon his personal authority and forbade any further discussion calling charlie was nothing more than a token gesture to procedure he said he couldnt remember the actual disparagementwhich the diligent cartright had produced verbatim alongside mcdowells written recollectionbut didnt deny saying any of it there had been intentionally introduced operational difficultiesto which the investigation of one department upon another had contributedand he felt his remarks were as justified now as they had been at the time he was apprehensive that malcolm covington might produce a voiceprint of his waterloo runaround telephone callsure it was covington hed spoken tobut it didnt happen the hearing was impatiently concluded by the middle of the second day richard cartright was assigned to the travel and communications desk at the vauxball cross headquarters gerald williams accepted the invitation for early retirement with his indexlinkedpension adjusted to what it would have been had he not left until he was sixtyfive jocelyn hamilton and malcolm covington had severe reprimands attached to their personnel files all that was ridiculous dismissed sir rupert hed insisted charlie accompany him from the hearing to his office totally agreed charlie one has nothing to dohas no effect whatsoeverwith the other warned the directorgeneral i will not ever again tolerate your affectation to be the lone vigilante and dont patronize me by meekly agreeing understand that i mean it i do said charlie its right that i thank you for what pacey tells me youve achieved for the department i do so but reluctantly thank you anyway now bugger off back to moscow it was the first time miriam bell had been in the presence of the fbi director judge colin pronounced cohlin hibbert who was avuncularly fat and prematurely bald and disappointed at being both he was also disappointed at the confrontation that had just endedhe hopedbetween someone as awesomely influential as kenton peters and a woman young enough to be not just his daughter but possibly his granddaughter he knew from nathaniel brindsley that miriam bell had told peters to kiss her ass and from ten years previous experience on the bench his verdict was that shed effectively if not physically made him do just that you were told your participation was over peters continued to argue i had initiated inquiries before i was recalled to be told that said miriam they obviously had to be concluded not to have done so would have aroused suspicion with the russians and the british concluded very successfully contributed brindsley whod enjoyed the spectacle have you anything else to say demanded peters i consider i have been wrongfully dismissed i wasnt aware that you had said the state department man to whom no responsibility ever attached thats my understanding a mistake a misunderstanding im sure said peters talking to the director ill look into it promised hibbert good said peters and id like personally to congratulate you for a brilliant investigation i think thats it isnt it my bended knees kissass time not yours determined miriam and id like to be reassigned where asked hibbert spain perhaps shed decided that europe was better than australia you have it promised the director thank you miriam smiled thats definitely it shed send charlie a card make him feel jealous kenton peters stood with his back to the room legs apart hands linked behind his back gazing out toward the british parliament hed come straight from the airport deputing boyces chauffeur to register him into the connaught he was vociferously proud not to suffer jet lag you know the difference between england and america what asked boyce dutifully permanence thats my impression everything heres permanent been here for a thousand years will still be here in another thousand years too much in america seems to me to be impermanent a gust of wind and itll all blow away i thought washington was supposed to be the recreation of a greek city said boyce the antiquity reverie was a familiar one peters claimed to have founding fathers ancestry thats what it is said the patricianfeatured man a copy not original and greece stopped being great about two thousand years ago he sat down in one of the armchairs the leather of which subsided with a sigh under his weight boyce thought the greek era had ended long before that but didnt bother to query it instead he said openly not quite as clearcut as we thought it would be a readjustment suggested the american the need was for containment and we achieved that didnt we i think so how was sir matthew persuadable to the argument of the national better good it was a family interment advantage of owning half a county is that he has walls and barred gates to keep out unwelcomed intrusion permanence tradition mused peters i suppose i was lucky all dunnes family are dead like him so your ceremony can go ahead boyce knew it was to be reassured about the arlington ceremony that the man had flown in from washington overnight personal attention to the smallest detail was the hallmark of their unique profession you know how it is with these sort of things no unexpected loose ends quite mason surprised me bloody man i actually think he believes he was a hero who didnt do any harm and worked out the deception all by himself i obviously needed to find out precisely what muffin knew before having the damned man fired or disposed of but mason insisted without any warning on talking like he did to impress people who didnt know the full story and didnt need to if hed left it to me everything would have been all right hes only himself to blame for the humiliation in front of the cabinet secretary and the head of sis i reread dunnes interrogation transcript he was full of selfjustification too managed to make his identification of mason a patriotic act you didnt know about the heritage art mason had boyce shook his head i should have reread masons debriefing as well instead of relying on the precis from my predecessor its there the russians targeted mason and dunne months before berlin put raisa belous beside mason in belgium he was using norringtons expertise to treasurespot for himself even then although norrington didnt know it of course mason was a veritable magpie and raisa was busy recording everything he stole he was a goldengoose waiting to be plucked and the russians recognized it that would have been the original blackmail of course why they couldnt go to the military authorities after yakutsk never really understood why the russians went to all that trouble truss them both up completely i suppose we subjected dunne to a polygraph disclosed peters he said the russians didnt think their artthieving was a strong enough pressurethat murder was better and knowing the choice he and mason would make with a gun to their heads the artthieving was enough to keep them from going to their own authorities when they got back to berlin makes some sort of sense i suppose said boyce larisa got to dunnes looting investigation squad in poland continued peters ironic thats where raisas husband died wouldnt be surprised if he wasnt involved in some way although the question wasnt put to dunne belous and larisa would have known each other from tsarskoe selo after all larisa really did put herself in the way of dunnes first bullet incidentally theyd had an affair going since poland in his statement dunne seemed more upset by that than being forced to shoot timpson boyce shrugged dunne and mason were real bastards werent they but useful in the long run wonder where larisas buried said peters god knows we never will said boyce damned clever of the russians to have used their trophy squads like they did already to be looking that far ahead well beyond the ending of the war and putting larisa in gulag trying to trick hitlers bunker squad into disclosing all they knew it was probably down to larisa that the russians still have hitlers will today to get our hands on that really would be a treasure said peters but im not surprised how far ahead stalin and beria were thinking thats what stalin was doing at yalta and potsdam carving up europe for himself all very clever mused boyce muffin really did turn out to be a nuisance said peters it was a bad mistake not eliminating him not only chopped mason up into little pieces but coated himself and his department in teflon cant do anything to any of them nowtoo many people know after that damned confrontation whos going to be your scapegoat not sure we need one at the moment the mi man in moscow made a fool of himself so hes available ill wait to see which way the media hysteria goes muffin back in moscow boyce nodded your woman spain its only a temporary respite well transfer her from the foreign division after the normal twoyear tour there bury her in a home station somewhere like montana or north dakota bit of a waste for someone so clever thats not the point reminded the american she was impertinent of course not apologized boyce there we are then said peters in finality alls well that ends well as long as the bumps in between dont derail anything the club special today is steak and kidney pudding tradition said peters excellent charlie and natalia sat side by side watching george timpson being buried as an unknown hero in arlington there was a rifle volley over the grave and the poignant last post and the president talked of americas great and good and of the hostilities of the past becoming the hope for the future at one stage he choked to a halt and wiped what appeared to be a tear from his left eye his rating was to climb five points by the end of the week charlie sighed and said thats it all over until the next time therell never be another one like this i couldnt stand it if there were he reached out for her hand and natalia let him take it my internal problems are over your internal problems are over like sashas storybook says we can live together happily ever after there were some changes in the duma while you were in england announced natalia he looked at her unspeaking viktor romanovich viskov got elected deputy of the communist faction i think i should still keep the leninskaya apartment
