alex scarrow gates of rome prologue august brooklyn joseph olivera gasped air huffed in and out of his lungs in total darkness the noise of his rasping breath bounced back at him from hard walls somewhere off in the black he tried to calm himself steady his nerves you knew what it was going to be like yes hed had that explained the sensation of falling the milky nothingness the light touch of energy crawling over your skin like the probing curious fingers of a pickpocket still even though hed mentally prepared for it forewarned olivera had been cautioned by waldstein that the first time was the hardest but he hadnt expected this pitch black anyone ththere he could hear the drip of water somewhere possibly from a low ceiling and faintly a quiet rumble that increased in volume as it passed overhead and then finally faded to nothing hello just then another noise a metallic rattle from behind him joseph turned towards it and saw a horizontal sliver of light appear it widened accompanied by the jangle of a chain and joseph recognized it as the bottom of some shutter door he saw a pair of feet outside cobblestones a muted grey of diffused light hello the feet shifted a figure ducked down and looked under the shutter door joseph saw a paunchy middleaged man with a beard and glasses wearing shabby corduroy trousers and a green woollen cardigan with leather elbow patches hello joseph squatted down so the light from outside could pick out his face is this the right place the man with the beard chuckled ahhh you must be our new recruit he ducked under the shutter straightened up inside and walked to the side of the shutter patting in the darkness until his fingers found a switch a fluorescent light fizzed on above joseph he could see now he was in some brick archway it smelled of damp cement and stale urine in one corner he could see a pile of loops of electrical flex beside that a dozen cardboard boxes that had the images of ancientlooking computers printed on the side early twentyfirstcentury bricks of clunky technology this this isnt the place is it asked joseph the man smiled and crossed the pitted dirty floor towards him his feet crackling across shards of broken glass this is it he offered his hand im frasier griggs by the way joseph olivera he replied i agree it doesnt look much at the moment mr waldstein i presume told you weve only just started setting up things in here joseph nodded but i i thought you thought it would be something grander yes frasier laughed again its all thats needed he looked around good choice id say nice and discreet i dont think its been occupied in years he kicked an empty glass bottle aside it skittered across a carpet of grit and rat droppings unless you count vagrants and drug addicts that is joseph glanced at the cobblestones outside this is really ive really travelled back over half a century oh quite yes august the tenth to be precise frasier spoke with an almost theatrical accent what used to be called british before that small nation vanished into the euroblock he walked towards the shutter and ducked down to look outside frasier followed him over squatting down beside him this is brooklyn tell me joseph you ever see pictures of brooklyn before they abandoned it to the flood waters joseph shook his head he only knew the outskirts of this oncefine city as a maze of waterlogged streets collapsed rooftops sprouting weeds and struggling saplings quite characterful and vibrant was brooklyn frasier gazed at the graffiticovered brick wall opposite and above it a mixed urban skyline of cranes factory roofs and warehouse apartments he sighed i used to collect priceless antique cds from about this time marvellous stuff they used to call hip hop big daddy k mc kushee ever heard of those composers joseph shook his head ah well its only old farts like me listen to that sort of thing now frasier nodded at the scene outside thirty years from now all this will be gone itll be nothing but a drowning ghost town abandoned ruins left to rot pity above them was a warm blue cloudless sky crisscrossed with the vapour trails of distant air traffic anyway mr waldstein has already given you your brief i presume joseph nodded were sourcing as much of the equipment components as we can from the present its safer that way the less of a footprint we leave from our time the better joseph had noted the boxes of desktop computers are those old machines powerful enough to certainly ill have to tinker with the network so their cpus synchronize and ill strip out that stoneage operating system and replace it with wg systems software should be fine though joseph gazed across the east river at manhattan quite a sight isnt it said frasier this really was a beautiful city back in its time yes they listened to the wail of a distant police siren the honk of the east river ferry on its way down to governors island the faint boom of a passing car hifi the gentle whupwhup of a helicopter high above joseph found himself sharing frasiers dewyeyed wonder everything seems so much more alive this was a mankind full of passion and energy from here the future looked limitless the possibilities endless this is what the world looked like when it still had a hope josephs breath fluttered it was intoxicating well now this field office of mr waldsteins wont sort itself out if we just sit here theres a lot to do frasier stood up and kicked a discarded mcdonalds carton out of the archway and across the cobblestone alley is mr waldstein joining us today yes he sssaid joseph worked at containing his stutter he said hed be along shortly good said frasier because i need to ask him where he wants me to set up the displacement rack going to need to check the wiring for tolerance and of course where to put the backup generator where will i be setting up my equipment frasier pointed into the gloom of the archway its in the back room theres another room see that sliding door half a dozen geninch biogrowtubes from our salt lake genetic research facility and several hundred gallons of that disgusting growth solution it wasnt easy beaming that lot through i can tell you is it assembled already no thats your job anything else you need except the foetuses of course youre going to need to source locally uh right frasier suddenly grinned broadly his eyes wide behind the glint of his lenses quite something this project of his isnt it guardians of history and all that yes yes it is you know only three people in the entire history of humankind have actually travelled through time mr waldstein myself and now you just think about it more people have walked upon the moon than done what youve just done joseph nodded grinning frasiers excitement was wholly infectious lots to do joseph old chap lots to do but first how do you fancy a coffee i spotted a rather nice coffee shop nearby real coffee good grief yes none of that awful vatgrown synthisoya rubbish he patted joseph affectionately on the shoulder give you a chance to see a little bit more of brooklyn before we knuckle down to work how about that a coffee would be nice frasier led joseph back outside worked the shutter door down to the ground with some difficulty and secured it with its rusty padlock thats stiff i might see if i can get the winch motor working dont want to be hefting that up and down each time we step outside do we the morning sun sparkled across the east river spears of brilliant dappled light that made josephs eyes moist the inverted reflections of manhattans proud skyscrapers shuffled in the wake of the passing ferry and above them a commuter train rattled across the williamsburg bridge towards manhattan beautiful quite beautiful he noticed frasier enjoying the same view oh how rude of me he said presently offering joseph a comic salute i suppose i ought to officially welcome you to our little agency joseph selfconsciously returned the gesture feeling a thrum of growing excitement course through his body what an incredible project chapter new york monday time cycle somethings wrong i know it i think theres something big going on we dont know about something foster shouldve told us and didnt maybe he really wanted to but couldnt wasnt allowed to maybe thats why he left us sal put down her pen and looked around the laundromat just like it always was at this time on a monday morning it was empty she was the only customer there sitting on one of the row of plastic chairs facing a grubby window she watched a removal truck outside the window trying to squeeze past a kerbparked yellow cab the drivers of both vehicles winding down their windows and barking abuse at each other men always so aggressive sal wondered for a moment what a world free of testosterone might be like surely a better place without men beating their chests and acting like apes she looked down at her notebook again that thing that stuffed toy the bear somehow thats at the heart of everything im sure of it the man that came through that poor twisted mess that was once a human being she was sure hed been trying to tell her something about the blue bear as he died something for her ears alone she wondered how a stuffed toy a threadbare scruffylooking one at that could mean anything to anyone except comfort for some child she scribbled again in her diary and then theres liams tunic sal was certain of one thing that she could trust her own eyes what she actually saw shed taken a close look again at the tunic that was hanging in a closet just outside the nook where their bunk beds were the clothes theyd all been wearing the day theyd arrived in the archway hung in there no longer worn because they were so precious a last link to the lives theyd lived before this before becoming timeriders shed unhooked liams tunic the very same one hed arrived in the night the titanic had gone down the tunic complete with two rows of brass buttons and the white star lines star symbol on its purple collar and yes there it had been the thing she was looking for that eversofaint commashaped red wine stain on the right shoulder so faint somebody had once gone to a lot of trouble to try and remove it and failed and heres the thing the exact same stain the exact same stain was on the tunic hanging in that odd little antique and costumehire shop a few blocks away an exact duplicate of liams tunic sal scribbled the obvious question in her diary so how come theres a duplicate of what he was wearing hanging in that shop the question begged all sorts of answers none of which sal thought she liked the sound of the answer that unsettled most was the one she decided to write down does that mean weve been here before she looked up from her scribbling the removal truck was still trying to inch past the taxi and both men were still enthusiastically haranguing each other their brooklyn voices lost beneath the frenetic whir of tumble dryers in the laundry she turned to look at the round porthole of the nearest of them spindrying her and maddys clothes they were all clothes from now garments that allowed them to blend in her eyes were drawn to a pale green ankle sock spinning round and round pushed up against the window caught in a spiral of forces it couldnt escape like us her maddy and liam three unfortunate souls unknowingly stuck in an endless loop they were doomed to live over and over again she looked down at the biro in her hand at the diary a nondescript notebook of lined pages that you could pick up in any stationery store she leafed through the pages realizing she had filled more than a quarter of it with her small tidy handwriting and sketches and doodles and before the first of her entries written months worth of timebubble days ago right there the torn edges of dozens and dozens of pages ripped out by someone a thought suddenly occurred to her that left a chill running down her back like a ghostly finger tracing her vertebrae making the flesh on her bare arms pucker into goosebumps oh shaddyah was that me she wondered if the pages of this diary had been used by her before another me a previous me she felt sick hadnt foster said something about the fate of the previous team something about being torn to pieces something about there being little left she remembered that first day vividly being awoken on her bunk meeting maddy and liam for the first time seeing fosters old face leaning over her and realizing it was the same face shed seen just before shed died just before her home in mumbai had collapsed into a raging inferno and there was that thing that ghostly form in the dark that hed had to hastily usher them away from the seeker didnt he say it was that ethereal glowing shape little more than fragile membrane like a jellyfish like a plume of smoke that had ripped the previous team to unrecognizable shreds the previous team us chapter cheyenne mountain colorado springs but why skippa rashim anwar shook his head at the childlike question the things squeaky voice and perpetual goofy dumb smile all of that rashims choice of course his laboratory assistant unit one of the halfsize models came up to no more than his waist in height in the default factoryshipped polygenic skin the domestic models looked like little plasticine children no hair faces deliberately artificiallooking inexpressive neutral but shapes and sizes varied rashims one was designed for a lab environment squat and square nothing like a plasticine child more like a filing cabinet on legs rashim couldnt help customizing his unit his inner geek looking for a way to express itself the lab assistant units shape and configuration were roughly the same as the cartoon characters anyway close enough that hacking the polygenic skins configuration code to make the unit look even more like the character was a couple of hours work little more than changing the programmable plastic skin from the default utilitarian grey to a bright yellow and getting the face to extrude and replicate the cartoon characters goofy features but why skippa it asked again with a squeaky voice it looked up at rashim with big round eyes above a perky pickleshaped nose and two jutting tombstone teeth rashim vaguely remembered those old cartoons his grandfather used to watch them rocking and laughing at the dumb antics played out onscreen rashim had worked from this vague childhood memory it had made him feel like a kid once more hacking the units configuration code and watching the polygenic plastic change colour and reconfigure looking down at the inquisitive robot he figured he had it pretty close although he wasnt so sure hed got the characters name quite right spongebubba its hard to explain please explain to me skippa please well i suppose its a design fault in our programming programming but humans dont have artificial intelligence routines spongebubba squawked rashim lifted his glasses and pushed a coil of dark hair from his face they stopped at a closed doorway and he presented his left eye for a retina id scan its just a figure of speech spongebubba the point is we have our faults just like bad lines of code the difference between you and me though is that its not so easy to edit our behaviour we are who we are it doesnt make sense said the unit frown grooves ran along its yellow plastic skin why do humans want to destroy their own world the doorway in front of them cranked open hinges carrying a threeton blastproof door creaked and echoed across a dark and dusty control room its walls lined with the glass of large strategic display monitors over a hundred years ago this installation had been built as a command and control centre in preparation for what had seemed like an inevitable nuclear war with russia now it was little more than a museum piece rashim hesitated before the open door and the dark passage way beyond i suppose its in our nature we dont like bad news so we just ignore it well duhhuh thats just plain stoopid he smiled the units speech patterns were a result of his hacking as well it is stupid bubba there was a time when we could have turned things around saved the earth from overheating but i suppose it seemed like too much hard work at the time so we didnt bother well duh squawked spongebubba again rashim smiled exactly duh he led the way down the passageway the blast door clanked as it closed behind them and motionsensitive lights in the passageway flickered on a fading sign on the concrete wall informed him that they were now entering a security level three zone lining the wall either side of the sign were old framed photographs of past us presidents bush obama palin schwarzenegger vasquez esquerra this installation carved deep into the side of cheyenne mountain had once upon a time been known as norad it had been kept in a state of warm standby until the mids then finally closed down after the first oil war americas old rival russia was having as much trouble as america with its own internal problems to no longer be a global nuclear threat now it was simply referred to as facility hcolorado i suppose my grandfathers generation my parents generation even were too busy wanting all the nice things the big shiny holotv real meat three times a week the latest digifashions too busy with all that to notice the sea slowly rising taking coastlines and cities with it did the big floodings happen after the oil wars rashim thats right he shrugged it might have been better for us if wed run out of oil and all the other fossil fuels a lot sooner than we did maybe wed still have polar ice caps rashims childhood like everyone else his age had been one lived in a world shifting with constant migration millions billions of people on the move retreating from land that itself was retreating before rising tides of polluted water mind you the real problem bubba was that there were just too many of us too many humans nearly ten billion totally unsustainable he looked down at the waddling unit beside him we were so very stupid bubba it nodded its plastic pickleshaped nose wobbling slightly duh stoopid ten billion mouths to feed how did we ever allow ourselves to get that crowded it reminded him of something a teacher once told him petri dish syndrome put a bacterium in a dish with something to feed on leave it long enough and itll fill the dish then oh boy then itll turn on itself cannibalize its own protein to survive you reap what you sow said spongebubba he looked up at rashim with wide hopeful eyes is that the correct saying to use rashim nodded it is well done bubba hey thanks they turned a corner into a passageway already lit with a steady glow from muted ceiling lights at the end a pair of soldiers stood guard either side of the door to a lift rashim flicked his hand casually at them as he and his unit approached morning guys morning sir said the older of the two guards almost old enough to be his dad rashim felt awkward he seemed to be the youngest member by far on the technology team twentyseven and he was in charge of the receiver team a group of eight technicians all at least ten years older than him youre up early again dr anwar rashim shrugged we have calibrations to crosscheck on the translation markers spongebubba raised a gloved cartoon hand in a mock salute at the guards sright rashims the most important man in the whole world rashim winced at his assistants singsong exuberance the older guard cocked an eyebrow you do know that outside of the facility you should have your ai unit on verbalmute sir dont you thats a security breach yes yes of course im sorry he let go of bubbas gloved hand spongebubba be quiet you got it its plastic lips snapped shut then pouted guiltily really sorry about that you know ill have to log that security infringement sir said the soldier rashim nodded hed get a slapped wrist for that from the project leader dr yatsushita later on today no doubt i promise ill remember to mute him in future outside the lab the soldier smiled offered rashim a sly wink in that case maybe we can let it go this time he pressed a button and the lift doors slid open have a nice day sir rashim nodded thank you he led his lab unit into the lift by the hand and the doors closed on them as the lift hummed taking them down to level three he cleared his mind of unnecessary things spongebubbas childlike curiosity about the world outside could wait there were figures to process and check yesterdays intramail about a change of mass tolerance meant several days worth of recalibrating and the deadline was now just over six months away bubba any other messages land in my inbox this morning spongebubba looked up at him desperately wanting to speak his eyes rolling plastic lips quivering with frustration unmute yes he blurted eagerly yes skippa three from dr yatsushita seven from ill deal with them this afternoon remind me yes skippa storing the hum inside the small lift dropped in tone and then the elevator shuddered gently as it came to rest the doors slid open to reveal chipboard panels erected in front of the lift to block any view of the area beyond on one of them was tacked a sign now entering level three security zone a last warning to turn back for anyone who shouldnt be down here beneath it handwritten with a magic marker was a little more information welcome to project exodus chapter new york i cant believe it said liam believe it maddy tapped her front teeth with a biro absently i never she looked queasy i never ever want to do something like that again liam nodded slowly it isnt an easy thing he recalled having to retrieve bobs hard drive reminding himself over and over that it wasnt some kind of horrendous mutilation he was performing on the support unit it was merely getting a friend back maddy glanced across the archway at where the carrier bag had been by the shutter door a bag containing something the size of a basketball tied up and put inside yet another bag thankfully it was gone now bob had taken it away earlier theyd discussed whether her head deserved some sort of a burial a ritual a few words said but none of them could decide how to do it or what to say in the end bob just took it away maddy didnt want to know what he did with it it wasnt becks any more it was just ten pounds of meat bone and cartilage data retrieval she muttered blanking out the memory with technical terms thats all it is she told herself just like pulling the motherboard out of a pc no big deal shed discovered beckss body almost completely buried beneath a mound of other bodies several separate distinct entry and exit wounds to her head any one of those would have been fatal to a normal human but her genetically engineered thicker skull and much smaller organic brain meant that she could suffer catastrophic cranial trauma and still be viable but clearly she was not immortal her body had sustained enough damage and blood loss that it had finally closed down and died sal settled on the arm of the threadbare sofa beside maddy think her chips ok maddy nodded towards the bank of screens across the archway several of them were spooling streams of encoded data computerbobs running a diagnostic on her chipset right now i dont know i hope so its gonna take a while the silicon wafer casings dented a bullet must have hit it on the way through i dont know what thats done to the drive inside well just have to wait and see the three of them silently watched the spooling screens a flickering stream of letters and numbers data countless terabytes of stored memories of dinosaurs and jungles knights and castles all that made becks becks well regrow her though said liam aye sal nodded yeah two support units are better than one she looked down at maddy right sure we will but but what theres no certainty that we can use her ai if theres too much damage if its an unreliable ai she could be a hazard to us we may need to work from default ai code that wont be our becks then said liam both support units becks and bob had developed distinctly different artificial intelligences despite running the very same operating system maddys best guess was that it was something in the way the small organic brain interacted with the silicon that it was the meat component of their minds that ultimately defined them gave them their individual personalities youre right she replied it wouldnt be the same becks i really hope her computers all right said liam wistfully sal looked at him she was a bit i dont know a bit cold though sometimes dont you think he shook his head thoughtfully i think she was beginning to learn how to feel things maddy thought shed seen something of that in the support unit the emergence of behaviour that might be described as an emotion a desire to please to seek approval well just have to wait and see what we get if the datas good she should be pretty much the becks we know and love if the datas good but maddys mind was on something else on that portion of the hard drive becks had partitioned off and encrypted several millimetres of silicon that contained a secret so important that it had become the source of the legend of the holy grail caused the very existence of the knights templar and compelled king richard to launch his own crusade to retake jerusalem a secret transmitted across two thousand years of history a secret meant for them but not yet apparently what was it becks had said that the message contained instructions for the truth not to be revealed just yet when it is the end i hope the message from that old manuscript isnt all messed up said liam as if he was reading her thoughts id love to find out what it said one day so i would maddy smiled me too the shutter door rattled gently as a fist banged against it outside ill get it said sal she hopped off the sofas arm crossed the archway and hit the shutters button it cranked up noisily letting in daylight and revealing bobs thick hairy legs in an attempt to make him blend in more with the tourists in times square sal was trying out the shortsandflipflopsandhawaiianshirt look on him maddy wasnt entirely sure that was working he looked like a freakish version of clark kent taking a vacation bob ducked down under the shutter holding a cardboard takeaway tray in his hamshanksized hands who requested the caramel frappuccino chapter central park new york they walked slowly round the duck pond kicking the first dry leaves of autumn aside they watched a young couple rollerblading ahead of them maddy smiled sadly envious of the pair of them both about her age and seemingly without a solitary care in the world she watched the young man tanned lean handsome with long wavy blond hair and a small goatee leading his unsteady girlfriend by the hands her feet splaying and weaving uncertainly laughing at how terrible she was to have that moment just that one moment foster touched her arm sympathetically i know what youre thinking what youre thinking ignorance is bliss she offered him a confessional shrug i wish i was someone else foster anyone else she nodded at the couple their legs beginning to tangle the young man laughing along with his giggling girlfriend being either of them would be nice theyll never experience anything like youll experience what youve experienced already maddy sighed but its too much i cant cope with all of it she looked at his old face sunken cheeks and eyes framed by a fan of wrinkles laughter lines if one was being kind every time i come and visit you it seems ive got more and more to unload on you he cackled it must get annoying having to repeat yourself she shrugged that away that was the deal thats how it was foster was here at this time in central park midmorning feeding the pigeons then on his merry way to live out whatever time he had left however he wanted for him an hour that came and went but for maddy reliving the same two new york days the th and th september it was a repeated chance to see him again to get his advice but every time they met it would be the first time hed seen her since walking away from the team and leaving her in charge so their conversation began with an everincreasing recap from her of the events she and the others had endured you guys do seem to have been through quite a lot he said tell me about it his face skin like fine parchment creased with a grin abraham lincoln sounds a character so he does did he really outrun both your support units oh yeah the guy can run like a kid chasing an icecream van they both laughed foster nodded at a bench beside the path in the shade of a maple tree can we sit my old legs arent what they used to be sure she looked at him wondering how many days he had left wondering how much life the displacement machine had stolen from him a couple of meetings ago here beside this same pond hed admitted he was only twentyseven years old more than that something that had rocked her to the core hed told her that he was once liam hed not explained how that could be in fact hed refused to explain but hed told her because he wanted her to know that every time liam went back into the past the process was gradually killing him ageing him before his time that he would all too soon end up like him she alone needed to be the judge of how much his body could take thats why she had to know they settled down looking further up the path at the pigeons indignantly puffing themselves up and backing off as several canadian geese waddled over to take possession of ground littered with scattered breadcrumbs foster yes what is it youre not telling me he looked at her a disarming smile his best attempt at deflecting her come on foster youve only given me half what i need to know his eyes narrowed why dont you tell me what you think you know why are you why cant you just tell me everything because i dont know everything you know more than me you know more than youve told me he held her gaze eventually he nodded with some regret all right yes thats true why why dont you tell me all you know what are you holding back knowledge maddy foreknowledge pandora he shook his head shed explained to him about the note shed discovered about the specific mention of that particular word in the voynich manuscript i know nothing about pandora hed said and she suspected he was being straight with her about that its a message foster a message someones trying to get to me its got to be important right his fingers steepled beneath the wattled flesh of his jaw and he rested his chin on them quite possibly very so what do i do about it he watched the pigeons and geese strutting warily round each other sizing each other up finally he spoke perhaps you should ask about it ask who his eyebrows arched suggestively what you mean call forward the future the agency not a tachyon signal he said quickly you absolutely can not do that the particles will give you away she knew that already the drop document foster had left maddy a small library of instructions and advice one entry had been how to communicate with the agency in extreme circumstances what was actually classified as an extreme circumstance had not been made entirely clear the method of communication was to place a personal advert in the lonely hearts ads of the brooklyn daily eagle beginning with the words a soul lost in time someone somewhere in the future obviously had a yellowing copy of the newspaper and was watching that page for a subtle change watching for a gentle ripple in reality that altered nothing but the wording of that one personal ad ask he said again finally why not you really dont know about pandora do you foster shook his head she thought she knew him and liam for that matter well enough to spot a lie they were both completely rubbish at it maybe i will said maddy and do let me know what he says im just as curious now as you she turned to look at him he foster closed his eyes she realized hed let slip something he hadnt wanted to he who who is he the agency she turned in her seat grabbed his arm foster are you saying the agency is what just just one person he said nothing what about all the other teams the old mans lips tightened his gaze flicked away from her foster tell me the other teams there are no other teams maddy he whispered his eyes drifted back to hers im so sorry youre alone the agency is you just you he looked down at his hands and waldstein she all but missed hearing waldsteins name her mind was reeling lightheaded with a growing panic youre alone the agency is you chapter project exodus cheyenne mountain colorado springs good morning dr anwar rashim nodded quickly at the assistant technician one of his small team the air around his hand glowed with the standby display of a wristmounted holographic infopad anything come in overnight we had some more personnel changes come in dr anwar and their attached metrics oh marvellous rashim muttered unenthusiastically buzz them over to my unit and ill look at them later yes sir the technician flipped his wrist and a holographic display blinked into existence hovering in the air in front of him his finger swiped across the display and a dozen messages were highlighted then floated out of their inbox and into the air like pollen received said spongebubba the lab unit squatted beside rashims desk like a docile pet a moment later he offered rashim a toothy grin collating metrics skippa rashim glanced across the cavernous interior of the underground hangar an interior blasted out of the mountain over a hundred years ago to make space for the political elite of the time generals congressmen senators and their families in the event of a thermonuclear war with the russians he shook his head nothing changes the politicians are always the first in line the hangar perhaps a shade larger than a football pitch was illuminated from the sides by floodlights erected on tripods pools of retinaachingly bright light stretched across a cold concrete floor scuffed and grooved here and there decades ago when this installation was stripped bare of equipment and mothballed an empty floor right now rashim sat down among the cluster of cubicles and desks deployed in this corner of the hangar first in again this morning as always he activated his terminal with a waft of his hand his iris flickered momentarily as the terminal scanned and confirmed it was dr rashim anwar issuing the command project exodus mass translation simulator the words glowed crisply in the air in front of rashim activate the floor markup the hangars concrete floor suddenly became a glowing chequerboard crisscrossed with an intricate mesh of pulsing neon blue lines cast from a series of holographic projectors suspended from the cavernous ceiling gridmarkers squares varying in size from several inches across to several yards overlay marker details above each square floated holographic displays of columns of numbers vital statistics for what was one day going to occupy each square and give me the content icons above most of the varioussized grid squares hundreds of them glowing blue silhouettes suddenly appeared some of them the outlines of boxes and crates several large icons depicting the profiles of vehicles but the rest displaying the shimmering but clearly discernible outlines of human figures bubba can you show me whos decided to be a nuisance this morning and drop out aye aye skippa spongebubba saluted playfully eleven of the human icons glowed red rashim got up from behind his desk and wandered across the hangar floor the beams of light from above projecting down across his head shoulders and back he squatted down in front of the first human icon that had turned red rashim read the display of information floating in the air beside it candidate name professor jennifer carmel age assignment biochemist mass index beneath the display an envelope icon flashed one of the notifications that came in during the night rashim touched the envelope and a message opened in the air beside his finger candidate carmel j deceased food riots in puerto rico yesterday one hundred and fiftysix fatalities cause of death head trauma gunshot wound no information on whether she was part of the riot or accidentally caught up next of kin informed sorry jennifer carmel he said sighing i guess you wont be coming along with us after all his finger hovered over a delete icon and her outline disappeared along with her vital statistics the grid square was empty now rashim cursed softly not that he knew or cared who jennifer carmel had been his frustration was more to do with the fact that unless they could find a replacement candidate with a close enough build and mass index he was going to have to work through a lot of tedious number crunching and recalibration for this one square he looked up at the other ten human silhouettes dotted randomly across the hangar floor outlines glowing red candidates who for one reason or another were no longer going to be able to join exodus in six months time six months to go six months until tday transmission day so much could happen in six months the world seemed to be utterly determined to destroy itself in the meantime the pacific war between japan and north korea seemed to be flaring up to a new level of intensity while neither of them had any nuclear weapons left to use there were far worse things they could unleash on each other the rest of the world seemed no less bent on its own demise rashims own country iran had led the charge there and destroyed itself thirty years ago in a war that started as a dispute with the arabian coalition a war over fresh water no less not even oil water drinking water iran iraq israel were now three countries that were too irradiated for anyone to live in even thirty years after the exchange of tactical nuclear missiles even if they werent irradiated the few mountainous areas that hadnt been flooded by the rising waters of the mediterranean and red seas and the persian gulf would be far too arid to support life the millions that died in that oneday exchange of titfortat warheads perhaps were the lucky ones werent they death in the blink of an eye instead of this long slow global death skippa he looked up spongebubba had waddled across the large gridcrossed floor to join him what is it dr yatsushita has sent a message hes on his way into the facility and wants to run a transmission simulation this morning well hell have to wait until i rework the figures without these candidates rashim snapped irritably shall i send that message to dr yatsushita skippa he stood up no id better talk to him when he gets in aye aye his unit replied and waddled back across the hangar floor he sighed there was so little margin for error a miscalculation on the total mass index even by the tiniest percentage could send them out of the receiver stations snap range not for the first time he was amazed at the foolhardy courage of that incredible man waldstein the reluctant father of time travel twentysix years ago now wasnt it the very first successful demonstration of time displacement there and back again of course the man had never spoken about where or when he went but hed done it more importantly hed survived it hed come back in one piece and not turned inside out like burger meat their own initial experiments here in the cheyenne mountain facility had turned a succession of animals small and large genetically engineered human prototypes even several real human volunteers into the equivalent of living pate living for a few ghastly moments actually alive rashim marvelled at waldsteins incredible genius dr yatsushita was a brilliant man but even with billions of dollars of funding and almost limitless resources at his disposal project exodus still felt horribly like a large scary exercise in trial and error guesswork waldstein though waldstein had built his machine on his own in his own garage for chrissake or so the legend supposedly went rashim often wondered what happened to that man hed been such a prominent figure for so many years meeting with world leaders the very last guest speaker at the united nations before it was finally dissolved in then he seemed to disappear became something of a recluse rashim wasnt even sure if waldstein was alive still there were rumours rashim pushed a lock of hair behind his ear and turned to head towards the nearest glowing red human icon a dozen yards away another candidate to delete what did you see roald waldstein hmmmm what did you see with those mad eyes of yours what did you see beyond these three spatial dimensions we can comprehend it was perhaps the most frequently asked question during the s and s when waldsteins face seemed to be on almost every media newsstream what did you see mr waldstein more to the point why did it frighten you so much chapter new york liam watched the data slowly spooling down the screen packets of hexadecimal data that made no sense to him whatsoever every so often the spooling stopped and lines and chunks of the meaningless alphanumeric text were fleetingly highlighted sometimes the highlighted text switched from white to green sometimes from white to red liam pointed at a chunk that had just turned red so thats not good is it that is corrupted data said bob the entire contents of beckss silicon mind had been downloaded on to the computer system over thirtysix hours ago a mountain of data stored up by her during her brief life and now computerbob was working through it testing the data for corrupted packets liam looked at the progress log on another screen a map of her hard drive her mind divided into a grid of blocks of data white for the data yet to be tested green for verified and red for lost data the last few chunks of white were being crossexamined the rest of the grid was a patchwork of green and red blocks the red seemed to grow malevolently like cancer tumours far too many of them weve lost her havent we bobs face twitched with the ghost of a response involuntary possibly perhaps a sign that he was once again much more than the basic code he was born with learning to turn incoming information into an understanding into context an emotion to almost be human significant portions of her stored data are damaged he offered liam a wan smile but i am hopeful computerbob was listening despite being busy sifting through the data we will not know whether we have a stable ai construct until i have compiled the data and run the emulator liam looked at bob what does that mean the computer system will run the ai code on a softwaresimulated version of the chipset it will then enter packets of the verified data block by block into the simulation to check the stability and reliability of beckss ai to see whether shes gone stupid bobs thick brow rumpled liam reached out and grabbed the bulging knuckles of one of bobs hands jayzus you really care about her dont you his chest rumbled with a deep hurumph she was an effective support unit her ai was able to develop more than mine ah but thats the ladies for you better at expressing their feelings than us fellas huh gender is not a factor bob turned his grey eyes on him did you care for her liam he laughed uncomfortably well i the discoloration of your cheeks and body language suggest you have a strong emotional attachment to her am i correct liam he gazed at the screen blocks of colour shes just blocks of colour on a computer screen now thats it and yet in her flesh form in human form shed almost seemed like another person perhaps a somewhat cool person detached aloof even but she could make a joke couldnt she and smile he realized her smile even though it was nothing more than a data file played out across facial muscles could make something inside him flutter and ache a beautiful smile actually quite stunningly beautiful truth be told id miss her he said finally if she really is lost yes ill miss her information liam nodded at the webcam what is it computerbob i am ready to start the simulation do you wish to proceed he wondered whether he should wait for maddy to get back sal too they were both just as concerned whether there was anything left of becks to salvage as he was will it i dont know is it safe it wont damage her mind or anything will it negative the data we have retrieved is now stored safely this simulation is a readonly environment and what does that mean it means that once the simulation stops running said bob any data that is generated is deleted she wont remember anything that is correct it is merely a test environment liam let himself down into the chair all right then he puffed out an anxious breath lets see if shes in there affirmative launching ai emulator on a screen to his right another black dialogue box popped up an empty box with a gently blinking cursor thats all liam looked up at bob nervously the support unit nodded silently for him to go ahead and communicate with her uh you in there becks the dialogue cursor continued to blink a steady onoffonoff like a heartbeat a pulse a sign of life and nothing more its liam here can you hear me the cursor continued to blink silently the cognitive and language code may not be functioning correctly said bob quietly becks this is liam if you can hear me just do something say something he watched the cursor with a gradually sinking heart weve lost her of course they could activate and grow another female foetus and she would emerge from the growth tube looking every bit like becks her identical twin but he wondered how different she would be shed have a face with the very same features and muscles and skin but the mind behind it would probably learn to use the face in a wholly different way smile differently no longer cock a sceptical eyebrow in quite the same way a thousand little tics and habits that made becks who she was all of them gone forever becks he tried again you there it appears there is not enough retrieved data to form a viable ai construct said bob liam thought he heard something in his deep rumble the slightest quaver in his voice a thread of grief becks he tried one last time he could hear emotion in his own voice now shes gone we lost her he felt something warm roll down his cheek and quickly swiped it away for some reason not wanting either bob or computerbob to make a note of that and intrude on the moment with a query goodbye becks i love you liam oconnor chapter new york they watched the foetus floating in the protein soup flexing and twitching tiny fingers and toes in unconscious readiness a feed pipe was connected to its belly button and rose up to the top of the tube where it met the filtration pump the perspex growth tube was lit from the bottom it glowed softly filling their back room with a warm womblike muted crimson light do you think they think about things when theyre growing in there asked liam probably not said maddy sal turned to bob standing like a freshly built brick wall beside her did you bob do you have any memories of being in a tube he frowned deep in concentration for a moment no my ai software was not loaded at this stage but your organic brain cut in maddy that must store some memories bobs shoulders flexed a casual shrug if so it is not data i can retrieve the little foetus kicked a leg out then tucked it back in maddy chuckled its got some of her attitude already do you think we can upload beckss ai asked sal maddy tapped her teeth with her fingernails i dunno yet sal that simulation we ran she seemed pretty flaky on maddy and sals return computerbob had run the simulation again with exactly the same results she turned to look at liam i mean i love you that cant be right for a support unit can it bob nodded it did appear that the simulated ai was behaving erratically so maybe these clone fellas can feel something said liam the others looked at him well im not so unlovable am i sal giggled im sure your mother mustve loved you point is maddy placed a hand on the warm growth tube im pretty sure support units shouldnt go round professing love for their operative liam looked uncertain she definitely was learning to to feel something so she was thats not so bad is it maddy found herself nodding in the gloom hadnt she too thought shed seen that in becks helps them appear more human i suppose back in the dinosaur time she liam looked at the others sheepishly she what well she sort of went to kiss me so she did sal made a face maddys eyes rounded behind her lenses kiss you tried to give me just a little peck so on me cheek thats all sal made a face thats just weird just a peck nothing else happened he added defensively honest maddy waved him silent doesnt matter the fact is maybe that means she did already have feelings before this damage maybe the i love you comment was not corrupted data or some sort of malfunction she looked up at bob she inherited your code bob have you ever experienced you know feelings for liam i have data files that you could interpret as emotional reflexes would you kiss liam bob cocked his head a frown of confusion rumpling his forehead for a moment before he reluctantly leaned down towards liam puckering his horselips liam recoiled jayzus bob whatre you no bob that wasnt an instruction that was a question he straightened up i see his expression settled i have managed to reprioritize mission parameters for liam in the past this could be interpreted as irrational he came to save me from that german prison camp didnt you bob is that because you valued liam more than you valued completing your mission objective asked maddy bob hesitated his mind working its files in silence because you cared for him she pressed bob finally answered affirmative liam is my friend maddy tapped the perspex with her knuckles there we are then that was already there in beckss identity she inherited feelings from bob she shrugged her shoulders she cares for you liam somewhere in all that data she has a file that tells her she loves you maddy smiled maybe her ai was just running that file during the emulation does that mean shes ok then asked liam bob if we upload her ai into this body and it turns out she is wonky can we i dunno reboot her or something affirmative the silicon wafer can be reformatted and the ai software reloaded without any of my or her inherited data right maddy nodded i suppose we could give her ai a go and if shes like all flaky on us then thats what well have to do thats taking a risk though isnt it said sal i mean there are loads of those corrupted red blocks what if she got funny with us what do you mean asked maddy i dunno jealous or something jealous of you or me sal is correct said bob maddy stroked her lip thoughtfully shed seen becks in action seen the bodies left behind in her wake god help them if she took on the role of a lover scorned her decisionmaking may be unpredictable bob added aw come on when hasnt she been unpredictable said liam maddy nodded true could we not give her a chance well have to watch her very closely said maddy the slightest sign shes going weird and well have to reboot her i mean it she even looks at me or sal in a funny way were going to have to totally wipe her liam sal bit her lip i dont want her tearing off my head liam nodded slowly shell be right as rain so she will he didnt sound entirely convincing ok right said maddy thats that then she turned to head for the sliding door leading back out into the main archway come on guys theres something else we need to talk about liam slid the door aside it rattled noisily and clattered against its runners what this agency of ours the pandora stuff sal and liam looked at each other did foster tell you something asked sal maddy nodded oh yeah chapter project exodus cheyenne mountain colorado springs rashim stared goggleeyed at dr yatsushita what i said we may have to consider advancing the tday deadline but but were still only at the primary testing stage rashims team had run several simulated tests on the transmission process and each time the simulation software had assured them that it had overshot or undershot the receiver station beacons snap range or on the one occasion theyd landed right on the money half the candidates would have been lost or turned into quivering mush dr anwar yatsushita started he looked harried tired a sleepless night or several by the look of him his usually carefully combed silver hair was uncharacteristically dishevelled you must have been following the newsstreams rashim hadnt or not closely anyway he had no time for that every day it seemed one or more of the transmission candidates had been replaced with someone else requiring him to chase up the data on their replacements plug in the information and recalculate the total mass index you have heard about the kosongni virus a couple of days ago hed watched a few minutes of news the last city in bangladesh had been abandoned to floodwater the algal blooms in the indian ocean were now calculated to be covering thirtysix per cent of the surface area poisoning completely annihilating the ecosystem beneath the north american federation were enforcing border restrictions on east and west state migrants a corps of japanese combat droids had successfully made an amphibious assault on the north korean city of hyesan a lot of dead people but then when did the news these days not feature a high body count and yes thered been something about a virus the newsstreams had speculated it might have been a chemical weapon of some kind dropped on a north korean city by the japanese or worse still some kind of wildcard bioweapon developed by the north koreans and accidentally exposed as a result of some missile strike kosongni virus so it had a name now yatsushita shook his head he pushed his way through the warren of desks towards rashims you fool you should be watching instead of of he looked at spongebubba squatting beside the desk and grinning with goofy teeth instead of making your foolish toys i havent got time to watch a holovid dr yatsushita rashim replied irritated with the project leader ive got its airborne there are reports of the virus in beijing airborne certainly wasnt so good our sponsors are worried by this they want tday advanced sponsors yatsushitas carefully chosen word it was transparently obvious to rashim that project exodus was being funded by what was left of americas defence budget most probably funds topped up by a few billionaires who wanted in on it advanced by how much dr yatsushita hesitated they want it ready to go for the thirtieth of may but thats five weeks away we need at least another six months to be sure we have no choice in this matter it must be ready by then rashim pushed his round glasses up on to his forehead where they held his draping dark locks back like a hairband did you tell them the risks involved did you tell them that we get this the slightest bit wrong and were all dead or worse i have explained all of this nonetheless they insist rashim stared at his project leader is it that bad yatsushita pulled a seat up looked across the maze of desks and cubicles at the dozen other technicians working late he sat down and lowered his voice it is much much worse than the news media are reporting they have been kept in the dark there is an embargo on the worst of it worst of it what do you mean a smartvirus rashim it is an advanced smartvirus a von neumann rashim nodded slowly von neumann a hypothetical premise imagined by a hungarian theorist john von neumann over a hundred and fifty years ago machines capable of harvesting their own resources for infinite selfreplication nanotechnologists had tried experimenting with that concept at the beginning of the twentyfirst century with little success little robots the size of blood cells but robotically there were too many practical problems to overcome however biologically a very different story after all bacteria were biological von neumann machines of a sort but the holy grail certainly in terms of weapons use was a bacterium that could be smart could be given genetic instructions an objective a specified goal could be given a target a sample has been isolated and analysed by a team in tokyo said dr yatsushita rashim could see the man was clearly shaken and it is designed to depopulate designed to target humans only its engineered of course it is on contact with any human cells it activates breaks down the cell structures into acids proteins he ran a hand through his silver hair it completely liquidizes the infected within hours my god the liquid solution is used by the bacteria to make copies of themselves to grow spores like feathers like pollen that can be carried by the wind are there any cases of immunity yet ethnicspecific resistance yatsushita shook his head no not yet so far it seems no one is immune whoever made this did not care that it would kill the whole world rashim looked at the holoscreen shimmering in the air above his desk endless columns of data that needed collating and processing now do you see why they want tday advanced said dr yatsushita something like kosongni is what leaders have feared for decades a perfect bioweapon rashim rubbed his temple jesus dr yatsushita nodded i have told our sponsors that all the tday candidates must make their way here immediately we must finalize the mass index as soon as possible we cannot keep changing the data rashim nodded yes yes absolutely his boss leaned forward dr anwar you have family on the candidate list dont you yes my parents call them rashim get them here now before its too late chapter new york brace yourselves said maddy she looked at them across the breakfast table liam and sal sitting beside each other on their threadbare sofa eyes resting expectantly on her theyre not going to like this jahulla come on maddy what is it this agency of ours its im not sure how to say this well just say it anyway liam fidgeted impatiently im sure weve heard worse already not really she pushed her glasses up the bridge of her nose the agency is just us the words hung above the table in the space between them they hung in the stillness of the archway accompanied by the soft hum of networked computers and the muted rumble of a train running over the williamsburg bridge above them what do you mean just us asked sal i mean exactly that sal were it the three of us liam sat forward frowning confused but but foster told us there were other teams in other places so he did i know he did but he lied sal looked past her one eye lost behind a fringe the other one just lost but there was that message maddy liam leaned on the table that message from the future about edward chan so there was there is one other person in the agency she replied its that guy waldstein roald waldstein that fella who invented time travel thats him hes the one who set this archway up hes the guy who recruited foster and the previous team sal shook her head working it through in her mind silently liam slapped a hand on the table jayzusnmothermary you know i i was wondering why its always us who was dealing with everything why them other teams were too bleedin lazy to get off their backsides and help out maddy splayed her hands well now we know but didnt foster say this waldstein was totally against time travel asked sal that he like campaigned against it or something yes he did but he also set this up secretly as a backup plan i guess he figured that even with international agreements prohibiting the development of timetravel technology on the sly every government would be having a go at it liam laughed softly i knew it i just bleedin well knew it its not fair foster didnt tell us that said sal she looked up at maddy why did he lie to us maddy shrugged i guess he didnt want to overload us put too much pressure on us did he just tell you now maddy this morning she nodded yup sals eyes narrowed why why what why did he wait till now to tell you i guess i guess he figured from all the stuff i told him wed been through that we were ready to find out chutiya she stood up biting her lip angrily he thinks were bakra stupid what else is he holding back from us maddy would have liked to say nothing but she wasnt entirely sure that foster had given them the whole picture yet she too was guilty of that holding truths back from her friends for example when exactly was she going to tell liam that time travel was killing him ageing him that he was going to look exactly like foster very soon a bigger deal than that that he and liam were the same person when the hell was she going to tell him that and what did that mean anyway maddy had tried running that little doozy through her mind many times over did it mean liam had been recruited from the titanic before did it mean that this archway existed in a bigger loop of time that one day liam was going to be an old man an old man who had somehow outlived her and sal and now needed to renew the cycle by revisiting the last moments of their normal lives and recruiting them all over again maddy she looked up sal was sitting on the end of the table theres something ive seen but ive been keeping to myself liam looked from her to maddy uh hang on has everyone here got a bleedin secret except me sal ignored him this may sound crazy but have we been recruited before what sal ignored him again her eyes were on maddy has foster said anything like that recruited before how do you mean foster said there was another team before us right maddy nodded that they died that that ghost thing that seeker killed them liam cupped his jaw in his hands hold on thats right i remember that was that team us maddy sals eyes remained resolutely on maddy watching her fidget delay fudge do i tell them that liam is foster because if liams been here before maybe sals right and all three of us have im asking because ive seen something i cant explain said sal she looked at liam your uniform from the titanic he nodded aye you told me you saw one a bit like my no liam no it is your tunic maddy frowned her turn to be silenced by a revelation what in that antique shop the theatre costume shop near us theres liams tunic hanging up dont be stupid replied maddy she pointed at the rack of clothes hanging just outside their bunk nook its over there its the same maddy exactly the same how can it be the same one sal how can it be here and in that shop at the same time it is its missing the same button it has exactly the same stain on it the same shape in the same place she stood up strode over to the wardrobe beside the nook she pulled out his white tunic still on its hanger and brought it over to the table she spread it out beneath the light above them there see liam got up and studied it you got that stain on the titanic right down the left side big stain what was it wine or something liam frowned i see it jayzzz never even noticed that before maddy joined them me neither its faint he looked at sal i i dont think i ever spilled wine down me jacket i dont remember doing anything like that chief steward wouldve had me guts for garters so then it wasnt you he shook his head maybe someone who had the uniform before me thats possible said maddy sal shook her head irritably thats not the important bit the point is there are two copies of it she looked up at them both do you see maybe that means liams been here before liams eyes widened this is messing with your head asked sal he nodded chapter project exodus cheyenne mountain colorado springs who was it that once said a week is a long time in politics well that was a pretty good observation to take note of if not to adapt very slightly rashim stared at the newsstream from new london in the north of england a week is a long time with a pandemic this particular media feed had been running uninterrupted for two days now a digistreamer dropped on its side on the street by some panicked cameraman had still been broadcasting powered by its own hydrocell battery pack the signal was being streamed round the world no doubt watched by millions of other frightened people like rashim the street had been full of people running from faint blooms descending from the sky like flakes of ash from a bonfire of paper the blooms viral spores landing lightly on scalps backs of hands faces had an almost instantly lethal effect the street had been full of stampeding people and screaming voices then five minutes later after the camera had dropped and settled on its side it was silent and full of corpses twentyfour hours ago hed been shaken by the sight of a solitary young girl staggering into the static view of the digistreamer a girl no more than eleven or twelve collapsing to her knees whimpering with fear and agony as her left arm dissolved and bacillilike growths like veins on the surface of her skin snaked past her elbow and spread to her shoulder her neck her face shed collapsed into a huddle very quickly quite dead and over the next six hours transformed into a pool of reddishbrown liquid and a bundle of empty clothes hed watched with increasing horror as the puddle had grown slight protrusions like humps almost mushroomlike that eventually opened to reveal fluffy spore heads like those of dandelions a fresh breeze had carried those away long ago somewhere in a refugee camp in kazakhstan his parents most probably looked like the girl now a tangle of clothes and a puddle of liquid rashim it had all happened too quickly the city lockdowns quarantine the complete shutdown of transportation systems none of it had managed to stop the kosongni virus dr anwar he looked away from the holoprojection above his desk dr yatsushita was leaning over the top of his cubicle partition his tie loose and his top shirt button undone his sleeves were rolled up and his lab coat dispensed with days ago hed taken to sleeping on a camp bed among the cubicles as all of them had working in ceaseless shifts to get things ready for tday i must have those figures now rashim felt disengaged from the hustle and noise of activity going on around him the hangar floor was now filled with people equipment and machinery being brought in he could see on one side of the concrete floor some famous faces he recognized the vicepresident greg stilson and the defence secretary a few dozen yards away a saudi prince and his family next to him the bulk of some central african dictator whose name he couldnt quite remember and his three young wives rashim suspected he must have spent the last of his nations wealth to buy a place for himself on exodus there were other faces he vaguely recognized old men with young wives the rich and powerful the figures rashim rashim nodded slowly and palmed the data off his screen and floated it on to yatsushitas infopad its not even close to accurate he muttered absently we have no more time yatsushita said lowering his voice they will have to take their chances so many of the carefully selected and vetted candidates for exodus had not made it to the cheyenne mountain facility some of the blist candidates had managed to be flown in but there were many grid spots now either empty or filled with lastminute replacements no longer the great and the brilliant rocket scientists and geneticists but a motley random collection of people army truck drivers clerical officers project technicians and of course a handful of politicians billionaires dictators the wellconnected whod caught wind of project exoduss lastminute chance to negotiate themselves on to the transportation grid not exactly the best representation of twentyfirstcentury society to send back into the past to make a new start rashim looked up at dr yatsushita you said they they will have to take their i am not going why the old man shook his head sadly i cannot not without my family still no news yatsushita shook his head he had managed to get his wife and daughter on a flight from tokyo to vancouver but there theyd been stuck no commercial or military flights left not even using leverage as the senior technician on exodus was going to get them over here the old man looked over his shoulder at the chaos on the grid anyway this is not the project i signed up to lead rashim knew exactly what he meant by that this frenetic undignified scramble away from the sudden and messy end of mankind was not what project exodus had been about even though it was a flagrant breach of ila ruling known informally as waldsteins law there was something worthy to it the idea of rebooting civilization back in a time before man had begun to suck the world dry the idea of bringing back twentyfirstcentury knowledge and enlightenment to an ignorant world that believed in gods and omens repression and slavery there was a germ of hope in all of that hope something there seemed to be precious little of in this poisoned and dying world but these werent the specially selected candidates quietly informed over a year ago to settle their personal affairs and be ready to be collected and taken to the exodus facility it was a random collection of the rich the connected and in a few cases the plain luckytobegrabbedatthelastmoment a poor crosssection of candidates to be sending on such an important mission so youre staying dr yatsushita he nodded youll die we all die eventually rashim ill stay with no there needs to be a project technician with them as senior technician on the grid you will have full authority i will make that official with a data entry rashim shook his head me in charge of them look im just a there is a mission protocol mission jurisdiction they are all aware of this and signed contracts of agreement to come along they must accept you as project exodus leader rashim looked across at the vicepresident yes said yatsushita even he must accept you as his the old man paused smiling as his boss he nodded at the vicepresident the prince the dictator and a handful of others all of them clearly elated to have made it into the facility before the security lockdown dont let any of those parasites become leader rashim he smiled sadly let this be a proper new beginning for mankind eh rashim nodded stood up pushed his chair back on its castor wheels beyond the calm of the small enclave of cubicles the hangar was a riot of noise and activity voices raised in confusion fear excitement the clattering of two dozen military combat units weighed down with carbonflex body armour weapons and equipment the whirring of exoskelkinetic loaders depositing heavy crates of supplies into specially holoflagged grid markings the deep rumble of three mobile command vehicles backing into their large grid slots dr yatsushita reached a hand out and grasped one of his tightly the military units are programmed to follow the exodus protocols they will accept your authority rashim once ive logged you in as my replacement dr yatsushita please you have to come im not ready for this rashim looked at the dictator the prince the politicians and the billionaires i cant lead them they wont accept that the old man smiled they dont have any choice in the matter youll die if you stay please you really need to come everyone who remains behind will be dead rashim this he turned to look over his shoulder at the frantic activity going on behind him for what it is this is our only future now this is crazy you have to go rashim and you have to remain in charge of exodus he smiled again an almost paternal smile odd that coming from the elderly japanese man rashim had always got the impression that dr yatsushita hadnt liked him that he disapproved of his maverick ways his disorganized virtual workspace the messy desk his personalized lab assistant i trust you young man you far more than i trust any of them rashim swallowed anxiously he could feel his stomach churning and a desperate need for a toilet visit ok ook ill uh ill try dr yatsushita clapped him on the shoulder youll do fine chapter new york so maddy let me just check i got this wording correct said the guy on the other end of the line he was just the kind of helpdesk type that bugged her overfamiliar way too friendly its not like they were dating or anything so whyd he have to keep using her name like theyd known each other since kindergarten a soul lost in time that right maddy she sighed yes so far need to know what you know about pandora aware it is the end have learned the family is just us and you and we have been used before insist on further information will not attend any more parties until we hear back she heard the helpdesk guy chuckle whoa maddy what are you some kinda supersecret agent or something yeah thats right she rolled her eyes some kinda supersecret agent now you going to print that ad for me or are you just going to carry on making fun of me hey look im sorry ill uh ill make sure it gets in tomorrows edition thanks its important you do so thats let me see she heard him counting under his breath thirtyfour dollars for a week in the classified section of the brooklyn daily no i want it in just for tomorrow just tuesday doesnt cost you a cent more to be in the whole week you know maddy just tomorrows edition please thats all ok if thats what you want gonna need your card details now maddy she ran through them as quickly as she could keen to get the call and the gratuitous and obligatory youhaveaniceday over and done with finally done she put the mobile phone down on the desk and looked at the others so there we go liam grinned a little anxiously do you think well tick this waldstein fella off she cocked her head casually im sort of past caring liam somebody owes us an explanation weve been through hell and back several times over weve been doing his dirty work pretty much blind im not lifting another finger until we get some information sal nodded at that yeah its not fair they should trust us now its he not they corrected maddy sal shrugged that away whatever whoever were owed an explanation maddy looked round at the archway i want to know who precisely set this place up it couldnt have just been waldstein though and how long ago how many teams have been here before us she looked at the others at sal and yeah maybe youre right to ask sal were they really us what if someone else gets the message said sal maddy hadnt thought about that i mean itll be out there in a newspaper right what if someone else knows to look at that ad then we just made a big mistake maddy looked at bob warily what about you bob any thoughts you want to share on this it is a logical move to seek to acquire more information maddy you dont have any secret lines of code do you hmm any deeply buried priority protocols that would make you object to us questioning our she was going to say hq but she wondered if this agency even had something like that questioning our boss negative maddy my highest priority is preserving history and protecting you youre not going to suddenly rip our heads off or anything his horselips protruded into something close to a sulky pout i would not hurt any of you liam punched his arm lightly dont worry coconuthead we all love you so maddy he sat back in his chair and crossed his arms defiantly is this what i think it is then whats that a workers strike she nodded her mouth set with a determined smile too right it is she slurped some of her dr pepper from the can if they he waldstein whoever wants us to save history again then we better start getting some answers liam nodded raising his coffee cup ill drink to that me too said sal lifting a glass of fruit juice she presented it across the table and the other two clinked mug and soda can with her bob nodded thoughtfully affirmative he looked around i have nothing to drink is that required chapter project exodus cheyenne mountain colorado springs rashim took his space on the translation grid a yard square as it was for every other personnel slot enough of a safety margin to ensure no one became merged during the journey of course nothing was certain rashim knew that better than anyone else standing on the hangar floor the laws of physics and its predictability had a way of breaking down in extradimensional space or chaos space as the enigmatic roald waldstein had once named it there was no knowing if any of them were going to survive this worse still with his estimates of the total mass being translated his precious mass index now being more a thumbintheair approximation than a precise figure they could quite possibly overshoot or undershoot the receiver station or jesus it didnt bear thinking about they might never even emerge from extradimensional space dr yatsushitas voice echoed across over the hangars pa system announcing the tenminute warning excuse me no ones told me anything about whats going on rashim turned to look at a man standing in the floor grid beside him the floating holographic data block floating above the ground said he was professor elsa korpinkski physicist clearly he wasnt her excuse me sir you know whats happening whats gonna happen in ten minutes the man was wearing olive fatigues an army corporal by the chevron on his arm he was one of the lastminute volunteers theyd rounded up as theyd sealed and locked down the facility effectively ballast thats what these lastminute personnel were equivalent mass for the many empty grid spaces of those candidates whod failed to make it to the facility in time although kosongni virus blooms had already been spotted in denver and a dozen miles further south in castle rock perilously close given the blooms were airborne theyd hung on until vicepresident greg stilson and his wife had arrived by gyrocopter before the facilitys nuclear blastproof and airtight concrete doors had swung to sealing off the world outside the corporal looked round the hangar floor whats all these hololines and displays for this some kind of inoculation for that korean virus or something that it this a cure were leaving said rashim leaving he wiped sweat off his top lip what how leaving whatre you talking about rashim could see a name on his pocket north were all going into the past corporal north the past what er whats that you just say past he took a step closer to rashim an army boot stepping across the line of his grid square a soft warning chimed across the pa system the calm synthetic female voice of the launch computer system proximity warning grid number please remain inside your location markers you need to step back said rashim pointing down at his boot you need to be in your grid north looked down did as he was told did you just say the past like yup like backintime past the man swore you telling me this this is some sort of time machine but thats thats a direct violation of international law yes i know rashim pointed at the glowing holoprojected line hovering an inch above the concrete floor you should try and remain calm and at all times until we have safely translated you must remain within your grid square is that clear corporal north looked at the square of light on the floor around him or what or whatevers hanging over the line isnt coming with you jesus that or it ends up stuck in the middle of the poor guy in the next square just stay still no one told me nothing they just grabbed me and a bunch of others out of the compound just stay calm and keep still dr anwar yatsushitas voice boomed across the cavernous interior your figures have been entered and the translation simulation program has approved them as being within an acceptable range of error are you ready to proceed rashim very much doubted that however the program warning could be overridden he just hoped the warning was a marginal amber as opposed to a blatant flashing red he nodded back to him corporal north looked at rashim you youre in charge of all of this uh yeah i am sort of field generator is charging announced the pa system translation in eight minutes he looked around at the exodus group mostly men many of them old a few women and children dotted around he even saw a newborn baby being placed carefully on the ground the families of the superrich this group should have been three hundred of the worlds brightest minds young men and women ready to colonize the past and bring with them the best values of the modern world on the far side the platoon of combat units stood perfectly still in their own grids genetically engineered soldiers slabs of muscle and bone in armygreen carbonflex body armour and helmets and carrying enough ordnance between them to wage a small war rashim spotted spongebubba waddling over towards him hey skippa he said with a cheerful plastic smile bubba im leaving now you have to get off the translation grid i know he replied grinning chirpily i just came over to say goodbye oh and you have three more messages in your personal inbox all bills the first one is a payment reminder from intercytex systems rashim smiled the stream had a habit of choking on its own internal mail system they can wait bubba you better get off righto oh dr yatsushita will be your owneroperator from now on for what time he has left i understand goodbye skippa have a great trip goodbye bubba he watched the yellow lab assistant turn and waddle back towards the cubicles and desks and the bluegreen glow of dozens of floating holodisplays translation in five minutes dr yatsushitas voice any nonexodus personnel must leave the grid immediately rashim could hear the growing hum of energy being channelled into the hangar from the ceiling above he heard the clank of chains and motors as the cage was being readied to descend the cage was a fine wire mesh a curtain of conductive material that was going to be lowered all the way round the perimeter of the translation grid like a stage magician hiding his assistant behind a veil before making her vanish the energy that was going to be channelled through it was much more than the cheyenne mountain facilitys generator could handle they were tapping several other nuclear reactors in colorado for this switching whole cities off to make this happen lights in denver were probably winking off right now not that anyone still alive outside was going to notice or even care the image of the liquidized girl from the media feed haunted him nothing more than a huddle of clothes and pool of dark liquid developing a leathery skin he wondered how long before the last isolated groups of humankind were infected before mankind was completely erased perhaps without humans the world will find a way to recover there was something a little comforting about that thought cities would descend into rubble and rust and nature would find a way to rebalance the poisoned air the toxic seas to eventually erase every last memory of us another failed experiment the dinosaurs had their time and mankind had his whose turn next lowering the energy cage rashim looked up and saw the wire mesh shroud slowly winching down enclosing them all those whod been lastminute standins looked anxiously around them unfamiliar with the translation process whats that whats coming down relax he called out to the corporal its just making a very big faraday cage round us generating a large shoeboxshaped energy field wrapping us up for delivery like a parcel others across the hangar floor looked equally startled few of those standing among the grid squares had received any briefing at all about the process even the vicepresident had shed his mediafriendly calm and was looking around anxiously rashim smiled yes just like a parcel he caught one last glance of dr yatsushita and exchanged a nod with him yatsushita mouthed something rashim could guess what it was dont let them take over then he was lost behind the shimmer of the curtain of fine wire mesh the whir of motors finally ceased as the mesh touched the concrete floor energy release in two minutes please ensure you are entirely within your grid markings rashim looked around and saw everyone else doing likewise making sure they were standing in the middle of their squares he was certain that in some cases it didnt matter how carefully placed they were they werent going to make it through alive if their body mass varied too much from that of the candidate who should have been standing there then well he had no idea what was going to happen to them lost turned inside out he looked at the few children at the baby squirming on the floor stupid fools bringing their children along hed tapped in wild estimates for some of them one minute until energy release please now ensure you are standing as still as possible he closed his eyes feeling certain this was all going to end up being a ghastly bloody mess too much haste too many fudged guessedat numbers this wasnt what hed signed up to either oddly though oddly he realized he wasnt scared it was not as if there was anything left to lose not as if he was leaving behind any family or friends not as if he was leaving behind anyone or anything worth crying over during the last week hed watched on a screen a virus annihilate humankind watched it as if it was one of those old disaster movies people used to go to movie theatres to see a virus that had erased humankind and nothing else a manmade virus no less we went and did this to ourselves there seemed to be some satisfying symmetry in that after screwing up the world we went and finished the job with ourselves the humming of the field increased and rashim heard the crackle of energy arcing above their heads across the footballpitchsized translation grid he heard dr yatsushitas booming voice one more time couldnt make out the words above the deep thrum of energy he could feel the hairs on his arms lift then the hair on his head rise with the buildup of static electricity all around him this is it a goodbye to everything to the twentyfirst century to a world completely trashed by mankind a goodbye to nations murdering each other over land over food over water sometimes just over the colour of a persons skin a difference in faith a method of worship a political opinion as the power surged into the wire mesh and arcs of energy leaped across the translation grid mere inches above their heads rashim wondered if mankind really deserved this elaborate cheat this second roll of the dice perhaps the only way to truly learn is to fail and fail badly thats what kosongni was mankinds lesson mankinds epic fail the few if any who survived that were probably going to be far wiser about the future than these people standing around him we made a mess of things and what do we do we run away from it he had a feeling all they were doing was rebooting civilization so that it could make the same stupid hash of things all over again and again and again chapter new york excuse me that tunic hanging up there said sal to the old lady can we just take a closer look at it the titanic one maddy nodded thats it the old woman pulled a stool out from behind the counter stood on it wobbling precariously as she unhooked the hanger from the railing and brought it down for them she pushed aside a small stack of secondhand books waiting to be priced and made space on the counter then spread the jacket out carefully its almost an antique you know said the old woman its nearly ninety years old she smoothed her wrinkled hands across the cloth older than me even she smiled maddy and sal stared down at it for a moment i dont rent it out for fancy dress and i really dont know whether id want to sell it she shrugged except if the price was right sal leaned over it there see she pointed to the shoulder of the tunic maddy stooped over adjusted her glasses and peered closely youre right it was there so faint it was missable unless you were looking for it what is it ladies a stain said sal red wine or something the old woman lifted glasses on a chain and propped them on the bridge of her nose she peered closely at where sal was pointing oh my you know i never noticed that before can i ask where you got it asked maddy the old woman straightened up lifted off her glasses and let them dangle on her chest well now it was someones attic cleanout if i recall a job lot i bought for this store a box full of all sorts of dusty old things quite a surprise to find this among all the other bits but you do find gems like this from time to time sal pointed towards the shops grimy window what about that bear the old woman leaned over the counter to see what she was pointing at on the rockingchair the stuffed bear yes oh i got all those soft toys from a daycare centre i think she looked back down at the tunic and the faint wine stain fascinating isnt it something like this makes history come alive she said to maddy almost like going back in time you can try and imagine how that stain happened the old womans eyes glinted with excitement perhaps this crewman was busy delivering a glass of sherry to some duchess when the titanic hit that iceberg and thats where the stain came from maddy humoured her with a nod yeah thats kind of cool she noticed sal was still staring at the soft toys on the rockingchair she nudged her gently sal uh sal turned back ok she nodded distracted a bell chimed and the shop door opened a man entered with a tuxedo and a ball gown carefully draped over his arms ah mr weismuller the old woman stepped from behind her counter how was your lodge party come on said maddy she took hold of sals hand lets go she led sal out miss thanks for showing us your tunic she called to the old woman as they both squeezed past her customer and stepped outside but she was already chattering away to him barely noticing the pair of them leaving outside on the pavement maddy shook her head my god you were right it is its exactly the same sal was still looking through the window back at the soft toys on the rockingchair sal what is it she turned back to maddy a smile quickly spread on her face nothing nothing just uh she changed the subject see then i told you the tunic what do you think it means it means something right it definitely means something maddy nodded yes yes it does she realized it was better liam wasnt here with them both liam and bob had gone out to their local barnes amp noble for some reading matter liam was adamant he wanted to read up on how to use computers and the internet better maddy assured them there really was a book entitled the complete idiots guide to the world wide web that she wasnt just being rude do you know what i think said sal this is going to sound like im a complete fakirchana head but she took a breath i think that tunic might be fosters maddy chewed her lip anxiously perhaps this was the right time to share what the old man had told her sal was so close to the truth in a way secrets she hated keeping them particularly this one it stank sal we need to talk about liam sal looked at her sharply what what is it hes well hes not who you think he is sal looked shaken what what do you mean who is he lets go get a coffee right now maddy tell me she looked upset no frightened who is he i need a coffee first maddy realized she was trembling her legs felt like they were set to give way on her and she felt queasy enough to hurl chunks on to the pavement i need to sit down sal i really need to i need to gather my thoughts and i need a freakin coffee chapter ad miles northeast of rome he found himself staring up at a cloudless blue sky a rich deep blue like the skies one used to see in old images from the beginning of the twentyfirst century quite different from the perpetual discoloured cloud cover of the turbulent sulphurous acid rain clouds the everpresent smog above cities and refugee shanty towns quite beautiful rashim could feel the warmth of the sun on his face hear the whisper of a fresh untainted breeze gently stirring the branches and leaves of trees nearby is this heaven he realized that was a pleasing notion that project exodus had gone disastrously wrong that every translation candidate including himself had died torn to pieces by extradimensional forces and this this was the afterlife his uncle an imam had once taken him aside and tried to describe what allahs paradise would be like it had sounded like this and hed scoffed at the mans faith maybe i was wrong maybe there is a god and that pleasant illusion could have lasted a while longer lying there on his back and enjoying the deep blue above him if it hadnt been for the stirring of others all around him it seemed like theyd managed to do it they survived the jump with a weary sigh rashim slowly lifted himself up on to his elbows and looked around they were right on the flat ground of the receiver station a field of swaying olivecoloured grass in the distance the glint of a gently meandering river and hills beyond that the correct location all right but he couldnt see any sign of the four receiver beacons tenfoottall tripods with an equipment platform at the top of each one each one marking a corner of ground space the exact same size as the translation grid back in the cheyenne mountain facility he got to his feet hooding his eyes from the sun no sign of them rashim cursed weve overshot the snap range where is this where are we rashim turned to his right the corporal was standing beside him where the hell is this where this is is near rome but im not sure precisely when it is the receiver station was deployed ahead of us in ad rashim continued more thinking aloud than answering the corporals question they should be right here dammit but i cant see any of the beacons ad the man rubbed his temples as if trying to push the idea into his head you mean like the year like fiftyfour years after jesus christ rashim nodded distractedly only this isnt i can only guess this is some time before then weve overshot the destination time this is further back in time rashim completed his threesixty survey the field was peppered with people slowly sitting up and getting to their feet gathering their wits and looking dumbstruck up at the strangely clear and beautifully blue sky above many of them still in a silent state of shock across the field he noted one of the mcvs the huge mobile command vehicles had gone missing one of the platoons of combat units strode purposefully across the field towards him equipment jangling from its webbing standard armyissue t pulse carbine slung from a strap on its shoulder the combat unit came to a halt in front of him and took off its helmet dr yatsushita has assigned you full authority rashim looked at the unit unsure whether it was telling him that or asking him the combat units unnerved him unlike the bulky sevenfoottall goliaths the military used to develop these newer models could pass more easily as human genetic tweaks had produced combat units every bit as strong as the older variants without requiring the same amount of muscle bulk they still looked like a bunch of military stiffs though two dozen pofaced combat carls with identical buzzcut hair hardly going to be the fun crowd at a party the combat unit standing in front of him carried the rank of lieutenant its name just like corporal north was stitched above the breast pocket of its camouflage tunic giving them names felt wrong they should just have numbers mind you hed given his lab unit a name hadnt he right yes uh lieutenant stern is it rashim tried a salute not sure if it was the right thing to do stern rashim wondered which moron came up with that cheesy name for this unit he could only imagine what the rest of the platoon were called chuck butch tex travis sir said stern what are your orders rashim puffed his lips and laughed a little nervously what er what do you suggest stern cast cool grey eyes across the field there were a lot of empty patches of grass where equipment even people had gone missing id suggest sir wed better take stock of how much got lost during the translation rashim nodded vigorously yes yes quite exactly the thing i was going to suggest very good he frowned his best attempt at looking officious and entirely in command well off you go then uh stern see to it the combat unit saluted him crisply yes sir he watched the unit jog across the arid grass towards the rest of the platoon the other people who had survived the jump were beginning to gather their wits he could see vicepresident stilson had managed to make it through mores the pity and that dictator and two of his wives rashim wondered how long before one of them decided that they should be leading project exodus instead of him chapter ad miles northeast of rome were in a rural region called sabines about sixteen miles to the northeast of rome rashim looked at the exodus group gathered in front of him just under a hundred and fifty of them theyd lost roughly half the people in the jump the children the baby were among those that had failed to emerge from extradimensional space god help them this location was picked out by the exodus survey team headed up by uh well me actually he shrugged selfconsciously the sun was setting behind a row of cypress trees on the horizon and long shadows stretched across the gently swaying grass around them i was in charge of establishing the receiver station whats that someone in the gathering dusk asked four beacons broadcasting tachyon beams the edt the extradimensional translation array keep it simple for the morons out there the time machine he hated that term was designed to zero in and snap to on these beacons beams and use that to guide us in to the correct emergence point but it uh it appears weve gone a little further back in time than we actually planned and lost over a hundred of our people rashim turned towards the voice someone messed this up badly vicepresident stilson glared like an old testament preacher well now look mr stilson this really isnt a precise science and quite honestly with all the lastminute data changes coming in and no time to recalibrate the edts transmission program actually im rather amazed that any of us survived stilson shook his head angrily ok ive heard enough look im assuming authority from here on in this is a damned mess already and we need to turn this around right now what rashims voice skipped up a notch it was almost a yelp no look see uh dr yatsushita actually put me in charge of exodus he said that im afraid we dont have time for this dr anwar isnt it rashim nodded right well im the senior government representative of the north american federation here which gives me executive authority like it or not that puts me in charge dr anwar a woman civilian he recognized her as one of the project exodus support staff not one of the candidates yes rashim answered her quickly before stilson could go on any more what is it do you know how far weve overshot the receiver markers rashim nodded forcefully and tried his most authoritative face here was a question he most certainly had an answer for yes i was able to successfully record the decay rate of the tachyon field its quite simple really tachyon particles decay at a constant rate a very similar principle actually to something like carbon dating where keep it simple well basically to cut a very long and boring technical explanation short ladies and gents we went back about seventeen years earlier than planned he scratched his chin and offered them a wan smile which actually i think is quite impressive really he ran a hand through his hair given the lastminute metrics i had to guess at he shrugged and smiled it could have been a lot worse than that really seventeen years out over half our people lost and most of our equipment gone stilson stepped forward good god man this is already a damned mess i know what the precise plans were for colonizing the past thats ancient history now were going to have to take stock and uh well now mr vicepresident yes of course we may have to play out the deployment phase slightly differently you can say that again anwar looks like well be improvising the plan from now on the group were silent few of them had been briefed on the details of project exodus all right listen up everyone barked stilson gather round closer im going to bring you folks up to speed on what you need to know what im about to tell you has been classified for toplevel eyes only outside of the exodus technical team the only other eyes on this have been those of the president myself and the joint chiefs of staff rashim noticed how easily stilson could rally everyone round this project has been in development for over five years funded by what remained of our defence procurement budget for what it was exodus was and still is our plan to transplant our values our knowledge our wisdom on to the infrastructure of an existing wellestablished and robust civilization the roman empire rashim heard the vicepresidents audience stir a panel of historical experts identified a specific moment in time in which to deploy exodus we were meant to arrive towards the tail end of the reign of a weak emperor a guy called claudius a weak emperor struggling to maintain his position in power now the plan was quite simple to offer our services our technology to this guy claudius in exchange for executive power in effect to become his governing body and eventually on his death to replace roman dictatorship with americanstyle republican democracy stilson turned and looked at rashim pointedly but it appears things have gone very wrong rashim felt all of their eyes fall on him uh now yes but you see most of you here are the wrong people that is to say youre all the wrong weights and sizes its thrown all my calculations completely out which is why we lost dr anwar said stilson what we dont need to hear are excuses or technobabble after the fact what we do need to do is start rethinking our plan of action were here in this time now and thats what we have to deal with so what we need to start finding out is exactly where we stand what the situation is seventeen years earlier can you at least tell us something about that rashim looked at the man and the others gathered behind him youve lost them already youre not in charge any more he realized it wasnt knowledge or wisdom that made a leader it wasnt being smarter than everyone else and by god he could perform intellectual somersaults round most of these morons no it was something as simple as the deep cadence of a voice a certain way of addressing assembled people a way of carrying yourself authority entitlement stilson had that all right and rashim none of it dr anwar he sighed slid open the panel of the hpad on his wrist and a faint holographic display hovered in the air in front of him yes there we go so he swiped through a timeline with his finger ah here we are well be dealing with a different roman emperor not claudius but his fingers traced along a glowing chart line to a name caligula what data do we have on this guy dr anwar uh let me just look that up on my he hadnt had the time to read up on the historical briefing dr yatsushita had the project historians put together not really if things had been a bit less of a frantic rush these last few months and weeks he might have been able to give it a cursory readthrough his job was the metrics punching the numbers getting them all here in one piece emperor caligula i can tell you about him all heads turned towards someone in the crowd by the fading light rashim vaguely recognized the face one of the candidates one of the few people who was actually meant to be there instead of another lastminute gatecrasher i know all about caligula god help us stilson gestured for the crowd to allow the man through and you are dr alan dreyfuss roman historian linguist ok then why dont you go ahead and tell us what you know dr dreyfuss the man was in his thirties narrowshouldered with a pot belly a shock of sandy hair above glasses and a salt and pepper beard grown rashim suspected to hide a double chin oh caligula dreyfuss began shaking his head oh boy this guys bad news bad news what do you mean hes mad mad uhhuh totally completely insane the people stirred unhappy at the sound of that but look i think theres a way we can play this guy said dreyfuss smiling stilson pursed his lips and nodded appreciatively he seemed to like this guy all right dr dreyfuss lets hear what youve got shock and awe well make an entrance dreyfuss played the crowd almost as well as stilson this guy made his own horse a senator would you believe this guy caligula believed in omens portents he was superstitious paranoid dr dreyfuss grinned well make him believe were gods chapter ad northeast of rome the two mcvs bounced energetically across fields of wheat leaving broad paths of flattened stalks in their wake rashim held on to the handrail as both hovervehicles slid across a rutted track into the next field their approach was relatively quiet the deep hum of electromagnetic repulsors was almost lost beneath the clatter of strappedon equipment bouncing against the carbominium hull he watched the heads and shoulders of slaves emerge from the tall swaying stalks like startled meerkats eyes and mouths suddenly wide with horror then gone as they scurried away in fear of their lives ahead of them a wider track thick with carts on the way into rome became a sudden carpet of chaotic panic as slaves and merchants scattered into the fields and horses reared and bucked in their harnesses the leading mcv veered left on to the track this one wasnt ruts of dried mud but a cobbled stone track a proper road in fact all roads lead to rome stilsons voice crackled over the commsspeaker rashim wrinkled his nose and sighed in silent disgust at the blowhard idiots appalling cliche he looked at the back of stilson in the mcv in front standing on the vehicles front gun platform like some buccaneer admiral on the prow of his squarerigged ship the vicepresident was punching his fist in the air with childlike excitement you let that jerk take over congratulations he looked at the combat unit sitting beside him on the mcvs hull t calmly resting across muscular forearms he covered his throat mic looks like someones having fun eh the unit had the reflective sun visor of his helmet pulled down rashim couldnt see his eyes just the bottom of his nose and the mouth chewing on protein gum with all the grace of a horse munching on hay yes sir to be fair stilson and dreyfusss rejigging of the plan called for a display of bravado theyd lost way too much of their ammunition powerpacks equipment and manpower to guarantee being successful taking control of rome by force two dozen combat units and whatever number of rounds of ammo they were carrying on their equipment belts were enough to make a spectacular display of firepower but not much more certainly not enough to take on several legions and a city of one million inhabitants hell well give em a display of shock and awe all right rashim vaguely recognized the catchphrase stilson and dreyfuss were using uttered by some puffedup presidential moron long ago shock and awe make them believe the gods have come down to earth that was basically their plan roll right into the middle of rome make a ton of noise intimidate the lot of them and take over the whole show simple all puff and posture smoke and mirrors bluffing it to the hilt right up stilsons street the mcv ahead suddenly lurched upwards and glided over an abandoned cart left in the middle of the road as they did the same rashim glanced down through the open turret hatchway at the passengers he could see crammed in down below approximately fifty of them standing room only they swayed queasily as their vehicle rose and dipped alarmingly like a dinghy riding a rough sea he was glad he was up here outside and not tucked away down there hed have thrown up by now hovertransports always made him travelsick sir rashim turned to the combat unit beside him he was pointing dead ahead he followed the units gloved finger and saw down the arrowstraight cobbled road flanking rows of evenly spaced tall thin cypress trees like a welcoming guard of honour beyond them the first faint outline of the city a long pale wall and hovering above a sea of terracotta tile roofs that receded into a morning haze a myriad of hairline threads of smoke from countless cooking fires and kilns bakers blacksmiths and tanneries stoked up for a days business climbed lazily towards a mediterranean sky rome rashim you hear me it was stilson yes i can hear you ready to give em a show theyll never forget eh rashim rolled his eyes the vicepresident sounded insufferably excited you really want to put that uh that music on goddammit yes of course i do stick it on man as loud as you can reluctantly rashim ducked down inside the hatch and nodded to the combat unit piloting the mcv stilson says to put that music of his on now loudly affirmative almost immediately his ears were ringing from chestthumping decibels of noise booming out of the vehicles pa system stilsons choice of music downloaded from his personal media digicube awfulsounding old stuff he called rock music the speakers mounted outside on the front of both mcvs blared and thumped and a raggedthroated singer was screaming something about being born in the usa chapter new york maddy set the tray down on the table between them a strong milky sugary frothy latte for her and a fruit smoothie for sal so said sal impatiently what is it about liam maddy settled into the booth and leaned over the table her voice low so its something foster told me about him hes she shook her head this is so weird its gonna really mess with your head sal jahulla maddy just tell me liam and foster theyre the same she pulled a face what the same theyre the exact same person sal turned to look out of the window there was a market outside grocers fishmongers and milling customers they could have sat outside the cafe it was certainly warm enough this monday afternoon but with the market going on far too noisy for their need to talk in hushed whispers the same maddy nodded foster was once liam sals mouth hung open catching flies an expression her mom used to use maddy nodded thats right give it a moment to sink in sal it totally fried my head when foster first told me but what so that means sal stopped cocked her head and frowned then tried again are you saying foster was young like liam exactly like liam fosters been working for the agency since he was sixteen ahh yeah i guess well kind of sal chewed the top of her straw nibbling ferociously at it she stopped so this means foster was once on the titanic maddy nodded i think so and he was recruited like liam was i guess so then who recruited foster i dont know i dont know she looked down at her hands playing with the handle of her teaspoon stirring the frothy coffee unnecessarily maybe another foster another foster sal looked up at her like its a loop or something like our archway field but bigger looping round and round does that mean there are other us other you s and me s maddy shrugged im still trying to figure how this all works perhaps it was someone else who recruited foster she hesitated waldstein even this is so chutiya this is really scaring me maddy i dont know what to believe what to think she laughed its a chutiya crazy idea what is sal shrugged come on sal what those two jackets liam being foster she looked up at maddy maybe this is so totally chutiya but maybe weve all been here before a nervous jittery halfsmile flickered on to her face maddy the team that came before us do you remember foster saying there was that team that died maddys coffee was midway between the table and her mouth it stayed there oh my god you think that was us sal shrugged my diary you know my diary that notebook youre always scribbling in yeah there were pages ripped out when i found it i thought you bought it no i found it in the arch she played with her straw i found it tucked in my bunk and maddy shook her head these rippedout pages i think it might have been me writing in the diary before oh was all she could say then im not sure i like the sound of this me neither the pair of them stared at each other we dont know anything for sure do we said sal finally were like little test rats in a lab maddy nodded feels like that sometimes she looked out of the window at the street outside not for the first time she wished she could just walk away from all of this trade places with just about anyone out there on the street all i know is i trust you sal and i trust liam too as long as were honest with each other sal turned to her but you did keep things from us the note from san francisco with that pandora message and now this liam being foster youve lied to us so how can i youre right maddys eyes dropped guiltily but im done with all the secrets you know everything i know now and you said that before too well this time i mean it sal seriously no more secrets you know what i know she reached out for sals hand but she pulled it away sal you seem to have picked up this job though maddy i mean really easily like maybe youve done it before or something like maybe easy youre kidding right tell me youre kidding you think its been easy for me sheesh maddy could hear her voice wobbling with emotion she shut up before that wobble became tears pressed her lips and took a deep breath dont you dare cry maddy dont you dare go girly she sipped at her coffee not even wanting it any more they sat in silence for a while both watching the market outside for something to do other than look at each other im sorry said sal eventually ok i was just saying maddy waved her hand forget it i trust you sal and i trust liam weve put our lives in each others hands havent we quite a few times now sal nodded and thats all the three of us have got each other if i dont even get to have that then i dont want to go on doing this i cant go on doing this sal reached out and squeezed her hand im sorry maddy maddy puffed her cheeks s ok tainted with guilt though there was one more secret she hadnt shared and maybe now was the time for it to come out theres more sal theres more i need to tell you sal looked like she didnt want to hear any more right now but the proverbial cat was halfway out of the bag maddy decided she needed to hear this fosters old right sal old how old do you reckon he is i dont know she hunched her shoulders really old come on give me a number seventy eighty try twentyseven the smoothie almost slipped out of sals hands what hes twentyseven years old maddy sipped her coffee so i suppose we can presume from that that hes been a timerider for ten years the field office our archway this agency has been doing its thing for about ten years worth of twoday looptime that felt about right the archway had from day one felt as if it had been lived in already certainly not brand spanking new freshly set up but that wasnt the thing she needed to tell sal now thing is the time displacement aged foster every time he went back in time to fix history it was corrupting him ageing him before his time and now the same is happening to liam sal stared out of the window for a moment maddy suspected she already had half an idea something like that was happening to him his hair she said after a while that bit of his hair maddy nodded yup that was a huge jump for liam sixtyfive million years he took a big hit on that one i hate to think how much of a bite that took out of the time hes got chuddah sal whispered hes going to die isnt he before us yes quite probably and then maddy didnt know what happened then perhaps she would one day soon find herself opening a portal on the titanic wading through freezing water looking for a young steward called liam oconnor i think its also hitting you and me she said ageing us too she reached a hand up and traced the faintest lines in her skin beside her left eye she sure as heck wasnt going to call them crows feet old people had those but thats what those faint lines were going to become one day ive done a couple of jumps back sal and i know that its affecting me but i think the archway field that loops us round the two days also has an effect sals eyes were still on the marketplace outside i thought she turned back to maddy i thought we were changing you and me i just i just wasnt sure if it was my eyes playing tricks on me dont tell me im lookin older ill tip my coffee on you said maddy she was trying to be funny it came out sounding lame liam must realize it said sal surely he can see it when are you going to tell him i dont know when the times right but its obvious now you have to tell him soon maddy wondered if liam was already aware that this was killing him and just putting on a front of not caring he couldnt be so thickskinned not to have noticed anything look i know i know its just she sighed im just worried that when i tell him hell run off and leave us but foster didnt true sal was right once upon a time he was younger he was liam and at some point he learned he was dying but he stayed at his post didnt he did his duty ill tell him maddy said ill tell him soon they sat in silence for a while both lost in their own thoughts their own worlds this doesnt end well for us does it said sal presently all three of us are going to die arent we everyone dies sal but were going to die soon why say that maddy come on what if we are were the other team are we going to get ripped to pieces by a seeker one day does this all happen again and again going round and round like circles crud i wish i knew i wish i could get my head round all of this look dont go there who knows right she took a breath anyway strictly speaking were already dead or should be sal looked morose maddy could see tears glistening in her eyes waiting to tumble she reached across the table for her she couldve said something kinder just then look you me and liam we got given an extra helping of life thats more than anybody else ever gets weve been so lucky and think what weve already done with that time what weve already seen and what more stuff well get to see we cant waste what weve been given and worry about stuff we cant possibly predict you know maddy realized she needed to take a piece of her own advice how often had she pined to escape this and be normal again i know i just i think i thought i hoped we would go on forever maybe the three of us and bob and becks sort of like a family like a gang of superheroes or something that first tear rolled down sals cheek and hung from her chin nothing lasts forever sal maddy squeezed her hand gently and superheroes we certainly arent that chapter ad amphitheatrum statilii tauri rome the man was useless absolutely useless there was no denying that the lion was clearly dying the fur on its rear flanks matted and dark with blood from a dozen gaping wounds a gash along its belly from which a loop of entrails was dangling and still this stupid man had somehow managed to wind up with his head wedged firmly in the lions jaws almost dead now no not quite dead yet his pale arms thrashed pitifully once again the crowd jeered and laughed at that not even a goodnatured laugh it was disgust at how little the old exsenator had been prepared to fight for his life to put on a good show for them he looked down from the imperial box at the crowd either side of him at faces contorted with mockery and anger at the still twitching man down on the bloodspattered sand mind you how well would you fools fight hmmm would you struggle heroically till your last breath he imagined the vast majority of them would have done what this weak old man just had dropped his sword fallen to his knees and pleaded for mercy until the lion casually swiped at him and knocked the fool on to his back he shook his head with disgust at the crowd so easy to be brave isnt it when youre sitting up there safe comfortable and entertained caesar he watched as the lion lazily crunched on the mans skull gnawing at it like a dog on a butchers scrap emperor gaius gaius julius caesar augustus germanicus turned to his freedman so few of the people around him used his name instead to his face it was usually a deferential term however when they thought they were beyond his hearing it was the name that everyone used for him the nickname that had followed him all his life from being a small boy yes replied caligula might i suggest we ought to proceed with the next entertainment caligula looked out at the crowd some of them were impatiently throwing stones down at the surviving lion and the headless body of the last of todays ad bestia victims yes yes of course you can clear this lot away for the gladitorii meridiani the man dipped his head and left the imperial box quickly caligula settled back in his seat alone again today his mischievous plotting sister drusilla and her son and old uncle claudius family he preferred them all to be kept well away from rome they were trouble he could do without he watched the midday sun beating down beyond the shade of his purple awning the heat of it making the dirt in the arena shimmer on sweltering days like today he missed the cool crisp winter mornings of his childhood in germania dark forests of evergreens trees laden with heavy snow the sound of an army camp all around him his father germanicuss voice barking orders to the men and those men those soldiers sternfaced veterans who grinned down at him in his miniature replica of a legionarys armour at his small wooden sword his little army boots they regarded their generals little boy as the legions mascot his nickname caligula little boot thats what the men around the camp affectionately called him he sorely missed those times the feeling of family the sense of belonging to be an emperor was to be entirely alone part of nothing above everything sometimes he actually longed for one of his dutiful subordinates to dare call him caligula to his face he wouldnt be outraged by such a gesture he wouldnt discipline such a person hed welcome it welcome that feeling of being a little boy again surrounded by giants of men who would squat down and politely ruffle his hair regard him with genuine fondness chapter ad rome the mcv ahead of them glided through the archway over the via praenestina the road heading into the centre of rome the thoroughfare in front of them was empty of people but littered with abandoned carts rickshaws dropped bales of goods as rashims mcv glided beneath the archway into the market square beyond he had to admit that stilsons idea to pump out hundreds of decibels of awful rock music was a pretty good scare tactic personally he would have chosen something a little more melodic and sophisticated to announce their arrival but whatever it was certainly working stilsons voice came over the commschannel which way is it to the colosseum rashim ducked down through the hatchway looking for dreyfuss he beckoned him to join him up in the hatchway dreyfuss clambered through the press of swaying bodies below found the ladder and pulled himself up beside rashim he pointed to the mcv ahead of them bobbing softly on its electromagnetic field in the middle of the nowdeserted market square stilson wants directions to the colosseum dreyfuss shook his head and shouted something back it was lost amid the din of the pounding music rashim picked up a headset hanging on a hook beside him and passed it to the historian gesturing for him to put it on his head my god dreyfusss tinny voice crackled over the commschannel a few seconds later behind roundframed glasses his eyes widened my god this is actually it this is really ancient rome this is incredible look at those wall decals that graffiti over there the jeez whos that squawking on the channel that you anwar no mr stilson answered rashim ive got dr dreyfuss up here with me now he could see stilsons head and shoulders ahead of them turning round to look back at them ah good job dreyfuss tell me which way do we go for the colosseum uh mr stilson see if this is in fact ad it wont have been built yet no colosseum ok dreyfuss give me somewhere else we can go wheres the most public place we can gatecrash well he scratched at his beard like a dog scratching for fleas he looked at rashim for inspiration rashim shrugged a youretheexpert at him well now the best place i can suggest would probably be the amphitheatrum statilii tauri yeah so wheres that its in the campus martius district they both heard stilson curse impatiently just give me a goddam left a right or a straight on ok dreyfuss pointed towards a broad cobbled thoroughfare branching off from the small square that road ahead of us i think it should take us in a generally southwesterly direction which is towards the centre of the city right the mcv in front of them began to slide towards the broad avenue it was flanked on either side by rows of low shops tabernae their stone walls painted with a riotous variety of colours and murals and fronted with awnings and stalls selling all manner of crafted goods rashim watched pale faces looking out at them from the dark tabernae interiors wideeyed expressions of terror he wondered whether that was at the sight of the two large hovering vehicles or the horrendous wailing bansheelike noise they were pumping out they proceeded slowly steadily down the thoroughfare the buildings on either side becoming brightly painted twostorey structures of clay brick with uncertainlooking balconies of wood and wicker he saw heads peeking from behind beaded fabric panels and wooden shutters abandoned animals braying in the street a baby left on its back in a doorway pink fists clenching and unclenching above its squawking face they entered a second larger market square rashim watched hundreds of people scatter clay amphoras of olive oil and wine dropped shattering and spilling their contents on the ground chickens skittering nervously between the wooden legs of market stalls and packs of dogs barking a challenge as they backstepped nervously into openguttered alleyways dreyfuss was grinning at their surroundings grinning like a fox in a chicken coop he instructed stilson to bear left that avenues the vicus patricius taking us past the forum traiani the palatinus on the left the we dont need a history lesson dreyfuss stilsons voice crackled just the directions dreyfuss nodded sorry just keep on this road until we see the river tiber then we take a right and follow the river up into the campus martius district chapter ad amphitheatrum statilii tauri rome the workers had cleared away most of the bloody remains from the ad bestia the last wretched lion had been put out of its misery and fresh dirt sprinkled over the largest coagulating puddles of blood the crowd were clearly restless for the next round gladitorii meridiani to begin a fight between several sparring partners of convicted criminals man versus beast was one thing but it was quite another to see two pairs of men fighting desperately for their lives particularly when it was well known that one of the convicts about to emerge into the arena was vibius the notorious childstrangler from the esquilinus district caligula rather fancied that if the man managed to survive his sparring partner he would put on some armour come down to the pit and face the murderer himself the crowd would love that he smiled the plebs are so easily pleased arent they a roar of excitement began to roll round the amphitheatre as wooden gates opened revealing a dark tunnel down to the underground bowels of the arena and a pair of praetorian guards leading out two rows of terrifiedlooking men a wretched collection of specimens he was about to turn and ask his slave gnaelus for his armour to be readied in case the mood to participate in finishing off any squirming survivors took him when he heard faintly over the hubbub of the impatient onlookers around the stalls of the amphitheatre a soft rhythmic thumping almost like a distant battle drum his lean face knotted with curiosity gnaelus can you hear that the old slave nodded now what do you think that is he cocked his head sounds like a marching drum caesar some other heads among the roaring crowd began to curiously turn one way then the other at the still faint but steadily increasing volume of that thumping the convicts meanwhile were now standing in the middle of the arena the escort of praetorian guards withdrawing to the edges of the pit as a pair of slaves passed out an assortment of weapons to the criminals their minds on the prospect of imminent violent death none of them yet seemed to have registered the growing noise caligula stood up and leaned against the railing of the imperial box what is that he uttered it really is getting quite irritating now all of a sudden a flock of starlings fluttered and swooped across the sky above them quite clearly startled by something heads all around the amphitheatre looked up at them circling once above the arena and then fleeing over the walls and out of sight caligula could hear the roar of impatient excitement for the next round giving way to a chaos of voices filled with curiosity and a growing anxiety at the noise and that sudden peculiar behaviour of the birds the thumping sound was now almost on a par with the noise of the crowd a deep slow regular pounding like a heartbeat accompanied by something else now it sounded like a horn no in fact like nothing hed ever heard before a note increasing in pitch getting higher and higher more insistent like a roaring wind whistling with growing intensity up until now he was damned if he was going to display any unease or urgent curiosity like the rabble in the stalls around him but this cacophony the thumping so loud his chest was beginning to vibrate this growing whistling wailing sound then shrill screams he turned to where they were coming from and saw something loom over the top of the highest row of stalls something large the size of those curious grey lumbering beasts from africa two of them in fact but it was all angles corners plated like armour and the drab colour of a muddy river it rose over the edge of the stalls and seemed to slide down just feet above the heads of panicking people fleeing their seats hovering the air beneath it shimmering and churning like the air above a campfire the thudding was suddenly so much louder caligula could hear what sounded like a voice shrieking and wailing like a man tormented by a thousand demons he dropped to his knees behind the parapet his eyes bulging with terror the giant thing not alive not any kind of animal he sensed that now some sort of vast flying chariot perhaps finally slid over the last stall and down on to the arena floor whipping up swirling clouds of sand and dust a second one of these leviathans appeared over the top wall of the amphitheatre glided down across the stalls now empty except for the writhing bodies of the trampled and wounded finally coming to rest beside the first both olivegreen leviathans were hovering a mans height off the ground churning up storms of grit and sand into the thousands of terrified faces all around finally the roaring wind sound began to drop in pitch and volume and both monsters settled gently on to the ground the storm cloud of dust and sand settling around them the deep booming thudding and the horrifying wailing continued however drowning out the hoarse screams of panic from all sides of the amphitheatre caligula realized that beneath his imperial robes he had wet himself another childhood memory for him today shame chapter ad amphitheatrum statilii tauri rome rashim could hear stilsons voice over the commschannel guffawing like a fratboy with a hallpass just look at em dreyfuss was grinning too drinking in the spectacle of the arena the combat unit leading the platoon lieutenant stern barked some orders to his men and they dropped down from the hulls of both mcvs on to the hard sand setting up an ordered circular perimeter kneeling weapons raised around both vehicles with quick wellpractised efficiency can we cut this wretched noise now said rashim i cant help but think weve made our point forty feet away standing on top of the weapons turret of his mcv he saw stilson nod slowly i guess these dumb suckers have heard enough acdc yeah ok you can cut it rashim ducked down inside and gestured for the unit manning the console to turn the music off he flipped a switch and all of a sudden they were engulfed with silence complete hearapindrop silence stilsons voice quietly crackled over rashims earpiece i think we got their attention eh dr anwar rashim nodded yes i think you could probably say that have we got that recording ready to go dreyfuss had worked with stilson last night taking the vicepresidents scribbled words and translating them into latin then reading them aloud and recording it hed fussed and fretted for endless hours over the various versions of the recording worrying about the precise pronunciation of the language no one knows for sure how some of these words were actually spoken had been his repeated complaint but hed done it eventually settling on one particular recording as the best he was ever going to get its good to go said dreyfuss over the commschannel then lets play it said stilson hopping down from the weapons turret walking across the sloping hull of his vehicle and standing proudly on the front of it hands on hips like some shakespearian actor centre stage the complete silence was broken by the booming sound of dreyfusss voice over the two vehicles synced pa system citizens of rome we come in peace rashim shook his head only a pompous idiot like stilson would start with a line as cheesy as that we have come down from the heavens to be gods among mortals we are here to show you new ways to share our knowledge and our wisdom with you we are here to educate this dark world bring peace to every land and prosperity to you he looked at the crowd the panicked stampede from the stalls had stopped and all around them on the four sides of the statilius taurus ten thousand faces stared in silence at stilson assuming the voice they could hear was his the members of project exodus crammed down inside the mcvs began to emerge warily from a ramp at the rear of each vehicle we are all gods in human form we are all from the heavens a place that we call america and we are here to bring you our way of living the american way chapter barnes amp noble union square new york this is not the historical reference section liam what uh liam looked up guiltily from the comicbook in his hands oh hi bob i wondered where you got to i have been waiting in the historical reference section for twentynine minutes bob looked at the label at the top of the spinning carousel graphic novels you will not find relevant or useful texts in this section i have located the computer technology section at the you should have a look at these liam flicked through several pages i never really took any notice of the cartoons in the cork papers thought they were for children or fools who couldnt read proper he handed the comicbook to bob but this he said grinning its properly amazing so look at them pictures bob looked at the cover of the one liam passed him judge dredd aye and the hero fella this dredd he looks just like you all muscles and chin and no bleedin smile you could be his twin bobs contemplative scowl remained as he scanned several pages you cannot see this characters face he is wearing a helmet hey we could dress you up like that eh get you one of them big motor bicycles and you could ride round the city being all grumpy liam nudged him what do you think about that bob handed the comicbook back to him this is not relevant reading material well were on strike are we not i fancy something a little bit more fun to read he stuck the comicbook under his arm and flipped through a few more this stuff is all so fun and look this ones got a big grumpy fella who dresses like a bat so he does liam giggled i love it this is not useful or relevant reading material he pulled another one out and silently flipped through a dozen pages grinning at the illustrations ah now will you look at this one right up your street so it is bob looked at the cover ad robohunter he shook his head disapprovingly it does not depict cybernetic technology accurately aw come on bob its just a bit of fun liam patted him im having this one as well he looked up at bob how much money have we got maddy gave us ninety dollars liam nodded enough for another couple do you think negative liam you have enough money to purchase one more comicbook if you still also wish to purchase a hot dog afterwards they were out on th avenue ambling north in the general direction of central park hot dogs on the grass in the midday sun that was the plan a bit of ladstogethertime was liams justification for blagging some petty cash from maddy liam was already eagerly leafing through the glossy coloured pages of judge dredd ah this dredd fellas such a cool customer so he is bob strode along beside him thoughtfully define cool customer well he just seems so calm see look at his mouth its always the same not screaming or laughing or anything just like this liam pressed his lips together firmly into a passable approximation of humourless stoicism i wish i could be like that calm firm you know in charge of things no fear you are able to do many expressions with your face liam why would you want to limit yourself to only being able to do one well i got a terrible feeling that i spent most of the last few months with me gob hangin open like a barn door which was probably true it seemed if he wasnt utterly confused by events going on around him then he was busy being utterly terrified by them mimicking human facial expressions is one thing i find difficult to do convincingly said bob becks managed to be far more effective at this ah but you see thats part of your charm bob being the surly ol lump that yare it is however one of my goals to appear more human than that goals liam looked up at him you actually have a personal goal bob nodded affirmative between mission specifications there is the ongoing imperative to improve the efficacy of my onboard ai now see when you said goal you actually sounded a lot more like a human just then liam laughed then you went and ruined it with all that mission specification nonsense they walked in silence for a while may i ask you a question liam aye sure do you have personal goals he frowned well theres a question and a half hmmm since being snatched from certain death at the bottom of the atlantic all those months ago it seemed his mind had been doubletiming to catch up on events to learn about this world of to learn about nearly a hundred years worth of twentiethcentury history and technology his mind had been so swamped with absorbing new information it seemed there was little time or space inside his skull for such petty things as a personal goal a wish a hope even a comicbook for example continued bob would you like to return to your own time liam liam shook his head i got the job on the titanic sos i could escape home wanted to see the world to visit america and all that you have seen many things now liam liam laughed more than i bargained for id say so you currently have no goals in your mind to stay in one piece thats a pretty important one for me bob nodded affirmative that is sensible ill tell you one thing i wouldnt mind though bob what is that liam he stopped stepped aside to let a pair of young women pushing double baby buggies pass by both of them were yapping on their phones taking the whole pavement between them oblivious to the disgruntled pedestrians in their wake i wouldnt mind going back to nottingham he smiled wistfully if there was one abiding memory he was always going to treasure it was waking up with the sun streaming into his bedchamber stepping out on to the balcony and surveying the city stirring to life the smell of woodsmoke the morning chorus of cockerels the swooping of swallows around his keep and knowing he was lord albeit temporarily of all that he surveyed that was a good time wasnt it you and me in charge of things bob nodded we worked efficiently together that we most certainly did he gazed at the shop window beside him a mobilephone store the window peppered with deals on call tariffs and unlimited texts ahhh yer eeejit what is the matter liam i forgot to turn me bleedin thingamajiggy on again he fished deep into his trouser pocket for the mobile phone maddy had issued him with he was always forgetting to switch the infernal thing on he was in for a moan from her if shed tried his number without any luck he fumbled with the tiny buttons and finally the small screen flickered to life seven missed calls and all of them from her oh great he quickly dialled her number and she picked up on the first ring cmon liam whats the point in you having a freakin phone if you never turn the thing on ahh im sorry mads really sorry i was just get home now why whats up just get back here now weve got a problem chapter new york it was some little kids yankees baseball cap said maddy wasnt it sal nodded that ny logo on the front you see everywhere it changed to a trident just changed in the blink of an eye liam lowered the shutter door so and so as any old dittobrain knows the trident is the symbol for the greek god poseidon right of course liam nodded thoughtfully yeah i knew that and thats what i figured until we got back here and started doing some datatrawling said maddy something to do with greek gods but then it was pretty clear this is a roman thing see the trident also works for neptune thats the roman version of the greek god poseidon hold on said liam it could be either then couldnt it a contamination from roman or greek times maddy shook her head no this is definitely a roman thing she led him over towards the desk weve got us a doozy of a change right here computerbob flagged it up straight away she sat down bob put up that list from our internal database yes maddy a list of names and dates appeared on the screen in front of them roman emperors she said thats the whole list all the way through the roman empire she turned to address the screen bob can you put up the list from our external source another list appeared on the screen next to the first spot the difference said sal taking a seat beside maddy liam spotted instantly it changes after the third fella caligula you got it said maddy she pointed with a biro running it down the screen the correct data says he should have been caesar from ad to thats just four years now look at the external data were drawing this from a database location at bibliotheca universalislibri cldvi see weve got the emperor caligula ruling for nearly thirty years weird said sal looking at the database address a latin internet liam squinted as he looked at the names on the screen and the names are all different after him too right maddy sat back in her chair so someone somewhere has just made sure caligula stays in power for much longer than hes meant to thered be a much bigger change now though said liam wouldnt there well sheesh god knows what were going to get when the next ripple arrives sal tutted someones just been very naughty in roman times liam looked at them both sooo maddy sighed and tossed the biro on to her cluttered desk so they shared an uncomfortably long pause a whosgoingtocrackfirst silence the question hung in the air between them not asked and not answered so said sal are we dealing with this or are we still on strike this is a significant contamination rumbled bob yeah thanks for that dr brainiac said maddy she huffed irritably it would just be so nice if this waldstein guy actually you know bothered to acknowledge what were doing here i want answers before i do another thing for this agency still heard nothing from that advert asked liam not a thing nada zip we cannot ignore this contamination said bob bob is correct maddy cursed great now i got both of em nagging me liam shrugged i suppose i wouldnt mind having a quick look at them romans he offered maddy a conciliatory smile and maybe the bobs are right if fosters telling the truth maddy sal said quietly if we really are the only team but what if we let it go said maddy let this small timeline change work its way up to whatever year waldstein is watching us from maybe thatll make him take notice of us make him answer our questions we cannot ignore this contamination said bob again she balled her fist on the table a soft gasp of frustration deep in her throat sal looked uncertainly at her there will be more changes coming soon maddy you know how it goes aye we ought to do something maddy turned in her chair to look at them right she nodded angrily clearly im the one being the stupid idiot here and clearly im not actually in charge of this team then it seems this is in fact a decisionmaking committee and apparently ive been outvoted that about the size of it sal was right though that was the annoying thing liam was right too even their dumb support unit and the networked computers were right they couldnt just do nothing couldnt just sit on their hands and ride this one out crud i just wanted to to wait and see you know see if someone else might step in and help out she tried sounding hopeful maybe even force waldstein to come back and pay us a visit you never know the silence was deafening all right ok i get it all right she pushed her chair back with a squeak of complaint from castor wheels forced across the pitted concrete i suppose we better start getting organized then what are they theyre called babelbuds said maddy according to the packet they came in everyone in the future uses them all the time liam looked down at them they looked like fleshcoloured smarties with a dimple on one side maddy opened a small ziploc plastic bag and dropped two of them in i checked them they support seventysix languages latin among them just pop them in your ears when you arrive theres a spare in case you lose one she looked at his shaggy hair and since your ears are lost under that mop no ones going to see them anyway sal handed him another sealed plastic bag containing the woollen tunic leggings and shoes from his trip to i found some leather flipflops and took the label off them i think theyll do thanks ive got a location set up about seven miles outside rome said maddy remote ive pinholed it and run a density probe its quiet so you shouldnt be observed arriving or leaving see if you can thumb a lift in or steal some horses from somewhere and then i guess the best thing would be to head into rome and have a quick look around she scanned through some printedout notes it seems something or someones helped caligula survive the assassination attempt that cut his reign short i really dont know where to suggest you should start looking somewhere central the government district the forum or senate or whatever the term is some place like that their version of times square added sal right maddy nodded ive picked ad on the database of corrupted history were getting garbled data for that year its in a state of flux i think these might be a sequence of oscillating time ripples like an interference pattern its very unsettled obviously something major happens in that year lets start from there and see where it takes us bob and liam nodded so like the cabot trip liam ok just go look and listen and see if theres anything at all we can zero in on as a possible cause aye will do return windows as usual are one hour one day one week well dont get all hissy with me if we miss the first two windows said liam he looked at her seven miles you say thats a days walk there and a days walk back me an bob wont get to see much of rome if we have to get back for a week then she replied irritably if thats what you want aye he smiled itll be good to get a proper look around for once rather than a flying visit up to you just be care maddy stopped shed not noticed it before but standing here at the base of the displacement tube with the strip light fizzing away directly above and casting an intense light down on his face liams eyes seemed lost in shadow ever so slightly sunken the very first faint hint of fosters face in his younger features mads she shot a quick glance at sal she knew about liam now can she see it too by this light is she seeing what im seeing liam cocked his head curiously and in the change of expression the vague resemblance to fosters face was all of a sudden gone maddy you all right she nodded quickly uh fine no what i was going to say was just uh just be careful of course i will always am liam grinned turned and punched bobs bare shoulder come on then fella time for the goldfish bowl she looked at bob naked apart from shorts and clutching his own plastic bag of clothes is your datapacket upload complete he nodded i have firstcentury latin and the correct timeline history from the database installed bring liam back safe and sound wont you bob of course i will liam tutus erit in manibus meis maddy smiled convincing as ever she watched liam ease himself into the tube with a whoop at the cold water that echoed round the archway bob joined him a moment later treading water beside liam as energy began to surge into the rack of circuitry beside the perspex tube sal joined her now i know why you always look so sad when youre sending liam back she said quietly yes maddy nodded now you know the hum of kinetic energy rose in volume and pitch as maddy counted down the last two minutes because every time i do this to liam im gradually killing him the archway boomed with the release of energy and the flex of perspex suddenly relieved of the weight and pressure of thirty gallons of water chapter ad italy liam looked around as he finished dressing maddy had managed to find a perfectly discreet location for them a small grove of olive trees nestled at the bottom of a narrow valley a brook meandered through boulders and across a shallow bed of pebbles a quite pleasant patch of wilderness they worked in silence burying their bags in the parched ruddy claylike soil beneath one of the olive trees as the rhythmic trill of cicadas whistled at them from the dry grass all around done they worked their way up out of the valley clambering up a slope of coarse grass and hawthorn bushes liam was mopping sweat from his face with the back of his hand by the time they reached the top and stood beside a dusty hardbaked track winding down a slope liam took in the broad sedentary horizon in the far distance a ribbon of peaks the apennine mountains before him a patchwork of pastures and fields rolling over gently sloping hills and dotted here and there with pastelcoloured villas with claytile roofs that shimmered in the heat of the midday sun the city of rome is seven miles east of our current position said bob i suggest we acquire transport and make our way there to gather intelligence transport liam looked around i think were the transport bob scanned the horizon were probably going to have to walk so negative this is a trade route into rome we will encounter transport bob narrowed his eyes and studied the dusty track carefully look liam followed his gaze and this time saw a distant curl of dust kicked up from the track bob flexed his fists and played out an unnervingly wide rictus of a smile on his lips show time he grunted merrily five minutes later they were in possession of their own horsedrawn cart laden with amphoras of wine and were leaving behind them at the side of the track a portly old greek tradesman shouting a stream of unintelligible obscenities shaking his fist furiously at them the babelbud in liams ear calmly translated for him in soothing feminine tones your father is a dog with a hygiene problem your mother has low moral values im sorry liam called out guiltily the bud whispered in his ear me paenitet me paenitet he called out bob nodded approvingly as he cajoled the horses in front of them to break into a weary trot you are using the translator very good maybe we should leave him something to drink you know its hot and as you wish bob reached a thick arm over the drivers seat into the back of the cart and lifted up a large clay amphora stoppered with a plug of wax liquid sloshed around inside as he swung it out over the side and tossed it gently on to the twisted brittle branches and needles of a squat aleppo pine tree by the side of the track the greeks cursing receded eventually lost beneath the sound of the carts creaking wheels and the clopclop of hooves on sunbaked dirt liam settled back in his seat and sighed contentedly in the warmth of the sun so this is ancient rome then affirmative another place i can tick off me mustgoandsee list bob turned to look at him you have a list of places to just a figure of speech bob i understand well now you might as well tell me all the important bits of information maddy shoved into your head there were you not listening during her briefing liam shrugged i was but there was a lot of it and she said it all a bit too quickly and i was trying to undress at the same time so bob sighed the year is ad in correct history this would be towards the end of the reign of emperor claudius the emperor who is supposed to have succeeded caligula after his fouryear reign and his assassination instead altered history records that this year the emperor gaius julius caesar augustus germanicus caligula correct commonly known as caligula celebrates his seventeenth year in power it is also his last year at some point during this year he is supposed to have ascended to heaven to take his place as god youre kidding bob carried on it appears that caligula has adopted certain tenets of a relatively obscure belief system imported from judaea whats that bob looked at him you do not know this liam shrugged no i then he realized youre talking about christianity correct caligula overwrites the greek and roman polytheist many gods belief system with the idea of one true god this he has stolen from christianity also the roman interpretation of the afterlife elysium is replaced with the christian depiction of heaven cheeky devil caligula has adopted this faith completely and then rewritten it with himself in the role of son of god liam half laughed at the mans gall so what really happens to caligula then this is unclear the data i have indicates that in this year caligula does in fact disappear historians and writers of this time record he vanished some believing he really was the son of god and actually did rise to heaven to become deified others thought that he might have become mentally unstable and killed himself in some way but his death was hushed up and his body secretly disposed of right liam settled himself in the back of the cart among several bales of reeds cushioning the clay amphoras wine sloshing in containers all around him almost comfortable he looked up at the cloudless blue sky the rocking of the cart quite soothing he recalled some of maddys hasty briefing her gabbling ten to the dozen as he stumbled around behind the curtains trying to get undressed for the displacement tube but it seems that history noticeably changes from ad onwards theres some roman poet essaywriter dude called asinius who describes what sounds to me a lot like a contamination event through the curtain he heard maddy flicking quickly across printed pages ah yeah here it is during the feast and celebrations of minerva the skies above those gathered in the amphitheatre opened and vast chariots descended to the city from which stepped messengers of the gods made to look as mortal men you think those were time travellers duh he heard her snort well obviously they certainly werent gods or messengers of the gods even more rustling of papers since we had that third small ripple a few minutes ago thereve been more data changes its like this contamination is scaling up gradually theyd all taken a look outside after the last one from a distance manhattan still looked the same the same skyline skyscrapers aeroplanes in the sky traffic rumbling over the bridge above but liam suspected sal would find a million little differences in times square now weve got varying accounts of caligulas reign and not a great deal more about these messengers though its as if theyve been purged from history rather clumsily or edited out somehow which i think makes them pretty damned suspicious eh liam had his shoes and socks off and was trying on the flipflops sal had got for him uhh but generally it seems the same sort of account of caligulas reign over the next seventeen years its not a good period for rome caligula seems to neglect his job as ruler there are food shortages water shortages he gets really unpopular with the people although oddly it seems caligulas version of a onegod religion catches on this all goes on until he vanishes mysteriously supposedly going to heaven hes succeeded by an emperor lepidus who encourages caligulas take on christianity the trident of neptune becomes the symbol of the faith and the faith later becomes known as julianity after his family name julii in it becomes known as the holy church juliani liam emerged from behind the curtains wearing his tunic and flipflops maddy was studying a clipboard of printouts how do i look like an idiot as usual she smiled looked back down at her notes so im going to send you back to ad the year in which hes supposed to have blasted off to heaven theres no month given but theres a suggestion its sometime in the late summer months because theres a reference to poor harvests and stuff so liam well make that year our first port of call ok aye liam he jerked awake whuh he realized hed dozed off and left a damp patch of drool down his own shoulder the warm sun and the gentle rocking of the cart had seduced him into slumber like some dewyeyed old codger sitting on a porch in summer you need to see this liam said bob rocking his shoulder insistently with one meaty hand liam pulled himself up from the mess of bundles of reeds and leaned over the front of the cart to the drivers seat bob i just had the weirdest creepiest dream he yawned as he spoke eyes still glued up and foggy with sleep are we there yet affirmative liam you should look liam rubbed crusts of sleep from his eyes the dusty track had become a broad avenue of cobbled stone that was the first thing he noticed the second were the broad pylons of wood lining the avenue either side each topped off with a crossbar making them tshaped oh mother mary whispered liam this is the road to rome affirmative across the tbar of each one arm nailed and lashed to each side of the horizontal bar bodies hung like overripe fruit some were recently dead some leathered and desiccated by the summer sun like withered grapes on a vine and others pecked clean to the bone carrion for crows a grisly procession that receded along with the avenue to a vanishing point in the distance and the east gates of rome chapter new york ok so it looks like liams decided to give rome a whole week maddy winked at sal hes such a tourist bob lets close the window affirmative the portal collapsed into a pinpoint of light and energy then vanished the deep hum of energy being consumed dropped away and the archway was silent once more maddy shrugged cant say i blame them i bet thats got to be a pretty cool sight he gets to see all the totally bindaas fun stuff said sal wish i got to go and see all that maddy looked at her but now you understand the price hes paying she nodded immediately feeling guilty for her thoughtless comment when are you going to tell him maddy tell him i i dont know hell figure it out eventually though wont he when he starts to look like foster i know i know and i plan to tell him long before that she clicked with a mouse and refreshed the portal dialogue box to enter the timestamp coordinates for the oneweek window keen to find something else to do to take her mind off that particular question can we start up the recharge for the oneweeker please bob important information maddy what is it one of the displacement machines power storage capacitors has just failed what oh crud that doesnt sound good it is not good well come on then bob spit it out what exactly does that mean there are six power storage units one of the six units has failed this means the maximum amount of spacetime displacement we can deploy has decreased by approximately she frowned so ok that sounds like we can still get liam and bob back right of course however with only five power capacitors drawing energy it will slow down the recharge time for the next window there is also a possibility the other capacitors may begin to be unreliable soon can we replace them affirmative it uses components that can be easily obtained from this time location any idea where i will compile and print out a components list these components can be purchased from any electronic components store i have on my database a business called geekmagnet this is where some of this field offices electronic components were originally sourced from maddy knew geekmagnet they had half a dozen stores in new york city she let out a breath phew i thought we had us a problem there we do have a problem maddy go on this component should be repaired immediately and a diagnostic run on the other remaining five capacitors if one capacitor has reached its reliable lifespan the others may also be nearing the end of theirs she turned to look at the layers of circuit boards racked one above the other in the displacement machines metal frame the thought of delving into that nest of circuitry and casually pulling out wires unsettled her it was technology way beyond her understanding way beyond messing around in the back of a pc overclocking a graphics processor or switching out the synthesis chip on a sound card can it wait until after weve got liam and bob back for safety reasons it would be advisable to replace the failed capacitor and the other five first sal sat down beside her yeah i mean what if another one of those things broke down you know she looked at maddy while a windows open sal is correct there is now a decreased reliability margin a second capacitor failure could be imminent during the opening of a window this would be dangerous the fluctuation of energy could cause the portal window to contract suddenly or affect the displacement attenuation computerbob was talking about the possibility of losing a hand or foot or a head even of being turned into human lasagne or worse than either of those being lost in chaos space if i start pulling out circuit boards youll talk me through it right bob maddy looked again at the rack of circuit boards if i go in there and start you know if i break the thing of course maddy i will supply detailed instructions i recommend you move my camera closer to the displacement machine so that i can observe what you are doing right she looked at the rack of the displacement machine then curled her lips anxiously ive never even looked round the back of this thing let alone pulled out boards and messed about inside it youll be fine said sal i will be right here for you maddy she looked at her simpsons wristwatch homers finger was pointing at a space roughly halfway between five and six the nearest geekmagnet store over on the upper west side was probably already closed by now the stores tended to open early but close about halffive they could get the components tomorrow tuesday they had to get what they needed early before the first plane hit before new york ground to a halt rendered immobile by the horror of unfolding events maddy turned to the webcam in front of her bob you better print me up our shopping list then well get what we need first thing tomorrow morning chapter new york whoa said the young man behind the counter he had a steaming cup of starbucks coffee in a cardboard carrycradle in one hand we like just opened up here she noticed it wasnt starbucks though the brand name was solvoventus the logo wavy lines like the sea or something similar yeah i know but were in a real hurry theyd watched one of the stores employees pull up the window shutters snap the lights on inside and had generously given him another thirty seconds to wake up before striding in maddy handed a sheet of paper over the counter can you check the items on this list see what youve got in stock he put down his paper coffee cup grabbed the printout and looked it over briefly he scratched at curly ginger hair pulled back into a hair tie the ponytail looked like a large puffball stuck on the back of his head he scanned the list of components for a full minute what the hell are you making here maddy wafted her hand impatiently the plastic name tag on his pale blue shirt read ned were kind of in a hurry ned she offered him a clipped smile dont mean to be rude or anything ned didnt seem offended in the slightest looks like some kind of energy storage and delivery regulator some real beefy ninja transformer is that what youre making he looked up from the list you pimping up a transformer this a school project or something yeah kind of well lemmesee he tapped at the keyboard on the counter id say we got pretty much all of those items in stock he looked up at maddy admiringly i mean not much call for those things on their own most people dont even bother making stuff from scratch any more you know its easier to buy whatever they want from walmart already he looked back down at the screen sucking on the end of a biro as he scanned the stock listings maddy looked at her watch you got those components in cos if not weve got to hike across to your other store which is like a real pain in pretty sure we got these he said tapping at the keyboard as he entered the last of the items on maddys list into their system yeah reckon thats all cool he tapped the keyboard one last time and a printer behind the counter spooled out a picking list yo ganesh he called out double doors behind ned cracked open and a young man wearing a turban and a thick beard stuck his head out ned handed him the picking list you do this one man dude im stocktaking ned turned his back on maddy and sal there was a hurried whispered exchange between the pair of them then finally ganesh nodded wearily and muttered you owe me dude he smiled at the girls and gave a friendly wave five minutes ladies ok thanks the door swung to ned all pointy elbows and bobbing adams apple grinned selfconsciously at them so nice day isnt it he cracked slender fingers and knuckle joints one after the other a sound that went right through maddy she found herself wincing with each crack it sounded like a wishbone being parted sure nice day sal replied uh so either of you two girls got a you know a boyfriend or something he shrugged and laughed skittishly i mean why not ask right because lifes way too short to just like skip around the important questions sal chuckled at that cos if youre both like single me and ganesh could take you ladies to see shrek or something he grinned his eyes bulging with hope make up sort of like a double date me and ganeshll pay for the movie tickets of course dinner though he pursed his lips thoughtfully i reckon we gotta go halves on that unless you girls are good for a taco or something cheap i reckon we could cover that maddy looked at sal taken aback by his forthright manner errrrr sound good his eyebrows flickered up and down and a grin spread across his lips his best go at a seductive smile whadya say tempted huh just then reality fluttered gently a mild sensation that made maddy feel giddy she grasped the edge of the counter to steady herself are you ok miss maddys eyes focused on ned again only it wasnt quite the same ned his shirt was bright red his ginger hair was cut short almost an armyissue buzz cut no name badge on his chest either she noticed just the stores logo a masculine fist holding a bolt of lightning you ok miss sal was kicking her foot gently nudging her out of the young mans line of sight uh yeah im fine just uh just a bit dizzy is all chapter new york computerbobs singlelens webcam eye regarded the archway wholly still and silent except for the soft hum of a dozen pc fans and the gentle rhythmic chug of the filtration pump on the activated growth tube in the back room a tap dripped into a basin in the toilet cubicle and overhead the brick roof rumbled softly as a commuter train far above trundled along the bridges tracks towards manhattan a useful chance to housekeep compress files purge data that was redundant with nothing to have to listen to via the desk mic or observe through the webcam he could get on with a growing todo list of queued tasks computerbob temporarily blocked the external data feed it was also a good opportunity to defragment the hard drives he initiated the various housecleaning processes it left his collective of twelve linked processors with clock time to spare down time think time code fetched acted on and returned thoughts computerbob could certainly feel the absence of the missing part of his intelligence the fuzzylogic function removed from the path of his decision matrix the organic component that thumbnailsized nub of brain matter such a difference that small nugget of flesh made computerbob suspected there was an emotion file for this somewhere on his g drive this feeling of mental castration of missing something he once had fuzzy logic no free will he tried to recognize that feeling much harder without the organic part of his intelligence but still possible like comparing audiowave files every thought had its own distinct shape computerbob was running comparisons through his folder of stored emotions when something far more important caught his attention and halted that process in its tracks a single tachyon particle in the middle of the archway within a dozen thousandths of a second the number of particles proliferated to millions warning tachyon particles detected the middle of the archway pulsed with arriving energy and a gust of displaced air sent papers and sweet wrappers skittering across the desk in front of computerbobs webcam eye a sphere of shimmering churning elsewhere appeared ten feet in diameter and hovered above the floor the webcam captured every swirling detail through the portal what appeared to be a dark room beyond with winking lights and holographic displays rows of what could be tall tubes glowing a soothing peach colour then six dark outlines six figures standing side by side now calmly stepping forward into the pulsating sphere one after the other they emerged from the hovering portal and dropped down on to the concrete floor into identical postures of crouched alert readiness six naked entirely hairless figures four of them male and two female the males each seven feet tall had broad frames carrying an almost implausibly muscular bulk the two females athletic were a foot shorter and looked far more agile but still rippling with lean muscle beneath milkwhite skin all of them were pale covered in babysmooth flesh unmarked by the lines creases scars and blemishes acquired through the course of any ordinary life one of the males stood erect slowly sweeping his greyeyed gaze round the archway information the field office is empty a second male nodded in agreement his face almost but not quite identical all forehead thick brow and square jawline they looked like perfect sculptures carved from granite affirmative we should assign temporary mission identifiers the first one said and verbal adoptive call signs he looked at the others i am alphaone i will be called abel alphatwo said the second male support unit verbal call sign bruno alphathree said one of the females cassandra alphafour damien alphafive elijah alphasix fred the others looked at six fred is genderincompatible said abel you are female pick another name six frowned it is short for frederica pick another name she nodded obediently faith acceptable said abel he turned to look directly at computerbobs webcam a nearfield data handshake two operating systems recognizing each other acknowledged abels thick brow knotted where is your team his deep voice filled the cavernous silence computerbobs cursor blinked on the screen silently system ai said abel please state the last known location of your team members the cursor blinked and finally began to skitter forward along the command line you are an unauthorized visitor to this field office i am unable to provide any information all information is confidential system going into lockdown system ai i have a higher authority level code abort lockdown please transmit authority identification code affirmative abels eyes blinked as he retrieved a string of data and streamed it wirelessly to computerbob the cursor blinked silently on the screen a full minute passing as computerbob appraised the alphanumeric string and finally conceded that it quite correctly was a code he couldnt ignore identification code is valid abel stepped towards the row of monitors cool eyes surveying the messy desk the scraps of paper with handwritten memos and doodles on them the empty pizza boxes and crushed drinks cans finally his gaze rested on the small glinting lens of the webcam perched on the top of the monitor in the middle of the desk system ai his deep voice rumbled please state the last known location of your team members location of team members is as follows chapter new york jesus this is beginning to get very weird said maddy she looked around the busy street she could see dozens of things that werent quite right billboards here and there advertising products she didnt quite understand some of the cars on the street had odd profiles much longer fronts and bonnets and no boot at the rear almost like drag racers pedestrians many looking normal but some had shimmered and changed and were wearing garments that looked tidier formal even and there was definitely a skew towards warmer colours red purple burgundy its never been like this before she muttered lots and lots of little waves sal nodded its weird all right we need to hurry back maddy looked down at their plastic shopping bag full of electronic components before a time ripple changes what we just bought into something else sal giggled nervously fruit or something yeah that would be odd the iphone buzzed in maddys shirt pocket it stopped her in her tracks whats up asked sal my iphone she said fishing it out of her pocket i just got a text the thing hadnt functioned as a phone since shed been recruited it played her music she carried it with her everywhere as a keepsake a memento a reminder of another life but it certainly wasnt a phone any more its not possible the only people who had her number were family and friends from a phone number and account not due to be activated for another eight years she looked at the screen she had a text from an unknown source maddy emergency return to field office immediately its bob she said bob sal frowned computer bob hes never texted before has he i didnt know he could she dialled the call number back it was a brooklyn code it was also engaged he must have tapped into the local cell network figured out how to access my phone shed left her nokia back at the archway after all liam was in rome no one was going to call them whats the matter asked sal what does he want maddy tapped out a text message back to him just gonna find out sal looked up at the sky shading her eyes the world trade center was still there if this timeline wasnt already changed enough then the first plane was due to impact with it shortly we need to hurry back computerbobs webcam lens observed the dim archway it observed the dark outline of two of the support units both moving through the shadows like ghosts one of them over by the shutter was studying the hairthin strip of daylight along the ground at the bottom watching for the shifting shadows of movement outside the other one was carefully picking through the clutter on the desk even without a webcam computerbob would have known they were both close by he was picking up their wireless idents alphathree alphafour and the wordless exchange of unencrypted chatter between all six of them alphafive proceeding north along th avenue towards west th street eta on grid reference three minutes thirtyfive seconds alphatwo grid reference correlates to business address jupiterelectro supplies alphaone confirmed information targets two only one caucasian female aged one asian female aged access data profiles for images alphathree information have acquired recently taken images of younger target bobs webcam could see the female support unit the one who had decided to call herself cassandra she held maddys nokia in her hand the soft glow of the screen lighting up her babysmooth dolllike face as she thumbed through pages of lowresolution photographs maddy had carelessly decided to take of herself and the others alphathree broadcasting image her eyes blinked alphaone data received all units update profile data of target saleena vikram with new image information it is possible her appearance will have changed since deployment computerbob also had a hard drive full of images of the girls of liam of becks and his fleshy counterpart bob everything his little webcam eye had seen recorded and stored over the last few months it was invaluable visual data he could should be making available to this team of support units their authority was unquestionable his cooperation was nonnegotiable command lines deep inside the quadprocessors of all twelve linked pcs thrummed insistently along silicon pathways lines of code barking like guard dogs yapping at a perimeter fence compelling him to assist these support units in their quest to zero in on maddy sal and liam he had already done that though followed his programming told them where they could locate the girls there was no command line however telling him what he couldnt also do warn them help them chapter new york alphaone abel stood at the intersection scanning the street thick with people in their smart clothes hot and flustered on their way to work jackets draped over clammy arms rolledup shirt sleeves and rolledup newspapers coffees in plastic cups breakfast bagels sweating away in paper bags abel cocked his head momentarily distracted from his missions parameters fascinated by these curiously busy busy people how different they looked from people in his time there was an energy about them a vibrancy as if all the little things they did actually mattered so unlike humans from his time those were slower more economical even lethargic in their actions as if movement itself had a criminal cost attached to it there was a phrase for the way humans behaved in his time a phrase that occurred again and again across the digisphere in media streams human inertia mankind had given up articles had been written and published on all digimedia articles about how the world was too far gone to save now how there was little left for humanity to do but calmly face whatever fate awaited it as the worlds ecosystem collapsed but these eager humans pushing past him on either side desperate to get to their jobs on time these humans seemed almost like a different species of animal entirely alive energetic hopeful alphasix visual contact established abel brushed away those thoughts thoughts were for humans he had something far more certain far more precise he had instructions alphaone confirm location faith could see their faces on the far side of broadway heading south walking very quickly anxiously weaving through the pavement traffic against the flow alphasix targets on broadway abel they are heading towards your current location request permission to intercept she waited patiently for several seconds keeping pace with the girls on the opposite side of the trafficjammed avenue her bare feet slapped the pavement attracting the curious glances of passersby perhaps that or the fact that she was wearing nothing but a plastic anorak and jogging bottoms shed wrenched from the body of the female human shed encountered a little earlier their necks were surprisingly easy to snap such fragile things really humans alphaone permission granted engage and terminate confirmed said faith under her breath she stepped into the road a little too hastily in front of a bus just as an intersection traffic light behind her flipped from red to green the bus knocked her flat and immediately lurched to a halt with the loud hiss of brakes a moment later still assessing whether the heavy impact had damaged her in any significant way she was looking up at a circle of concerned faces staring down at her just stay still someone insisted someone call an ambulance julii someone cursed the woman just stepped out the bus driver looked round at the gathered faces she just stepped out right in front of me it wasnt my fault faith sat up stiffly you should stay still cried a largeframed woman im triagetrained you should stay still until a triage mobilus arrives i am fine she replied calmly a policeman pushed his way through the gathering crowd and crouched down beside her best do what she says and stay put his dark purple uniform quivered ever so slightly the round silver badge on his chest morphed into a metal spreadwinged eagle faith watched him call the incident in on his radio then listen to the unintelligible sound of the controllers crackling reply theres help on its way people faith noticed the mattblack grip of the cops firearm in its holster riding high on his left hip not required she said reaching for it that will help jahulla whats happened over there asked sal she stopped and pointed maddy turned to look she could see in the middle of broadway a growing knot of people gathered round the front of a bus some poor sucker just got squished by the look of it she grabbed sals hand come on somebody just got unlucky weve got to get back home before everything changes before theres no williamsburg bridge no subway theres more changes coming said sal theyre coming i know i can feel it it was like an almost constant vibration now tickling through their feet as if they were standing on some sort of footmassaging mat change after change each one causing a tiny piece of reality to adjust and all around them minor things flickering winking out of existence winking into existence or morphing into some alternativehistory variation she saw the large toshiba led screen looming over times square shimmer and become a much wider display that spread out either side of the building it was mounted on on its longer screen she saw what appeared to be mechanized chariots racing each other round an oval race track sal look at that at that moment they heard a piercing shriek from the crowd what now the crowd gathered round the front of the bus scattered like pigeons startled by a handclap they both saw a pale and slender baldheaded figure get to her feet a young woman in an orange anorak standing in the middle of broadway entirely alone now looking directly at them my god that looks just like becks the young woman slowly raised her arm for a creepy second maddy imagined it was a ghostly visitation of becks pointing accusingly at her some scroogelike apparition come to haunt her in the middle of times square then several loud cracks filled the air like the snap of a bullwhip and the shop window right behind them exploded into granules of glass that cascaded on to the pavement maddy stared agape at the shattered window while the rest of times square seemed to register a gun had been fired and collectively dropped to the ground shaddyah shes shooting at us yelled sal what the pale young woman began to stride towards them maddy could see she was barefooted she raised her arm again and fired another three shots at them this time maddy felt her hair whisked by a bullet passing right beside her ear oh crud run screamed sal grabbing her hand and pulling her run chapter new york the pavement was clogged with people either cowering on the ground or scooting for cover maddy glanced over her shoulder the young woman almost certainly a female support unit was weaving her way across logjammed lanes of traffic impatient with her progress she leaped up on to the long bonnet of an ornately decorated car gold oak leaves and murals all down the glistening panels to runningboards at the side the driver at the vehicles rear gaped wideeyed at the sight of the firearm in her hand she leaped gracefully across from the bonnet of one car to the next like a girl playing stepping stones across a babbling stream oh crud gasped maddy shes coming straight for us the pavement was impassable with people crouching nervously on their haunches in here hissed sal dragging maddy towards a pair of glass doors that slid open for them what maddy looked around her they were inside a large store a blast of cool air from an ac unit hit them from above it was only eightforty in the morning and the place was already heaving with tourists shopping for mementoes brass figurines of naked male torsos faux marble busts of augustlooking elders cheap plastic gadgets that maddy realized she couldnt identify only right now business was a suspended tableau dozens of faces were turned their way julii was that ballistafire i just heard someone called out maddy wrenched her hand free of sals well get trapped in here sal pointed across lanes of goodsdisplay spindles towards the glare of daylight streaming into the store on the far side over there an exit ok right yeah they began to push their way past shoppers momentarily frozen and confused by events maddy leading the way just then they heard a horn sounding followed by several more that suddenly were choked and silent followed almost immediately by the crackle of gunfire praetorians are here its like war out there shouted someone standing by the glass doors opening on to broadway a man with oriental features and a cheerfully coloured tunic grasped maddys arm is this gang war collegia uh yeah its war just stay inside she pulled his hand off and pushed past him the gunfire was intensifying whats going on out there it sounded like the entire nypd no not them some other form of police had arrived was laying down a barrage of small arms fire all that response for one young woman she was about to say something about that to sal when sal tugged at her from behind down she squealed uh what sal pointed past her over her shoulder towards the glow of daylight theyd been weaving their way towards look maddy turned to look at the double doors of the exit a solitary figure was silhouetted by rays of morning sunlight streaming over rounded bulky shoulders of sinew and muscle like the young woman it was bald and pale wearing an unzipped hooded tunic and bright blue beach shorts several sizes too small oh my god she ducked down with sal and they continued to observe the figure through a display rack of plastic cases with covers showing the scarred faces of wrestlers no gladiators hang on is that bob thats not bob whispered sal but it looks like him its not him though maddy felt her breath thicken a whistling noise that in complete silence would have given them away in a heartbeat she cursed herself for not picking up her inhaler on the way out earlier theyre support units she gasped thats what they are another figure joined the first another male just as tall wide and muscular as the first it was holding a gun in each hand hands that were spattered with dark dots of blood it silently passed one of the weapons to the first unit maddy realized the crackle of gunfire had now ceased oh god sal i think they just killed all the police guys outside she glanced back at where theyd come from the entrance to broadway and there was the young woman silhouetted against the daylight glow of the double doors a perfect statue gun in one hand head slowly swivelling studying the shoppers and staff cowering amid display racks and aisles of cheap tourist goods oh crud now we really are well trapped one of the male support units took a step forward into the store everyone please leave his deep voice boomed nobody dared move he fired a single shot into the floor everyone please leave this building now or you will be executed there was an immediate stirring of movement across the store people hastily getting to their feet dropping baskets of forgotten bargains and making for the exits as they streamed anxiously out past the support units their bald heads panned quickly one way then the other examining each persons face as they hurried out the female grasped the wrist of someone leaving a young asian girl she pulled her closer then placed a hand under her chin to turn her head towards her the girl whimpered and squirmed as the support unit quickly studied her face she tossed her aside a moment later negative id she called to the other two theyre after us specifically us after me and sal outside they could hear the distant wailing of yet more police horns approaching times square was unsettlingly quiet a thousand or more people crouched behind rubbish bins and newspaper vending machines in shop doorways and peeking out through store windows all wondering what to do wondering what was going to happen next and faintly very faintly maddy could hear the deep drone of an approaching aeroplane we know you are hiding in here said the support unit in shorts please reveal yourselves to us and you will not be harmed maddy looked at sal she shook her head silently right theyll kill us we know you are in this building there is no way out maddy felt her chest heaving feeling tight getting lightheaded with growing panic she could see sal was no better trembling like a yard dog on a winters morning who are they madelaine carter saleena vikram a deep voice boomed please reveal yourselves the girls exchanged a roundeyed glance who sent them without any further verbal warning they moved as one all three of them striding forward into the store each picking a different aisle of goods to walk down maddy and sal dropped down to their hands and knees which way mouthed sal maddy looked around they were in an aisle stocked with swivel displays of cds and dvds or something like that nowhere for them to hide nothing to crouch beneath she looked down the far end of their lane there was a service counter with a till and behind it a door that looked like it led to either a stockroom or some sort of staff restroom she shuffled along the floor on her hands and knees towards the counter sal following her in the very next aisle to theirs she could hear the slap of heavy bare feet on lino one of the male support units maddy picked up the pace shuffling along as quickly and as quietly as she could her ragged breath was huffing out too loudly like some faltering fairground steam engine she only hoped the growing deep rumble of the approaching jet plane was covering it up the aeroplane not the one surely this was history that had been altered enough they were nearly at the end the swivel racks of cases sporting famous gurning gladiators had given way to racks of plastic toys swords spears tridents she was beginning to believe they might just be able to sneak out of their aisle and hop round the back of the counter before one of the support units turned into this aisle and spotted them when she caught the strong scent of stale sweating meat she looked up from her dirty hands splayed on the floor and saw two equally dirty bare feet in front of her maddys gaze rose as her heart sank drifting up a pair of milkwhite shins smooth featureless knees on to the frayed dangling fringe of some old orange hikers anorak it reeked of stale urine and mouldering tobacco maddy could only imagine the fate of the hapless vagrant whod owned it please stay where you are madelaine carter a soft not unpleasant feminine voice maddys eyes rested on a familiar impassive face a face that could have been convincingly introduced to her as beckss slightly older twin under different circumstances look pplease she whispered wewere just faith cocked her head her grey eyes bright with intelligent curiosity she seemed to admire what she saw cringing at her feet it is a pity she said softly a hint of regret on her lips then she looked up for the others over the aisle abel damien her voice barked coldly i have located the targets request authorization to terminate them behind them maddy heard the slap of bare feet she turned and saw the two male support units standing at the other end of the aisle the one wearing shorts hesitated its thick brow furrowed with confusion at the increasing volume of that deep rumble it turned to look around trying to make some sense of the approaching noise maddy saw the look on sals face thats not the aeroplane chapter new york they had no more than a second perhaps two to realize what could happen to them their eyes met in mutual understanding a time wave a big one not good truth was there was no knowing what reality any wave was going to leave behind more specifically there was no knowing what kind of mass if any was going to end up wanting to occupy the very same space that they were both occupying in the archway with the field switched on they were entirely protected from any massintersections brought about by a reality shift however outside of the field it was a lottery a time wave could leave a person merged fused with anything that was attempting to occupy the very same space the likelihood of that varied of course on an open rolling field in the middle of some remote rural county it was far less likely but here inside a cluttered gift shop looking out on to the beating heart of one of the busiest cities in the world where humankind congregated most densely for example a place like this new york thats where reality really had the most fun and games reinventing itself whatever course history had taken this bay on the east coast of america a place that was once an indian settlement then a colonial outpost then a thriving trading port and finally a metropolis this place was always likely to produce a densely populated alternative version of itself in the wake of a fullblown time wave and the last place they ought to be when a wave hit was here inside a building of all places sal we need to was all maddy had time to utter before the wave was upon them it went dark as if the sun had gone out unlike sal it was maddys first time directly experiencing the effect of swimming in fluid reality as it rippled past her wrapped round her presenting fleeting images of infinite possibilities she screamed it came out of her mouth sounding like a deep timedilated moan like the protracted mournful song of some distant whale carried across a hundred miles of water her ears were filled with her own weird voice and a roar like that of a tornado not the roar of wind though but a billion other human voices female and male young and old born and unborn conscious entities crying in hellish torment and all sharing the same fleeting few seconds of consciousness a shared awareness of lives stolen away from them possible lives that could have been but now would never be lived of children babies loved ones who would never have a chance to exist it was a billion screams like her own stretched out and deep and full of grief anger and fear if hell had a voice it was this awful protracted roaring wail of tortured souls then it snapped off gone the dark swirling tornado of liquid reality was suddenly a placid milky whiteness featureless utterly blank oh god she could see her hand in front of her face but that was all oh god im stuck in chaos spa maddy sals voice the ghost of a whisper she saw a grey shape beside her faint sal sal she became aware of other gentle noises all around her a woodpeckers jackhammer tap far above them the echoing cry of a coot the fidgeting life of a deep undisturbed wood the gentle stir of leaves the creak of swaying branches were in some sort of forest maddy sal again where are we she realized the milky white was nothing but a thick morning mist cold heavy and damp against her skin hanging in dense pools above them she could see it was thinner and saw the pencilline grey streaks of crisscrossing branches swaying gently she reached out grabbed sals hand and pulled her towards her a finger to her lips shhhh sal nodded wherever they were they were not alone they heard the rustle of movement very close instinctively maddy squatted down crouching lower into the thick pooling mist around them she noticed the broad leaves of a large fern swaying gently beside her and ducked down beneath its feathered leaves pulling sal down with her call in your identification and condition a deep voice boomed out of the mist alphasix faith i am undamaged the female support unit alphafour i am also unharmed a long silence then maddy heard the swish of someone pushing through foliage nearby the leaden crack of dry dead wood beneath a heavy and carelessly planted foot i am not picking up alphatwos signal said the female faith he may be damaged that is a lower priority the targets will still be in the immediate vicinity spread out and search something brushed against the fern they were huddled beneath maddy felt a long thick twig under her bottom shift as the weight of a foot settled on the other end looking up through gaps in the leaf swaying above her face she could see the female unit the beckslookalike her grey sentinel eyes slowly panning the mist around her like a guard on a watchtower my god shes right there shes right there maddy held her wheezing breath and screwed up her eyes she was absolutely certain that any second now a hand was going to reach down and push that fern leaf aside that icecold voice was going to calmly call out her discovery to the other two maddy could feel her chest collapsing with a growing panic a faint memory skipped through her mind of her and her cousin julian both much younger they were playfighting wrestling he had her in a hold her arms trapped by her side and his dead weight lying across her chest shed been squirming panicking squealing and hed genuinely thought she was just playing around until shed started screaming panic like that breathless panic hold your breath maddy hold it for seconds that felt agonizingly like minutes becks remained where she was scouring the milky mist with her piercing eyes then finally maddy felt that twig shift again relieved of the weight on its end as the support unit lifted her bare foot and took a step then another away from them she slowly faded into the mist until she was an unrecognizable blur another grey pillar just as easily another tree trunk then she was finally gone they listened to the sound of movement of all three support units receding in different directions the careless echoing crack of twigs and cones the swish of bramble and undergrowth casually pushed aside the still forest slowly stirred to life after them a disapproving shake of its head at such noisy and clumsy intruders maddy hoped they were far enough away not to hear her wheeze like a blacksmiths bellows as she finally eased her breath out dizzy and lightheaded she quickly drew in another one shaddyah whispered sal i thought we were soooo dead me too the thump rustle and crack of distant movement grew steadily quieter as the units moved further away we got to maddy grabbed at another breath weve got to get back to the archway but wont they expect us to do that we need help she looked at sal we really need bob and we really need to get back to the archway before they figure that out too come on maddy got to her feet then realized she hadnt a clue which direction to start off in which way sal looked up at the faint canopy of branches and leaves above them she pointed to a dull creamcoloured disc still relatively low in the morning sky playing hide and seek with them behind the mistshrouded canopy of leaves and branches so very easy to miss the sun she said rises in the east doesnt it yup so that way maddy nodded to their left that way then should take us to the east river they began to move slowly cautiously sal one step ahead of maddy picking a path across the woodland floor that managed to avoid their stepping on the kind of gnarled brittle dead wood that would crack like a gunshot they made their way through the wood in almost complete silence for what seemed like an hour but in all likelihood was no more than a few minutes finally maddy thought she heard the gentle sound of the tidal lapping of water ahead of them the ground beneath their feet stopped being a sponge of decaying leaves forest moss and fir cones and became firmer harder the cool mist was beginning to thin with the morning suns warmth working on it and soon they could see past the narrow waists of forestedge saplings to a small cove and beyond that the broad flat surface of the east river sal settled against the base of the slender trunk of a young tree maddy joined her and they studied the shingle and placid lapping waterline in front of them the soothing draw and hiss of low tide playing with pebbles theres nothing said sal quietly new yorks just a wilderness she shivered and its colder how come maddy shook her head she had no real idea maybe this was a world with far fewer humans in it less people less pollution less methane less carbon less global warming or more likely given how chilly it felt autumn cold perhaps this was a world with absolutely no humans at all in it it was a wellknown fact among ecologists that if you took humankind out of the equation you could easily knock three or four degrees off planet earths temperature anyway sal was right it was much cooler no humans nice idea that look whats that said sal suddenly she pointed along the shingle cove what over there maddy squinted into the haze at what looked like a large chunk of driftwood a log carried up on a high tide and left stranded its a boat maddy pushed her specs up her nose actually sal was right i think its a kayak or canoe or something so much for no humans then chapter formerly new york she studied the twisted form merged into the trunk of the tree it certainly explained the reason why alphatwos ident signal had suddenly ceased to register the support units head appeared to be buried within the tree the rest of his body dangled lifelessly slumped against the base of the trunk it looked oddly like hed been attempting to charge the tree head first like an enraged bull and the tree had simply decided to swallow him up to his neck she cocked her head fascinated at the glutinous and fleshy bubbling where the units neck intersected with the bark the instantaneous merging of trunk skull and the computer inside at a molecular level would have instantly reduced alphatwos head to a meaningless pulp faith sensed the wireless signals of the other two support units drawing closer approaching through the thinning mist abel emerged first his eyes immediately rested on alphatwos body that is to be expected he said calmly the area has a high mass density there was a significant probability of intersection faith nodded agreed alphafour damien emerged from the mist his eyes momentarily on their colleague before reporting in to the other two i have not located the targets they appear to have successfully evaded us abel nodded we must reacquire them immediately their three minds began to exchange data electronically a bluetooth committee meeting in the silent woodland space between them all three support units frozen like statues absorbed in a collective reassessment of variables options and mission priorities a meeting of minds that resulted in a decision less than ten seconds later they will attempt to return to their field office said abel the other two nodded this way said abel he turned on his heel and had just begun to force his way through a thick nest of thorny brambles when he stopped ahead of him stood twelve of them humans primitive humans the wood seemed to hold its breath in silent expectation as the indians slowly spread out bows drawn and ready to use charcoal paint smeared round their eyes and across the bridges of their noses the whites of their eyes almost seemed to glow in the gloom beneath the canopy of leaves these are not our targets said abel one of the indians replied with a barked challenge a language of guttural croaks and hard consonants he raised a tamahaken of wood and flint a clear gesture of warning for abel and the others to back up the way theyd come faith drew up alongside abel her curious mind cataloguing these strangelooking humans their heads were also bald except for a crest of hair in the middle and they were naked their skin a rich copper colour adorned with tattoos of swirling dark blue patterns i have no data on these she said to abel a significant time contamination has occurred abel looked at her but this is not a concern of ours she took another casual step forward curious wanting to get a closer look at these oddlooking humans when a nervous young hand released twine the wood echoed with the vibrating hum of a bows drawstring and the sound of a fleshy thwack faith glanced down at the feathered end of an arrow protruding through the grubby orange nylon of her anorak she cocked her head as she looked down at it an arrow she announced matteroffactly as she yanked its bloody barbed tip firmly from her chest then she raised her pistol and fired you hear that said sal she stopped paddling that was a gun maddy pulled the wooden oar out of the water and rested it across her thighs a moment later they heard the distant crack of another single shot echoing from the receding mistshrouded shoreline she swallowed nervously thats them i guess they came across the owner of this canoe who what are they maddy theyve got to be support units sal theyre bob and becks or very similar but why are they after us maddy shook her head i dont know maybe we caused it what do you mean that message the message we sent forward to waldstein god sal might be right you think it might have been i dunno intercepted by someone sal said nothing her eyes on maddys jeeez she watched the shoreline they were leaving behind the mist dissolving before her eyes someone knows about us sal someone who knows where we are when we are maddy do you think the roman contamination is anything to do with this i dunno it happens at the same time it cant be a coincidence can it maddy i dont know i just she screwed her eyes up i dont know anything sal im just running running scared like you frustrated she banged a fist against the side of the canoe its fragile wooden frame flexed alarmingly just give me a moment to think here ok sorry maddy they drifted in silence for a minute sal whys someone sent a bunch of support units after us i mean why what have do you really think thats what they are maybe theyre come on you saw them too what do you think sal nodded silently they did look like bob and becks they drifted for a while the water gently slapping the taut hide like the palm of a hand on the skin of a bodhran ive got no idea what this is about but if those really are support units were freakin dead already sal i mean it we havent got a chance here she picked her paddle up we need the others what are we going to do we need to get bob back that was it that was her plan thats all she had to offer right now he can fight them but theres like three of them maddy he cant fight them all by hims thats his problem ok she turned round and squinted at the far side of the river where home brooklyn had been only ten minutes ago it was yet more dense woodland if it wasnt for the sun rising into the morning sky indicating which way was east she would have been hopelessly lost the canoe had drifted in several lazy circles since theyd stopped paddling and one shoreline looked exactly like the other lets just get back over there see if we can find the archway that alone was going to be a challenge it was all trees and thick brambles and somewhere somewhere in the middle of all of that provided it wasnt buried or so overgrown by moss or briar they were hopefully going to be able to find their shambolic molehill of red bricks hopefully sal offered her a supportive smile im glad im with you you usually figure something out maddy do i do i really figure stuff out or have i just been lucky so far maddy returned the gesture with a shrug of bravado well i guess thats why im the boss right she looked back over sals shoulders at the hump of woodland that was once manhattan and hoped there werent any more canoes lying around waiting to be used she dipped her paddle into the water and the canoe began to slowly pull round in the other direction come on sal we should get back to the archway as quick as we can she was going to add before they do but it seemed an unnecessary thing to say and saying it was almost like inviting bad luck to come knocking at their front door yeah right like dont say it and it just wont happen if only life could be that straightforward chapter formerly new york ten minutes later they had beached the canoe on the far side of the river as they walked along the shoreline looking warily up at the edge of the wood to their left sal couldnt help thinking they were going to be jumped by screaming savages at any moment or worse hey sal said maddy remember those weirdlooking reptile people an edgy laugh theyre exactly what i was trying not to think about right now the mistake her mistake that had bumped liam back to the late cretaceous had produced an alternate present in which homo sapiens had never even got a lookin in their place were lean hominids with elongated heads descendants of a species of therapod that had managed to survive they too had developed to a similar level as the humans who lived here now spears huts round hide and woodframed rafts but theyd been quite terrifying to look at the stuff of nightmares it was an alternative history sal was more than glad theyd managed to snuff out they wandered along the shingle for a while careful quiet steps as they listened to the woodland birds calling to each other and the gentle hiss of stirring branches even with most of the morning haze burned away and the sun finding its strength there was still an autumn coolness in the air sal stopped sal she looked across at the forestcovered hump of manhattan on the far side trying to judge from the sweep of the river heading out towards the atlantic whether they were standing roughly where the williamsburg bridge used to cross i think this is it what do you think maddy wrinkled her nose and scowled at the shoreline across the water it all looks kind of the same to me you sure sal sal thought she recognized the large sweep of the brooklyn side and the tapering end of manhattan she shook her head not really they turned away from the river stepping up a gentle sloping shoreline up shingle and silt that finally turned to dry sand crested with tufts of coarse grass ahead of them the edge of dense woodland invited them to enter just like mirkwood said maddy isnt it sal shrugged mirkwood meant nothing to her maddy grimaced i really hate woods particularly thick gnarly ones they stepped under the lowhanging branches of a chestnut tree and into the wood the sun was fully up and about its business now and shone in slanting shafts down through the leaves dappling the forest floor with brushdabs of light that shifted endlessly across the dead wood dried cones and undergrowth maddy cursed as a cluster of stinging nettles brushed against her arms aghh i wouldnt mind if history swept these vicious plants away she rubbed her arm vigorously sal you sure its up here i didnt say i was sure i said i think it might be out of sight of the defining curve of the river they were now just walking up an incline through a thick forest they could be absolutely anywhere they could be within a couple of dozen yards of the archway and walk straight past the thing maddy estimated they must be about a hundred yards or so into the wood by now if the general shape of the new york estuary hadnt changed too much in the last two thousand years and sal had picked the right point for them to head uphill into the woods then it had to be close by although looking at the foliage ahead of her maddy couldnt see anything that looked like a termite mound of red bricks sal im sorry she said sighing i really thought we were in the right place dont worry well just go back down to the river and get our bearings again sal shook her head no jahulla no im right im sure were in the correct place she looked around them it was all dense foliage she pushed aside creepers and vines that looped down from low branches yanked angrily at them here somewhere come on lets go back down and try again sal picked up a stick and used it to thrash at the nettles and brambles sal im not wrong she hacked at the foliage decapitating nettles sending leaves and stalks fluttering sal stop it she stopped turned slowly to look at maddy she slumped down to the ground exhausted this is shock said maddy posttraumatic shock she joined her reached out and took the stick from her hands we need to catch our breath sal stay calm yeah sal was looking past her sal you and me well go back down to the river and get our bearings again ok right maddy offered her a hand and pulled her to her feet well find it sal easy as easypeas she tossed the stick behind her into the remaining thicket of nettles and brambles only to be rewarded with a metallic clang and rattle they both spun round a veil of ivy cascading down from the branches of a chestnut tree hung as thick as a velvet theatre curtain the stick had created a gap through which they could see a few inches of the graffiticovered corrugated grooves of the shutter door sal grinned i knew it maddy and sal grunted with effort as they hefted the shutter up between them three foot up enough to wriggle through inside it was unpowered just as maddy had expected it to be the archway would be on generator power right now essential systems only it was dark inside almost completely black the dim light of the forest spilling in from beneath the shutter door revealed several yards of grubby concrete floor and no more bob you powered up in there she could hear the faint chug of the generator at the back good at least thats working bob none of the monitors were on she tried to make out whether any of the pcs standby indicators were glowing if they were they were actually too faint to see from here she stood up inside and wandered over to her right where their breakfast table and assortment of armchairs were her thigh bumped against the arm of one of them she side stepped shuffling to her right until her hand finally touched brick wall you ok in there maddy called sal she was crouched beneath the shutter holding it in case the thing rattled down again fine just looking for the light switch its somewhere here she patted dry crumbling bricks until her fingers brushed electric flex ah nearly there her fingers traced flex along the wall until she found the switch box bingo bongo she flipped the switch and the tube light above the kitchen table buzzed winked and finally flickered on oh god gasped sal maddy turned round what is it she saw for herself blood lots of it dark smeared and spattered across the floor maddy picked her way across the floor avoiding pools and bloody drag smears that were already clotting and drying out bob you on one of the monitors flickered on from standby mode she made it over to the desk and sat down in one of the office chairs hello maddy bob what happened in here sal joined her a moment later looking decidedly queasy oh pinchudda this is so disgusting theres blood everywhere warning what is it bob there is an unauthorized presence in the archway with you it was then they heard a scratching scraping sound coming from the far corner of the archway where several storage racks of bits and pieces rolls of electrical flex and buckets of circuit boards lined the wall information there were two of them i attempted to extract them both from the field office two what maddy looked at sal oh crud not two more support units the scraping scratching sound seemed to be getting closer accompanied by a wet gurgle the sound of exertion bob affirmative two support units the cursor skittered along the command line far too slowly as bob elaborated i was successful in extracting one of the support units completely and one partially just then sal strangled a yelp shaddyah maddy look maddy turned in her chair and looked at where she was pointing it emerged slowly into the pooling light bit by grotesque bit dragging itself across the shallow crater in the floor scooped out by a dozen or more old displacement fields a pale hand connected to an arm a bloodspattered shoulder and finally a bald head and the top half of a torso missing the other shoulder and arm it pulled itself towards them another female support unit or what was left of one maddy didnt know whether to puke scream or run jesus caution it is still very dangerous maddy got up and crossed the floor looking at the pitiful thing dragging itself determinedly towards them it didnt look dangerous she almost felt sorry for it dont let its hand grab you said sal maddy took a step back the support units one hand was reaching out for the toe of her boot its mouth snapped open in a bloody snarl of gurgling frustration sal took a wide berth round it towards the storage racks rummaged for a moment through a plastic bucket of tools and came towards maddy with a large heavy wrench in her hands we should squish it just a sec maddy squatted down in front of the support unit careful to keep enough distance between her and that one functioning hand there was undoubtedly still enough strength in those fingers to crush bones to throttle her who sent you its bloodshot eyes rolled up towards her can you hear me its gurgling stopped who sent you again this one had a face unsettlingly similar to becks eyes as grey and piercing as hers but the whites webbed with hairlines of haemorrhaging veins you primary target maddy wondered what the support unit meant by that them the team or her specifically does someone want us dead its mouth snapped shut and open again it gurgled a paste of dark clotting blood down its chin is that it someone wants us dead primary target who sent you the thing was dying its voice failing to little more than a wet bubbling whisper she leaned forward please who sent you its hand reached out for maddys shirt collar and snagged it weakly balling its fist and trying to pull her closer bloodshot eyes stared intently up at her and its mouth opened once again spilling a viscous drool of dark blood on to the floor opened and snapped closed its fist pulling maddys face down towards its bloodied lips its jaw snapped open once more cont contam no sal brought the wrench down with a sickening crunch the support unit squealed like a banshee a horrible verminlike screech it thrashed about violently on the floor sal brought the wrench down again and the screeching ended abruptly the noise of both impact and the cutshort scream echoed round the archway as the reverberation faded they stared in horrified silence at the support unit quite dead now maddy looked up at sal the bloodspattered wrench was still in her trembling hands her eyes wide locked on the horrible mess shed just created whyd you go and do that she was trying to tell me something i i thought it was it was trying to bite you maddy got to her feet backing away from the remains of the support unit it she was trying to say something contamination thats it i think contamination contamination yeah thats what i think she was saying like maybe we are the contamination event she took several more steps back until her legs bumped against her office chair she slumped down in it for the moment robbed of the energy to stay standing do you think that means were the problem not the solution sal joined her maddy oh god i thought she was going to she wrapped her arms round maddy and began sobbing into her shoulder a computer beeped its ok maddy cooed stroked her hair the last hour had been enough to shred anyones sanity let alone a child sals age she let her get it out of her system wondering for a moment if she was ever going to find someone whose shoulder she could go and soak its ok were nearly sorted now just got to bring the boys back and well be all right i promise sals head nodded against her shoulder a computer beeped come on then sal she said lifting her away youre getting snot on my shirt ive only got one decent one sal laughed not so much a laugh as a smile but good enough one of the pcs beeped again one of those annoying reboot beeps a youwentandhitthekeyboardinangerdidntyou beep maddy turned round to see computerbob had opened a dialogue box and had been patiently trying to get her attention for the last minute warning i am picking up approaching ident signals yards warning i am picking up approaching ident signals yards warning i am picking up approaching ident signals yards warning warning warning chapter formerly new york the shutter door rattled noisily under a hammerblow impact theyve found us already screamed maddy sal stared at the dented shutter door with bubbleeyed panic it suddenly jumped again in its running frame and another fistshaped dent buckled the thick metal slats theyre trying to break in she screamed maddy turned back towards the webcam emergency evacuation bob activate a portal affirmative you should specify timestamp the shutter door lurched again as another huge dent suddenly appeared anywhere activate a freakin portal information maddy it is not advisable to enter a portal without a programmed exit location the shutter jumped and rattled again this time the left side of it clattered out of the top of the running frame and swung inwards a corner of daylight spilled into the archway now bob jesus do it now she heard the displacement rack start to hum and glanced at the charge display leds flickered one after the other from green to amber to red as the reservoir of stored energy began to be discharged into the circuit boards of the machine bob was right though if they stepped into that portal when it appeared before them without some coordinates any coordinates plotted in they were stepping into something unknown unquantifiable unthinkable a place there was no return from she didnt however have the time to sit down and tap numbers into the system sal was backed up beside her terrified hopping from one foot to the other screaming something at their pursuers in hindi maddy couldnt think clearly the moment was happening too quickly shed planned to set up an emergency evacuation timestamp some quick dial preplanned coordinates that she could have bob pull up and use at a moments notice a precaution shed planned to sort that out it was right at the top of her todo list but she hadnt got round to doing it always busy with one thing or another always having to clear up after fighting the last fire just like everything else shed found another way to mess things up again theyre nearly through screamed sal do something bob the last timestamp plot in the last timestamp affirmative plotting the shutter door took another battering bulging alarmingly on the side that was almost knocked entirely out of its frame the metal slats there were crumpled and ragged almost like the silver foil wrapper of a chocolate bar sal turned to her jahulla what about becks she was in the growth tube in the back room last time theyd bothered to go in and check on her progress to look through that murky gunk at the hairless prebirth candidate shed had the look of a ten or elevenyearold girl theres no time the displacement machine suddenly discharged its energy a gust of displaced air sent the rubbish on maddys desk fluttering in comechaseme circles three yards ahead of them in the middle of the archway perfectly aligned with the shallow scoop in their concrete floor an eightfootwide sphere of energy popped into existence maddy could see in the swirling oilonwater pattern an image of the location that had been sitting in computerbobs data buffer liam and bobs deployment location she could see hints of a rich summerblue sky and the greens and browns of grass or trees we cant just leave her another crash and the misshapen shutter door swung entirely free on the righthand side it collapsed heavily on to the floor inside the archway sal was right it wasnt just that they owed becks not just a support unit she was much more than code and meat now she was a friend a member of their small family and it wasnt only that the loyalty owed to a friend somewhere inside her memory was a packet of data that perhaps was an answer to every question they had perhaps also an answer to this why they were being attacked whod sent the units what theyd done to deserve this through the semiopaque portal she could see three perfectly bald heads ferociously pushing their way over untangling themselves from the twisted and jagged metal and entering the archway no time now to save the unborn child floating in the growth tube go she yelled at sal shoving her roughly in the direction of the portal sal looked back at her ducked down and picked up the wrench ready to swing it im not leaving without you dont worry im coming maddy stretched across her desk and grabbed the small bulletdented hard drive wrenching it free of the ribbon data cable attached to it go she screamed ive got becks now go sal nodded understanding that at least they had the essence of becks with them she ran forward and leaped into the portal bob close it right after me maddy yelled over her shoulder as she turned towards the shimmering sphere through the semiopaque shifting dancing image of sunbaked countryside she could see that one of the support units was entirely free of the tangle of metal and was looking her way it broke into a sprint towards her towards the portal she leaped forward gritting her teeth at the terrifying prospect of hitting the sphere of energy at exactly the same time as the support unit entered it from the other side the pair of them fusing together in chaos space and emerging as some entwined horrifically arranged and shortlived conjoined twins nooooo she found herself screaming as her feet left the ground and she leaped into the spherical void her arms swung up protectively in front of her face for what little good it was going to do her chapter ad miles outside rome how much longer now asked liam it is due in two minutes thirtysix seconds replied bob liam shook his head cant come a second too soon he looked around the olive trees grateful that their rendezvous was a quiet discreet location and seven miles away from the stench of decay and squalor in rome im glad were out he added a week that was all one week in rome and liam could quite happily say he never wanted to see the city again he shook his head at his naive hope of a week ago assuming the place was the very definition of order and civilization an endless spectacle of marbled splendour how wrong hed been the city what hed managed to see of it was a slum of over a million people buildings stacked several storeys high packed tightly side by side like arrows in a quiver and the smell was unbelievable the stench of human and animal faeces of rotting bodies the city was riddled with diseases from polluted water typhoid cholera liam recalled nottingham a city that had been in just as much trouble but rome had something else it had caligula examples of his madness were everywhere in every communal area marketplaces forums tshaped cruciforms were erected from which hung those whod displeased him in some way graffiti on almost every wall depicted the emperor as either mad or cruel or demonic or godlike and benevolent rival gangs collegia daubed the walls with these lurid illustrations and most of the gangs seemed to favour the emperor they flourished in the growing chaos of the city that was the thing from those romans theyd spoken to overheard their landlord in particular a short thickset and foultempered man who seemed to swear with every other word liam had got a sense that caligula had disengaged from running his empire was content to let it descend into chaos ruin and anarchy while he prepared for some rumoured and imminent destiny within the walls of the city it had been the very definition of hell itself liam felt queasy as images of the last few days flashed before his mind glimpses frozen images a slideshow of horror splashes of blood and squalor stop it liam think nice thoughts surely theyre probing here already are they not bob shook his head i have not detected any tachyon particles yet thats not right they shouldve probed already liam looked up at the support unit somethings wrong maddy always checks first before she opens affirmative that is standard procedure liam liam shook his head silently this was one place he really didnt want to be stuck any longer than necessary he had a memory of taking confession with father ogrady his parish priest a few years ago confessing to him guilty fantasies about rosie mcdonald his schoolmates older sister who lived three doors down from him father ogrady had given him chapter and verse about the temptations of satan and then gone on to describe in glorious detail the torments that awaited him in the underworld liam had gone home and that night had dreamed fitfully of the world ogradys words had conjured up in his young mind these last few days hed seen that nightmare world for real i am detecting precursor tachyons said bob ah thank jayzus for that liam felt relieved enough to try out a smile another minute and they were going to be back home and working out together how they were going to put an end to this nightmare timeline we should stand clear said bob holding liams arm and leading him several steps back liam turned to look up at their cart and the ponies it was up the hill on the side of the track where someone was likely to find it sooner or later he was wondering whether they should have cut the poor animals free when he felt the puff of displaced air on his cheek the branches of the olive tree hanging over them swayed and hissed excitedly liam looked at the shimmering orb that had just appeared hovering in front of them he saw the familiar welcoming cool dimness of the archway and there he could just about see the flickering outlines of sal and maddy sal burst out of the portal running as she hit the ground she lost her footing and tumbled into a patch of long grass she was instantly up again on her feet liam looking around frantically liam sal he called out to her she spun round and saw him and bob standing in the shade of the tree whatre you doing here before she could answer maddy was spat out of the portal arms ahead of her as if shed been taking a leisurely dive into a swimming pool ooooo she hit the dusty ground and rolled head over heels maddy whats going on she scrambled to her feet like sal spinning round glancing in all directions to locate him liam bob she saw sal wheres bob were over here liam said then what the devils going on she ignored his question for the moment turning back to look at the portals shimmering image oh god close please she muttered close dammit close close close liam looked at bob then back at her uh why do we want it to close maddy are we not meant to be going back n just then as the sphere began to collapse in on itself a third figure was spat out on to the dusty ground maddy screamed backing away from it as it attempted to get to its feet only it had no feet just bloody stumps smoothly cut and cauterized above the ankle and one arm severed at the elbow by the edge of the force field as it began to collapse in size and winked out of existence whos that chuddah its got a gun said sal bob was the first to react charging forward towards the footless figure trying to steady itself on uneven stumps wielding a pistol in its remaining hand it fired off a shot at bob hitting home a puff of crimson coming from his shoulder but then bob was upon it throwing his full weight in and knocking it flat on the ground they tumbled across the hard dirt locked together in a lethal wrestlers embrace liam winced as the footless figure fired two more shots into bob before he managed to knock the gun out of its hand his eyes were trying to make sense of what he could see it looked like two versions of bob rolling around squirming together in the tall dry grass kicking up clouds of dust between them get the gun shrieked maddy get the freakin gun sal stepped forward and scooped it off the ground shoot it she cupped the gun in both hands a finger on the trigger grimacing uncertainly as she tried to line up a shot on the right bob shoot it i cant i ill hit him give it to me snapped maddy she wrenched it out of sals hands and strode towards the two struggling support units like a pair of giant pitbulls locked together all rippling cords of muscle and entwined limbs one then the other managing to get the upper hand bob was on top again now this time holding the other support unit in a tight headlock and bracing his hold position with his legs spread apart as it flailed ferociously to struggle out of his grip hold it still maddy yelled at bob she stepped forward standing over the pair of them hold it still she screamed she aimed the gun and fired jayzus be careful shouted liam she fired again and again and again and again then the gun was clicking harmlessly in her cupped hands the struggling stopped and as the dust began to settle liam realized hed stood on the side uselessly too confused by what he was seeing to be of any help to the girls cursing his moment of stupidity he rushed forward maddy collapsed to her knees the empty gun still in her hands she was gasping for air or perhaps she was sobbing he couldnt tell either way she looked like an utterly spent force bob liam pulled at bobs bloody shoulder bob you all right his deep voice rumbled affirmative the damage is minimal he sat up slowly on his haunches releasing his grip on the other support unit it flopped lifelessly to the ground liam looked down at the things head jayzus its you bob your twin or something is it maddy panted several breaths a ragged rattle is that thing dead three wellplaced cranial wounds replied bob it is quite dead she sighed dropped the gun into her lap and this time liam realized by the heaving of her shoulders she really was sobbing sal came over to soothe her we made it maddy she whispered its all over were safe liam looked at them both wondering which of a dozen questions spinning round his head to blurt out first he ended up going with the obvious catchall question anyone mind telling me whats bleedin well going on here chapter ad miles outside rome it took maddy half an hour to get liam and bob up to speed on everything that had happened to them since shed sent them off to ancient rome ive never been so scared she concluded she cast a quick glance at the dead support unit i thought we were going to die sal nodded so stupid i kept thinking why are bob and becks trying to kill us even though i knew it wasnt them i would never harm any of you bob assured them maddy looked at him because its not a mission parameter he nodded correct but hang on so who sent them support units after us then asked liam i dont know maddy shook her head ive got no idea liam i just dont know who would maybe its someone we upset said sal upset liam looked at her incredulously if thats what upset does id not want to know what totally hacked off gets us maddy waved him silent someone wants us dead who though maybe someone doesnt want us looking after history someone who wants history to be changed all messed around sal took a sharp breath what if what if this roman contamination was linked to those support units somehow maddy stroked her chin giving that some consideration sal continued maybe whoever came back here somehow knew all about the agency about us maybe they wanted to make sure they took us down so we couldnt undo whatever theyre up to right here they looked at each other a long uneasy pause i think it was the message said maddy she looked at the others asking about pandora someone other than waldstein intercepted it thats not good said sal eventually that someone knows about us they knew precisely where and when we are maddy pulled on her lip not good and those support units you were talkin about said liam theyre still back there in our archway maddy nodded quite probably trashing our place as we speak destroying everything liam looked up at her but this means were well be stuck here then right for the moment maddy sighed well figure something out he muttered to himself id rather have gone back and faced them crazy bobs than im sorry liam ok i didnt have time to organize another recall window we were lucky to escape with our lives he stopped accepted that right im sorry look theres still the sixmonth window continued maddy if they dont smash the place up if computerbob runs the recall sequence as scheduled theres a couple of them if words of yours madelaine carter liam offered her an edgy grin thats never a good sign she returned it and nodded im not such a huge fan of embedded ifs either she shrugged ive got no idea whats going to happen back home we might get the sixmonther we might not i dont want to stay here six more minutes let alone months why asked sal she looked around at the valley the olive trees seems all right to me nice and sunny and maddy noted the look on his face liam bob come on what do you two guys know this is a significantly altered timeline said bob well it looks pretty much what id imagine rome to this isnt rome cut in liam he shook his head slowly this is a small valley full of wild olive trees you want to see rome well maddy looked around we cant wait here for six months it would be inadvisable to remain here added bob youre right maddy pulled herself to her feet brushing dry dirt off her jeans they might find a way to bypass computerbobs security lockdown open another portal we should move away from here affirmative you want us to go back to rome asked liam well where else do you suggest how about anywhere maddy frowned jeez whats got into you cant be that bad its bad maddy sighed could we just get some clear useful information out of you please it appears some sort of contamination event occurred in rome approximately seventeen years ago said bob something witnessed by many people but it has become an interpreted event interpreted event what do you mean it appears that emperor caligula has manipulated the many different eyewitness accounts of this event to his own advantage to create an accepted orthodox version of events so whats the story there are accounts of a host of angels coming down from heaven said liam descending from the skies in vast chariots during some religious festival seventeen years ago he shook his head at how ridiculous it sounded they actually descended right into the middle of their largest arena during a gladiatorial show and theyre supposed to have announced that caligula was a god their god would you believe what maddy looked at sal oh my did you just say vast chariots bob nodded clearly vehicles of some kind modern technology someones gone bigscale said sal a large group of time travellers bringing with them what tanks or something maddy shook her head the futures getting careless or desperate added sal just like that kramer then said liam but a much more ambitious version of his jolly jaunt maddy nodded and so what weve got some future powerjunky jerk like that kramer running the show now calling himself emperor caligula liam shook his head no we think its still the real caligula in charge what about the time travellers then asked sal liam shrugged gone information the orthodox account is that the angels stayed for several years to prepare caligula for his role as god then returned to heaven with a promise that one day soon he will be summoned there too thats the orthodox version added liam ask me i think he had em all killed liam is right this would appear to be the most likely outcome these angels have not been seen by anyone in over fifteen years they most likely have been secretly executed by caligula maddy looked at them both then at sal a breeze stirred the olive trees and filled the long silence between them hes clearly as mad as a box of chocolate frogs you dont know the half of it muttered liam rome is he shook his head it isnt what i expected its he took a deep breath rome this rome is the last place on earth youd ever want to see again but we will have to return liam said bob gently he looked towards maddy there is an unresolved time contamination that is our mission priority she looked at his hulking form yeah that may be your priority bob not necessarily ours though he was still working from code programming that absolutely insisted this contamination was resolved before anything else the agencys programming waldsteins the guy whod dropped all three of them into this neverending nightmare without a word of warning without any support whatsoever madelaine insisted bob this is our mission priority she wandered over to the body of the clone on the ground well we cant stay here thats for sure weve got two things to deal with this contamination weve got to zero in on the jerks who caused it the precise when and the where my moneys on some idiot like that kramer some powerhungry moron who fancies himself as a roman emperor she hunkered down and studied the clones still face its glazed grey eyes staring lifelessly back at her and then weve got this to deal with i guess well have to face that in six months time if the sixmonth window opens said liam what if its all smashed up back in the archway maddy shook her head i dont think so why asked sal liams right theyre probably smashing it all up and were going to be stuck out here forever i dont think so they wanted us dead not on the loose somewhere in history she looked at bob what would you do if you were them i would assume an automated recall sequence was set up i would wait in the field office for it to be activated then i would kill you as soon as you returned precisely she looked at the other two well get our sixmonth window we just need to be ready to fight for our lives the moment we get back liam sighed i love being us maddy ignored him so whether we like it or not weve got six months to make use of lets see what we can find out about this contamination if its another kramer maybe theres some modern tech somewhere another machine possibly who knows another gun would be nice said sal inspecting the empty nypd handgun useless to anyone except perhaps as a club yup maddy smiled that would be handy come on she stood up we should go probably best not to hang around here any longer they got to their feet and followed her out of the small valley up the slope towards the cart and horses patiently waiting on the side of the track chapter new york as the portal snapped down to a pinprick of light then vanished the highpitched hum of the displacement machine dropped in tone then there was silence except for the gentle chugging of the generator in the back room the two support units abel and faith regarded the feet and hand lying on the floor in front of them both perfectly cauterized where shrinking reality had cut through their colleague system ai please advise where the targets were sent said abel computerbobs webcam eye regarded them his cursor blinked on the screen system ai please advise where the targets were sent computerbob was running decision filters across his network it was almost surprising really that neither of these mysterious support units could hear the change in pitch of his cpu fans not on screen but deep within a mind of logic gates and circuit boards options presented themselves to bob decision assist with enquiry note authority code is valid protocol n invoked assistance mandatory override valid code initiate system lockdown lie the unit called abel stepped towards the desk he hunkered down and looked directly into the webcam system ai please provide an answer computerbob realized he was using fuzzylogic routines that no programmer had ever actually written for him they were decision functions that in a way hed written himself feelings that once upon a time had crossed the great divide of hairthin wires from flesh to silicon feelings that once across those wires became hexadecimal approximations original code a strange experience a very novel experience almost human in fact computerbob had a file tagged smile in his extensive database it was a smile type that he saw liam use often particularly when he played games on the nintendo console bobs webcam eye had seen that smile whenever liam won one of his gokart races there was even an audio file linked to the visual record of that smile maddys voice sheesh what are you looking so smug about liams voice i just won again smile could also be labelled smug smile he made a mental note to give the file that additional heading but now more pressing matters needed to be dealt with computerbob selected option three targets have been relocated to preprogrammed emergency jump location computerbob watched the support unit called abel read the screen then nod and say please specify the emergency jump location information miles from this location give me precise timestamp coordinates i am able to open the same portal proceed said abel computerbob initiated a sequence of commands enough power for a modest window surged from the remaining five properly functioning capacitors into the displacement machine a moment later a portal flickered into existence in the middle of the archways floor the two support units wasted no time at all they stepped through one after the other computerbob closed the portal immediately power needed to be conserved unnecessary lights winked off in the archway the monitors shut down one after the other all but one of the networked pcs went into sleep mode the final pc was running a processorlite version of computerbobs ai if someone had asked him what he preferred orange or pink it probably would have caused a system crash instead his idling ai allowed itself a selfcongratulatory moment to play around with ascii characters smile specifically smug smile the cursor blinked several times d then that final monitor also snapped into sleep mode chapter ad rome the faint outline of the city lay ahead of them nestling in a valley of gently rolling hills and the track was now a wide cobblestone road leading down a gentle slope emerging from an orchard of olive trees bob steered the cart round a line of slow shuffling slaves up ahead of them each had a noose of rope around their necks attaching them to a long heavylooking pole that rested along their shoulders oh my was all maddy could say as their cart rattled slowly past them slaverys popular here said liam oh and sacrifices maddy bit her lip as she looked at him seriously youll start to see some grisly stuff soon enough the cart rolled along in a solemn silence slowly drawing past the line of slaves maddy looked down at them at their pale faces she supposed they came from faroff northern countries all of them daubed with swipes of green paint whats the paint for asked sal the green liam leaned on the side of the cart its caligulas colour its the colour of his church the church of julii said sal what liam shrugged i dont think its called that not yet she added it gets called that much later i guess it sort of becomes this timelines version of the catholic church sal watched the slaves trudge barefooted along the cobbles her face drained of colour as she watched them the cart slowly rattled past daubed faces gazing down at their own bloodied and blistered feet and she looked like she was going to vomit whyve they been painted green asked maddy theyre marked said liam marked for sacrifice every call to prayer is begun with a sacrifice there are five calls to prayer every day added bob this is by decree any citizens who are seen not praying are punished so they get through quite a lot of slaves said liam sombrely the three of them watched the line of tethered slaves recede until they were no more than a shifting smudge of pale flesh shimmering in the heat reflected by the sunbaked cobblestone road liam directed their attention to the road ahead welcome to rome the crucifixes lining via aurelia the road into rome from the southwest gave maddy and sal their first taste of what horror to expect within the city for the last mile on either side of them crossbars of weatherbleached wood bore the dead and dying the pitiful frames of emaciated men and women those still alive pleaded with them in dry whispers speaking languages none of them understood maddy suspected they were begging for a quick death pleading for the sharp thrust of a blade between their ribs to end a slow agonizing torment bob cajoled their ponies across the stone bridge over the river tiber into the city the smell of putrefaction of disease and burning cadavers filled the air this is a nightmare whispered maddy liam nodded this isnt just a starving city its a madmans personal playground she understood what he meant by that the roadside was decorated with heads stuck on wooden posts some posts sported several older heads pushed down by newer ones the oldest little more than skulls shrouded in dry tatters of leathered skin not all of them were daubed with old flecks of green paint some of those were roman citizens said liam there was a crowd of people who were protesting last week while me and bob were staying about what asked sal building materials taken from the aqua claudia to be used on caligulas stairway replied bob the aqueduct was one of the citys main sources of drinkable water caligula assured the people his first good deed after ascending to heaven and becoming god would be to cause fresh rainwater to fall on rome and for the river to be made as clean as mountain water added liam when those protesters decided they didnt actually believe any of that he had his praetorians kill the lot of them seriously liam nodded me an bob were right there he hesitated there were details he didnt want to describe wasnt very pleasant we saw that happen on the third night wasnt it affirmative i was a bit uh bit shaken up by that said liam he didnt tell her that hed spent the following day in the rooms theyd rented the streets and avenues had been deserted every last person in the city hiding from caligulas petulant rage there were people in the avenues now traders with a meagre stock of items on sale the carcasses of rats and dogs for the lucky few who could trade in coin the scrawny bodies of hares the hind leg of a wild boar crawling with flies citizens and slaves young and old looking for scraps of protein a marketplace that was deathly quiet a hundred conversations carried out in worried halfwhispers as crows lined claytile guttering nearby cawing noisily without a care for the miserable shuffling humans they eyed caught a glimpse of him continued liam in a low voice saw caligula himself whats he like asked sal yeah maddy pulled a tattered sack from the floor of the cart and draped it over her shoulders she offered one to sal their clothes were going to attract stares unless they covered up i was never a particularly religious type you know he shrugged jesus mary joseph an god i could take em or leave em if you know what i mean but what liam bit his lip but i ill swear theres something of the devil about him did he look like he could be someone from the future anything about him clothes wristwatch that kind of thing negative there was nothing anachronistic replied bob looked like the real thing to me said liam quite mad the cart rattled out of the broad thoroughfare into a much narrower avenue flanked on either side by once brightly painted threestoreyed buildings crimson yellow green the paint was old though flaking off like dry leprous skin along the front of the buildings above a portico of loose clay tiles were precariouslooking wooden balconies and rat runs from which dangled strings of herbs this is the subura district said bob its a pretty rough part of rome warned liam what am i saying its all rough actually this is where we found some rooms the praetorians stay out of it mostly even them priests the collegia run things around here collegia gangs said liam criminal gangs maddy looked up at the creaking wooden balconies that loomed over them oh i thought caligula was like totally in charge of every he rules by consent said bob while he pays the praetorian guard and turns a blind eye to the activities of the collegia they are effectively his police force mind you cut in liam from what bits and pieces weve heard even they think hes gone too mad as they drew up beyond the last of the traders stalls bob clicked his tongue and rapped the reins across the ponies backs their plodding stopped but if everyone thinks hes a crazy fakirchanahead why is he still in charge why hasnt somebody just got rid of him everyones completely afraid of him liam reached under a lock of his dark hair and adjusted the babelbud in his ear maybe some of them do actually think hes some sort of god i dont know perhaps hes got his hands on some tech that makes him appear like a god said maddy say a gun that would do it right make you look like youve got super godlike powers sheesh even a plain old flashlight or a cellphone could look godlike right she looked up at the chaos of wooden slats above them the colours of robes and togas drying in the noon sun they were opposite a narrow rat run between buildings little more than a yard wide leading to a shadowed courtyard beyond the sounds of life echoed out of it the barking of dogs the squalling of a baby the shrill cry of a womans voice raised in anger countless lives lived on top of each other in cramped squalor have you seen any tech liam bob anything at all that shouldnt be here in this time negative ive seen nothing like that liam shook his head if someone did come back here seventeen years ago and they made a big show of themselves well chariots from the heavens said maddy quoting from one of the sources of the time some sort of modern vehicles trucks or something right chariots from the heavens and messengers from god an all that if someone made a big spectacle like that liam said with a shrug theres not a sign of them now bob hopped down off the cart its like this city just swallowed them up added liam maddy peered down the rat run into the dark courtyard that where you were staying aye liam pointed up the side of a claybrick wall third floor the building looked more modern than she could have imagined a roman building would look five storeys in height with rickety balconies of wooden slats and wicker screens for privacy the buildings basic and very smelly gets noisy too and its owned by a right miserable old grump but it is cheap just hope hell let us have our room back liam dug into a pouch tied round his waist maddy heard coins jangling heavily whered you get the money from liam looked guiltily at bob we uh well we kind of mugged someone kind of or did did maddy shrugged needs must and all that i better go and speak to the landlord see about getting our room back those babelbuds work ok liam shrugged aye you get some gibberish out of them sometimes he turned to bob better bring them ponies in quick affirmative he turned to the others we used to have four of them but people are eating horseflesh now youre best not to leave em unattended bob began to unhitch the animals from the cart sal helping while liam led maddy down the narrow rat run into the courtyard as she emerged from the narrow passageway she looked up all around the courtyard on all four sides she could see balconies and walkways hugging the walls stacked one on top of the other and propped up on wooden support stilts she could see the curious faces of children and women looking down at them a dozen different conversations shouted out from one side to the other chickens down in the courtyard chickens wandering freely along the walkways and balconies and at the very top an overhanging lip of terracotta roof tiles framed a square of daylight liam approached a thickset bearded man wearing a leather apron hacking with a cleaver at the skinned carcass of what looked like a greyhound she heard liam mutter something to himself and remembered thats how the buds worked they translated what they heard liam cocked his head slightly listening to the almost immediate translation being whispered into his ear then repeated it to the man salve rediimus passimus priotem concavem iterum locare the man stopped hacking at the carcass then eventually shrugged si vis he held out a bloody hand quiniue sestertii liam nodded a barely discernible delay as he listened for the translation he dug into his pouch and handed over several coins to the man maddy smiled impressed at how effectively almost seamlessly the babelbud appeared to work she made a note to give it a try herself liam nodded a thankyou to the man and was about to lead her across the straw and dungcarpeted courtyard towards an external wooden stairway that would take them up to the buildings third floor when they both heard a commotion coming from the rat run chapter ad subura district rome with the sound of raised voices liam turned to see sal dragging one of the ponies by its reins into the courtyard it was snorting frantically distressed and wideeyed hooves clattering and skidding in the dirt as she tried to manhandle it in they tried to take our ponies off us who did a moment later bob emerged from the rat run dragging the other animal after him he let the ponys reins go and smacked its flank so that it darted across the courtyard towards the other one a dozen chickens squawked flapped at the disturbance caution bob barked out almost immediately a dozen men spilled into the courtyard all of them thickset and muscular all of them armed with short swords or daggers drawn ready to use liam heard the landlords voice his bud translating almost as instantly as an echo watch out collegia strongarms one of the men stepped forward titus varelius adsumet unam vestrarum bestiarum titus varelius will have one of your beasts the bud whispered quietly in his ear the landlord snapped an angry reply and thumbed his nose at them defiantly the collegia leader smiled a broad gaptoothed grin his gaze settled on bob titus is owed this months payment the pony will do titus can go and kiss my arse said the landlord liam was no longer aware that he was actually listening to the bud in his ear this animal is ours said bob in passable latin i recommend you leave immediately the collegia leaders smile broadened i hoped youd say that he pulled a short sword from his belt then we shall have some sport with you mamercus mettius vel this big brutes yours three of his men stepped forward grinning like naughty schoolboys as they angled the tips of their blades towards bob and sized him up are you an ox or a man one of them laughed bob scowled neither he lunged a whiplash of movement that concluded with the tips of his fingers lodged firmly beneath the jawline of one of the men the jab had crushed his windpipe as the mans legs began to buckle beneath him and he choked gasping for breath bob caught his short sword in midair as it began to tumble from a limp hand with a deft flick he was suddenly holding it by the handle instead of the blade he lunged forward swinging it at the throat of the second collegia man but this one was a little more prepared he thrust out his blade managing to parry the heavy sweep barely inches from his neck the ring of metal echoed round the courtyard and all of a sudden liam noticed every creaking wooden balcony above them seemed to be lined with curious onlookers it reminded him of a crowded penny theatre the gaptoothed leader decided the sport was already over with and barked an order to the rest of his men to attack bob they fanned out either side of him liam pulled sal back into a corner of the courtyard beside the old landlord who was already quickly packing away his joints of meat and muttering to himself those scum think they own the place maddy liam called out to her she was still standing pretty much in the middle of the courtyard back up give bob some room three of them closed in on bob at the same time one of them swinging his sword at his neck the other two thrusting at his torso he ducked the swing at his neck deftly enough but one of the other blades lodged deep into the side of his ribcage a groan erupted from the balconies above they recognized the wound as a fatal one that the fight wasnt going to last much longer the landlord grimaced and shook his head pity but bob casually twisted his body yanking the handle of the sword protruding from his ribs out of the hands of the man whod thrust it into him he grasped the handle and wrenched the blade out of his side one sword in each hand now all the collegia thugs had successfully managed to do was arm him with two swords and of course annoy him bob swept the sword in his left hand down low a round scythelike sweep that hamstrung one of them and lopped the foot off another in his other hand he flipped the short sword bladeoverhilt catching it by its tip then throwing it end over end at the third man whod swung his heavy sword carelessly for bobs neck it thudded into his stomach the man doubling over with a grunt and dropping to his knees in the dirt beside the other two men clutching their legs spurting arcs of dark crimson on to the ground above the courtyard voices cheered out from the balconies liam glanced up at them theyre cheering for bob bob picked up another discarded weapon and again had a sword in each hand his beefy hands were spinning the blades like marching batons shimmering blurs of glinting metal like rotary saw blades a whuskwhuskwhusk of sharp edges slicing through the air whos next bob announced calmly in heavily accented latin hes a oneman army liam shook his head in amazement isnt he always the collegia thugs were certainly now looking less sure of themselves liam guessed reputation was at stake here he could see the gang leader weighing things up wondering whether to withdraw from the courtyard with all these people still openly braying their support for bob or try and finish the oxofaman off a lesson to everyone watching that no one no one not even this extraordinary brute was going to walk away after thumbing his nose at their collegia he barked at the rest of his men enough of the play now finish him all six began to close in their eyes warily on the spinning blades and the mischievous grin spreading across bobs face liam glanced at sal big mistake she wasnt listening or didnt hear him over the caterwauling from above instead she closed her eyes and turned away just as the first wet thunk of a blade slicing through muscle and cracking bone filled the air liam watched the blur of bob leaping forward the grace of a woodland deer married to the rippling muscular bulk of a giant bear he was no longer spinning his blades like a manic circus performer instead with flashes of metal and bright droplets of blood he deployed a sequence of fast and precise thrusts and slices that dropped all six men in rapid succession each wet thud accompanied by an increasingly raucous cheer of delight from above a hand severed at the wrist hit the dirt a yard away from liam clenching and unclenching the hilt of a short sword reflexively in less than half a minute all six men lay dying clutching bloody stumps or cradling puckering stomach wounds desperately holding their insides in the courtyard echoed with a hundred or more spectators cheering gleefully as those collegia men still alive withdrew back down the rat run the voices of the apartment blocks tenants echoed off the clay brick walls someone even tossed a basketful of sunflower petals from the third balcony into the air they spun like confetti all the way down finally settling on bobs sweating head the landlord stared wideeyed at bob muttering some oath under his breath chapter ad subura district rome bobs become some sort of celebrity said maddy liam made a face and spat out an olive stone and whats one of those famous people you know people who get rich for doing nothing added sal mostly hes a hero to the people in this building said maddy arent you bob he nodded i appear to have earned their approval maddy looked around the simple furnishings of the room straw mat on the floor a small low table between them almost completely filled with food theyd had a steady stream of offerings all evening gentle polite knocks on their door shy smiles through the grilled covered greeting hatch whispers of gratitude and wooden platters of fruit bread and amphoras of watereddown wine left behind food many of these people could ill afford to surrender so willingly the landlord still wearing his bloodspattered leather apron had even offered this room to them for nothing although hed not made clear how long that gesture of goodwill was intended for bob humiliated those thugs said liam they run this district of rome the people do not like them said bob liam frowned and spat out another stone theyre vicious crooks extortionists so they are maddy sipped at her cup of diluted sourtasting wine these people are looking at bob as some sort of champion now arent they their champion that could be of some tactical use to us said bob on the other hand she swilled the wine round her mouth and made a face ugh on the other hand it could attract unwanted attention we do need to be discreet sal was fiddling around with one of the babelbuds tactical use jahulla we dont even really have a plan she looked up do we visitors came by not so long ago said maddy within living memory of some of the people in rome perhaps some of the people in this very building saw them we need to ask around carefully of course we need to figure out when they came back precisely when and why what was their game plan more to the point added liam where the devil are they now who knows they might be here still they might have gone native blended in they sat in silence outside in the courtyard below they could hear a dog snapping and yowling through the thin walls of clay brick they could faintly hear the muted exchanges of other families somewhere a woman cried somewhere angry voices snapped at each other somewhere pots clattered on a brazier liam made a face again gah so bitter he spat out another stone on to the side of the plate of stale fruit curling his lips in disgust these grapes are rubbish so they are maddy looked at him then at the olive stone god you can be such a moron liam it was a tap as gentle and as light as a feathers touch quiet enough that neither sal nor liam stirred or bob hed gone into one of his occasional standby modes sorting his memories into more efficient storage compartments decluttering was the term sal used for it not quite what he was doing inside his head but close enough maddy sat up and listened carefully the city or at least this district of it had finally quietened down for the night even the feral dogs had stopped their yapping taptap someone at their door maddy softly called whos there before she realized even if she knew how to ask that in latin she wouldnt have a hope of making sense of the answer she fumbled in the dark for the babelbud and found it where sal had left it on the table she eased it into her ear and then quietly whispering to herself asked the same question the bud soothingly translated for her she stood beside the oak door she could see the faint flickering amber of candlelight coming through the doors grated hatch and round the loosefitting doorframe she could see the shadows of somebodys feet shuffling impatiently outside she looked out into the passageway it was their landlord yes can i help ive got someone here he grunted whod like to meet your friend she noticed a man beside him tall and lean his dark curls emerged from beneath a hood pulled up to hide as much of his face as possible by the flickering glow of the candle she thought at first he looked quite young but then saw flecks of grey in his dark hair the traces of lines around his eyes his was a face that looked like it had seen the better part of thirty or forty years but he was still very lean and fit a soldier perhaps maddy tried the phrase of latin the bud had whispered in her ear who is that the landlord replied in a soft growl a ragged voice that sounded like it had spent a lifetime being abused hes an old friend of mine from my army days a good man the younger man stepped forward may i speak to the one who got the better of vareliuss men hes asleep which was kind of true i wish to discuss a matter with him an important matter as it happens maddy narrowed her eyes the only part of her they could see through the door slot she hoped this expression of suspicion was universal and timeless enough that theyd understand she wasnt opening this door for them not on the strength of that were alone out here he added i just wish to talk thats all she peered through the slit both ways the passage did appear to be empty as far as she could see about what the tall man looked uncomfortable uttering his business aloud it would be better discussed inside in private please she looked at them both wondering how much of a threat they posed the tall one was athletic for a middleaged man but nowhere near as muscular as the thugs bob had effortlessly despatched earlier and although his older friend the landlord was thickset and squat with brawn that looked decades old beneath his tanned wrinkled skin she doubted bob would even break into a sweat dealing with him all right just a moment she turned round bob you two wake up liam and sal stirred sat up groggily bob was instantly alert weve got guests said maddy gently sliding the doors bolt aside they entered the landlords guttering candle filling the small room with dancing amber light bob was on his feet with a sword in his hand alert ready for trouble warily watching as both men came in closed the door behind them and settled down on wooden stools maddy looked at the tall one who are you the men looked at each other silently communicating it doesnt matter if they know my name does it shrugged the landlord he turned back to her im macro lucius cornelius macro the younger man nodded and as a gesture of trust of goodwill ill tell you my name its cato quintus licinius cato he lowered his hood so that she could see his face more clearly im a tribune of the praetorian guard what do you want both men looked at bob we wish to discuss a proposition chapter ad subura district rome cato studied them in silence bob in particular before he finally spoke he is every bit as big as you said macro i thought you were exaggerating never seen a brute this size move so quickly maddy found herself smiling the bud in her ear was working hard to find and settle on suitable simulated voices and appropriate translations for the coarse soldiers latin they were using for cato it came up with a culturedsounding british accent for their landlord macro it produced the tone accent and mannerisms of a paradeground sergeant maddy whispered in a question then parroted the latin to them what proposition did you want to discuss you are newcomers to rome visitors maddy and liam nodded sal without a bud translating for her could only look on in silence and you cato directed his question at bob where have you come from hes from britain said liam in fact we all are cato stroked his chin can he not talk for himself is he mute i am able to talk replied bob cato recoiled at his deep voice macro laughed told you lad hes a monster youve come here on what business uh just to see a bit of rome so we did macro laughed at liams response with all manner of plagues going on starvation and riots on the streets youve picked a daft time to be tourists cato waved him quiet macros quite right this is not a good time to be in rome therell be blood washing the streets soon if matters dont change we noticed on the way in said maddy people on crucifixes hundreds of them cato frowned why do you whisper once before you speak whatre you saying its just just how our uh how our tribe talk its a custom she shrugged were odd that way not a custom ive ever encountered before grunted macro your emperors gone totally insane hasnt he said liam macro barked a cough cato stiffened thats not something you should say too loudly these days lad he lowered his voice there are purges going on in every district rival families the wealthy ones stripped of their villas farms and money informers rewarded handsomely by caligula for betraying those who openly doubt his divinity many of the collegia are bribed by him the praetorian guard are paid well youre a praetorian arent you said maddy cato stopped nodded with a hint of shame for my sins i am so why are you here she asked whats this proposition she noticed a shared glance between both men a look that spoke of old friendship more than that trust the kind of trust from which the thread of a life could hang there are a few of us began cato only a few of us left prepared to meet and discuss this discuss what a change change maddy listened to the word whispered into her ear a word loaded with intent danger youre talking about removing caligula she said macro swore under his breath and stepped forward foolish woman he hissed you dont just blurt it out like that bob stirred protectively taking a step towards macro its ok bob hes right she turned to the two romans sorry that was careless of me cato nodded quite the candles flame guttered and twitched on the floor between them i should inform you you are all now in some danger he continued the collegia will know where you live theyll come with a lot more men you understand reputation is at stake reputation is everything to them he turned to bob theyll particularly want your head mounted on a spike as a warning to anyone else then they will be unsuccessful replied bob matteroffactly macro grunted appreciatively and smiled i like his spirit fighting off a dozen thugs is one thing but theyll muster as many men as it takes to bring you down cato gestured at the others that or theyll make an example of one of your friends liam turned to the others uh that doesnt sound so good he muttered in english what doesnt asked sal looking from him to maddy maddy what are they saying to you maddy ignored her whats your proposition leave come with me to a safe place for now away from here where we can talk more comfortably talk about what cato looked at bob an arrangement arrangement bob rumbled please clarify cato shrugged for money a lot of it if youre successful i do not need money replied bob sure he does maddy cut in well come with you cato raised an eyebrow at her then looked back at bob am i talking to the horse or the cart bob cocked his head confused does this young woman normally make all your decisions for you affirmative and the other two also youre their slave then negative i am their support unit look well come with you said maddy but were after information not money not after money said macro theyre an odd bunch this lot cato nodded information about what something that happened about seventeen years ago right here in rome macro and cato looked at each other they must be talking about the visitors visitors yes thats it said maddy we need to know as much as you know about them she got a dry laugh from the tribune rome is filled with all manner of rumours and stories about that day and every story is different most of them i fancy are superstitious nonsense peddled by caligulas acolytes stories for children and gullible fools added macro somebody arrived here seventeen years ago said maddy somebody not from this world cato studied her silently and what makes you so certain of this something happened didnt it something that cant be explained something caligula has chosen to use to make people believe hes a god another question occurred to her around that time did he suddenly gain powers special abilities some sort of device or tool a weapon is there a reason why he has lasted so long the two men remained tightlipped more care was needed discussing such matters why hasnt someone replaced him tried to assassinate him in the dark sal squeezed her hand a sign shed spotted something maddy had spotted it too the momentary flicker of a glance from both romans at bob a support unit have you seen someone like him maddy said pointing at bob just like bob is that it no cato answered then he added not of the same appearance but if my friend macros account of the fight this afternoon is not an exaggeration then i saw him take a mortal wound cato on his flank macro took a step towards bob there you can see the blood on his tunic bob turned away to hide the dark stain why not show em said liam let em see maddy nodded yeah good idea bob let them see lift your tunic he reached for the hem lifted it slowly up exposing the top of his britches the ribbed muscles of his stomach and finally the flesh of his wound like puckered lips raw and red and crusted with dried blood slowly he turned to show his back and an exit wound this man should be dead said macro run completely through he should be dead cato nodded hes one of them them maddy cocked her head you said them catos eyes remained warily on bob youve seen others like him she addressed her question to them both youve seen others like bob cato nodded yes we call them stone men they guard caligula night and day chapter ad rome who in the name of the gods are these people liam didnt get the impression they were entirely welcome the man was small and slim and wearing nothing more than a towel round his narrow waist the parchment skin of an old man hung in wattles from his neck wrinkled into slack bands over his knobbly knees crassus theyre not safe where they are replied cato ushering them into the senators atrium so this isnt a public refuge for waifs and strays they could help us crassus cato pointed at bob particularly this one my gods muttered crassus eyeing the support unit up and down hes a giant and fast very fast added macro crassus nodded the old senator turned back to cato but at this time of night caligulas eyes are everywhere you arrive at my home at this hour youre asking to attract attention crassus looked a little out of breath and can you not see im being washed whatever this is about it can wait cant it we need to talk crassus catos tone conveyed everything it needed to an important matter crassus nodded slowly all right he wafted his hands at the slave lathering his legs and feet with oil off you go tosca he smiled i can finish here myself thank you he waited until his slave was gone and the atrium was empty but for himself and his unexpected visitors he stepped out of the wash bowl on the floor and padded wetfooted across the cool granite floor to a seat cato he began cautiously eyeing bob and the others if this is a matter that might be best discussed in a dark corner i suggest we this big one cato pointed at bob is a stone man oh please he is macro nodded seen him fight with my own eyes he took a sword that would kill any man he turned to look up at bob why dont you show him bob looked at liam who nodded go on muttered liam might as well show him too bob lifted his tunic to expose the sixinch line of puckered flesh across his ribcage to the hilt and out the back added macro ive seen that wound too many times if it doesnt kill you outright itll finish you within hours crassus shuffled over towards bob one hand holding the towel round his waist for modesty he reached the other out and lightly ran his fingers along the seam of knitting flesh this must be an old wound actually it happened earlier this afternoon said cato macro nodded took down a dozen of vareliuss collegia as if they were children crassus stared at the wound up at bob does this monster speak bobs grey eyes panned down to him of course i do his deep voice made a nearby vase vibrate and ring like a tuning fork are are you a man of stone bob looked again at liam and maddy go on said maddy you tell em what you are i am a support unit a genetically engineered life form with advanced adaptive artificial intelligence i am capable of delivering a strengthtoweight ratio of seven hundred per cent crassus shook his head i dont understand the words you are speaking which means added liam hes seven times stronger than any human crassus already roundeyed found a way to open them even wider i have advanced damage limitation and healing systems blood with a thickening agent when exposed to air high concentration of red blood cells delivering oxygenrich which means hes almost impossible to kill crassuss jaw suddenly sagged with horror you brought me one of caligulas no hes not one of the palace guard said cato hes new these people are new to rome theyve just arrived crassuss rheumy eyes small like slits narrowed even further arrived from where cato lowered his voice you were there crassus the day the acolytes the priests talk about you told me you were there in the amphitheatre the statilius taurus seventeen years ago you were one of the few who saw crassus nodded yes i i was one who bore witness he was still studying bob i have never been certain of what we all saw you know cato i do not believe in such things as gods or the emperors foolish notions cato smiled of course but i have no other explanation for the visitation i i do crassus cut in cato these people are like the visitors they come from the same place as them the old mans breath hitched the same place not the heavens crassus for sure a strange place though crassus reached out again and probed the healing wound the old man looked up at bobs face at the ridge of bone that shadowed his eyes the jaw that jutted forward like the prow of a ship thick cheekbones that looked as if theyd been sculpted from stone crassuss lips were dry his old eyes glinted widened and you he said to bob you are your own man you serve no master i take orders from liam oconnor madelaine carter and saleena vikram he replied they are my team so you you are not one of caligulas stone men not one of them bob shrugged i do not understand the question who is them crassus shared a conspiratorial meeting of eyes with cato a silent barely noticeable nod of agreement the visitors they were given a couple of cubicula in the guest wing of senator crassuss home comfortable rooms through several small square irongrated windows the first pale blue light of approaching dawn seeped in rome was still fast asleep the only sound the first twitter of sparrows impatient for the day to start and the rasp of some traders cart wheel across cobblestones in the bluegrey gloom of the receding night the four of them sat together on a bed of silk and linen earlier maddy and the others had listened as the old man crassus and the praetorian tribune cato had talked for several hours men talking carelessly impatiently about their intention to end caligulas disastrous rule before it was too late they learned that crassus was one of the few members of the dissolved senate still alive the entire political class of rome entirely wiped out by years of purges alive solely because he was a wily politician selfserving because hed been one of the few senators to understand their emperor was in an unassailable position and willing very publicly to vote in favour of caligulas order that the senate should dissolve itself theyd listened to the old mans regrets that a stronger more moral man would have stood beside his fellow senators and registered his outrage instead his finelytuned political senses had anticipated caligulas agenda the imperial order had been caligulas rather unsubtle attempt to identify which senators and their families were to face the lions first i am not a brave man hed said i have far too weak a stomach for that kind of thing courage is a thing for young men or dying men marcus cornelius crassus had his life still and his home and wealth because along with a handful of other equally wily old men hed made the right choice at the right time hed managed to quickly distance himself from that foolishly planned attempt on caligulas life nearly fifteen years ago because since then hed been prepared to praise caligulas imperial decrees to flatter the man to endure his poetry recitals to clap enthusiastically at his grotesquely onesided demonstrations of gladiatorial skills but most importantly to donate generously to the emperor crassus was alive and favoured because the advice he uttered to caligula on the few occasions that the emperor deigned to ask for it was what he wanted to hear since that failed attempt my hope was always that caligula would kill himself by accident or in one of his dark moods take his own life but the day of that visitation at the amphitheatre real or not gave him a sense of destiny at least in his own mind and now far too late i finally see that caligula will destroy rome long before he destroys himself crassus had smiled sadly i hope in my final years i have found in me a little of what my friend cato has in abundance quintus licinius cato they learned was a tribune in the guard once upon a time the son of a court slave hed been given his freedom on condition he joined the legions hed served in the second legion stationed on the rhine frontier there hed fought alongside macro for many years guarding the western banks of the river rhine it was the stretchedthin red roman line that was struggling to hold back the eastern hordes that collectively sensed like a pack of hungry dogs that under caligula rome was on the cusp of eating itself despite an unpromising start cato had distinguished himself many times over in combat capable and quickwitted maddy sensed macro looked upon his old comrade with something like fatherly pride theyd bored crassus into going to bed with their bawdy tales from the second stories of heroic rearguard actions and daring counterinsurgency missions that seemed to enthral liam she was looking at liam when macro had said his young friend cato had been only sixteen when hed entered the second a pampered educated court slave paleskinned and whippetthin and unlikely to cope long with the rigours and hardship of army life ill tell you when i first caught sight of young cato i didnt think too much of him looked like a strong fart would blow him over liam had chuckled at that but i watched this young lad turn into a fine soldier and a fine officer they learned that ten years ago macro had retired from the second with his pension and bought the crumbling apartment block in the subura as an investment meanwhile cato had been headhunted by the praetorian guards praefectus always on the lookout for officers with talent finally with macros snoring echoing round the atrium sleeping off crassuss wine cato bid them goodnight and to get some rest there were others he and crassus wanted them to meet tomorrow a slave had shown them to their rooms the stone men are support units said maddy presently clearly and this caligula has a dozen of them as his personal guard added liam but why would they protect caligula asked maddy i mean they wouldnt unless theyve been programmed to affirmative sal made a face incredulity and amusement wrestling with each other you saying caligulas like hacked the code reprogrammed them no of course not but maybe i dunno maybe this caligula fella isnt caligula said liam all three of them turned to look at him as if hed belched unpleasantly he glanced from one face to the next and shrugged what why are you looking at me like that chapter ad imperial palace rome he could never sleep during the hot months of summer even as a child caligula recalled the uncomfortable summer nights in his fathers quarters hearing the noises of an army camp coming through the tent flaps the legions on their various summer campaigns he smiled wistfully half of his childhood spent in innumerable marching camps such a different creature hed been back then just a small boy fascinated by the same things any small boy would be the soldiers who towered over him their armour their swords in his father germanicuss tent he played out the battles germanicus had fought with an army of small wooden soldiers carved by those same men they loved him the legions mascot little boot he looked out over rome now still and dark i am something other now no longer that boy the city had once seemed so vast to him long ago the centre of the civilized world now he saw nothing but an endless tangle of scruffy rooftops and there across the city his magnificent unfinished stairway to the heavens the only beautiful thing out there his eyes were drawn to the night sky a starfilled night the ghosts of silverblue clouds chased each other in front of the moon these days he spent more and more of his time gazing up at the sky particularly on overcast days wondering whether he might catch the slightest glimpse of the heavenly world far above between tumbling anvils of cloud my waiting world my kingdom he stepped away from his window bored with gazing at the city frustrated by the very sight of it to be god not just a god but to be the god the one and only and yet have to wait so interminably to visit the kingdom above i am god so why can i not simply wish myself there and be there caligula shook his head he had no answers to that but then his divine baptism was yet to happen his ascension to heaven then when it was done of course all those godly powers would come to him he could simply wish and things would happen and he would wish good things he would wish wonderful things he would shower rome with wealth and treats he would reward his faithful followers with eunuchs and virgins and fountains of the finest wines there would be bountiful harvests of wheat and maize no one would be hungry again if only those grumbling disbelievers out there could see that yes he would also punish his enemies their fate would be endless torment endless agony he would wish on them all the pox leprosy then hordes of gargoylefaced demons to poke at their weeping skin with sharpened sticks flamehardened and still smouldering he shook his head at the stupidity of men why doubt me they came to me down from heaven to speak to me the doubters were blind blind to the obvious truth thats why he decided those fools whod made that attempt on his life so many years ago would not need their eyes any more how many had there been five hundred six hundred of them to be fair he was certain now that a good few of them had not known anything at all about the plot to kill him but to be the wife or even the child of a conspirator was in some way a form of complicity hed ended up with over a thousand bloody eyeballs staring up at him from where they were piled on his marble floor and their butchered bodies had covered the palace gardens outside caligulas bare feet had carried him absently out of his bedroom into the main atrium there standing guard outside his bedroom was one of the few he could fully trust it is a hot night is it not stern stern such an oddsounding name caligula had tried to rename these guardians of his but they only responded to the names they came with affirmative one degree centigrade hotter than last night caligula smiled nodded some of the things stern and the others said confused him they used words he didnt quite understand he was sure he would understand these words the strange language hed heard stern and the others of his guards use occasionally when he properly became god not so long now will you walk with me stern nodded caligula admired the sculpted contours of the man the fascinating olivecoloured armour he and his men wore so light and yet so effective and their helmets so oddlooking affirmative stern replied his latin perfect his accent still so very foreign caligulas restless feet took him across the atrium down the main passage three steps dutifully behind him the soft clunk of sterns boots the gentle clatter of his armour echoed in the stillness do you ever dream stern negative have you no wishes no fantasies no desires negative i have mission parameters that need to be fulfilled that is all caligula turned and smiled at him curiously you and your men are such a puzzle to me stern you are not like anyone else you do not seem to have the weaknesses of other men other soldiers i never see you sleep he said laughing or get drunk it is not a requirement hed never seen them sleep as such but every now and then stern and his men periodically went into a sort of trance a meditation hed looked in a number of times on the palace quarters hed given them over the years and seen the twelve of them sitting bolt upright on their cots staring into space in perfect motionless silence nothing like the soldiers quarters he remembered from his youth the smell of stale sweat and cheap wine the raucous noise of men off duty the clack of dice on a table raised voices cursing poor fortune the exchange of crude profanities and vulgar stories he rested an affectionate hand on sterns firm neck if only all men were like you dutiful loyal sterns grey eyes rested on him he said nothing but then you arent really normal men are you correct stern had explained on several occasions precisely what he and his colleagues were again using a host of words that caligula couldnt begin to understand but was certain he would one day soon the language of angels so cryptic youre just like me said caligula not of this world this ordinary tedious world but somewhere far greater somewhere magnificent somewhere beyond affirmative we are not from this time he squeezed sterns neck gently feeling the cords of muscle there stern and the others were incredibly powerful for their size and remarkably agile they made superb gladiators in fact perfect gladiators none of the gladiators in the various commercial ludi based around rome had ever managed to beat any of sterns men once just once one of the finest fighters from the ludus at capua a myrmillo had managed to slice through the lower arm of one of sterns men but with just his remaining hand he had been able to finish the gladiator off crushing the mans neck despite the man stabbing and stabbing him over and over with his gladius one of the public displays he put on for the people from time to time a free fight free entertainment and a reminder to those with ideas in their heads that his guards his viri lapidei his stone men were utterly invincible that particular myrmillo had died of course sterns onearmed man had recovered within a couple of days they were paused midway down a long passage lit by the guttering flames of several oil torches to their left a heavy velvet drape shifted subtly caligula pulled the drape aside to reveal a short passage and at the far end a pair of thick oak doors a locking bar across them two more of his stone men stood to attention either side of them i think i shall go and take a look at the oracle stern nodded caligulas bare feet tapped lightly along the smooth floor ahead of him the two guards watched his approach with impassive grey eyes they slid the locking bolt to one side and pushed the heavy doors slowly open beyond a dark room completely dark caligula reached for a tallow candle and lit it from one of the torches he didnt need to instruct either of the guards not to follow him inside they knew the dark space beyond was for caligula alone they were forbidden to enter stern and his men they also knew to close the heavy doors behind caligula as he stepped inside and not to open them again until he rapped his knuckles on them to be let out once more thick hinges creaked under the weight of old oak and caligula found himself standing alone in the darkness the candlelight formed a small pool of brightness on the tiled mosaic of the floor are you awake his voice echoed across the large chamber he took a step into the darkness it was there just ahead of him the candle would pick it out soon i cannot sleep again caligulas voice reverberated in the empty chamber what about you hmmm his candle picked out the front of the wooden box in the middle of the chamber a box like the doors made of thick oak and reinforced with metal brackets he could smell it from here an awful smell not dissimilar to the reek of those overcrowded streets in the subura are you awake in there he heard a shuffling sound inside the box a restless stirring like that of a caged tiger chapter ad rome it took several days in fact for crassus and cato to coordinate a meeting of their fellow conspirators crassus carefully arranged for two other exsenators to discreetly join them cicero and paulus two more elders like crassus were alive because they too were wily politicians and at the right moment had stepped away from the aborted attempt on caligulas life cato brought with him a centurion he trusted from his cohort the palace guard fronto a muscular man in his early thirties with a scar running down the lefthand side of his face and all his teeth missing on that side one other conspirator atellus was a tribune like cato but from another legion the tenth like cato in his late thirties muscular but lean a career officer with a face that gave nothing away and of course catos trusted old friend retired chief centurion macro just seven men prepared to discuss the assassination of a leader that was rapidly driving rome the only beacon of civilization in a dark world of savagery towards a cliff edge do you know how dangerous it is for us to even be in the same room together said cicero he was referring to himself paulus and crassus caligulas spies kept an eye out for any huddled meetings of the few politicians left alive and you have us standing here with these complete strangers they could be theyre not spies cicero im quite certain of that replied crassus they stand out far too much for that he shrugged thats why theyve been my guests here out of sight beyond the reach of spying eyes and wagging tongues rumours had a habit of travelling quickly through the narrow streets and tenement blocks of the poorer districts of rome rumours that could quickly reach the ears of an emperor macro had worked quickly to crush the stories being told by his tenants of the invincible superhuman who had wiped out an entire collegium in mere seconds theyd all seen bob take that mortal wound and walk away from it as if it was just a scratch hed spread the word among his tenants that the large man had unfortunately died of his wounds during the night sadly he was not an invincible champion of the poor and frightened just a good fighter who for a few moments had provided onlookers a rare glimpse of hope and cheer cicero looked at them all and finally nodded in agreement they do indeed look very strange what did he say asked sal quietly maddy waved that away were not from rome she was getting used to the technique of muttering to herself what she wanted to say and then repeating aloud the latin whispered to her were from another place very far away britain i believe you told us maddy shrugged america actually the conspirators looked at each other sal recognized the word amid the latin are you telling them about america ive not heard of that place said cato is that a region of britain liam shot her a cheeky grin not exactly she smiled no ones going to hear of it for another fourteen hundred years atellus was studying bob intently cato you say this man is is like caligulas stone men cato nodded not one of them but he is the same kind the stone men are of particular interest to us said maddy some of the men from the palace cohort think theyre evil spirits muttered fronto dont like being around them cato glanced at maddy what is your interest in them she looked at liam how much to say how much to tell them we believe they come from the same place as us we believe they are the remnants of a larger group of people who arrived here youre talking about the visitors said paulus maddy nodded weve heard so many different stories about what happened about that day i was also there said paulus i was a witness to it can you tell us what you saw it was a long time ago i saw things i couldnt understand paulus shrugged his old rheumy eyes closed since that day i have wondered what we saw sometimes i almost believe it was a shared moment of madness he laughed bad wine even tell me pressed maddy what did you see there were perhaps a hundred of them to my eye as i remember them they looked like ordinary people men and women the stone men appeared to be their soldiers their protectors support units liam uttered in english maddy nodded one of them spoke to the crowd in the arena he spoke in a voice inhumanly loud do you remember what he said paulus shook his head i recall small portions but then i wonder how much of what i remember is a fiction my old mind has conjured up please try and tell us what you remember pauluss eyes twinkled with moisture as he reached back to try and relive the memory he spoke of bringing news that our roman gods were a cruel trick a lie i remember that he said that there was only one god this for sure is part of what he said because i remember thinking that peculiar notion reminded me of of that odd that very strange cult that was coming out of judaea christians paulus frowned eventually nodded yes yes i believe they called themselves something like that he resumed his story the visitor said that they were here to guide us all to to steer us to a better way of life the old man shook his head frustrated with his foggy recall he used words that made little sense to us all words i am trying to remember but paulus looked down at the hands in his lap strange words like he looked up at maddy that word you spoke a minute ago which word the name of the place you said you came from america paulus played with the word on his lips whispered it slowly to himself several times then finally nodded that is the word i believe the voice he told us they had come to show us the americanway sal listening without the benefit of buds picked that phrase out of the exchange in latin did he just say the american way maddy looked at liam and sal some americans came here my god americans sals mouth hung open shaddyah remember that man cartwright cartwright maddy remembered him all too well the classic xfiles type dark suit and a bad smoking habit hed turned up out of the blue knocking on their rollershutter door he and his topsecret agency an agency apparently so secret even presidents had no knowledge of it an agency spawned into existence by the discovery of a mere fragment of flint she shook her head a mere breadcrumb left in time by liam and it had brought men in suits and dark glasses to their door filled the sky above them with circling helicopters its possible sal thing is weve got no idea who else in the future has got their hands on a time machine its what are you two saying asked crassus maddy listened to the latin in her ear im sorry we were discussing what your friend just said the visitors message she turned to paulus so what happened next caligula descended into the arena he approached them we were all in fear of our lives there was panic but caligula i remember this so well he was calm almost as if hed always expected something like this would happen he spoke to them then he stepped aboard their giant chariot the chariot ascended into the sky crassus huffed there are so many different accounts that a host of white horses suddenly appeared from beneath the chariot and carried it up that the ghosts of all those whod ever died in the arena emerged from the dirt and i heard it was a flood of water sprites that carried it up said fronto beautiful seamaidens with long silver hair and the most perfect cato rolled his eyes at the soldiers vulgar fancy quiet antigrav thrusters rumbled bob quietly maddy nodded clouds of dust and debris kicked up by some craft taking off she smiled encouragingly at the old senator please carry on the emperor was carried back to his palace on the palatine continued paulus and the next day he announced in the forum that he was to become god that the visitors had come to tell him this and that he must now spend every moment of his time in preparation for that role that one day he was going to ascend to heaven and rule rome and the whole world from there caligulas madness became worse it had a purpose said cicero the purges the mass crucifixions his twisted new religion from that day it all began what about them visitors those chariots asked liam what happened to that lot there are stories from some who say they saw them a few times after that said crassus the visitors that is caligula showing them some of the city the chariots crassus shrugged they were never seen again said paulus i have sometimes wondered whether i actually saw some sort of trick arranged by caligula a chariot lowered into the arena by some concealed device there was silence for a moment the atrium of crassuss home echoed with the sound of his household slaves preparing food out in his courtyard but the stone men are very real said cato and dangerous caligula has made sure to demonstrate that very publicly the question we have to ask is do you think your stone man could best caligulas guards maddy shrugged possibly even to distract them for a moment said cato thats all a moment when i am close enough to him enough time to strike him down thats all i need thats possible she replied but in exchange we need some help crassus leaned forward go on those chariots we need to find them are they somewhere in rome still crassus shook his head nothing from that day apart from the stone men has ever been seen again but cut in cato there are places in the palace that caligula will allow absolutely no one to go the others looked at him maddy suspected that was information new to them hes given very specific instructions to me on the deployment of the palace guard there are places only he can go big enough to hide these chariots the imperial compound is vast but in the palace itself yes ive seen a reinforced doorway guarded by stone men perhaps in there you might find something maddy stroked her chin thoughtfully for a moment all right then perhaps we can help each other out cato turned to look at crassus and the others silent nods from them all sal tapped her arm gently any chance youre going to tell me what weve just agreed to chapter ad rome the two senators left for their townhouses in the greek district atellus returned to his legion stationed outside the city maddy and liam sat with cato in the shade of a portico watching macro and fronto sparring with bob in the courtyard with wooden training swords crassus chortled and sal hooted with delight at the centurion and excenturions failed attempts to score a touch on bobs torso your stone man is so fast said cato very said maddy hes saved my life many times over added liam oneman army he is tell me cato sat forward what language is that you use when you speak quietly you mean when we whisper to ourselves yes she laughed you must think were totally mad talking to ourselves cato splayed his hands apologetically its a very odd thing you do liam reached up to his ear shall we show him maddy nodded might as well he pulled out his babelbud and handed it to cato youd better explain how it works he said to her this little device translates our language which is called english into latin cato turned the small fleshcoloured bud over in his fingers it actually speaks words to you yes in our ear it hears what we say quietly in english and gives us the correct latin phrase to say he frowned as he looked at it do you mean to say it is this device can understand the meaning of what is said to it yes theres a thing called a computer in there a bit like a mind i suppose an artificial one its an engineered thing catos eyes widened this province of yours with such advanced devices how is it possible that no one has ever come across it before how is it possible no roman has ever heard of america before cato passed the bud back to liam and he carefully placed it back in his ear because its too far away for anyone even any roman to find liams bud was whispering again in his ear you telling him about time travel mads i wouldnt know where to start she replied cato frowned what did you just say to each other it was nothing i suspect youre patronizing me he said with a smile the simpleminded roman soldier eh she made an apologetic face where we come from is very difficult to explain cato why not try she realized how easy and how stupidly incorrect it was to assume that a person from an earlier time was somehow less intelligent just because they might not understand the concept of something as commonplace as a cellular phone or a computer or a light switch it didnt make their minds any less agile we are from the future his eyes narrowed and he rubbed the dark hairs on his forearm as he digested that when you say future are you talking about the passage of days thats right days yet to happen correct you mean to say then you are from time that is ahead of us exactly that said liam a long way ahead see in the future cato mankind will discover how to travel backwards and forwards along time just like travelling along a road a road a road through time the place where we and them visitors came from america doesnt exist yet said liam well it does but it just doesnt have that name yet cato stared at the sparring men as he attempted to absorb what theyd just told him this is an incredible idea he whispered after a while you know as a small boy i used to wonder what it would be like to witness the future to see how things go to imagine what i would be like as a man whether i would ever become a freedman he looked up at them and you say it is possible to do this both of them nodded so how far along this road of time do you come from how many years yes well this is quite a hard thing for me to try and explain i suspect youre patronizing me again both maddy and liam laughed at that all right said liam dont say we didnt warn you thisll really mess with your head so it will he grinned at maddy impishly you gonna tell the poor fella or shall i about two thousand years she said catos jaw hung slack did you just say two thousand just under she shrugged give or take a few years depends on whether you count in jesusyears or normal ones ad anno domini or ce common era jesusyears he cocked his head maddy shook her head thats a whole other story the thing is cato history has a way its meant to go a way its supposed to go and these visitors from the future theyve sent events going off in a different direction a wrong direction maddy and liam proceeded to explain to him the nature of time travel and alternate timelines histories that should never be and how they caused things called time waves reality shifts that erased everything in their path and left monstrous new realities in their wake she was surprised at how well he grasped the notions how intelligent his questions were an agile mind just as keen to peer into the unknown as any of the great thinkers and philosophers hundreds of years down the line by the time theyd finally finished explaining both macro and fronto had had enough swordplay and were hunkered over sweating in the midday sun gasping for breath bob continued playsparring with sal so then said cato you are here to correct events thats right and you say this time we are in right now this would be the rule of claudius not caligula yes claudius that old fool he looked surprised but then shrugged as he gave it some thought better a fool than a madman i suppose he does a pretty good job said liam i read it in a book he conquers britain britain cato laughed whod want to conquer that miserable wilderness they sat in silence for a while watching the fighting listening to the clack of wooden swords cato frowned but your plan to correct history that would mean the end of all this would it not he gestured at crassuss courtyard and the end of all our lives maddy shook her head the end of this version of your life theres another world very much like this one another version with you and macro and crassus its a better version added liam under claudius your roman empire gets richer gets bigger not like it is now cato pondered that as things stood disaster hung like an approaching storm cloud the empire was all but bankrupt the city was on the very edge of starvation as the last of its stores dwindled the regular arrival of food supplies from other provinces and trading partners was beginning to dry up as it became clear that roman debts were going to remain unpaid even if they did manage to get rid of caligula an even greater danger loomed the threat of civil war there were three or four generals he could think of in charge of unpaid and disgruntled legions whod advance on rome to crown themselves emperor once news reached them that the madman was finally gone and if that wasnt enough there were rival empires watching proceedings from the periphery of the roman world like vultures the parthians to the east for example a civil war would surely be the final straw once romes many legions had broken themselves fighting each other barbarian hordes from all over would descend on them to pick the roman carcass clean if these strangers from another time were to be believed that correcting history would return the fate of rome to a more stable footing how it had been when hed been a young boy then that was worth surrendering this life for wasnt it another version of rome would be worth dying for he admitted oh but you dont die said liam not really therell be another you another macro another crassus living the lives you should have lived added maddy and how do you intend to correct this history we believe were hoping really that there may be technology devices left behind somewhere in caligulas palace by the visitors that we might be able to use to get back to our time from there we can correct this more easily the others looked like they were getting ready to come over and join them in the cool shade it might be better if we keep this notion of travelling time like a road to ourselves said cato maddy nodded as they stepped into the shade beneath the portico does this brute of yours ever get tired grunted macro as he slumped on to a bench and reached for a cup of watered wine crassus took a seat beside cato it is time i think that we discuss matters in detail he reached for the jug poured himself a cup of wine and lifted it something our new friends should know this roman officer to my left tribune quintus licinius cato he was addressing maddy and liam in particular this man is the one who has put our gathering of conspirators together he is the one who has risked everything by whispering in dark corners to find the few of us willing to commit to treason he patted cato on the shoulder affectionately i would give my arm to have a small fraction of this mans courage hear hear barked macro filling his cup again and raising it to cato cato picked up his cup to success he turned to liam and maddy and to the return of better times eh aye ill drink to that said liam chapter ad imperial palace rome an eternity of darkness in here this space this world of his measured in mere feet if he flexed his legs his toes his arms his hands he could brush the edge of his minute universe he could feel the surface of it worn smooth now having been touched so many times but he didnt touch the edges of his universe any more not intentionally he preferred to imagine the walls werent there he preferred to live within the endless corridors of his mind now dwelling on memories that were beginning to fade like old photographs pulled out into the daylight too often he could wander through a few special childhood memories could almost be there feel the sand beneath his bare feet the warmth of the sun on his face smell his mother hear his father and brother only when he heard the doors creak open and the ghosts of real daylight stole through the slits between the oak planks of his universe was he pulled away from his memoryworld once every day the grim return to reality as someone presumably one of the slaves brought a bowl of water and that bittertasting barley gruel pulled open the feeding slot to his small cubed universe and pushed it through for him as the slot closed the heavy doors outside creaked shut and his universe became a uniform blank darkness once again he would feel with his hands for his bowl of water and his bowl of gruel if he could have talked that once daily ritual might be his chance to communicate with someone even if it was just to say a thankyou but he couldnt talk he could grunt he could whimper he could howl oh yes he could slobber and whine but he couldnt talk he called the mask mr muzzy his muzzle the only other permanent occupant inside this wooden box me and mr muzzy the iron brace around his jaw with a protuberance a tube of iron that kept his teeth prised apart mouth open and pressed his tongue back preventing him from forming anything that sounded remotely like words that was mr muzzy the gruel could be spooned down into mr muzzys hollow tube it slid down inside it and into his mouth where often he gagged on it several times before being able to swallow it it took a long time to spoon his daily gruel into that he imagined it probably took hours but then in complete darkness in almost complete sensory isolation how does one measure time mr muzzy was his tormentor the alwaysthere taste of iron in his mouth the sores where the brace rubbed his skin raw sores that constantly wept and crusted up wept and crusted up once a million years ago it seemed mr muzzy broke the brace had weakened his constantly weeping pus had corroded the thin band of iron around his head enough that waggling it to and fro it had finally buckled and fallen away from his face and then oh god then hed screamed hadnt he his ragged voice had startled him terrified him the sound of words instead of gurgling sounded alien strange hed screamed for hours terrified by the babble of insanity that was coming out of him then the creak of the doors the faint hairlines of light entering his box and the feeding slot opening later the same day there was a brandnew mr muzzy a much thicker stronger iron band cinched tight round his head and back in complete darkness once again hed wept and wept and wept ever since that time however long ago it was hed learned that the best thing he could do was to try and live as far away as possible from this place wander the corridors of his mind and open doors into rooms full of gradually fading memories and frolic and play in the twilight sunshine that existed in there one day those memories would fade completely every room of his mind would be as empty and featureless and as dark as this place and when that finally happened he guessed he was truly going to be insane chapter ad rome an ingenious plot said crassus he looked at cato devious even admirably devious macro nodded at that even as a snottynosed young optio cato was a smartarse i had to be replied cato a young soft strip of a boy in the legions it was either be tough or be clever and i wasnt much of a fighter back then macro grinned turned out all right in the end though didnt you lad cato shrugged that away the legions have a way of finding out whats in you liam smiled at the interplay between cato and macro clearly both men were fond of each other brothers in arms over the last few days macro had frequently come by a visitor to crassuss home of no particular interest to any of caligulas spies that might be watching he had plenty of tales to tell them of his time in the second legion serving alongside cato firstly as catos commanding officer and in the latter years watching this young man mature and become a firstclass officer who would eventually outrank him liam saw a vague reflection of himself and bob in these two one of them the brains of the partnership the other the brawn your plot said maddy caligula may be insane but he isnt stupid he knows full well that the power of an emperor isnt in what the people the citizens of rome think its in the support of her legions treat the legions well and theyll do their best to keep you in power cato sat forward in his seat when he first became emperor he had a lot of money to make use of bought the support where he needed it now theres so little money left hes stripped the assets from almost every wealthy family in the city and most of that money is going towards paying the praetorian guard and the only other two legions in italy the tenth and the eleventh and paying them very well all the other legions of the empire hes made sure to station as far away from rome as possible guarding our failing frontiers far away because hes not paying them said liam precisely its a foolish emperor that allows a disgruntled legion anywhere near home the praetorians the tenth legion the eleventh legion those men will happily fight and die to keep caligula as their emperor that doesnt sound promising said maddy the trick of this plot is deception a sleight of hand this plot hinges on being able to fool these two legions and the praetorians into thinking the other is making some kind of a move against caligula a wry smile spread across catos lean face were going to make them fight each other macro shook his head i used to lose money playing dice with this lad we need to provoke the tenth and eleventh into marching on rome we need those men to believe the praetorians are preparing to launch a coup against caligula at the same time we need the praetorian guard to believe these two approaching legions are attempting to launch their very own coup as soon as he hears the news of their marching on rome caligula will have to react he cant afford to appear weak or intimidated hell have to order his praetorians out to face them with nothing but a skeleton garrison left behind guarding the government district and the imperial palace i have a better chance of cornering and killing him provided your bob can deal with the stone men would he not have his men stay behind and defend the city asked liam thats what id do thats not how legions fight said macro their strength lies in having room to manoeuvre an open plain if caligulas guard are still stuck in the city when those two legions turn up theyll simply be bottled up inside those legions will simply camp outside rome and starve the fools until they come out weakened then of course their backsll be against the wall macros right caligula will want them out and on the battleground of his choosing as i say hes not stupid so how are you planning to get those two legions to suddenly believe the praetorians are planning to turn on caligula asked maddy cato sat back and let crassus answer that general lepidus commands those two legions the old man replied hes a careerminded general he very nearly joined us came here to my home on several occasions hes no friend of caligula but hes certainly not an idealist hell sit tight because his men are well paid and so is he but i have been working on him quietly discreetly and hes prepared to help crassus laughed no of course not the man is a coward he became nervous and excused himself from our plans isnt that dangerous asked liam what if he told caligula about you he wont hes already implicated ive been doing my best to make the fat oaf look as guilty as possible of conspiring against caligula bribes and gifts in certain places correspondence in his name a whispered word or two in caligulas ear and hell want lepiduss head on a spike alongside mine the trick is said cato to let lepidus know that someone is about to whisper of his treachery to caligula lepidus knows that with caligula there is no right of reply he wont get a chance to try and prove his innocence the only thing hell be able to do is act quickly either run for his life or make a preemptive move on caligula but i thought you said his men would fight to defend the emperor said liam the men of a legion will always follow their general up to a point that is so yes he will convince them that theyre marching on rome to protect their emperor not usurp him and how will he do that cato shrugged the regular legions are always suspicious of the praetorian guard atellus the officer you met the other day liam and maddy nodded he is one of lepiduss tribunes hell feed lepidus enough hearsay and rumour that even that idiot general can convince his men the praetorians are up to no good if those soldiers suspect for one moment their generous benefactor caligula might be replaced with another emperor less generous cato grinned theyll be on their feet and marching towards rome maddy and liam looked at each other and grinned thats clever said liam while atellus is pouring suspicion into lepiduss ear i will be doing the same with caligula added cato what maddy sat upright you meet with him im the tribune in charge of the palace cohort of course i do almost every day i believe he is beginning to trust me perhaps even likes me sometimes we talk and im as close to him as i am to you right now i could try and have a go at him but his stone men are fast you wouldnt stand a chance said macro caligula does listen to me he doesnt listen to the praefectus but i know he trusts my advice perhaps if i can persuade caligula to send some of his stone men into battle and get your bob within the palace itself its possible he could overcome any of them left behind and us as well said liam could you get us inside too perhaps bob maddy said in english she patted the mound of one knee you up for it he replied in english cato crassus and macro looking on in silence as they talked the description we have of these stone men suggests they are thirdgeneration military recon units designed to have normal physiques and pass more easily as human beings as a full musclechassis combat unit i am approximately fiftyfive per cent stronger this gives me a tactical advantage and you did sort out that other unit that came through the portal said sal and that was another big one just like you but it was missing feet and a hand replied bob this also gave me an advantage but do you think you can take them down said maddy more than one individually yes more than one at a time this would be difficult she sucked air through her teeth were rolling our dice on a pretty steep bet were helping these guys with their coup and theres no guarantee we get anything out of this there may be nothing in the palace no tech no displacement unit nothing in which case that leaves us stuck here said sal right said liam maddy nodded right and without bob if those stone men kill him added sal they looked at each other a decision unresolved hung in the space between them actually if computerbob doesnt activate that sixmonth window his head chips going to end up as helmetspaghetti anyway said maddy hell be a dribbling vegetable the three roman men were looking at them expectantly even if we end up successfully killing caligula said maddy we might also not find anything in the palace that can get us back home well the way i see it is this if we are goin to be stuck here for good id not want to live here with this caligula fella still in charge there is that maddy nodded slowly if this is it for us if this time we really cant put things right and were stuck here for good i think id rather caligula wasnt around she turned to bob how does that fit with your mission priorities his deep voice rumbled this is an already contaminated timeline if we cannot correct it the mission has failed whatever course of action you choose to take bit of a downer there bob said maddy but youre quite right she consciously switched back to listening to the translator burbling quietly in her ear ok count us in chapter ad imperial palace rome caligula felt a tremble of excitement course through his body this place this large chamber was once a temple to neptune now it was a temple to himself more than that an act of homage to his approaching destiny its large marble and tiled walls echoed his light footsteps as he walked among the artefacts inside with those large heavy doors closed the daylight outside was entirely gone the only illumination the flickering flame of the golden oil lamp he held in his hand objects that the visitors left behind he crouched down and picked through the strangelooking things incredible his voice echoed round the chamber such curious possessions they had brought with them he never tired of looking at them there was a shuffling coming from the wooden cage in the middle of the chamber but you see that is something i find so fascinating these devices of yours he picked up an empty hydrocell the smooth metal glinted in the gloom a residue of liquid sloshed around inside its casing i always believed gods needed nothing that a mere wish a desire was all that was required for a thing to happen and yet you and your friends brought with you all these odd contraptions objects you needed a mewling whimper came from the cage he tilted the hydrogen fuel cell listening to the liquid inside objects that stopped working for you eventually he smiled not particularly godlike he tossed it on to the pile of other items empty ammo cartridges guns backpacks firstaid packs flashlights and wandered over towards the cage he remembered how utterly bewitched hed been when theyd first arrived such a stunning remarkable arrival such noise such spectacle that day in the arena like every other roman citizen looking on he was certain hed been gazing upon heavenly beings his heart had thrummed in his chest with the thrill of it and of course there had been an almost paralyzing terror at the idea of it gods or at the very least emissaries of the gods here in rome right before us caligula recalled that childlike wonder approaching those enormous chariots and seeing up close the remarkably humanlike passengers emerging from them some of them as fairskinned as those barbarous savages in the northern parts of germania some of them as dark as egyptians all of them wearing such delightfully strange garments hed been trembling like a leaf fearful as a small child before an enraged parent the voice had boomed out across the floor of the arena and bounced off the stalls all around them a thunderclap voice announcing in heavily accented latin that they had come from above to enlighten them to show them new ways to offer them the gift of enlightenment wisdom and finally emboldened by the knowledge that several thousand of his subjects were watching that a roman emperor ought to be the one to lead the way he had slowly reached out with a trembling finger and dared to touch one of them caligula had done that half expecting that at the first slightest touch of this creature from heaven he would burn instantly to cinders as the power of elysium itself flooded into him caligula pulled the viewing slot of the cage to one side and peered at the darkness within it stank of human faeces and stale urine an appalling stench worse than any of those awful plebeian marketplaces or perilously tall topsyturvy apartment blocks by the light of his oil lamp he could see the wretch inside like a caged wild animal restless and wideeyed he realized now even back then all those years ago the moment his finger had touched warm skin damp with sweat flesh just like his own that the visitors were just ordinary people not gods or messengers of the gods hello he uttered the man murmured and gurgled something behind his muzzle i apologize its been some time since we talked said caligula with a gentle smile quite rude of me he produced a bronze key waved it so his captive could see it come here i shall take your muzzle off and you and i can talk the man moved suddenly like a wild animal grabbing for the key the viewing slot was wide enough for a hand of clawlike fingers to thrust out caligula took a step back uhuh turn round theres a good fellow the man glared at him through the slot for a moment caligula could only see his eyes above the corroded bronze face mask and the gunkencrusted hollow of the feeding tube a dark rigid oval frozen in a permanent corroded o turn round he said waving his key again out of reach of the waggling claws the glaring eyes disappeared into the darkness and then a moment later caligula could see the back of his head the bronze padlock securing the brace and one or two tufts of lank hair drooping over and the soreridden skin rubbed completely bald by the rough metal band caligula reached through the slot inserted the key and twisted with a dull click the padlock sprang open and the brace fell away the head instantly spun round those glaring eyes on him once more but now he could see the mans slim nose and below that a thick nest of moustache and beard bristles clotted with dried mucus and rotten food in the middle of it like a pair of newborn hairless rats in the bottom of a coarse nest two lips mottled with scabs and abrasions old and new they flexed and fidgeted revealing bloody gums and the rotted black stumps of a few remaining teeth hello my old friend said caligula the man struggled to move his mouth savouring the freedom for his tongue to actually wander around his clawfingers probing his crusted lips pitifully it is the month of sextilis once again so its not so very long now is it the man was still flexing his mouth relishing this fleeting moment of freedom from the mask caligula suspected the crazed old fool was getting ready to cry out in that strange garbled language of his he tried the same thing every time the muzzle came off the same strangled word save your breath your stone men wont be able to hear you the doors are closed and they are all on the other side of the palace its just you and i in here the pitiful wreck of a man tried anyway sucking in a lungful of fetid air then screaming system ooverride enenable ssponge his voice was a frail and feeble gasp like a faltering breeze across marshland reeds trust me smiled caligula they really cant hear you nonetheless he tried again this time his croaking voice had a shrill and desperate power behind it the asylum scream of some unhinged wretch and it was the same meaningless word over and over again gibberish to caligula spongebubba spongebubba sponge bubba chapter ad rome so maddy that thing about caligula joining the gods you remember the information you got off your computer maddy nodded shed not forgotten she looked ahead of them at sal and bob they were walking along a narrow avenue outside crassuss walled garden traders set up temporary stalls along the base of the pinkpainted wall early every morning stalls that could trade for a few hours before the midmorning call to prayer sounded across the rooftops of rome and caligulas acolytes started patrolling the streets to be sure every citizen was obediently on their knees in homage to their emperor and god the unlicensed traders and their illegal stalls were packed up and long gone before then charcoal graffiti covered the flaking pink paint latin tags of one collegium or another slogans crude jokes and vulgar stickman drawings one clearly depicted the emperor a stick man with an oakleaf halo above his head and exaggerated booted feet maddy squinted at what it seemed to be waving around in its hand without her glasses on the entire street was in soft focus it seemed to be a oh perlease she tutted in disgust joining with the gods prompted liam thats supposed to be soon isnt it yes there wasnt a date but the data theyd pulled up did say something about it being in the summer should we not tell the others about that though i mean its important i im not sure we should why not well look think about it if they learn from us that actually caligula might not be around for much longer theyll abandon their plans right i mean why risk your life if you just need to be patient and wait a few more weeks months they watched sal cajoling bob into bartering with a trader maddy very much doubted any haggling was going to last particularly long with something as big and as intimidating as bob on one side of the transaction liam this ascending to the gods thing it could mean anything its far too ambiguous for us to assume it means anything it could mean he just got sick of a disease and died and his priests decided to make up something that sounded suitably exciting and godlike aye true on the other hand she added it could be a portal he looked at her and grinned well i was thinking the very same thing so i it might be that theres some timetravel tech somewhere in his palace thats been in a dormant state and it starts to activate maybe something on a timer a bit like one of our sixmonth windows but much longer she looked at him see thats why weve got to get in there before whatever happens to caligula happens and cato and the others theyre our only way in were using them said liam he didnt look entirely happy about that she knew hed warmed to those two cato and macro yes she sighed yes technically we are sort of using them doesnt seem right oh sheesh she cursed under her breath why do i always have to be the freakin bad guy huh truth was maddy had learned to think of an alternate timeline as something not entirely real almost cartoonlike a virtual world even these were lives that were not meant to have been lived in some cases perhaps they were better lives than they should have been more often at least so far theyd been horrible lives lived through horrible timelines yes perhaps she should have told cato that something in this timeline was due to happen to caligula very soon but if whatever happened happened in the palace on the palatine with them sitting around out here and god help them they missed it then that really might be their one and only chance to get back home wasted we have to get in there liam and we have to get in there before anything activates do you get it this might just be our only way back home he stroked the tuft of bristles perched on his chin thoughtfully aye well i suppose so we dont tell them we need them to act on their plans the sooner the better so then our friend here is quite correct crassus acknowledged maddy with a nod there is no need to delay a moment longer with our conceit to lure away some of these stone men and with the help of yours we have a chance for you to get to caligula cato the longer we delay the more chance there is that one of caligulas spies will notice our gatherings crassus looked round at the others the two senators cicero and paulus had attended atellus had made a trip over from the tenth legions permanent camp fronto the senior centurion of the palace guard cohort was there and of course cato and macro i know caligula already suspects me of whispers behind his back cato nodded agreed we have a workable plan now i say we proceed immediately although the gathered men stirred uneasily there were no objections to that right crassus reached into the folds of his toga and produced some scrolls this is the evidence you can present to caligula cato he handed cato the scrolls cato unravelled them and scanned them quickly this is correspondence between lepidus and you the old man nodded if i hand this over to caligula hell have men outside your front door within the hour it has to be convincing crassus smiled my name on these letters will be enough to ensure caligula sends for lepidus as well the moment he hears both he and i have been summoned hell know his involvement with us albeit a fleeting one has been exposed crassus if i do this you should leave rome if no if i run before they come for me it will suggest i have foreknowledge i must be caught redhanded by caligula for this to fool him more importantly for him to fully trust you cato he may already know you have visited me met with me you have to betray me cato you have to hand me to caligula as a traitor he hunched his shoulders i will comply i will play the innocent old man and then when he threatens me with torture i will implicate lepidus cato shook his head we need you alive and well crassus when caligula is dead we will need all of you he looked at cicero and paulus well need every last one of you to rebuild the senate the senate needs men far younger than i crassus smiled anyway i dont plan to die caligula will want to keep me alive to execute alongside lepidus in some elaborate public display cato looked at atellus then we must be sure general lepidus will make his move quickly he will smiled atellus hes already nervous about his meetings with you last year crassus he has no wish to be made a martyr and his legions theres no love lost between the tenth eleventh and the guard cato nodded then it looks like this is our time when will you present this evidence to caligula asked cicero on my return to the palace he looked at crassus they will come for you tonight are you ready for that my affairs are all in order atellus you should leave immediately then and carry the news back to general lepidus that arrests of suspected traitors are being made in rome this very evening thatll put the wind up him it certainly will cato held the scrolls of correspondence in his hand as soon as caligula sees these letters hell issue an order for lepiduss immediate arrest i suspect the arrest order and a party of praetorians will arrive not very long after you atellus grinned therell be no sleep for him tonight lets just hope he decides to go on the offensive and not turn and run he addressed the senators you two should go into hiding as soon as crassus is revealed as a conspirator caligula may decide to round up the rest of the surviving senate pick friends you can trust and stay out of sight until you hear that caligula is dead what about me asked macro i want you to look after our new friends keep them safe as soon as i have convinced caligula to move the guard out to confront lepidus ill send for you how will you get us into the palace asked maddy cato gave it a moments thought youll be my property and macroll be bringing you into the palace grounds for safekeeping a perfectly sensible thing for me to ask permission to arrange there will be riots and unrest in the city when the people witness the majority of caligulas praetorians marching out he took a deep breath tonight and for the next few days few weeks this city will be in a state of anarchy even after caligula is dead it will be a dangerous time general lepiduss men the praetorians and every other legion near italy will be mobilizing to put their candidate on the throne we need the senate reestablished quickly and order restored fast if were to avoid a civil war romes sickly enough without the prospect of that said paulus quite all of you should use tonight to prepare for this macro you should make sure you have extra food in and be ready to fortify your apartments this city will descend into hell the collegia will almost certainly make use of the chaos to raid and loot and settle old scores right you are if were very lucky said cato the majority of the bloodshed will be outside rome the tenth eleventh and the guard will incapacitate each other the palace cohort will be right here in the city under my command caligula will be dead and we will have a small window of time to restore a republic cicero looked at him for a few days cato you understand you will in effect be the protector of rome quite possibly the only cohesive military force within a hundred miles of rome it takes a strong will to voluntarily surrender that kind of power back to the people nows not the best time to start doubting me cicero the politician looked taken aback i was just say macro spat a curse id trust cato with my life cato glanced at maddy at liam a momentary meeting of eyes a fleeting understanding this was not meant to be caligula has to go before its too late for rome what if fronto began go on fronto thank you sir i just thought it might be worth saying what if caligula really is well you know a god atellus snorted with laughter thats not such a stupid question replied cato soldiers are a superstitious lot something we should be mindful of a bad omen a rumour something as trivial as that can swing the allegiance of them at a time like this most of em are semiliterate wineswilling knuckledraggers grunted macro wiping his nose on the back of his hand cato looked at him shook his head and smiled macro scowled back and whats that look supposed to mean chapter ad rome late afternoon sunlight painted the claybrick walls of every building a warm peach and cast violet shadows into every narrow alley and rat run the streets were busy with vendors packing up their shop fronts and pulling shutter doors to for the approaching evening liam and bob flanked macro maddy and sal a few steps behind what was it like in the legions asked liam macro repeated the question liam nodded ive seen some he was going to say films but stopped himself only cato knew where and when theyd come from that might change at some point but for now the fact that theyd come from some place beyond the known roman world was enough to share well macro shrugged ill be honest i probably moaned all the way through my twentyfive years in the second it was either hard work or damned boring and plenty of years spent shivering in cold damp places i wouldnt wish on my worst enemy he smiled wistfully but id have those days back if i could they stepped aside for a pair of caligulas acolytes wearing long green robes it was approaching evening prayers and the calling horns would be sounding across the roof tiles soon why i miss the i dont know i suppose i miss the sense of brotherhood they really are an ugly stupid foulsmelling lot of lowlifes the lads in any legion not the sort youd want to bring home to meet the family if you get my meaning but he shook his head looking for a way to make his point but together you and those men youre something more part of something greater do you understand liam nodded he thought he probably did he and the girls bob and becks even computerbob they were their very own unit sort of with someone else by your side someone you know would throw down their life to save yours somehow it made staring into a hopeless abyss possible macro echoed his thoughts back then i would have died for any one of my lads and i know theyd have done the same followed me into hell itself if id ordered it but now he shrugged sadly i see faces i recognize every so often lads retired from the legions or even deserters just thugs and crooks some of them now a lot of them hired men in the various collegia id kill them without a second thought if i needed to how long did you and cato serve together oh now i suppose it must have been about twelve years he laughed good times then most of it well some of it he came as a freshly freed slave from the imperial household of the julii as thin as a strip of willow and soft as a peach and completely clueless about army life i thought the lad wouldnt last a week he looked at liam ive told you that already havent i liam nodded i suppose i took pity on him at first took him under my wing taught him how to become a soldier and in return he taught me how to read he laughed made this dumb old centurion appreciate some of the finer things in life chapter ad imperial palace rome caligula stood in the main atrium admiring the construction of these weapons every now and then he brought them out of the darkness and studied their smooth wellhoned lines and curves there were no scrapes scratches or the hammer marks of a craftsman it was as if these things had been born not made he gazed at them spread out on a satin sheet beautiful mysterious weapons his caged guest had once told him these things were called t pulse carbines weapons that spat death at the mere squeeze of a finger caligula had once long ago asked to have a go at using one but the visitor called stilson a man he found to be rather annoying and loudly spoken had refused him saying he was from a time too primitive to understand such things caligula smiled at the mans breathtaking arrogance at his assumption that their intellect was far greater than these romans theyd come back in time to rule more wisely yes caligula had fully understood what they were certainly not gods hed known that almost from the first moment in fact they were just men men from a far future his frequent private discussions with that darkskinned young man had helped him to understand that the parthianlooking one who was called rashim the one who had the most knowledge of such incredible things the one who could be promised the role of coemperor of all and be foolish enough to believe it was genuine the one who could be flattered so easily young enough naive enough to believe all the empty assurances and promises caligula had given him rashim theyd come here the young man had told him all those years ago because their world was no good any more it was poisoned and dying more than that a pestilence had suddenly arrived that killed everything in its path theyd had no choice rashim had told him that they had knowledge of a science that allowed them to open a door on to an impossible dimension to step through it and appear back in the real world at a time of their choosing it was clear from the young mans description that he knew little of this dimension it was knowledge beyond even his science but caligula thought he understood what it was they had passed through from rashims words white like snow infinite endless beautiful terrifying it could only be one place heaven itself these shortsighted fools had passed directly through heaven to come here and make themselves kings and emperors if theyd had an ounce of wisdom between them they would have realized heaven was the true goal to step through it and actually leave it behind them now that surely was the very definition of madness it was only six months after the visitors had arrived made themselves at home in his imperial compound that caligula learned his guests werent quite as invincible as they believed they were their protectors the stone men were in a way just like their other devices merely tools that could be used for a purpose used switched on switched off one just needed to know how to do such things the young man rashim knew he had an understanding of them an understanding of how to give them instructions that made them behave very differently just a few words spoken by me rashim had promised him and they will follow your orders they will do anything i ask yes of course its a standby mode a diagnostic mode and they will forever follow my commands rashim had nodded unless they hear the reset code sequence then theyll reboot and return to their last mission parameter set then rashim caligula had smiled warmly you and i shall rule side by side i dont want the others hurt in any way caligulas assurance had been enough for the gullible young man it was a night of killing nine months after the visitors had arrived the palaces smooth marble walls had echoed with the screams of slaughter into the early hours of the morning as the stone men hunted them down one by one their leader that arrogant fool stilson caligula had made sure they captured him alive his torment had lasted several days and rashim caligula giggled at the young mans naivety the night of the bloodletting as all the other visitors had been enjoying his lavish hospitality in a quiet room away from the main atrium away from the noise of raised voices and laughter the twelve stone men had assembled as requested in obedient silence rashim spoke his special sequence of words that unlocked these automatons the stone men had all seemed to momentarily fall into a trance only to stir moments later a seemingly very different look in their cool grey eyes caligulas first order had been for the one called lieutenant stern to silence rashim before he could speak again and so the night of bloodletting began eight hours later dawn had shone into the palace shards of sunlight across these very marble floors spattered with drying pools of blood his stone men were already stacking the bodies in the courtyard and preparing a funeral pyre and the young man rashim was waking up in his cage muzzled waking up to the realization that the rest of his life was going to be lived in that cage caligula stopped stroking the cool smooth metal of the weapons spread out like museum exhibits across the purple satin he looked out at the panorama of rome getting ready to bed down for the evening a rich warm dusk bathed the labyrinth of claybrick and whitewashed walls and terracotta roof slates thin threads of smoke rose into the sky from every district many of them from bonfires of the daily dead disease spoiled water the normal attrition of such a big city he shrugged things would be better for his people soon when he returned he listened to the distant echo of horns across the city summoning the people out of their homes to pay homage to him he could see the dark outline of his marvellous stairway up to heaven a stairway he was going to descend to visit this world once he had stepped into the white mists of heaven and finally become what hed always been destined to become god his reverie was broken by the sound of bare feet whispering on the smooth floor he looked up to see stern step forward to intercept a slave and in a hushed voice ask him what message he had for the emperor the slave prostrated himself immediately as soon as he noticed caligula looking at him what is it the tribune of the guard wishes to see you replied stern says it is important caligula sighed he was tired he rather fancied curling up on the satin alongside the weapons and resting his pounding head against that cool metal soothing but this tribune of the palace cohort yes he quite liked this new one quite an intelligent and engaging man for an army officer what was his name he struggled to remember yes all right send him in chapter ad imperial palace rome cato entered caligulas atrium hed been in here on only half a dozen occasions since being appointed to command the palace guard the room was cavernous and every noise seemed to echo endlessly he had only ever seen caligula alone the emperor it seemed preferred his royal family as far away as possible preferred his own company he was alone except for one of his stone men the one called stern and of course half a dozen slaves waiting patiently by the walls for his bidding almost unnoticeable still like frescos murals not really humans in caligulas eyes cato stopped a respectful distance from caligula and saluted caesar the emperor smiled a greeting ahh yes i remember now its cato isnt it cato nodded yes sire tribune quintus licinius cato come on now dont be rude stern say hello to our visitor the support unit looked at cato blankeyed hello cato regarded him in silence for a moment he had seen these things up close many times over the last few months they unsettled his men to be entirely honest they unsettled him too while he didnt believe in supernatural explanations hed always been certain there was something not entirely human about them now he knew what they were manmade constructions made from flesh and bone instead of wood and metal what is it tribune caligula settled back on a seat he beckoned cato closer come over so were not barking at each other cato took a dozen steps closer as he neared caligula he noticed the stone man watching him closely apparently its something important it is sire i i have come across evidence of a plot against you caesar caligula sat up a plot you say plans to try and well to kill you sire the emperors face reddened slightly and he offered a tired sigh they never stop do they he pulled himself to his feet and approached cato kill me you say cato nodded all these conniving old fools all they care about are their own petty agendas advancing themselves the careers of their sons and nephews marrying money to status or the other way round cutting each others throats for profit awful people he smiled sadly at cato its the poor common man i feel so sorry for ruled by these inbred cretins for far too long he noted the scrolls clasped in catos hands so then which meddling fools want me dead now cato silently held out several scrolls correspondence sire caligula snatched them from his hand unrolled one and scanned it quickly crassus that driedup old fig why am i not surprised by that he looked up at cato as if this was an old conversation theyd had many times over you know i should have had every last one of those gossiping old relics done away with im too much of a soft touch thats my problem he looked back down at the correspondence and read on in silence lepidus caligula looked genuinely surprised lepidus yes sire caligula opened the scroll and read further his face turning a deeper red as his lips silently moved the ungrateful fat wretch ive given him and his men everything they take pay three times what they would have normally they he lepidus pledged his allegiance he swiped his hand at a bowl of fruit on a stand the bowl clattered noisily on to the floor and rolled across it like a cart wheel finally coming to rest spinning and rattling with a noise that echoed round the atriums walls and off down the passage caligula spat a curse lepidus that slug actually got on his knees and prayed directly to me prayed to me said he always knew i was more than a mere man the general tells you what he thinks you want to hear said cato caligula balled his hand into a shaking fist the deceitful he stood before me not so long ago got on his knees before me and told me he believed in me that he he turned on cato you believe in me dont you tribune you believe i will ascend to heaven soon and take my place dont you because you know it isnt long now not long at all cato hesitated and realized in the space of several heartbeats that his hesitation was foolish he should have anticipated this sort of question been ready and practised with an answer caligula swung his hand up and placed a finger roughly against catos lips no dont answer me his eyes were wide and glassy with tears of anger tell me why why is it so very hard to believe why is it so difficult to imagine that i could be something more than human hmmm i have wisdom an infinite capacity for love i know things no other man does the visitors came for me you know not anyone else they came and they told me everything he leaned closer lowering his voice to little more than a hoarse whisper more than that i have ambition when i am taken up when i step into the heavens and receive my powers we wont need legions any more to pacify those barbarians in germany in britain well do it with my love my compassion ill bless their crops their water ill make the sun shine warmth and light on those cold dark places and they will love me for it caligulas finger remained on catos lips and if that doesnt work then i can just as easily send plagues on them turn the skies black with storms make them fear me he smiled love and fear they are after all halves of the same circle at some point on the arc one becomes the other caligula was standing so close to him cato could feel the emperors hot breath on his face catos hands flexed by his side his left wrist brushed against the iron pommel of his gladius i could kill him now reach for my sword and kill him right now only he wouldnt get a chance stern was no more than a yard away and could move frighteningly fast cool dispassionate grey eyes were regarding him closely right now warily analysing the ticks of muscle in his face noting the subtle flexing of his fingers near his sword he could try and reach for it but cato doubted hed even manage to get the blade out of its scabbard before the stone man had run him through i i am just a soldier sire said cato his lips moving against the light touch of caligulas finger my only concern is your safety that is all the anger in caligulas face the faraway look in his eyes vanished in an instant an ugly mask of rage whipped away and replaced with something that looked genuine a warm welcoming smile he stroked catos cheek affectionately i love the simplicity in that answer no judgement no doublespeak no lies the simplicity of a good soldiers mind a task a duty and how best to perform it caligula stepped back from him i will of course have both of their heads on spikes for this have crassus arrested immediately cato nodded and what about general lepidus caesar caligula pursed his lips thoughtfully it might be prudent if i were to summon him with no reasons given rather than openly have him arrested he may be a fat spineless slug but if he suspects hes shortly due to lose his head he may try and do something rash yes sire tell him caligula rested a finger thoughtfully on his chin just tell him i wish to speak to him nothing alarming do you understand i merely wish to speak to him cato nodded i will see to it immediately good replied caligula distractedly good and let me know when you have got crassus i would like to have a little talk with him as well yes sire caligula turned away from cato and strolled towards the window and balcony that looked out on the darkening city skyline ahh now look how annoying ive just missed my sunset he uttered wistfully chapter ad miles north of rome what general lepidus sputtered wine across his desk its what ive heard sir this very afternoon lepidus stood up and the chair legs barked across the wooden floor arrests the young tribune shuffled uncomfortably his helmet respectfully under one arm he was still puffing from his exhausting fivehour ride from the city come on atellus what are you prattling on about lepiduss voice sounded shrill and sharp almost effeminate he hated it when nerves anxiety made him sound that way arrests crassus was one of them lepiduss wide face instantly paled crassus atellus nodded lepidus slumped back down in his chair it creaked under his heavy frame he looked shaken crassus gods help me hell talk at the first sign of pain he looked at his subordinate and names will be mentioned atellus you and i the tribune nodded lepidus wiped his mouth his skin already damp and tacky with anxiety i curse that withered old prune for roping me into his bloody politics a couple of visits thats all him and atellus that had been enough for him to realize the old man was going to get them all killed if he wasnt a great deal more careful lepidus had backed away quickly from the fools small gathering of conspirators deliberately ignored his repeated invitations to rejoin them he should never have gone in the first place but ambition vanity had piqued his curiosity crassus had suggested rome might need a protector in the aftermath should something happen to caligula someone with power popular with his soldiers near to hand and no great fan of the emperor someone someone like himself lepidus had brought along an officer he trusted atellus expecting a lunch at the old politicians expense and a carefully worded conversation a gentle probing of his thoughts on what direction rome should take should something regrettably happen to their emperor what he hadnt expected was an assembly of strangers and such open reckless dangerous talk and such a pitiful assembly of conspirators three senators a tribune of the guard and one or two others what he should have done was leave the meeting immediately and report them all to the emperor just as soon as he could but he hadnt he and atellus had returned and said nothing about the matter to anyone enough right there to be deemed as guilty as crassus and his conspirators in caligulas eyes and to make matters worse crassus had been badgering him to come back sending presents even dammit he reached for the cup on the desk in front of him nearly knocking it over and spilling wine across the nest of scrolls in front of him the routine and endless paperwork of a legion encamped he emptied the cup quickly and wiped his mouth that treacherous old snake has been playing games with me sir lepidus winced cursed under his breath he sent me several gifts over the last year those parthian horses that attractive slave atellus nodded he knew full well about them most of the camp did the slave had been particularly well received by the general sir surely those gifts have nothing to do with this dont you see you idiot crassus has been trying to make it look like im part of his mischief hes trying to lepidus stopped his eyes widened gods help me what is it i wrote a letter to him i thanked him before hed attended that meeting hed been almost seduced by crassuss persuasive flattery his eyes darted left and right as he tried to remember the precise wording of his correspondence crassus had sent his gifts with letters punctuated with carefully phrased criticisms of caligula subtly worded inducements for lepidus to expand on that criticism a little more sounding me out thats what he was doing lepidus remembered carefully avoiding any references to crassuss less than flattering thoughts about the emperor and his appalling neglect of the affairs of the city in his reply the general quite clearly remembered writing a polite and very neutral thank you to the old man for his lovely gifts but most importantly ignoring those dangerously obvious phrases phrases clumsily probing him for where his allegiance lay oh help me he whispered sir what he hadnt done was immediately forward that correspondence to his emperor what he hadnt done was warn caligula of crassuss treacherous mutterings oh the gods the generals thinking in recent years had been that sitting tight and keeping his head down waiting this madness out was the clever strategic game to play with his two legions permanently encamped a mere days march away from rome he was perfectly placed to sweep in and replace that insane fool the moment something happened to him and something inevitably would caligula was mentally unstable increasingly so believing himself to be a god immortal the crazy fool would end up either killing himself in some reckless chariot race to impress his people or believing he could actually fly and stepping off a high wall that or some desperate starving citizen was going to get lucky with a slingshot or an arrow caligulas insanity seemed to be approaching some sort of a feverish crescendo as if he expected something truly worldchanging to happen to him very soon but this news these rumours gods help him if that exchange of correspondence between him and crassus should fall into the emperors hands not participating in any conspiracy the old senator had been quietly organizing was not going to be enough to save him sir lepidus looked up at his tribune we have to do something sir we could be next caligula was going to have new heads on spikes all over the city by the first light of morning and two of them might just be mine and his atellus sir i want every officer from both legions assembled in my quarters in half an hour yes sir what what do i plan to do yes sir i have no choice do i crassus has made sure of that he thought he saw a grim smile play across his tribunes lips yes atellus i want the men ready to decamp sir you are considering marching on rome atellus hesitated confronting caligula of course i am the men sir they may not take well to the idea atellus was quite right the legions officers and mens allegiance was broadly with the emperor his was the hand that fed them and fed them very well lepidus couldnt be sure his men were going to be behind him and should an order for his arrest arrive as well might i make a suggestion sir go on let them believe the guard is moving against the emperor lepidus nodded slowly yes of course mobilize the men sir let them believe were marching on rome to protect caligula from a palace coup tell them the emperor will reward them for their loyalty that the guard will be disgraced disbanded as a result of this treachery yes theres no love lost there between the legions and the guard atellus every officer in here in half an hour move yes sir the tribune saluted turned on his heel and swept out of lepiduss private quarters by first light he was going to have both the tenth and the eleventh assembled and ready to march however the next few days panned out whether he was going to need to confront the guard or not whether he was going to attempt to move against caligula or not it would be better to be ready for it to have his men in their armour and on their feet chapter ad rome crassus heard the banging on the large wooden gates to his courtyard he topped up his cup with the last of his wine as he watched his slave tosca hurry across the courtyard clutching a flickering oil lamp to answer the insistent knocking here they come he tipped the wine insistently down his throat a little crimson courage crassus knew his strengths and his weaknesses he wasnt a brave man if he had an ounce of courage in him he would have stood shoulder to shoulder with all the other senators whod tried defying the emperor years ago tonight he was going to try and make up for that the gates swung in and he saw the purple cloaks of a dozen praetorian guards sweeping in past his slave master master cried tosca in a panic marcus cornelius crassus barked a centurion i have orders for your arrest crassus recognized the voice fronto cato had given the arrest order to an officer he trusted to handle crassus humanely gently thank you cato i am here he said shakily stepping out of the shadows beneath his portico whatever is the matter fronto approached flanked by his men he adopted his best officious voice marcus cornelius crassus i have orders to escort you to the emperors palace he wishes to speak to you crassus smiled calmly at fronto at this time of night centurion is he lonely fronto worked to keep the flicker of a smile off his face best come along immediately sir the old man nodded yes of course cant keep a god waiting can i tosca hurried forward with a cloak for him master what is happening crassus patted his slave on the arm affectionately nothing to worry about tosca old friend i shall be back for breakfast no doubt sir said fronto insistently lock the door tosca he said quietly he turned to fronto fastening the cloak round his narrow shoulders with a clasp centurion im all yours caligula looked up from the small battle being fought between wooden figurines on the low table in front of him hed heard the clatter and jangle of armour the slap of sandals on stone all the way from the entrance hall ahh good evening crassus he smiled coolly crassus nodded politely as his escort of praetorians came to a halt a couple of yards before the emperor your divinity well a curious thing happened earlier this evening would you like to know what it was crassus said nothing oh not in the slightest bit curious i suspect you plan to tell me anyway caligula grinned then frowned curiously hmmm thats not like you crassus youre normally so so meek he leaned forward over his battlelines of miniature wooden legionaries and sniffed the air in front of the old man been drinking have we a little anxious perhaps i am working my way through the wine i have left before rome falls into complete anarchy and is looted by the mob tsktsk caligula shook his head i wont let rome fall into anarchy soon every citizen will be showered with wealth with their very own casks of wine ahhh youre still holding out hope for your special day are you the day heaven opens for me yes of course and it is very soon in fact if you say so i do say so caligulas face tightened you know this troubles me crassus perhaps you can answer this for me if those dirty savages in judaea could believe a young uneducated man a simple craftsman of some kind i believe if they could believe this mere troublemaker was to be the king of kings the son of god why is it so difficult to believe a roman emperor could be you are quite mad replied crassus and a danger to rome caligula was dumbstruck at the mans candour there are no gods or god these are morality tales nothing more any man with half his wits can see that crassus caligulas eyes widened playfully you do seem to have found your tongue tonight you had a reason for bringing me here caligula stood up yes yes i do he looked over the old mans shoulder ahhh tribune come forward cato joined them and offered caligula a crisp salute tribune why dont you tell crassus here all about your interesting find hmmm cato turned to the old man he kept his voice dry and officious correspondence between yourself and quintus antonius lepidus containing invocations to acts of sedition and treachery pouring your poison into lepiduss ears very very naughty of you lepidus was a faithful man a good man caligula shook his head sadly im sure he believed in me until you started working on him now he picked up a wooden soldier from the table now i really cant trust him any more can i crassus laughed drily you can trust no one no one loves you many fear you me i just pity you your days are numbered caligula kicked the table between them sending his wooden soldiers cascading on to the floor why why cant you all just wait just wait and see wait wait for you to become a god yes caligula turned away from them all and screamed with frustration into the gloom of the atrium just wait wait and see crassus glanced at cato quickly to see the tribune shaking his head almost imperceptibly the message was quite clear dont provoke him any more not necessary the old man smiled at his friend a smile that told cato that he knew where this exchange was going to take them that he was ready for it but most importantly that cato should let this happen to try and stop it to try to save him to try and lunge at caligula would be futile the emperors stone men stood close by too close you will never be a god caligula little boot you are nothing more than a failed emperor and a deluded fool caligula whirled round tribune your sword cato looked at the emperor uncertainly give me your sword now cato unsheathed it slowly and presented the handle to caligula caesar i suggest crassus be kept alive he will be a useful source of informa caligula ignored him and grabbed his sword he pressed the tip of the blade into the hollow at the base of crassuss throat it drew blood a small trickle that rolled along the old mans prominent collarbone over the edge and soaked into the linen of his toga caligula giggled at the sight of it crassus you do seem to be full of surprises tonight do you have a death wish i am quite ready to die he glanced quickly at cato ready to make way for a new generation of senators he turned back to caligula and smiled defiantly senators who will very soon be replacing you caligulas face bloomed a dark crimson he thrust the sword forward hard until it grated on bone somewhere inside the old man he laughed excitedly as crassus gurgled blood his mouth jerking open and closed several times before he dropped to his knees and flopped forward on to the floor caligula squatted down to examine the old man caesar he looked up at cato yes what are your orders orders general lepidus you had a messenger despatched earlier a message for him to report to you immediately he will be warned now he may even now be provoked to make a move on you caligula nodded his mind clearing aside the dwindling rage yes yes youre quite right we must do something about that may i suggest you mobilize the praetorian cohorts garrisoned outside the city lepidus has two legions at his command and they are less than a days march from here caligula stood up slowly crassuss body already forgotten about yes we must move quickly mustnt we cato nodded immediately sire if lepidus already knows hes under suspicion he could be readying his men to march on rome right now the guard should be readied to march out and meet them youre right caligula spat a curse where is your damned praefectus i sent for him hours ago cato turned to fronto find out where he is we need his authority to no we dont im the emperor i want word sent to all of the praetorian cohorts to assemble outside the east gates on the via praenestina at first light is that understood fronto nodded yes caesar well go on then now cato watched his centurion hurry out of the atrium his gaze rested on stern standing to attention dutifully just behind caligula your stone men sire might i suggest you send them along they have something of a reputation caligula stroked his chin thoughtfully and lepidus has two legions to our one hmmm maybe youre right he pressed his lips together thoughtfully although if there are other whisperers like crassus around i would rather they remained by my side cato wondered how far he could push his advice for the moment caligula seemed to be listening to it even welcoming it you have my cohort here sire to guard you to guard the palace and the government district yes perhaps i should send some of them caligula was thinking aloud more than talking to cato enough to be sure of a decisive victory sire hmmm yes it certainly needs to be decisive cant have every other disgruntled general out there following lepiduss example can we no sire chapter ad subura district rome sal looked out of the small window of their room down on to the narrow alley below there were people emerging from their homes and the avenue was illuminated by the flames of oil lamps and torches carried outside by the curious whats going on down there asked maddy people gathering in the street somethings going on maddy joined her jostling for shoulder space to crane her neck out over the rough flaking plaster of the ledge its like a town council meeting somethings happened already across the tiled rooftops they could see the walls of other narrow streets faintly illuminated from below by torches carried outside the glow coming from dozens of window shutters opened spilling light over the top of hunched shoulders and curious craning necks its like chinese whispers said maddy somethings going round rumours in this city seemed to spread even faster than they used to back in her time she laughed no need for the internet or facebook or twitter here in rome it seemed when you could apparently just as easily shout through paperthin walls or gossip across cramped courtyards maybe theyve gone and killed caligula already i dont know it cant have been that easy surely maddy looked down past a shutter banging open directly beneath them and several more curious heads poking out she could see the entrance to the rat run that led into their apartment blocks inner courtyard down there the unmistakable bulk of bob moving around macros right though whatever happens over the next few days its going to be complete chaos altogether lads grunted macro liam and bob and several other men from the apartment block hefted the cart up on one side one two three now barked macro the cart clattered over on to its side forming a rudimentary barricade blocking up most of the entrance to the rat run there were gaps either side that needed filling and macro started to bully his tenants into a human chain ferrying bricabrac lying around the courtyard to stack either side of the overturned cart liam stepped on a box and looked over the top bob standing beside him watching the gathering people can you make out what theyre saying out there bob i will try he frowned concentrating for a moment on the growing babble of voices out in the alleyway they are discussing the news that the praetorian guard are leaving the city he cocked his head listening more intently there seems to be another rumour that caligula has been killed by the praetorians bob smiled and theres another rumour that demons from the underworld have arisen from the sewers and are rampaging through the city liam watched as a cluster of young men emerged from a doorway further up the alley all of them clutching knives hatchets clubs macro joined liam and bob shorter even than liam he stood on tiptoes on a crate to peek over the top its begun already then he said what has asked liam troublemakers macro sighed first sign of a riot and out comes the scum of the earth looking for easy pickings he cursed and spat over the top of the cart i tell you if they even think about touching my property he pulled out his butchers hatchet from a pouch on the leather apron tied round his waist ill give em what for im tellin you liam looked at the glint of light playing across the thick rusty blade so you uh you saw quite a lot of action when you were a soldier in the legions macro macro grinned a gaptoothed smile you are joking with me arent you lad liams bud quickly translated that but the incredulous look on macros face was more than answer enough chapter ad imperial palace rome cato unrolled a map of the city across a table in the palace gardens and weighted the corners down with several stones gather round gentlemen he said to the assembled officers the centurions and optiones of the first cohort his men some of them roused from their cots only minutes ago were still blearyeyed as they fiddled with the straps and buckles of their armour they pressed forward around the table as their tribune began to brief them quickly im sure youve all heard by now that the rest of the guard will be mustering outside the castra praetoria at first light whats happened sir cato looked up at a bullnecked centurion with a flattened boxers nose and a fuzz of blond hair clipped short almost to the scalp it seems the general in charge of the tenth and eleventh has decided hes had enough of our emperor rufus the guard will be marching out to meet them bit sudden isnt it sir i thought lepidus was the emperors man cato shrugged you know what its like with these equites they all think theyre entitled to the job one way or the other anyway to the point our cohort is being left behind to guard the city when everyone wakes up tomorrow morning and hears of this and they discover the majority of the guard have packed up and gone were going to have riots in every district a complete breakdown of order so its going to be down to us to protect the citys infrastructure where we can cato leaned across the map starting with you rufus i want your second century deployed over here in campus martius to protect the temple buildings you as well lectus your century over here guarding the stratum sulla marcellus i want your men protecting the aqueduct here and here the rest of you ill be assigning perimeter positions in the palatinus district to protect the government buildings he turned to fronto and your men fronto will provide security for the palace itself yes sir rufus cocked his head just one century to protect the emperor cato looked at him rufus was like most of the men in the guard tough but certainly not stupid the emperor has his personal bodyguards the stone men uttered one of the optiones cato disliked the term it implied a supernatural quality about them now he knew they were just muscleandbone devices made by men from a more advanced time the name smacked of superstition he will be quite safe as long as he stays in the palace cato assured them he nodded at fronto wont he yes sir perfectly safe sir just then they heard a raised voice booming out across the flamelit palace gardens what the hell is going on here the officers all turned to see their praefectus quintus striding towards them he easily identified catos tall outline among the knot of men tribune who in the name of jupiter took my authority and ordered the guard to the emperor himself sir what quintus stopped in his tracks caligula but only i have the authority to quintus caligulas voice cut across the darkness he emerged into the night flanked by two of his stone men the prefects face paled nobody but a stupid fool bellowed the emperors nickname across the palace grounds caesar i caligula waved at him to be silent i exercised my prerogative as emperor to mobilize them since you were nowhere to be found but sire quintus swallowed nervously there there is a protocol that should more precisely my prerogative as godinwaiting added caligula he smiled say another word quintus and ill have your tongue removed from your mouth his cool glare left quintus staring down at the ground like a chastened schoolboy now then wheres that tribune cato ahhh there you are caesar i have decided that i shall in fact be leading the guard what he almost forgot himself whats that sire yes i think its fitting that i come along the men should be led by me and of course my stone men it will truly inspire them cato glanced quickly across heads at the only other conspirator present fronto but sire it would be much wiser for you to stay in the palace the people need to see you right here in rome they need to see that lepiduss foolishness is nothing that youre particularly worried about oh im not worried caligula chuckled happily in fact im actually looking forward to having a splendid big battle its been too long he sniffed the evening air as if there was a faint scent that only he could detect one last battle before i ascend to the heavens how marvellous he turned to one of his stone men standing behind him holding his armour and i really wouldnt want to miss seeing that fat treacherous fool lepidus grovelling at my feet cato struggled to keep his voice even sire please it will be dangerous dangerous oh hardly said caligula lifting his arms up as one of the stone men helped him into his bronze cuirass this is what the people need to see what they need to realize that im not just a god but also a warrior a great general cato clenched his teeth with frustration the whole plan for what it was had relied on the certainty that caligula would choose to remain in the comfort and apparent safety of his palace tribune said the emperor you just make sure everyone behaves themselves while im away i really dont want to come back to a messy city caligula let the stone man finish tightening the straps at his side then turned to the prefect come along quintus dont stand around like an old woman you better go and get your armour on too we shall be moving out from the castra praetoria at first light he turned to cato and winked at him i shall leave you three of my bodyguards to help guard the palace im trusting you with my home tribune do try and keep it nice and tidy he turned back to quintus and slapped his shoulder impatiently off you go man cato watched quintus turn and leave and caligula leading his bodyguards towards the imperial stables he watched until the night swallowed them up then turned to his assembled officers all right then gentlemen you all have your orders dismissed the officers saluted and then turned to gather their men fronto dismissed his own optio to go and organize the first century both men stood silently until they were entirely alone and out of earshot cato cursed our plan is already broken so it seems said fronto cato nodded the plan had rested on an assumption that caligula would remain and hopefully send out most of his stone men along with the guard now hed chosen to go it was a battle that would probably go caligulas way and embolden the madman even more unless lepidus manages to be victorious do you think that likely cato shook his head the praetorians with those stone men in the vanguard were probably more than a match for lepiduss men all we have managed to achieve with this fronto is to organize a few days worth of blood sport for caligula thats all he wondered whether there had been a moment during the last few hours when he could have reached for his sword and dealt the death blow certainly he would have been dead within seconds of the emperor the stone men were quick and lethal quite probably it would have resulted in an unsuccessful lunge for caligula and him being wrestled to the floor and executed then and there truth was on his return caligula was probably going to find out one way or another that crassus had met with fellow conspirators cicero and paulus were two men the emperor would probably have at the top of his list of people hed like to have a little chat with for sure and how long before either of those old men let slip his name if he wins fronto if hes victorious and returns then i shall make a try for him he looked at his first centurion our names will come up soon enough once he gets back we will be dead men then said fronto indeed chapter ad subura district rome ive never seen the streets so quiet said macro liam nodded as he scanned the empty avenue over the top of their barricade not entirely empty though half a dozen bodies littered the cobblestone road there had been fights all through the night rival gangs settling old scores people looting the small businesses that operated from alcoves beneath the apartment building opposite them and something that had put the fear of god into the stocky old excenturion a fire someone had set alight one of the small alcoves a place selling bolts of linen and silk macro had leaped over the top of their barricade charged out across the avenue roughly pushing his way through the mob of brawling young men to stamp the flames out before they got a firm hold of the place hed made his way back five minutes later stinking of smoke sweating profusely and muttering latin obscenities to himself if id known how flammable these shoddilymade buildings are id have invested in a vineyard instead it was midmorning now the sun spilling down from a smokesmudged sky on to the cobbles i suppose none of them food traders will come in today said liam no any merchant with an ounce of sense will steer clear of rome until the praetorians return and restore some order people are going to be hungry this morning liam looked back down the rat run into their courtyard there was food there several sacks of grain bought in at an extortionate price yesterday afternoon a dozen or so loose chickens and of course their two ponies liam guessed macro had about a hundred tenants in his apartment block a hundred mouths to feed for however many days this crisis was due to last and they all know weve got food in here macro nodded at faces peering at them from the three storeys of small shuttered windows and balconies opposite wordll spread quickly enough well be fighting to hold on to it before long sal worked with the young man a blondhaired slave from gaul she held the wooden stake steady as he sharpened the end into a spike she guessed he was only fifteen but it was hard to tell his arms were all sinew and muscle his face taut and lean not a square inch of flesh on him without a purpose so unlike the puffyfaced friends she knew back in steady please he said smiling at her fleetingly the bud translated that for her sorry he worked the blade of the knife honing the end of the stake to a sharp tip then took it from sals grip and blackened and hardened it in the flames of a brazier people say you and friends comes from far away said the boy sal nodded very far he glanced at her again someone whisper me same place as the visitors she shrugged not really to say yes would have invited a barrage of questions she wasnt sure how shed answer he looked at the stud in her nose is this mark of slave she lifted her hand and felt it selfconsciously this no its just decoration i suppose to make me look good the lad picked up another stake and offered her one end to hold you look different different she looked down at herself her dark hoody black drainpipe jeans and platform docker boots were stored away in their room she was wearing a sleeveless burgundycoloured tunic hanging down to her shins belted at the waist with a strip of leather and sandals no different from any of the other girls and women in the courtyard the young lad touched his own mop of curly hair hair like short like boy she made a face it wasnt if anything it was too long her fringe seemed to hang in her eyes all the time it had been far too long since shed had it cut but compared to every other girl or woman in this time long hair pulled back and tied in braids that hung down to the small of their backs yes hers probably did look boyishly short i like it like this she replied its the fashion where we come from he cocked his head they says you home is call he frowned with concentration as he tried to get the pronunciation right america america home she smiled a little sadly not really im from a place called india she replied mumbai marm bye nearly mumbai is this same place as you friends how was she going to explain that no it wasnt but then she reminded herself keep it simple yes sort of quite close he stopped whittling the stake for a moment what is mumbai like she looked up at him then at the courtyard now filled with the apartment blocks tenants working together on makedo weapons and barricades she looked up at lines of laundry strung across the skylight above them stretched from balcony to opposite balcony there were parts of mumbai that looked like this still shanty towns of corrugated iron and breeze blocks stacked precariously high and ludicrously close tens of thousands of impoverished migrants from the now submerged lowlands of bangladesh living on top of each other each towering shantyblock sharing several dozen overloaded electrical feeds a handful of water taps and communal toilets that channelled untreated human waste down on to the mucky streets below sal sighed she realized she came from a time almost exactly two thousand years after this particular hereandnow and yet things back then back home had been getting so bad so overcrowded resources so scarce food and sanitation so utterly shaddyah poor that this downmarket district of ancient rome looked almost like a step forward in time almost its not so good she replied i think we might have ruined the place we came from what you mean how to explain it all too many people she replied eventually too many people wanting too many things i think he nodded as if he understood that is like rome huh like rome she nodded rome fell eventually didnt it crashed and burned overrun by vandals and left as nothing more than smouldering ruins maybe he was right maybe the far future and rome had a lot in common yes quite a bit like rome just then she heard liams raised voice across the hubbub in the courtyard she couldnt make out what hed said but by the shrill tone of his voice it didnt sound like good news maddy whod been talking with bob called out liam whats up we got company macros voice boomed even louder a paradeground bark that bounced off all four towering sides of the courtyard and turned every head in the middle the babelbud in sals ear calmly translated his raucous cry into the relaxed detached and emotionless voice of an elevator announcing a floor here they come chapter ad imperial palace rome the palace was a quiet place normally caligulas notorious orgies his peculiar excesses tittletattled about by roman tongues all over the empire were a feature of his younger years some of the older veterans in the guard had shared with cato tales of the emperors extravagant behaviour after hed first come to power but theyd all agree that the day of the visitors was the day caligula left that all behind him since then the emperors halls had become a place where conversations were spoken gently and the guards that patrolled anywhere near where they thought the emperor might be stepped lightly and muffled as best they could the clank and clatter of their equipment the palace was a quiet place normally cato noted but today it was as silent as a tomb the palace personnel slaves and freedmen were confined to quarters for their own safety the only people within the imperial compound were cato centurion fronto and his century and the three stone men caligula had chosen to leave behind and where exactly have they got to he didnt like the idea of not knowing where those things were quietly lurking cato did his best to look like an officer with duty on his mind scouring the hushed marblefloored hallways and private courtyards for any signs of intruders or looters out in the palaces herb garden he squatted down over a sewer grating and checked the grating itself was secure not that he particularly cared but appearances were everything his mind was elsewhere a messenger from prefect quintus had arrived only several hours after the guard had set off in a long column of purple cloaks his message was that cavalry squadrons scouting ahead of the column had already clashed in several light skirmishes with scouts from the tenth and eleventh legions and that theyd caught a brief glimpse of lepiduss column on the horizon it seemed atellus had successfully goaded the general into making his move both forces would probably draw within a couple of miles of each other by noon and then spend the remains of the day building temporary marching camps their men suitably rested overnight the fighting would happen tomorrow what concerned cato was the possibility of a parlay between caligula and lepidus perhaps the general might be able to convince the emperor that hed been set up by crassus and his fellow conspirators how long into that conversation before catos name cropped up and how long after that before a messenger and an escort of praetorian cavalry arrived at the palace with orders for his arrest he could have lunged for caligula he should have tried while the emperor was distracted watching crassus dying hed had a ghost of a chance then hadnt he his mind turned to those young strangers the two girls the young man and their giant perhaps the only chance they had now was to get that creature bob a curious name into the imperial grounds while it was mostly deserted then on caligulas return he might somehow manage to pick the right moment emerge and fight his way through to the emperor it wasnt much of a plan but right now it seemed to be all cato had left other than wait for that inevitable messenger and arrest order to eventually arrive he returned to the main atrium and headed west down along the main approach hallway to the front entrance of the palace fronto and several sections of his men were stationed there cato needed to speak to him halfway down the hall as he paced quickly filling the echoing hallway with the noise of his own heavy footsteps he stopped and looked at the drape to his left the temple was beyond that he took several steps towards it the temple that only caligula entered he wondered if the girl maddy was right whether hidden inside the room were those mysterious chariots perhaps even the remains of the visitors he reached for the drape and pulled it slowly to one side you do not have authority to be here cato jerked at the harsh voice so this was where all three of them had been lurking please leave immediately said another taking a threatening step towards him and reaching for the pommel of a sword strapped to its side chapter ad subura district rome jayzus get off will ya yelled liam as he swung the club down on to the bulging knuckles of a pair of hands grasping the top of the barricade the club the leg of a wooden stool with several lumber nails banged through it crunched down heavily even through the din of the baying jeering crowd that had amassed out in the street he heard bones crack like eggshells there was another pair of hands in the same spot a moment later the gathered mob working together as one rocking the heavy cart forward and backward to make it topple over bob was doing his best to use his bulk to hold it in place to steady it but that wasnt working how theyd hoped the wooden spars of the cart were stressing and creaking and loosening the mob out there might not be able to push it over with bob holding on to it but that didnt matter the thing was likely to rattle to pieces as soon as fall over macro was busy prodding his old armyissue gladius at some of the desperate fools whod pulled away the stacked clutter either side of the cart and were now trying to push through the gap there go on get away he roared angrily at them this is my property a man a foot taller than him and armed with a similar armyissue sword swung down at him macro thickset and carrying a couple of stone more than he must have done as a soldier was surprisingly agile as he sidestepped it the blade bit deeply into the wood of a casket and lodged firmly there he grinned at the large man as he struggled frantically to wriggle it free he smashed the pommel of his sword into the mans face and he fell back into the press of men behind him information roared bob this barricade will not hold much longer liam nodded it was falling apart around them theyd be better off he bob macro and the three other men macros tenants holding the barricade if they took several steps back now and formed a defensive line further down the rat run its going to collapse macro nodded he could see that too he glanced round over his shoulder at the far end of the rat run was another low barricade of furniture and bricabrac they could run back behind that and then have the advantage of all the other tenants being able to throw down stones and other missiles from the balconies around the courtyard all right then after three everyone back there the other men nodded liam nodded at the whisper of english in his ear barely audible above the noise although hed already figured out what macro was bellowing one the other men stepped away from the rattling rocking cart bob was still holding it two liam swung his club down on another pair of hands crushing them to a bloody mush three they all turned together and scrambled down the rat run sandals slipping in the muck of animal faeces and nightwater liam heard the crash and clatter of the cart falling behind him as he vaulted over the flimsy inner barricade bob remained where he was almost completely filling the width of the entrance to the rat run with his bulk and the arc of the shorthandled blacksmiths hammer he was swinging wildly now the cart was torn down and bob fully exposed missiles began to rain down on him from the avenue outside stones several arrows dislodged clay bricks liam could see thickening blood trickling like syrup from a dozen nicks and gashes on bob already the support unit had faced far worse barrages than this but becks had been the example one lucky arrow on target one arrow puncturing the bone of his cranium and damaging either his walnutsized organic brain or the computer nestling next to it and he could be brought down like any other man bob get back here liam cried over the cacophony of noise bouncing off the walls either side of them affirmative he heard bob rumble in reply he retreated slowly under the barrage still swinging his hammer and holding the crowd back until finally he was able to quickly turn round and leap over the barricade to join the others a moment later the mob crashed into the fragile second barricade it wobbled and collapsed easily into a tangle of chair legs and shards of fractured crates and through that pressed a forest of legs and arms swinging clubs and knives and short swords the air above them buzzed and flickered with stones and short sharpened stakes slingshots and grabbed handfuls of muck from the street a neighbourhood brawl the likes of which liam had never seen before the first few men through the tangle were quickly dealt with and collapsed amid the confusion of broken furniture the rest quickly pulled back under the shower of projectiles raining down from the balconies around the courtyard between bobs swinging hammer and macros foulmouthed jabbing swordplay it looked like the pair of them in this narrow bottleneck were going to be able to hold the jeering angry mob at bay for a while yet go on be off the lot of you macro bayed at the men hovering several yards beyond the probing tip of his sword the bud struggled to find modern english alternatives for half of the stream of invective spewing out of his mouth liam found himself laughing nervously at the exsoldiers coarse bravura aye go on get lost he crowed defiantly as he ducked down and picked up a rock that had just landed at his feet and tossed it back into the crowd watch out macro raised his shield a battered and old curved rectangular shield that still sported the flecked paint insignia legio ii amid the forked lightning motif he raised it over his and liams head as a large chunk of flint pulled up from the avenue outside arced over the heads of the mob in front and descended towards them it clattered and bounced heavily knocking a jagged gash through the shield before rolling on to the ground at their feet macro lowered the shield and grinned at liam just like the good ol days liam had the distinct impression even before he got the translation a halfsecond later that the old boy was getting a kick out of this or he would have been had he not heard someone scream incendia flamma what macro looked back into the courtyard towards where the scream had come from whats the matter asked liam above them they heard the unmistakable whusk of an arrow accompanied by a fluttering hiss liam saw the faint trail of smoke it left in its wake macro spat rage and a stream of abuse noooo several more flaming arrows zipped overhead thudding into the wooden balconies quickly setting fire to the dried wood the wovenreed modesty screens and the hanging lines of laundry no macro bellowed again thats my bloodyproperty chapter ad imperial palace rome cato stood and stared at them they calmly returned his silent gaze this area is offlimits to you said stern you do not have authority to proceed any further please leave immediately im checking the palace for any intruders looters said cato i understood that replied stern calmly however i repeat you have no authority to enter this particular location please turn round and leave these men no not men things used to unsettle cato however unlike the superstitious men he commanded hed never thought of them as supernatural beings just that they were decidedly inhuman odd creepy but now he felt he had some sort of understanding of what they were contraptions devices you know who i am dont you affirmative tribune cato and you understand i have the emperors authority in his absence said cato i am in charge of palace security affirmative so what is behind those doors stern took a step forward he cocked his head slightly as if listening to something only he could hear that information is strictly classified tribune cato you do not have the correct security clearance for that information cato studied the stone man his eyes were blinking repeatedly there was an air of distracted uncertainty of confusion about him security clearance such odd words you mean i dont have the authority but you see i do the emperor put me in charge of negative this is a us military security zone this is stern stopped cocked his head again awkwardly in this current operational mode the user designated emperor has complete diagnostic control the confusion slowly cleared from his face as if another conflicting voice from within was coming through we are authorized to use lethal force if you do not leave immediately stern took a step forward more certain of himself now he reached for the hilt of the sword strapped to his side you should leave now cato raised both his hands in surrender all right all right im leaving he stepped back into the main hallway and allowed the drape to flop back into place once more concealing the small passageway cato realized the young woman from the future was quite correct that beyond those sturdy oak doors was quite probably everything she wanted to find the technology of her time her way home and a way to correct everything he found fronto a few minutes later outside watching the sky above rome laced with ribbons of smoke from riots that were breaking out right across the city we should bring the others in now he said quietly yes sir take a section of men with you and get our friends back here as quickly as you can chapter ad subura district rome sal was struggling to breathe a thick pall of smoke from the fires above them had descended to fill the courtyard she had maddy or rather maddy had found her and was even now leading her by the hand through the churning sea of bodies five minutes ago the fight had settled into a stalemate the looters held at bay in the rat run by the constant barrage of projectiles from above but now things had descended into a confused misty chaos the smoke from a dozen fires on the first and second floors had become a choking blanket macros tenants were now no longer concerned with keeping their looting neighbours out of the apartment block but instead were struggling with each other to escape the burning building sal was jostled and bumped from all sides nearly losing her grip on maddys hand as they became funnelled into a press of thrashing bodies the rat run five minutes ago it was a bottleneck that was proving to be their saving grace now it looked like becoming a death trap for them above her amid the churn of smoke she heard the crackle of flames taking hold of the building maddy weve got to get out weve got to find a way out i know she had no idea where the others were last shed seen liam and bob had been manning the second barricade successfully holding back the baying mob but that was ancient history now there were no more attackers and defenders not any longer just a couple of hundred people fighting with each other to escape the building through a passageway littered with obstacles and bodies they heard a loud crack of snapping wood from above and then a moment later the balconies lining one complete side of the quadrangle came tumbling down through the smoke into the courtyard an avalanche of blackened smouldering slats of wood that exploded into a shower of sparks and embers that set fire to the tattered linen sunawnings around the courtyard through a gap in the smoke sal caught sight of a woman with a child in her arms trapped in the corner beside their two ponies that were rolling widened eyes at the flames around them she and the animals were imprisoned inside a collapsed scaffolding of wooden poles the womans eyes met sals the only person now looking back into the courtyard she was screaming for help a fleeting moment then the smoke closed on her and she and her child were gone items of burning clothing embers from drapes and privacy screens and a million and one flammable household possessions were starting to rain down on the crowd that had completely plugged the rat run and were going absolutely nowhere setting hair and more clothes on fire help sal screamed help her voice was lost beneath a hundred others screaming the very same thing in latin she couldnt see maddy now she still had hold of her hand but their arms were twisted over the back and shoulder of some old man carrying a screaming toddler piggyback maddy she screamed im here were going to die were going to choke to death or burn her mind flashed with memories of that day the last day of her life standing in the ruin of that stairwell with the others on their floor whod spilled out of their apartments her mamaji and papaji like her with ghostwhite faces of dust the air thick with powdered concrete and toxic fumes she remembered the choking the panicking being terrified then that sound that endoftheworld sound a deep rumble like an approaching train the floor trembling beneath their feet gasps cries screaming a desperate collective horror that didnt allow them even a few seconds of stillness a goodbye moment a whispered farewell that might just might be carried on some spiritual ether to those it was intended for and then foster extending a hand offering her just her a way out oh jahulla not like this dont let me die like this bob she screamed liam helllllpp liam looked at bob they were watching people pour out of the rat run on to the avenue not a fleetfooted escape but a molasseslike spill of the staggering crawling coughing and retching people clambering desperately over a growing bed of collapsed bodies that was sals voice bob nodded affirmative ah jayzus we got to go in and pull her out you must stay here liam said bob he turned towards the clogged exit no im comin with an iron grip held liams wrist he turned to see macro let your friend go lad liam struggled to shake him off but the romans grip was far too insistent and strong let him go lad if hes truly made of stone then hell live liam watched as bob carelessly bulldozed his way through the emerging people and disappeared into the smoke spewing thickly out of the narrow rat run above screams for help they could both hear the crackle of flames eagerly devouring the apartment block smoke now growing a dark grey pumped energetically out of seemingly every small window the yellowwashed clay plaster facade over the buildings clay bricks was beginning to crack under the heat and crumble to the ground in chunks bricks and brittle mortar too breaking crumbling and falling like the decaying flesh of a dead body a body decomposing in fast forward rendered from living flesh to skeleton frame in minutes liams weary oxygenstarved legs buckled under him and he sat down heavily in the middle of the cobbled avenue dropped like a sack of coke off the back of a coalmans cart he wasnt alone the avenue was thick with others slumped on their knees lying on their backs gasping to fill their lungs with clear air macro squatted down beside him his eyes glistening with moisture stupid he muttered to himself stupid stupid people they heard something collapsing deep inside the column of smoke perhaps a wall giving way filling the courtyard with fractured fragments of heatshattered clay brick and glowing spars of charcoaled scaffold poles liam felt his cheeks grow wet tears creating two clean paths down his sootblackened face theyre dead in that for sure all of them the deafening clatter of collapse somewhere within the smoke ceased to be replaced by the growing crackle and roar of flames the stream of people crawling staggering out of the smoke had become a dwindling trickle one or two dropping as they emerged surely the very last likely to step out of the pall as certain as hed ever been about anything liam knew the rest of the poor unfortunate souls caught up in that deathtrap space were either suffocated by now burned to death or buried his vision blurred with tears became a kaleidoscope of refracting stars and spears of light he felt a hand lightly on his back patting him gently and the deep grunt of macros voice far away offering a soldiers illphrased words of comfort but all liam could do was hear his own choice of words hardly any more comforting theyre gone and its just me now just me selfish words he realized selfish to grieve at being left alone like this to cry like this just for himself maddy sal and bob not just friends but family more like family in truth than the faint photoalbum memories he had of a mother and father uncles and aunts macros hand was still patting him if hed had a greater presence of mind been stronger quicker smarter he shouldve reacted sooner left the standoff over the barricade and gone to find the girls there could have been a way out for them they could have found another way out macros hand was thumping his back more heavily not a flat pat more like a fist hardly a comforting soothing gesture he realized the bud in his ear was calmly insistently telling him something telling him what the old roman was now bellowing loudly repeatedly look look look liam did wiped muck and tears from his eyes his blurred refracted vision cleared he saw what he expected to see the thick column of smoke spiralling up from the skeleton of macros building and an avenue of sootcovered bodies but then he picked out the thick roundshouldered outline of a bull charging towards him not a bull it ran like a human on human legs a minotaur then no not a minotaur those werent horns on top he could make out that much he wiped his eyes again and realized macro still pummelling his back was cheering hoarsely the minotaur an enormous black creature came to a halt in front of liam hefted two blackened humps what hed mistaken for horns from its shoulders and on to the cobblestones where both began to wheeze cough and retch minor burns and abrasions there may be some minor scorching of the trachea and nasal passages this will heal but they will both be all right rumbled the minotaur behind them the complete front wall of the apartment building collapsed backwards in on itself sending a mushroom cloud of sparks ember and ash up into the sky unlike your property lucius cornelius macro added bob just then they heard the clack of standard armyissue nailsoled sandals on the cobbles and the approaching rattle and clatter of armour and harnesses macro turned to look up at fronto you might have come a little earlier fronto gazed at macros retirement investment fully ablaze now its like this right across the whole city riots in every district he turned to maddy and liam cato sent me to get you maddy still on her hands and knees coughing up globules of phlegm as black as tar wiped her mouth and looked up at the officer you you can get us in into the emperors palace fronto nodded right now yes if we hurry chapter ad outside rome caligula watched the ground shifting and beetleblack a thousand crows moving among the dead more in the sky overhead swooping and buzzing the battlefield the dead stretched as far as he could see the red tunics of dead legionaries men from the tenth and eleventh dotting the olivegreen grass of the hillside like wild poppies the deed was done before the sun reached midday two legions of men broken and routed within the space of an hour caligula had watched the battle unfold from the comfort of a wooden platform erected in the early hours of the morning his small vanguard of stone men had formed the very tip of an advancing wedge that had plunged through lepiduss predictable chequerboard formation the stone men were soon lost from direct sight in the melee but their precise location in the press of men was never in doubt it was the source of the screaming the source of the greatest amount of movement in the middle of the glistening sea of helmets and armour after the brief battle caligula could actually trace the path they took by the wake of horrendously dismembered bodies almost as if someone had gathered up men and bits of men and laid them out like a narrow carpet a road of ragged flesh splintered bone and dented metal almost indestructible those stone men but not quite four of them had eventually been brought down by lepiduss men a concerted effort by his archers leaving them for a moment staggering pincushion figures like human porcupines until theyd finally collapsed but by then of course the damage had been done the legions formations were broken and the men were already beginning to turn and run caligula glanced once more at the pitiful sight of so many good roman legionaries dead on the field carrion being pecked at by hungry birds difficult to savour victory for long when a sight like this was the aftermath he sighed sadly then turned back round to face general lepidus kneeling stripped of his armour and left with just his tattered and bloodstained tunic this is what happens when you decide to take matters into your own hands caligulas hand idled on the pommel of his sword what did you honestly think was going to happen hmmmm lepiduss eyes were on caligulas idling fidgeting fingers i i had no choice i well actually i think you probably did have a choice caligula pouted disapprovingly down at him you could have come to me the moment that poisonous old man crassus started sending treacherous little notes to you you could have presented his letters to me and quite easily proved that i could trust you but no you chose not to i crassus was trying to make me look already guilty he was wording his letters to make it look like wed already spoken of of trying to kill me lepidus shut up and looked down defeated even if crassuss letters implicated you you should have come to me i would have understood i would have been fair merciful good grief im not a monster lepidus i it i was misled i was used oh you were misled all right i was frightened caligula crouched down before the general lifted the mans ample chin with a finger and looked him in the eyes frightened of me why whats to be afraid of i only want whats best for us all whats best for all romans he stood up again fear that was your undoing youre nothing but a frightened old man i should have far better men in charge of my legions he began to pull his sword out of its sheath please oh pleading is it so very sorry now are we lepidus nodded vigorously i was left with no choice i had to do something they goaded you coerced you into trying to kill me replace me caligula smiled and clearly you obviously thought you could replace me i no i didnt believe i dont think you were sorry this morning as you presented your legions for battle i think you were looking forward to the idea of sleeping in my bed tonight in my palace calling yourself emperor wearing my robes caligula laughed not that theyd fit you he lifted the tip of his gladius up and held it in front of lepiduss face sunlight reflected off the polished blade glinting into the generals eyes i need better men than you in charge of my legions younger braver men trustworthy fellows now listen to me lepidus you can go some way towards making amends if you were to let me know who else other than crassus was involved in this ridiculous charade the general licked dry lips quickly i i think my tribune atellus was in on it now yes thinking about it yes im sure of it caligula glanced at the tribunes body lying in the grass nearby well hes not exactly going to deny that now is he lepidus others iim sure there were yes crassus used to have visits from cicero paulus those two caligula nodded now thats a bit better yes he stroked his nose thoughtfully i could imagine those two old relics would have been involved somehow who else hmmm any other faces you noticed keeping crassus company lepiduss eyes darted left and right trawling a racing mind for names faces your palace tribune the new one caligula frowned what you dont mean cato lepidus looked up nodded vigorously again yes he was involved i im sure of it cato caligula frowned crassus hinted to me not long ago said said what he said he had someone in the palace someone close to you someone who could get to you caligula cast his mind back to the few conversations hed had with the man the tribune had always seemed professional reliable competent but then your stone men sire might i suggest you send them along you have my cohort here to guard you caligula spun round looking for the praefectus quintus quintus take your cavalry back to rome he nodded at the five remaining stone men their olivegreen armour spattered with dark droplets of dried blood take them with you as well the tribune of the palace cohort is to be arrested sire hes one of them quintus a traitor i want him arrested and i want him alive do you understand yes sire and have the rest of the guard assembled to march but caesar theyve just fought they need caligulas look silenced him have them assembled he repeated softly the prefect nodded saluted and turned to deliver his orders caligula once more looked down at the man in front of him an anxious twitching face bathed in sweat thank you lepidus he said absently and then without much thinking about it for good measure he quickly swung his sword down at the generals neck even before the arc of blood had landed on the dry sandy soil and arid grass of the hillside caligula had already turned on his heel and was heading towards his tent to change out of his uncomfortable armour the march back to rome would be a morning and an afternoon theyd be back by twilight he supposed if they moved out soon behind him he finally heard the thud of the generals body keeling over while all around the orders hed given to quintus were being barked down the ranks followed by the noise of five thousand men scrambling in response chapter ad imperial palace rome i cant let you in sir the optio grimaced uncomfortably at the thought of challenging his centurions order he craned his neck to look through the iron grille of the gate to get a better look past fronto at the sootcovered people behind him i cant let them into the palace grounds sir he swallowed nervously standing orders your orders septimus lad are exactly what i say they are now open this gate the optio looked unhappily at fronto torn between the dressingdown his centurion looked like he was about to give him and fear of what would happen to him if ever caligula discovered hed opened the northwest gate and let in some uninvited strangers is this on the emperors orders sir fronto sighed he was about to let rip at the optio with a blast of colourful language when cato appeared beside him its all right let them in septimus theyre my property i just wanted to bring them into the imperial grounds for safekeeping the optio nodded at his tribune right sorry sir i just cato shushed him and smiled quite all right you were doing your job the bolt slid back and the iron gate swung inwards fronto threw his optio a withering glare as he led his men and the others inside the gardens and the gate was slammed shut again cato looked at his old friend macro first then at maddy and the others what happened a fire happened grunted macro its all gone my investment my retirement fund everything there are fires all over the city said fronto cato nodded the smell of burning was on the air and a pall of smoke hung in the sky he spoke to fronto best assign your men back to their posts immediately centurion fronto nodded right you are sir cato waited until fronto had finished barking orders and the legionaries had dispersed to their deployment positions around the imperial grounds i can take you to the temple of neptune in the palace said cato i believe thats where you may find what youre looking for the things belonging to the visitors maddy glanced at liam and sal hes found something sal looked heartened what a time machine can you take us there right now asked maddy i can but theres a problem cato continued three stone men guarding it liam translated that for sal she sighed do you think your man could fight three of them at once cato looked at bob they are lighter combat models replied bob i have a reasonable chance of success and well help you said macro if you need help that is all three units detected the faint signal at the same time their eyes instantly locked on each other it was weak and it flickered out of detectable range for a moment then was there again an unidentifiable broadcast identification signal it is not one of ours a different systems manufacturer stern narrowed his eyes the carrier signals ident tag has an older version packet header the other two nodded in agreement v agreed sterns digital mind deconstructed the signal information model type wg systems heavy combat model batch number activation year os v is this unit a threat asked one of them if the unit compromises our users standing orders said stern it is a legitimate target its a heavy combat model stern said the other heavier than we are he looked at his squad member mildly impressed by the note of anxiety in the units voice an emotional stress indicator he must have picked up from a human and he was using quite convincingly now there are three of us we have a significant numerical advantage what if it has better weapons than us stern nodded certainly a concern although the three of them still wore their polygraphene body armour after all these years their weapons were useless it was strictly romanera swords and spears for them unitchuck unitbutch i have an order for you both units stood to attention affirmative locate and observe identify what weaponry the unit is carrying and report yes sir stern watched them push past the drape and listened to their heavybooted footsteps recede his digital mind had some simple calculations to make several combat scenarios to evaluate should this newly arrived support unit attempt to prevent him and his men from carrying out temporaryusercaligulas standing orders but his actual mind that tiny pink muscle linked by an umbilical cord of hairthin data wires was busy pondering how it was possible for another support unit albeit a slightly older model to be here in ancient rome chapter ad imperial palace rome its off the main passage beyond the entrance portico whispered cato hidden behind one of the thracian drapes on the right he turned to maddy and liam could your stone man attempt to lure them away maddy shrugged it will depend on what orders they have wont it bob affirmative if guarding the doorway is a higher priority than attempting to eliminate a potential threat then they will not attempt to pursue me in which case well just have to fight them said liam he turned to bob what do you think can we take em it is possible possible maddy sighed ok i guess i can go with possible cato nodded shall we proceed then one moment said bob cocking his head his eyelids flickered whats up asked liam bob nodded satisfied with something going on inside his head i am deactivating my local wireless communications system switching your wifi off maddy patted his back good idea cato led them across the east gardens of the imperial palace approaching a cordon of praetorians guarding the eastern portico the men stared suspiciously for a moment at the sootcovered people accompanying their tribune but cato snapped stiffly at them to remain focused on their duties and keep a watch on the perimeter walls for any looters attempting to take advantage of the citywide chaos he walked them past the guards out of the afternoon sun and into the cool dimly lit labyrinth of caligulas palace past marble columns and intricate vividly coloured designs in mosaic tiles on the floor wow this is totally bindaas sal whispered softly almost silently even so her whisper echoed across the cavernous interior the palace should be entirely empty now except for the three stone men said cato the slaves of the palace have been confined to their quarters my men are all stationed outside the building watching the entrances the gardens it is just us inside which way cato nodded ahead this leads to the main passageway the tribune led the way with bob by his side a short sword clutched in each fist behind them maddy and sal hands clasped anxiously bringing up the rear liam and macro warily glancing behind them and into the shadows between columns their breathing echoed in the gloom the tap of their feet sounding precariously loud presently they looked out on to a broad passageway almost as broad as any roman thoroughfare the walls towered to meet a ceiling of murals that depicted heroic scenes of presumably caligula it was punctuated every now and then with small skylight openings that allowed meagre shafts of sunlight to pierce the gloom and angle down on to the mosaic tile floor like muted spotlights cato indicated to the right and cautiously led the way they walked slowly along the broad passage until finally cato stopped and pointed at a gently shifting drape the others nodded bob crossed the passageway until he stood beside the drape a draught of cool air was teasing it liam could feel it on his skin as he macro and cato stood weapons ready beside him and there it was again the same thing that cursed him every time he faced the possibility of imminent violence his legs trembling like the whiskers of a rodent his mouth as dry as parchment he glanced quickly at macro his dark beard splitting with a grin of excitement beside him cato a foot taller poised with a face almost as stone cold and impassive as bobs both men seemed utterly used to this that moment of readiness before a fight that final breath that heartbeat before the calm became a bloody thrashing chaos liam sighed why cant i ever look as ready as that cato checked the others were ready then quickly leaned forward and pulled the drape aside chapter ad imperial palace rome maddy gasped at the sight of it standing there legs planted astride sword drawn almost as if it had been patiently waiting for them but it was the things appearance that surprised her the breathtaking historical contradiction standing there in the flickering light of a pair of oil lamps with a gladius held ready in one hand and a gladiators shield in the other was something quite unmistakably from the twentyfirst century a soldier in military olive green a soldier wearing a polygraphene torso plate shoulder and forearm armour plates thigh and shin plates and black combat boots at a glance except for the sword and shield that is little different from the kind of specialforces guys she was used to seeing in grainy night vision sliding down ropes on to the terrace roofs of al qaeda hideouts you are not permitted beyond this point it said almost politely leave immediately bob met its gaze you must step aside the soldier studied bob for a moment a flicker of recognition comprehension in his eyes you are a heavy combat model bob nodded affirmative you are a multirole reconnaissance model a later version yes i am he smiled same manufacturer maddy could have sworn both clones nodded a quick nicetomeetyou greeting at each other you must step aside said bob finally you are not permitted beyond this point our priorities conflict agreed both units eyes flickered for a split second as they processed the same conclusion but it was the soldierunit who reacted first he thrust his sword at bobs neck with the speed of a snake bite bob dodged to one side but not fast enough to avoid the tip skewering him deeply just above the collarbone bob retaliated with a roundhouse swing of the sword in his right hand the soldier parried the heavy blow with his shield a clatter and ring that sounded deafening bob thrust with his other sword at the units midriff its reaction time or perhaps it was a module of combatprediction code anticipated the move and sidestepped it with an almost beckslike ballerina grace as it yanked its blade free from bobs shoulder macro took a step forward and thrust his sword at the unit it swept its bloody blade down from bob and effortlessly blocked macro with a jarring rasp of clashing sword edges bob tried again with his right sword this time a thrust not a swing the shield snapped down to intercept it another clang filled the passageway this time though the guard of bobs sword caught on the curved edge of the shield leverage for him a chance to use his brawn bob flung his sword arm to the right wrenching the small gladiators shield out of the units grasp and hurling it against the passage wall the soldierunit backed up a step eyes flickering from bob to macro and now liam as he took a faltering step forward to help them out liam no dont hissed maddy you will lose rumbled bob stand down hes right snarled macro the unit was crouched like a rattlesnake ready to strike passing its sword deftly from one hand to the other you do not have security clearance to pass please leave immediately macro and liam were edging round either side of it cato warily holding his ground in front of it a threesided confrontation for the unit but maddy suspected it had already identified liams as the weak side he was no soldier liam she cried please get back im fine so i am mads he called back over his shoulder the soldierunit took advantage of that the split second of distraction it took a quick step in liams direction and thrust its sword at his gut the blade disappeared into his linen tunic and liam yelped in pain the unit quickly pulled the blade back the tip spattered with blood liam clutched his side a blossom of crimson spreading through the material as he dropped to his knees macro thrust his old sword into the units flank exposed by the lunge towards liam once again the units mind working in nanoseconds of prediction anticipated that and successfully dodged the thrusting blade with both arms committed now however one withdrawing from liam the other blocking macros thrust the unit had nothing left to counter bobs sweeping downward stroke his blade bit deep into the units head through the skull deep enough to cause catastrophic irrevocable damage to the organicsilicon processing centre inside stern teetered unsteadily on his feet for a moment a look of complete incomprehension in his grey eyes a small trickle of dark blood ran between his brows down the left side of his nose and on to his cheek he gasped something incomprehensible before falling forward flat on his face quite dead liammmm screamed sal starting forward she raced across the passage and scooted down beside liam still kneeling holding his side his face had turned grey his skin waxy with beads of sweat ahhh jayzus this hurts maddy was next to him liam her voice was shaking liam how bad is it he grimaced with the pain do i look like a bleedin doctor i i dont know macro and cato joined the girls macros looked after enough of his boys on the field macro nodded let me take a look at you lad bob grasped maddys shoulder we do not have much time maddy the other units are nearby somewhere your stone man is right said cato he nodded at the door in front of them if whatever you seek is in there then perhaps we should hurry maddy looked back down at liam now sprawled on the mosaic tiles looking ashen macro ripping open the bloodstained tunic to get a look at the wound sal she said she nodded understood ill keep an eye on him you go on maddy got up and followed bob and cato towards the door a thick iron locking bar ran across both doors and bob easily slid it back with a heavy rasp that filled the short secret passageway maddy reached for a handle be careful said cato he tapped the heavy doors with his knuckles these seem like doors built more to keep something in than keep intruders out the tribune took a deep breath a sign perhaps that despite his rational mind a part of him still held a wary suspicion that the supernatural realm of gods might just exist maddy grasped the handle and pulled the thick oak door rattled heavily but didnt budge she cursed after all that its freakin locked bob gently pushed against the other door it swung inwards with an ominous creak negative you just need to push not pull chapter ad imperial palace rome maddy reached for a tallow candle and stepped inside the dark room the candles guttering flame picked out little detail a vast room that echoed like a cavern she could see a ceiling above faintly frescos and decoration left for so many years in complete darkness bob and cato entered behind her another two candles marginally increasing the light in the room she took a dozen steps in until finally the candlelight glinted on piles of objects on the floor laid out on several wooden tables she went over to the nearest table and set her candle down on it bob over here the support unit and tribune joined her bob studied the items on the table hydrogen cell powered pulse rifles he said drily what are these devices asked cato weapons maddy replied weapons from the future catos eyes widened the stories of the visitors cicero once mentioned they had spears that roared he looked at them these i doubt theyll roar any more replied maddy picking one of them up blowing the dust off it and inspecting the weapon more closely information without maintenance the hydrogen cells will be dead by now maddy looked across the wooden table there were other things supplies of all sorts medicines emergency food packs tools this wasnt just a field trip she gasped those visitors came here to stay do you think to to colonize roman times bob nodded that appears to be a plausible conclusion she picked up her candle and wandered towards a pile of objects on the floor nearby she squatted down and inspected them clothes shoes glasses some of them spattered with faded bloodstains by the look of the mound of items of clothing there must have been a lot of them perhaps hundreds and all of them massacred and this then uttered cato almost reverentially this must have been one of the chariots they arrived in maddy turned to look he was on the other side of the room now holding his candle up to inspect something large that glinted dully in the gloom she and bob hurried over and a moment later the three of them were inspecting the dusty slanted metal sides of a large vehicle to maddys eyes it looked like a cross between a humvee and a hovercraft multiterrain personnel carrier with antigrav thrusters for a limitedaltitude vtol capability said bob this appears to be a more advanced model than the prototypes being fieldtested by the us military in maddy shook her head this is completely crazy the scale of time contamination i mean this is insane what the hell were they thinking maddy it was sal she turned round and saw her silhouette in the doorway how is he macros bound him up she managed a relieved smile not serious he said just a flesh wound ok ok she sighed thats good she looked round the room there were plenty of other things to inspect perhaps somewhere in this room please god a time machine of some sort something to get them back home now bob if theyve brought with them some sort of a timedisplacement device and its in here somewhere we need to find it affirmative but there is unlikely to be a viable source of power still bob clambered up on to the slanted metal hull of the vehicle i will look inside the personnel carrier you do that she turned to sal were going to find a way home sal i promise stay with liam ok sal nodded and quickly disappeared out of the doorway a time machine please tell me you idiots brought with you a means to get back home please you guys cant have been that stupid right perhaps they werent stupid just desperate she returned to the tables stacked with guns and ammunition cartridges and webbing and field equipment hoping to find some firstaid packs anaesthetic for liam more importantly something antiseptic to cleanse the wound antibiotics to fight any potential infection he wasnt going to make it if that sword wasnt clean in this prepenicillin time even a paper cut could finish you off if you got unlucky she found a firstaid pack unzipped it it was fully stocked sal sal came back in here unwrap liam theres an antibiotic spray in here use that and use these bandages at least theyre clean sal took the firstaid pack and hurried back outside maddy resumed looking round the vast room her candle picked out a large object in the middle a box a crate of some kind crate a protective crate she made her way quickly towards it doing her best to stifle the growing hope it might actually contain a machine eagerly waiting to be switched on and ready to conveniently whisk them back home to life doesnt actually work that way does it mads not for them at any rate closer she could see it looked less like a packing crate and more like the kind of travel cage youd transport a wild animal in shed once watched a show on cable tv a dayinthelifeof kind of show based on laguardia airport thered been an episode with a sedated indian tiger in a crate in the back of an aeroplane last of its kind or something anyway the crate had looked not unlike this one she stepped warily closer to it expecting at any moment to hear the enraged snarl of a roused tiger or a lion coming from inside she noticed a sliding trapdoor on one side of the crate lion tiger or time machine this crate reinforced with iron brackets on the corners had to contain something important gently she eased the trapdoor to the side revealing a hatchway eighteen inches wide and six high a viewing slot a feeding slot she wrinkled her nose there was an awful stench spilling out of it like sewage slurry no even worse decay a feeding slot then it had to be there was some kind of animal being kept in there or one that had died and was quietly decomposing slowly she raised her candle its flickering glow beginning to pick out a few slats of wood on the inside hello she uttered softly anything in there she heard a sudden scratching sound the scramble of movement inside the box then a pair of eyes suddenly lurched into view oh my god eyes wide and milky almost human or perhaps human but entirely insane animalcrazy completely feral the eyes were accompanied by a shrill frantic gurgling whinnying cry its face yes a human face she could see that now was hidden from the bridge of the nose down to the chin by some sort of leather and iron mask strapped round the head and caked in scum and dirt oh god over here she cried theres someone alive in here chapter ad imperial palace rome bob worked the reinforcing brackets off then pulled away the thick bars of wood that made the cage jeeez whispered maddy as she caught her first glimpse of the rest of the pitiful creature cowering inside is that really a man in there the frail skeletal body inside looked like that of an old man edges and bulges where bone pushed out against paperthin skin his skin was darker than mediterranean skin middle eastern asian perhaps and hair lots of it cascading down his narrow shoulders once upon a time dark but now grey threaded with white in places the man cowered in the corner at the sight of bob pulling the cage open bar by bar shhh its ok maddy cooed softly were not going to hurt you cato stepped closer to get a better look at him is is this one of the visitors the man in the mask glanced at him quickly he nodded vigorously manic darting eyes growing even wider he whimpered mewed and gurgled bony hands gesturing frantically at the mask over his mouth maddy stepped forward let me take that off you is that what you want the man scrambled unsteadily forward his bare feet padded off a soft bed of trampled faecal matter years worth of human waste compacted into an almost compostlike bed on to the cool hard tiles with a gentle patter he turned his back to maddy and frantically lifted his long matted hair to reveal a crusted iron band with a padlock on it its a lock im im sorry i dont let me said cato he pulled his sword out and carefully dug the tip of his blade into the locks rusted clasp with a sharp twist it snapped and showered flakes of rust to the floor maddy eased the band away from his head grimacing at the skin worn bald at the back of the mans head the fresh scabs the fading scars the old man untangled his matted hair the long wisps of his beard and moustache from the masks locking band he eased the mask itself away from lips crusted with scab and dried mucus the feed tube the outside of it coated in the slime of rotting food lodged in the front of the mouth emerged from a largely toothless face gums almost completely black with the ruined stumps of dead teeth oh jesus maddy whispered controlling the urge to retch the mask clunked to the floor the echo filling the cavernous dark room are you one of the visitors cato asked the man seemed to be in a state of shock hyperventilating gasping his tongue snaking out and tasting the air relishing its release from captivity did you come from the future tried maddy in english his darting eyes stopped on her immediately english you can understand me his jaw flexed trying to speak trying to form words with his ruined mouth just then bob stirred information maddy held a hand up to shush him hes trying to say something the old man was gurgling something trying to produce a word caution said bob more insistently i am detecting two more idents approaching from the east quickly two of them we dont stand a chance against two of them what is your stone man saying asked cato maddy turned to look at the doorway the others are coming she hissed in latin to cato sal she started towards the doors sal get liam inside hurry a moment later she saw macro and sal with liam dangling between them shuffling inside weve got to close the doors screamed maddy help me she jogged across the floor and began to wrestle with one of the oak doors macro grabbed the other the doors creaking on solid iron hinges bob was beside her a moment later and with a heavy rattling thud the wan light from the oil lamps in the small passage outside was gone by the light of her candle she could see there was no way to secure the doors no locking bar on this side no padlocks nothing they are twenty yards away said bob everyone weve got to hold the doors she barked wedging her shoulder against one of them cato was beside her now no theyll lock us inside and well be trapped in here macro nodded catos right well be dead men if were stuck in here when caligula returns cato drew his sword we should fight them now we have a chance against them theyll kill us all maddy cried better that said macro than caligula finding us in his palace they are now directly outside said bob the doors suddenly boomed and rattled under the impact of something a shaft of light spilled in as the doors momentarily parted bob threw his weight against them both and they clattered shut again theres no knowing how long we have said cato frontos lads are loyal to the emperor and their prefect quintus theyre following my orders for now because they think im loyal too but they catch a glimpse of whats gone on here do you understand theyre our men until they realize theyre being fooled cato shook his head we have to find whatever contraption it is you need to put things right and we have to leave this place quickly bobs voice rumbled out of the gloom he is correct maddy we are trapped in here this is not tactically advisable all right maddy panted in the dark all right ok well ahh jeeesus this is freakin crazy so i guess what were gonna fight them your stone man macro and i i say we have a chance wait the voice came from out of the dark she heard the slap of bare feet approaching wait i know this his voice was weak and brittle the words slurred and almost incomprehensible the word he croaked the word theres a word i know it theres a word they didnt have time for this does everyone have a wweapon maddy whimpered nervously oh god i cant believe were doing this were going to die the word cried the old man i i have the wooooord stand back old man barked macro readying the sword in his hands on three said cato to bob you open those doors on three is that clear affirmative get back sal whispered maddy holding the hilt of a knife in trembling hands shaddyah maddy what were letting them in one two and three bob pulled both doors inwards stepping backwards into the room as the dancing light of oil lamps outside spilled in to meet them he pulled the sword from his belt the two stone men charged into the room side by side not a single microsecond wasted in offering a challenge ssssspongebubba screamed the old man an insane wild banshee scream that peeled round the darkness like the cry of some nocturnal forest creature the units instantly froze they dropped their swords and shields at their feet a deafening clatter and rasp of metal on ceramic their heads dipped in unison their eyes slowly closed as they straightened their posture arms dropped to their sides and they planted their feet heel by heel soldiers standing to attention ten twenty seconds passed the silence filled with a chorus of panting breath what are they doing gasped maddy presently both units raised their heads and opened their eyes gazed quite neutrally almost benignly at them diagnostic mode reinitialized they both calmly announced please state your username and password chapter ad imperial palace rome centurion fronto heard the impatient clatter of hooves nonetheless his optio called out the obvious horses sir i can hear them he stepped towards the iron gate and looked out on to the vicus patricius an hour earlier there had been several hundred citizens gathered out there pleading to be let in begging for food and water no roughtalking plebeians these but the betteroff citizens welltodo merchants friends and hangerson of the court theyd been there grasping the iron bars and rocking the gate menacingly hed had to muster several sections of his century to form up inside the palace compound open the gates and present an advancing shield wall to flush them away theyd dispersed eventually but not before a few of them had felt the probing tip of a gladius between their ribs since then it had been relatively quiet outside little but the occasional shout and scream echoed from back streets and across rooftops the faint rasp and clang of blades here and there as collegia and neighbourhood militias fought each other he looked through the iron bars and saw a column of cavalry making their way hastily up the vicus patricius towards them for a moment he wasnt sure if it was an advance party of scouts from lepiduss legions or their own praetorian cavalry squadron septimus can you make them out the optio squinted the sun was approaching the skyline of roofs and terraces the men on horseback were a jiggling silhouetted mass of helmet plumes oval shields and the bucking heads of horses not sure sir but as they drew closer fronto caught a flash of purple tunic his heart sank imperial purple theyre ours that didnt bode well if those had been red tunics theyd be horsemen from the tenth and eleventh it would mean lepidus had won and caligula was finished the column of horsemen drew up outside the gates and a decurion dismounted quickly striding towards the gates fronto ordered the gates open and went outside to meet him the young officer stopped and saluted him fronto acknowledged the junior officer make your report whats happened sir the young man gasped for breath clearly he and his men had ridden hard general lepidus has been beaten sir fronto nodded forced a grin on to his face that is good news and the general hes dead sir fronto struggled to contain a sigh of relief dead at least lepidus wasnt going to be able to tell caligula anything name any names hopefully hed done the honourable thing and taken his own life before he could be captured alive sir i have orders from the prefect yes the decurion seemed hesitant come on what is it your tribune tribune cato what about him i have orders for his immediate arrest sir what you are to arrest him immediately the prefect the emperor himself wants him taken alive sir fronto stroked his chin his mind racing my tribune my commanding officer hes youre telling me hes a traitor just have those orders sir right he nodded right i ill have to hes to be taken alive yes yes i understand ill have to he turned hesitantly to look at his men watching from inside the open gate all of this was out of their earshot he could see an expectant look on their faces eager to hear whatever news the messenger had just brought wait here decurion ill see to his arrest personally yes sir fronto turned on his heel and strode smartly back to his men he picked out his optio and spoke in a lowered voice close the gates sir those men outside fronto thumbed over his shoulder theyre traitors theyve turned against the emperor the optio s eyes widened so did those of the other men close enough to hear theyre a part of general lepiduss plot they are not to be admitted into the imperial compound under any circumstances do you understand yes sir further down the avenue he could see another couple of turmae of cavalry arriving a single squad a turma accompanying a messenger was quite normal but others arriving he wondered if praefectus quintus had despatched the entire cavalry wing close the gates the optio barked to his men several men dropped their shields and worked the iron gates closed the decurion called out something confused take another step forward and youll get a javelin roared fronto through the bars the decurion stopped in his tracks whats going on septimus sir send someone into the palace to find the tribune tell him weve got company out here yes sir the optio turned sharply and picked one of his men to take the message fronto watched the decurion standing outside in the avenue shrugging with bewilderment at the gate being closed on him fronto wondered how long he was going to maintain this confusion among his own men sooner or later they were going to question his orders lads he barked so that they could all hear those men outside have turned against our emperor they are traitors the emperor was victorious this morning and our boys are already on the road back to rome we must protect the palace until then his men eyed him uncertainly no one is to enter roared fronto not a single man until our emperor returns until our emperor approaches up that avenue is this clear his men chorused a yes sir good he looked through the bars at the decurion the young man had caught most of what hed just bellowed his eyes met frontos and he shook his head gravely he was perfectly clear on what the situation was now that it wasnt just tribune cato who was to be taken alive the decurion shook his head again it said more than a mouthful of words could convey a warning from one officer to another you are a stupid fool sir chapter ad imperial palace rome maddy and the others listened to the poor old wretch gabble his cracked lips opened sores as they moved frantically a trickle of blood and spittle rolled from his lips and into his thick mucusencrusted beard i hacked them i you see i they were reset to take his orders slow down said maddy please slow down youre not making sense chief technical officer me mme see i was in charge exodus exodus exodus pproject the project exodus i was chief ttechnical officer the old man squatted down on the cool floor his painfully malnourished body already exhausted from the rush of excitement cato crouched down beside them ask him if he was one of the visitors oh i think he must be replied maddy rrashim mmy name it its rashim he replied in broken latin yes i i was one of them i wwas there i was there sal came over to join them ive bound liam up and jahulla her eyes took in the ruined facsimile of a human being tucked into a foetal huddle on the floor she stifled a gasp who is that we think hes one of the visitors maddy whispered in reply she turned back to the man what happened to you she asked what happened to the others rashims wild eyes danced from cato to her bbetrayed my fault oh my ggod it it wwas all my fault i i jjust wanted to i never thought that i oh god ohgodohgodohgod maddy touched his hand held it to calm him down shhh its ok its ok youre safe now were going to get you out of here no mmust listen yyou must listen to mme now he snatched his hand from her time not mmuch time it it it hhappens soon what does tell me tell mme the day what is the day whatistheday date is that what you want you want the precise date rashims head nodded vigorously tell mme his thin voice was almost a childlike scream maddy looked at bob information todays date in the roman calendar is twentynine sextilis in the twentieth year of gaius in the contemporary calendar that would be twentyninth august ad rashims eyes rolled showing the whites and his eyelids drooped down almost closing his cracked and bloody lips fluttered silently counting calculating what is it asked maddy rashim rashim is that your name what are you doing he raised a bony finger tipped with a long clawlike nail to shush her his lips still silently twitching and leaking bloody spittle into his beard rashim whats up whatre you doing are you counting is that it noooo rashim bellowed suddenly nononono too soon too soon toosoon too soon cato grasped maddys arm roughly tell me what is he saying too many things too much hitting her at once maddy was ready to scream along with this crazy scarecrow of a man on the floor beside her rashim what tell me what is too soon his eyes locked on her i am ccoming i will be here what are you talking about bbeacons beacons llight to show the way i i came i came years bbefore i wwas here to show the way she shook her head that meant nothing to her it was complete gibberish r rreceivers rashim continued i pplaced ththem tttachyon bbeacons maddy looked up quickly at bob his inert face flickered with a reaction rashim did you just say tachyon asked maddy he was burbling nonsense again the halfwhisper of a deranged mind she grabbed his shoulders firmly rashim you said the word tachyon youre talking about time travel yes he nodded frantically yes yes mmarkers ssignals madelaine bob hunkered down beside her this could be an alternate timedisplacement method marking out a locked location a timestamp rashims face lit up hearing that his deranged whispering brushed aside in an instant yes yyes understand he grinned manically looking at bob then maddy ttime travel exactly we came through all those all those years but i came through before the others see yes it was me i had to set it up you understand you placed out what some kind of timestamp markers asked maddy beacons is that what youre saying yes yyes then we aall came through we all came through exodus exodus what is that is that the name of your your group or something she recalled a name stamped on the side of the firstaid pack project exodus project exodus pproject yes he huffed air into his lungs we came the future is dead we came back we ccame back here that that is was mmy project my project my project they heard the gravelrasp of macros voice an exchange of voices outside the temple in the short passageway a moment later he was standing in the pooling light of the doorway cato weve got some company lepidus macro shook his head slowly no such luck cato cursed he looked at maddy caligulas on his way back we may not have much time left can you buy us some more time he gestured at the piles of dustcovered technology so can we use these things maddy shrugged maybe maybe theres a way out of here i just i cato nodded ill do what i can he got up and headed to the doorway they watched him go until bob broke the silence it is possible rashim may have been part of an advance party that arrived in this time to deploy markers in order to plot out a safe arrival area for a much larger group rashim nodded but calculations i made mistakes so many mmistakes he shook his head eyes leaking tears on to his scabencrusted cheeks too many new ppeople they made me guess i had toguess his eyes darted wildly in their sunken sockets you cant just guess this has to be precise time ttranslation you must be precise you understand precise maddy nodded oh yes i know that ii i got it wrong wwe lost half of them lost do you mean in chaos space rashim stilled chaos chaos he worked the word round his mouth chaos yes or hell hmmm hell he licked his dry cracked lips shook his head and began to giggle manically this is my hell my hell my hell my hideyhole hell my hideyhole hell me and mr muzzy mr muzzy and me rashim she shook him by the shoulders rashim come on stay with us his face steadied the insane smile slid off his lips and vanished into his beard i lost them in chaos lost ssouls now you said half of them what about everyone else what about the rest of you you came here right rashim laughed again bitterly arrived seven seventeen years too early strings of bloodtinted spittle hung from his lower lip wrong time wrong time wrong caesar bob said maddy im just trying to figure this out hes saying he made a hashup of things and his group what overshot these timestamp markers correct that is what i believe he is saying they went back seventeen years earlier than intended she looked at him and that happened about seventeen years ago thats when the visitors supposedly arrived affirmative she shook rashim from his manic reverie rashim is that what youre saying your deployment team are going to appear sometime soon appear to place out those beacons he nodded he knows too he who god rashim chuckled god bob looked confused right said sal dismissively hes a nut she looked at the others and were listening to him no wait said maddy hes talking about caligula arent you rashim i told him it was this year this summer i told him oh my god you actually told him about your advance party appearing about there being a portal rashim nodded he his his doorway to heaven maddy looked at bob could we use it could we use this portal to get home i have no information this must be a timedisplacement technique developed after my inception date after the agencys database was set up but its got to be similar the same basic technology right correct if its a beacon could we use it to communicate forward to computerbob bob nodded theoretically the only way to transmit data is a tachyon transmission the big question was whether computerbob was still in one piece capable of receiving anything rashim you said its soon a few moments ago you said soon you were talking about the advance party appearing right he offered her an appalling gummy smile too soon too soon he replied in a singsong voice three days three days time rashim nodded do you know where can you tell us exactly where he was mumbling to himself in that unhinged singsong way rashim i know i remember he tapped his skull of tatty wiry hair all in here dont worry me and mr muzzy know sal cocked an eyebrow at her chapter ad imperial palace rome cato strode down the dimly lit main passageway towards the front portico i said theyre not actually from britain macro looked at him theyre not no the place they come from is cato made a face im still struggling to make sense of it myself as it happens the place they come from is the future the future yes the very same place as the visitors time ahead of us macro frowned as his mind worked on that years yet to be cato nodded but from a place more than a thousand years yet to be he expected his old friend to struggle with that concept instead he nodded casually well that explains quite a lot then macro i dont understand whats going on with that prisoner we found theyre talking about something perhaps theyre discussing some of the visitors devices perhaps their chariot i dont know but all i do know is we have got to find a way to give them some more time cato theres you and me your centurion fronto and that giant of a man back inside bob yes bob strange name anyway im not sure how long the four of us can hold back the entire praetorian guard cato thats a fools errand we have frontos men thats enough men right there to hold the front gate for a while if it comes to a fight thats if theyll fight on our side true they strode through the entrance portico cato nodded at the section of men stationed there they carried on down several steps outside into the courtyard he could see frontos men across the courtyard drawn up in an arc round the iron gates through the iron bars he could see a body of troops outside dismounted equites cavalry on foot acting for the moment very reluctantly as infantry he picked out fronto and approached him centurion sir whats going on here fronto nodded to the decurion still standing outside the gates beyond him cato could see in the failing light of the late afternoon what looked like two or three hundred men and their horses still more of them in the distance a column on horseback trotting up the avenue this traitor sir fronto barked loud enough for his men to hear him clearly wishes to loot the emperors palace i see the decurion caught frontos reply above the noise of his own men assembling in ranks behind him thats not true i have orders from the prefect the decurion looked at cato orders for your arrest its common practice in the roman army to address a senior officer as sir decurion open the gates immediately the decurion snapped as frontos men lined up behind their shield wall this tribune is to be arrested for treachery macro snarled angrily and took several steps towards the gate he grabbed the iron rails in his hands this tribune is your superior officer the decurion offered him a patronizing smile and you what are you you fat old man nothing not even a soldier macro ground his teeth then spat through the bars i could still take you on boy the officer ignored him you will open the gates immediately or you will all be treated as traitors and punished accordingly lads cato turned to face his men those men outside the gate have become deserters mercenaries theyre here to fill their pockets and then flee the city before our emperor returns it is our sacred duty to hold this gate hes lying quiet snapped macro smacking his fist against the bars of the gate men cato shouted his voice was never going to match the paradeground roar of macro or fronto but it carried the authority of rank and experience the emperor has entrusted this cohort and this particular century to guard his home he favours us he trusts us if we allow those men outside he laughed those horsemaidens to come in the men shared his amusement there was little love lost between any legions foot soldiers and its squadron of cavalry equites who considered themselves a class above the rest then we are breaking his trust and disobeying a direct imperial order the decurion sighed shook his head right have it your own way cato joined macro beside the gate they watched as the young officer turned away from them and headed back to rejoin his men fronto joined the pair of them well done sir he said quietly some of my lads were looking a bit twitchy for a moment there this standoffs only going to last until someone turns up with a higher rank or a written order said cato then those men will turn us over maybe not theyre good boys all in fronto shot a glance at the anxious faces of his men eyes glinting in the shadow of their helmets eyes on their centurion theyre a loyal bunch loyal enough to be branded traitors alongside us replied cato to face caligulas wrath the centurion pursed his lips not entirely sure of his answer like i say this standoffs going to be over the moment we get a higher rank out there standoff macro sucked air through his gapteeth it looks like were up for a bit of a scrap if you ask me look cato followed the direction hed nodded in and saw a cart being rolled forward through the assembled ranks it was stacked high and heavy with sacks of animal manure pushed by several dozen men and beginning to roll under its own momentum he reached up and tightened the strap on his helmet i think you might be right there macro chapter ad imperial palace rome the front rank of dismounted equites sidestepped to allow the trundling cart through its large ironrimmed wheels clattered noisily across the paving stones of the square before the palaces northeast gate thats coming right through grunted macro cato nodded the iron gates were more decorative than they were utilitarian the cart was going to knock them right off their hinges without any trouble at all fronto form up your men closer to the gate he pointed to stone posts either side and the eightfoot wall that continued all the way round the imperial palace once theyve barged those gates open we can hold them in that bottleneck for a while right you are sir fronto advanced his men to within twelve feet of the gates ready to press forward into the open space the moment the cart was pulled back to allow the equites in where do you want me cato asked macro cato smiled where you feel most at home in the thick of it then macro flashed a dark grin at him like old times eh lad like old times the cart outside had found the gentlest incline and now was rolling freely towards the iron gates shedding several sacks as it bounced and vibrated across the flagstones steady lads bellowed fronto cato watched macro shoulder his way in among the front rank of the centurions men come on ladies make a hole he heard his friend growl at them like old times cato remembered his first skirmish in the army he was just a boy only a couple of weeks into basic training macro on the other hand had been little different from the way he was now short and stocky an impenetrable wall of foulmouthed confidence he remembered that first skirmish being petrified beyond belief but somehow even in the middle of the clash of arms and the screams of the dying knowing that standing right beside his centurion right beside macro he was safe that hed always be safe as if a cloak of invincibility surrounded that cantankerous old man here it comes boys shouted macro whos up for teaching these horsegirls how to fight the men either side of him roared with nervous laughter cato grinned as he stood beside fronto youll have to excuse him you once served under him cato nodded oh yes and he was just as bad then the cart closed the final few yards and crashed into the iron gates knocking the left gate so hard its hinges exploded from the stone pillar in a shower of dust the gate collapsed inwards and they heard a roar from the praetorian cavalrymen outside a moment later the cart lurched as men behind it began to work it back clear of the tangle of bent and crimped iron bars the other gate hanging from just one twisted hinge clattered over on to the ground and caught up on the carts axle was dragged away as the cart was pulled clear of the gateway advance ordered fronto the front rank sixteen men wide advanced behind their presented shield wall one step at a time they approached until they finally filled the gap between the stone pillars cato spotted the decurion now joined by a cluster of several others still mounted he saw the plume of another ranking officer trotting through the kickedup dust and haze outside the praefectus alae commanding officer of the guards entire cavalry wing he cursed the last thing he needed was that officer talking round frontos men better that the talking was all done and the fighting had begun he decided to hasten things along fronto lets give them an opening volley the centurion nodded and barked an order for his men to readyandrelease on his command the men two ranks of sixteen all took a step backwards javelins drawn back in their right hands release the modest volley arced through the air across thirty yards and picked out no more than a dozen victims not enough to make any sort of a difference but enough to ensure the time for parlaying was over the equites many of them foreigners from across the empire batavians sarmatians expert horsemen but certainly no match for legionaries on foot began to advance on the gateway in a ragged loosely formed line short spears protruding between their shields a line of light oval shields designed for dextrous horseback melee not closed formations spears instead of their swords another cavalry habit they were used to wielding a weapon with reach cato pointed that out and fronto nodded idiots havent got a clue how to fight on foot a moment later the gap between them was closed and the clatter and ring of blades on shields and spear tips on armour began to fill the ominous stillness that had descended over the smokeshrouded city chapter ad imperial palace rome we have to get out of rome said maddy i mean like now bob nodded that must be our mission priority she joined sal and liam beside the doorway and hunkered down beside them how is he it stings like hell liam winced burns hes not bleeding any more sal pointed at the bandage wrapped round liams waist i dont think any veins or whatever were cut what about internal bleeding sal shrugged i dont know what to look for nor did maddy it was just a phrase shed heard often enough on hospital dramas right well when we get him back home well get him looked at by someone get back home liam laughed sarcastically good luck with that were going to find a way out of rome there is a way home a window a return window and were going to try and use it ok the other two nodded bob brought rashim out supporting an emaciated elbow in one large hand he blinked and grimaced at the modest light of several flickering oil lamps maddy had a thought rashim could we use that hovervehicle thing back in there he shook his head shading his eyes and wincing uhuh a big ddead dragon now yes it is she shook her head she didnt have time for his wittering madness what the hell does that mean information said bob the vehicle is hydrogen cell powered the cells will have needed maintenance they will not be any good to us now rashim he was muttering to himself again she grabbed his arm rashim where this portal is is it close enough that we can get there in time on foot he hunched his narrow shoulders time flies time flies tick tock tick tock were wasting our time with him said sal he knows where to go sal we need him maddy pushed a loose tangle of hair out of her blinking eyes and weve got to escape this palace the city somehow cato he can help us she replied he knows this palace where did he go did you see which way i think hes outside at the front of the palace with all the other soldiers it was then that they heard it the faint sound of metallic ringing and raised voices maddy and sal looked at each other is that someone fighting said sal maddy cocked her head to listen for a moment i think it is then were too late arent we were trapped she looked up at maddy jahulla we are arent we liam winced opened his eyes no way im getting stuck in here well have to find a way out said maddy can you move liam im sure as eggs not bleedin staying he tried to sit up groaning as he held his side ahhh ow ouch it bleedin well stings bob you carry liam me and sal well help the old guy she said nodding at rashim which way are we going asked sal lets try and find cato maybe he can help us a moment later they pushed the hanging drape aside and emerged from the concealed passage and stepped into the main hallway liam groaning carried piggyback his arms wrapped round bobs neck rashim shuffled between maddy and sal giggling and warbling gibberish to himself that way said maddy nodding to the left towards the increasing sounds of battle they made their way down towards the entrance portico closer maddy caught the flickering of glinting armour bathed in the bloodred light of sunset whats going on up there they arrived inside the highceilinged portico to find it swamped with wounded men bleeding out on the marble floor through the archway down the steps she could see the palace guard were drawn up in three lines along the bottom of the steps the courtyard was filling with other soldiers she caught a glimpse of catos horsehair crest among the men organizing the defensive lines across the steps she pushed her way through the mass of men and finally stood beside him whats going on who are they caligulas praetorian cavalry all the damned alae five hundred of them he looked at her did you find what you were looking for she nodded look cato we need to talk well as you can see im a bit busy right now theres a way we can fix all this make it not happen please we need to talk ill explain cato looked out at the equites they were flooding into the gardens theyd managed to push his men back from the gateway through sheer weight of numbers this was their next best bottleneck to try and hold the portico but it was all but over for them now anyway they were into the palace compound now there were other entrances to the palace buildings soon enough they were going to be overwhelmed the portico was going to be a last stand for them plain and simple cato grabbed macros arm macro yes give me a few moments i need to talk to our friends quickly macros brow cocked can they weave some kind of magic for us he shrugged thats what im hoping he nodded at the remnants of frontos century the centurion had gone down five minutes earlier the thrust of a cavalry spear to his throat hed gone down thrashing angrily with his sword managing to at least catch and give a lifelong scar to the man whod killed him theyre all yours macro he nodded right you are the men exchanged a salute then macro turned and started bellowing a barrage of coarse language over the heads of the few dozen men drawn up on the steps maddy led cato back inside into the portico where liam sal bob and rashim were standing they stepped through a carpet of the writhing wounded to join them she pointed at rashim ok he knows a place where a time window will open a time window catos eyes narrowed thats a device that lets you travel through through time yes exactly and this window opens in three days he shook his head were not going to last three more hours let alone its somewhere outside rome you wish to find a way out escape maddy nodded and what were to stay here and die she had no answer to that she spread her hands look its very hard to explain but if we can travel home we can change history back to how it should be so this never happens bob stepped forward hed been listening to their hasty exchange information emperor caligulas reign lasts only four years he is assassinated in ad by officers of the praetorian guard and his uncle tiberius claudius caesar is made emperor in his place cato made a face claudius that stuttering cretin couldnt lead a beggar to coins he will be a very successful ruler during his reign britain is successfully conquered and added as a province to the empire so are thrace lycia and judaea he is known for ruling fairly and not now bob she placed a hand over his mouth point is the last seventeen years should have been very different everything thats happened since the visitors arrived its all wrong them arriving here is what made it go wrong it changed history from what it should have been cato studied them both silently for a moment you can make all of this happen yes replied maddy but only if we can get back home cato pinched his nose thoughtfully can you get us out somehow im thinking chapter ad imperial palace rome macro finished threading the loops of leather through the fastenings and tightened up the lorica segmentata round his thick torso it was snug but he nodded with satisfaction that his portly gut could still be contained by the onesizefitsall segmented armour all right lads he barked as he put on a helmet those girls across the garden are probably more frightened of you than you are of them a grim cackle of laughter rippled among the men without their horses theyre just a rabble of rank amateurs so lets not worry about em too much eh the red stain of twilight bathed the gardens with their stone pathways and small bushes young olive trees and the decorative scattering of bodies the evening was strangely quiet and still after the last fifteen minutes of fighting the clash of arms and the roar of raised voices the silence seemed almost complete but macro heard a low murmur of voices from men still outside the imperial compound a low murmur rolling forwards and spreading across the men inside like a wave riding up a shingle beach whats going on out there then he saw movement over between the stone columns of the gateway several men on horseback picking their way through the men filing in all of them roaring support as they suddenly recognized the men on horseback macro cursed as he realized who they were caligula and the praetorians prefect quintus cato he turned round and looked up the steps what are you up to he muttered under his breath the equites on the far side of the gardens roared with glee at the sight of their emperor and praefectus macro watched as they dismounted and disappeared among the mass of men only to appear a few moments later as the front rank of soldiers parted respectfully to let them through caligula walked slowly towards them flanked by two of his stone men quintus had dropped back a dutiful three steps behind a dozen yards away he stopped raised his hands to quieten the equites behind him an obedient hush swiftly settled across the gardens i wonder now what are you lot doing in my home he looked around at the grounds littered with bodies the shafts of javelins poking out of the dirt divots of displaced soil and trampled flowerbeds what an awful mess youve made he sighed on any other day id be quite annoyed but today today has been a very good day soon very soon now something truly wonderful is going to happen i will transform from a man to a god and rome will be showered with riches once more today i defeated the last few men who doubted me two legions of fools commanded by their foolish general wiped out praetorians he took a step closer my good men he said with hands spread i hear you have done your duty well defended my home against those you thought had come to ransack it for that i thank you all and i forgive you macro took a step back from his line of men climbed the halfdozen steps up to the portico entrance he saw cato deep in conversation with the others but im afraid you have been misled tricked continued caligula tricked by officers who were in league with general lepidus conspirators fellow disbelievers traitor macro put two fingers in his mouth and whistled cato looked up caligula paused and an expression of irritation at the rude interruption flashed across his face the three ranks of sweating grimfaced and bloodspattered soldiers on the steps swivelled their heads to look up at macro an entire battlefield frozen in a moment silent and every pair of eyes on him macro shrugged then grinned load of bollocks he roared loudly it sounded like a breeze rustling through the small orchard of baby olive trees but in fact it was a ripple of gasps spreading among the men on both sides youre not going to be a god youre just an idiot that rustling breeze again followed by a silence he could see the os of mouths open aghast in every direction stuff this he spotted an unused javelin on the floor nearby and in one swift movement bent down picked it up and hurled it towards caligula it arced lazily through the air every pair of eyes on the seemingly endless trajectory of the wobbling wooden shaft and glinting iron tip until it dug into the dirt between caligulas planted feet with a dull thud caligula stared wideeyed at the shaft as it wobbled in front of him he reached out for the wooden shaft pulled it free of the ground and then tossed the javelin to one side his face split with a grin as he laughed with delight do you see now no one can kill a god frontos men began to stir and fidget unhappily macro backed up across the entrance portico towards the others nearly tripping over and losing his footing on the legs of one of the dying a full pardon for all you men cried out caligula and a thousand sestertii for the one who brings me that mans head i think wed better run rasped macro cato nodded i think youre right together they turned and headed back into the dimly lit halls of the palace as some of the quickerwitted praetorian guards began to climb the steps in hungry pursuit of their bounty chapter ad imperial palace rome cato led them all back down the palaces main hallway they passed by the secret passageway theyd emerged from five minutes earlier where are we going called out maddy theres a slaves and merchants entrance on the far side of the palace if were lucky that idiot quintus wont have thought to block it off yet hes not exactly the sharpest arrow in the quiver said macro puffing as they jogged which is the main reason caligula appointed him cato added if were quick the section of frontos men i posted there wont yet know theres a bounty on our heads the hallway ended at the grand atrium and as they emerged into it they saw on the far side a dozen soldiers emerging from the hallway opposite not men of frontos century but equites on the emperors orders you there stay where you are echoed a voice cato hissed a curse too late were going back cried rashim back to my cage be quiet grunted macro as they reversed into the flickering lamplit gloom of the main passageway again this isnt good said maddy were going to be trapped my cage trilled rashim going back yes my cage my stone i said be quiet macro snapped raising a threatening fist the stone men said maddy hes right rashim he could reboot them the word didnt translate well for her and macro offered her a puzzled glare put some boots on them what the she tried again reactivate them awaken them cato nodded yes he turned to rashim can you do this make them take your orders oh yes yes i can make magic work cato pointed his sword back the way theyd come then back back there quickly they turned cato grasped rashims painfully thin wrist and dragged him along as he jogged ahead with macro bob bounded after them liam bouncing and groaning on his huge back the girls kept pace either side looking anxiously back over their shoulders at the clatter and jangle of armour and harnesses and the slap of pursuing nailed army sandals on the stone floor here its this one shouted sal suddenly this one she stepped towards the drape pulled it aside to reveal the concealed passageway they stepped in just as some more voices challenged them from further up the main hallway in in in screamed rashim they stepped through the opened oak doors into the darkness inside bob placed liam down on the floor retrieved the locking bar from outside and brought it in then he quickly pushed the heavy doors to he slid the locking bar across both sets of looped handles on the inside the doors were secure for the moment a candle still flickered beside rashims opened cage and by its light they saw the stone men standing where theyd been left calmly watching the commotion going on around them rashim shuffled over to the nearest of them out of breath and struggling to keep on his bow legs and arched feet sal hurried over and held an arm before he collapsed thank you he whispered he turned to the stone man in front of him you are you are in full diagnostic mmode yes affirmative all systems are nominal cato whispered to macro in the dark ive only ever heard their leader talk he said and only on one occasion they sound like devils macro growled suspiciously i i wish to talk to you rashims voice seemed to have settled a lower calmer timbre a less manic delivery what is your current mission status i have no stated mission thats very good and tell me who was your last authorized user temporaryuser gaius julius caesar augustus germanicus also known as caligula your your last registered user is no longer authorized to issue you commands is is that understood the clone nodded you will need to provide me with a system password before i accept that as a command protocol of course of course rashim frowned for a moment long enough that maddy felt her heart sink hes forgotten perhaps not surprising given that his hacking of these support units happened so many years ago ahh yes rashim slapped his head several times i i have it i have it please state your password the stone man calmly repeated the pass the password is patrick starfish the stone mans eyes glinted by candlelight as his head slowly swivelled down to regard rashim your password is correct and accepted i am your user now muttered rashim the clone nodded that is correct and these people are my friends protect them it looked up from rashim at the others a smooth cool sweep of machinelike eyes affirmative rashim giggled pleased with himself transmit your updated status and accepted password to your friend over there it nodded and began blinking rapidly a moment later the other stone man stirred to life and swept the chamber with its gaze rashim turned to look at the others and spread a gummy smile our friends now yes indeed the oak doors suddenly rattled under the impact of something outside the locking bar jumped as a vertical thread of light from outside appeared momentarily between them theyve found us said bob maddy looked at him then the others well thats just fantastic now we really are trapped chapter ad imperial palace rome no shouted rashim he pointed to the ground dropped down to his knees and spread his fingers on the floor caressing the stone almost tenderly below i hear it whisper every night my ocean in my world cato looked at maddy what is that mad fool saying now she shook her head he was talking in english gibberish might as well have been in mongolian rashim rolled his eyes with frustration water you fools dripping water and again in latin for cato and macros benefit of course cato dropped down to his knees running water he looked up a network of sewers beneath the palace somewhere beneath this floor we just need to dig dig macro shrugged with what the oak doors boomed and rattled again more insistently this time they are using a battering ram said bob these doors will not last for long cato pulled his gladius from its sheath and dug the tip of the blade into the hairline seam between the stone tiles with a soft crack the clay cementing the tile gave up its hold and the tile dislodged with a puff of dust and grit come on macro help me macro produced his sword knelt down and did likewise both of them gouging at the floor frantically help them said rashim pointing dig dig us a hole both stone men chorused an affirmative produced their own blades and joined in hacking into the tiles the doors boomed again accompanied by the sound of cracking wood bob braced his back against the doors supporting the locking bar with his own substantial weight we will not have long he cautioned maddy looked at liam how are you doing he grinned not so bad getting used to the sting now thats good she whispered and smiled were getting out of here you know cato dug frantically at the dried clay floor beneath the dislodged tiles his sword gouging out fistsized chunks rustred and crumbly the four of them quickly had a crater three foot across and several uneven inches deep he cursed under his breath how deep do we have to dig water down there hissed rashim beneath our feet yes i hear it every night sal picked up a candle and headed towards the piles of dusty equipment where you going sal called out maddy she pointed at the piles of artefacts on the floor maybe theres something we can use from over there sure uh ok go look the chamber filled again with the sound of a deep boom and the crack of surrendering oak hairline fissures of light stretched up and down each door you must dig faster suggested bob cato peered down at the rustcoloured clay his sword tip was hitting and sparking on stone again another layer by the flickering candle nearby he could see little desperately he scrabbled with his fingers feeling for another seam to wedge the tip of his blade into sal squatted down next to the pile of things her hands pulled at the threads and edges of halfseen things clothes shoes glasses boots a childs toy the dark and cracked touchscreen of a longdead holodata pad but nothing remotely useful come on come on the cavernous chamber boomed again she thrust her hand deeper into the piles of things fumbling patting pulling feeling for something that might help them her index finger caught in something and wrenched painfully as she struggled to twist her finger free it scraped out of something a hole she pulled clothes and boots aside until she found herself staring at a small iron grille in the floor she could hear it coming up through the grille the unmistakable soft trickle of water thats what rashim had heard thats where the noise had been coming from over here she cried over here theres a grille the men looked up from their digging a moments hesitation no more not a clue between them as to what she was saying she wished she had one of those buds shaddyah maddy tell them theres like a sewage grating or something right here maddy did and both romans were out of their shallow crater and beside her moments later once again cato used the tip of his sword and levered the iron grille out of the floor macro helped him grunting as between them they slid it to one side thats it said cato leaning over the small hole and peering down into the darkness the faintest reflection of candlelight glinted back at him the foul smell of rancid effluent was overpowering oh thats it all right said macro curling his lips in disgust the doors boomed again and this time a strip of oak from the lefthand door clattered on to the tiled floor cato picked out the shape of maddy near the doors a comforting arm around liam you you two come here maddy helped liam to his feet and they both came over this sewage aqueduct you have to follow the direction of the flow said cato it leads to the river she nodded ok you should go now he glanced at the doors theyll be through soon enough maddy nodded she turned to sal can you help rashim down right sal lowered herself down through the hole in the floor i cant feel the bottom i think its a drop maddy peered through a gap to the side of her until she caught the flicker of reflected candlelight i dont think its far here goes then sal lowered herself down until her arms were fully extended then let go maddy heard the echo of a viscous muddy splut its ok not far her voice reverberated as if it was at the far end of an underpass ughh but its total chuddah maddy grabbed rashims hand you next another deafening boom and more fragments of splintered wood clattered to the floor thick shafts of light speared into the darkness and she could see the glint of helmets through the fractured doors liam pulled himself painfully up to a seated position liam you ok to im fine mads im ok i can get myself down your friend then you maddy and your stone man said cato but hurry what about you cato glanced at macro macro returned a subtle nod an unspoken understanding between the pair of them we need to cover over the sewage trap and perhaps we can buy you some time she looked from one to the other theyll kill you of course they will cato smiled but then as you said you can make it so this never happened am i correct she nodded yes but then you should go now give us both a better end than this one rashim was down liam eased himself into the hole groaning with pain as his arms worked and his torso flexed boom the cavernous room echoed with bobs deep angry roar as he thrust his sword through the jagged hole in the lefthand door and there was a yelp of agony from outside they heard the echo of a muddy splat and liams voice groaning at the impact bob cried maddy were leaving get here now i must remain by these doors cato stood up and approached the stone men will you two take my orders affirmative they both replied you are to be protected then kill anyone who comes through both clones drew swords from their sheaths and crossed the floor to stand in front of the shuddering flexing oak doors bob nodded at them as he passed by good luck he offered they paused to look at each other briefly both clones bemused by such an oddly human gesture of compassion from another support unit then they took up their positions before the fragmenting remains of the oak doors legs apart a twohanded grip on their swords braced to kill go said maddy slapping bob on the shoulder as he squatted down beside her you first madelaine i will guard the rear cato seemed to understand bobs intent he is right let him be the rearguard she was about to drop down through the hole but hesitated she leaned over and kissed cato on the cheek ill make things right i promise you that then she grasped macros forearm ill make it right go said macro he grinned go on dont worry weve been in tighter spots than this she lowered herself down into the sewer and landed with a splat bob quickly followed her down squeezing barely through the hole in the floor both cato and macro reached for the iron grating and eased it back into place as a final crash against the doors sent them juddering open the clones stepped forward together into the light of flickering torches and braziers and engaged the praetorians stepping across the splinters of wood and twisted iron bracing cato picked up his sword as macro pulled the rotting and dusty artefacts across to cover the manhole is that the truth cato they can change this he bent down and picked up a shield from the floor perhaps macro pursed his lips as he gave that a moments consideration and finally nodded good enough for me thats what ive always liked about you macro whats that you never overthink things macro laughed the two clones were doing a lethal job so far holding the doorway and filling it with a growing pile of squirming bodies i hope our other fate sees us both as old men cato grinned old and rich how does that sound macro flexed his arms sword in one shield in the other i always figured wed go out like this you and me cato smiled at his old friend ever the optimist shall we he shrugged no point standing here gossiping like a pair of old fishwives chapter ad outside rome they emerged into the night no shining light at the end of the tunnel just the darkness of full night the stars and moon lost behind clouds and a pall of smoke from the many fires across the city they took several steps down a delta of silt and sewage into the cool water of the river tiber to wash the muck off rashim shuffled over savoured the cool tickle of water on his skin cupped it in his hands and drank and drank eww i wouldnt drink from here whispered maddy watching him liam you ok asked sal he was holding his side wincing with pain ill hold together i think maddy washed her hands clean and waded over to him she pulled her glasses out from beneath her tunic the arms were bent she fiddled with them for a moment then put them on crookedly lets take a look you wont be able to see a thing in this light replied liam she reached out to his side is it bleeding its ok i think he touched the tight binding macro had fastened round him its dry it burned painfully literally burned but it seemed his exertions hadnt opened the wound macro did a good job said liam he looked up at her an expression on his face that told her what she already knew hed grown rather fond of the exsoldier maddy nodded me too between gasps back in the tunnel shed explained that the pair of them had decided to stay behind and cover their escape we owe them she said sombrely she looked around at the city dotted with the flickering light of fires well fix this for them i promised them that aye then well make sure we do it no time for this said rashim no time we must leave rome now aye skippa yes indeed sal nodded id really like to leave now maddy looked up and down the river to their right a bridge running across stone arched supports to their left further along a ricketylooking bridge made from wood which bridge neither said rashim we follow see he pointed along the bank of silt to their left takes us round the bottom of the city then we go he frowned as he thought tapped his temple with his knuckles as if to shake loose a memory are you sure you know where this portals opening yes yes we go northeast from rome for some hours can you be more precise than that rashim tapped away at his scabby temple in here all in my head let me let me get it out information bob lifted his head if we are within several miles of the correct location i may be able to detect tachyon particles as it opens yes said maddy but if it opens for just a couple of minutes and were a mile or two away well miss it she turned to rashim we need the precise location we need to be in exactly the right place so long ago rashim muttered he closed his eyes i i remember coming along a road into the east of rome bobs eyelids flickered accessing his database the via praenestina yes long road a big archway a a market go back remember it backwards said maddy before entering rome can we go now said sal looking back at the sewage outlet theyd emerged from can he remember and walk at the same time maddy followed sals gaze if caligulas soldiers had figured out theyd escaped through the sewage outlet it surely wasnt going to be long before they saw the faint flicker of torches emerging shes right lets get going chapter ad outside rome dawn saw them on a dusty track flanked by rolling fields of parched soil and withered wheat stalks on one side and an orchard of fig trees on the other rashims weak bow legs had long ago failed him and now he was fast asleep on bobs broad shoulders sal walked beside him in thoughtful silence occasionally sharing a word or two with bob but mostly lost in her own thoughts liam walked beside maddy still holding his side protectively there was a slight limp to his walk as he favoured his right leg with a longer stride youre made of tougher stuff than ive given you credit for said maddy ahh i may not be whinging like a little girlygirl but that doesnt mean to say it isnt hurting me like theres a pitchfork stuck in me sides liam she looked at him you took a sword in the gut he shrugged at that i took a glancing blow looked a lot worse than it was ill wager she wondered in the heat of the moment of that fight shed actually thought that it was all over for liam that he was going to hit the floor dying liam was right a glancing blow if it had skewered him like she at first thought it had that surely would have meant a ruptured spleen or stomach or kidney or liver leaking all manner of toxic acids into his blood a painful agonizing way to go certain death for sure youre incredible liam she said hugging his narrow shoulders gently incredible yes he winced but not a bleedin stone man sorry he shrugged maddy yes when we return he said were going to be walking into trouble are we not i dont know i dont even know if we can get back to our field office it might not even be functioning any more sal overheard them what if we went back to whenever these exodus people came from i dont even know when that is itll be after surely said liam well obviously the exodus project occurs after said bob how do you know the stone men were running ai software that is a later generation than mine liam turned to maddy is that when our agency came from thats a safeish guess i suppose what about it asked sal what if we go into the future why sal you know better than me and liam what its like its grim liam nodded that man who came through to robin hood times he tried to remember his name locke i think it was i remember he said something about hearing rumours of our agency in the s so he said it was bad then really bad liam met her gaze sort of endoftheworld kind of bad the end words that were all too familiar to maddy maddy stopped walking guys that message in the voynich manuscript you know becks has it in her head all decoded and everything liam and sal stopped walking and turned round what about it said sal you know i said becks couldnt tell me what it was they both nodded well actually becks told me she could only tell me what the message was when certain conditions arose what certain conditions asked sal she said when its the end the end liam laughed scornfully great whats that supposed to mean i dunno maddy shrugged but i get the feeling were all headed for something pretty nasty we everyone im talking like mankind liam made a face well thats cheered me up no end so it has see i think something awful happens one day something that wipes us all out thats what i think pandora is its a warning about that that poor man said sal the other two knew who she meant that unfortunate soul whod arrived out of nowhere back in new orleans an arrival that had been catastrophic that had inadvertently caused the death of a young man called abraham lincoln hed arrived presumably without properly probing and checking his destination hed arrived in a hurry presumably leaving his own time in a hurry arrived and instantly fused with the bodies of a pair of horses that man was the one who was warning us about pandora said sal joseph liam looked at her thats what he said his name was didnt he yeah he was the one that left you that note maddy yes she sighed yup i know she shook her head but what do we do huh so weve got a warning from some guy from the future that something awful happens to mankind what the hell was he trying to tell us change history so it whatever it is doesnt happen sal nodded slowly i think so but weve also got a duty to make sure history doesnt change said liam thats what foster told us remember for good or bad history has to go a certain way my point exactly said maddy i just dont know what were supposed to do any more liam and now weve got whole freakin platoons of support units being sent back to kill us so obviously were making somebody angry doing something wrong or something right volunteered sal maddy rolled her eyes see welcome to my world the world of nothavingafreakincluewhatsgoingon they stood silent in the middle of the road the rising sun making hard shadows that stretched long and slender across the cobbles ill tell you what i think said liam after a while i trust foster he said we should keep history as it is for good or bad it has to go a certain way well if that means that one day theres an end liam pressed his lips together a conciliatory smile then well i suppose it is what it is were just following orders said maddy aye you know who said the very same thing maddy didnt wait for him to pull out an answer he wasnt going to know nazis thats who concentration camp guards so what are you saying we do maddy she turned to sal im saying i dont know i just dont feel like trusting anyone right now liam nodded at that lets just get home then lets get home if we can and then well figure it out from there chapter ad outside rome rashim had mentioned that the exodus group had travelled most of the onehour journey on a broad brick road winding the memory backwards he said that it eventually became a broad dusty track two lanes busy with cart and foot traffic the old man had said it had taken them an hour but they had travelled quite slowly because their multiterrain vehicles were heavily laden people crammed in below equipment stacked all over slow then not much faster than a person could jog his words hardly precise but he did mention a range of hills nothing too spectacular hills that would be on their right coming out of rome and one hill beyond a gently rolling valley with a notably flat top as it approached midday maddy scanned the horizon there were hills ahead of them as hed said and beyond their smooth outline on the far horizon the more distinctly sharpedged silhouette of a range of mountains rashim she called out he twitched slightly on bobs back give him a prod sal she obliged he lurched opened his eyes then howled at the bright daylight his eyes instantly clamped shut what is this where am its ok its ok sal reached up to calm him we escaped remember the old man winced and covered his face with his hands at the glare of daylight or perhaps it was some sort of agoraphobia a mortal terror of the infinite openness all around him maddy wondered how much of her sanity would be left if shed spent seventeen years cooped up inside a large packing crate rashim over there those hills are they the right ones bob eased him down to the ground and he shaded his almost completely shut eyes against the painful brilliance of the morning sun i think yes or maybe im not sure come on we need to be sure his face looked pained as he studied the rolling line of hills to the right of the dirt road then his eyes widened as he spotted the flattopped hill that one there you see it yes maddy followed the direction of his clawnailed finger the hills followed each other in almost symmetrical humps some topped with villas spilling hairthin threads of smoke into the morning sky but the one with the flat top was distinctive as if a cheeseslice had scooped its crown off you sure yes yyes his eyes narrowed his mouth widened with a manic grin needed a flat place big open flat yes an open place to mark out yes me and spongebubba spongebubba rashim ignored her thats it thats it thats the place his eyes were wet with tears i never thought i i and how long have we got he said three days last night said bob which would mean we have two days now maddy wiped sweat from her eyes and squinted through scratched glasses at the distant hill it wasnt that much of a hike for them an hour at most then once they were certain they had the precise location they desperately needed to find something to drink even spoiled water would do anything shed worry about disease some other time when they got back home are you sure caligula doesnt know where to come asked sal maddy bit her lip does he know rashim does he know where your people arrived rashim smiled stories and stories mr muzzy and me rashim does he know he cocked his head we kept secrets we told stories we id take that as a no said sal maddy reached out and grabbed rashims thin arm but he knows its sometime soon doesnt he rashim nodded and by now hell know youre missing maddy frowned hell be looking for you wont he does he know the exodus people travelled in from the northeast rashim closed his eyes the day the visitors came in chariots of gold his singsong reverie wandered off into gibberish again there is only one main road into rome from that direction said bob it is this one then lets get off of it maddy scanned the road in both directions it was deserted except for a pale speck kicking up dust a mile away a solitary cart or trader hopefully or perhaps a praetorian scout one of many sent in every direction along every road out of rome looking for them she didnt want to waste another moment finding out come on she said pointing towards the flattopped hill she could see there were trees around the base of it even though it was a bald hill on top they could hide somewhere in there for a day or two wait it out until rashims advance party were supposed to arrive lets go chapter ad outside rome dry wood thats the secret said liam if its totally dried out like charcoal you dont get any smoke at all maddy gazed at the fire it was barely visible in the daylight a few wisps of smoke from the cones and branches theyd thrown on turning grey as transparent flames consumed them and the air above danced with the heat there was of course the pleasant always welcoming smell of a fire it would carry but no one was going to see where it was coming from certainly not from that road theyd left earlier she raised a hand to her eyes and peered through the gently wafting evergreen branches of cypress trees at the road two or three miles away the weather was so dry this summer anybody using it would kick up a plume of dust she could see nothing sizzling on a wooden spit were several wild hares bob had caught for them skinned from neck to lean shanks and naked except for furry heads and furry booties normally shed be queasy at eating an animal she could recognize but her mouth was salivating at the smell of them cooking the savoury tang of crisping meat rashim sat hunched over beside the fire drooling at the glistening meat chuckling at the sound of fat spitting into the fire maddy glanced out once again through the branches of the hillside wood at the distant road i think were safe now theyd seen a party of cavalry thundering along an hour ago leaving dust trails behind them from this distance they could have been anyone but theyd seemed to have a purposeful disciplined look about them rashim had laughed gleefully as theyd passed by laughing that caligula was going to miss his precious rendezvous with heaven theyd seen no one else since then though she looked at him curled over beside the fire she studied the pitiful skeleton of a man malnutrition and complete darkness for so many years she wondered how a human body could cope with that downhill through the trees she could hear the faint splash of water bob and sal were rinsing their tunics in a small brook clean water drinkable water not like the rancid tiber theyd bring some back when they were done maddy wandered over to where liam sat perched on a boulder that afforded him a view down the side of the hill i guess we ought to get some air to your wound she nodded at the bandage tied firmly round his waist there were a few spots of dark dried blood that had soaked through the wound must have opened while they were fleeing the palace wading through sewage actually as soon as they got back home they were probably going to have to pump liam so full of antibiotics he was going to rattle like a pill bottle liam shrugged all right just be gentle with me now mads oh tsktsk dont be such a baby she worked the bandage loose ill be careful he winced as she unravelled the material sorry hurts naw not exactly a little tender just he looked anxiously at her just worried this is the only thing holding me together he laughed edgily not entirely joking oh i think youll mend she smiled there was something about liam that felt indestructible maybe it was that stupid lopsided grin of his maybe god really did exist and spent his full shift every day looking after devilmaycare idiots like him ouch go easy sorry even though she could see traces of ageing in his face the silver flecks in his hair that plume of grey hair at his temple somehow she couldnt quite imagine him as foster yet as that poor frail dying old man or perhaps maybe she just didnt want to he should know here we go she said the last layer was still damp blood that was not quite dry she eased the material away from his skin stuck to it as if by glue more slowly please he whimpered nervously sorry sorry sorry she grimaced as his pale skin tugged at her soft pull she eased the last of it away and realized as she looked at the puckered line of his wound there was never going to be the perfect time to tell him just a time too many secrets had already got in the way of them as a team as friends this was the last of them she looked across at rashim muttering like gollum as he sat on his haunches and studied the glistening meat liam aye how is it liam youre dying what its just a cut no liam listen time travel its actually killing you he frowned what the devil are you going on about now foster told me going back in time it ages you it accelerates the ageing process that silenced him she pointed at his temple liam come on you must have noticed of course i have im not blind he took the bandage out of her hands and began winding it back round himself im not stupid either liam i its killing me he sighed i know that you know he paused then nodded i suspected as much he busied himself winding the bandage again when we came back from the cretaceous time edward chan that girl laura i think i guessed it then that time travel made them sick maddy nodded they both took a lethal hit its a bit like radiation poisoning theres no recovery it does its damage and theres no way back from it that doesnt sound so good no not good she heard something in her voice she didnt need right now here let me help you she took the bandage back off him and finished the job with a knot im so sorry liam im so very sorry i shouldve told you as soon as i knew she expected anger instead she got a smile out of him a heartbreaking one the wistful moisteyed sort that old war veterans give on patriots day liam i got some extra time maddy thats a bleedin gift so it is oh god liam why cant you just be angry with me that would have been easier to cope with and ive already seen so many incredible things with that time he grinned im up on the deal whats to be all down about there eh theres something else what liam youre foster uh you are foster he laughed im not as cantankerous as that old no liam im saying you are foster youre the same person for the second time in as many minutes shed managed to shut him up i dont know how that is i dont know how it works that you two are the same person its just what foster told me she was struggling to explain it maybe its something to do with the loop we live in maybe weve all been here before and we dont remember it maybe history and us were on some big wheel that just goes round and round i dont know all i know is what foster told me right liams eyes were on rashims sunken tortured body folds of skin drooping from bones that seemed to almost poke through in places right there are no more secrets now liam thats it you know everything i know he looked down at the hands in his lap old man hands he whispered thats what me mam always said i had all knobbly knuckles liam she rested a hand lightly on his arm liam i dont know exactly what it means that you and foster are the same but its something important important to all three of us we have to think it through we need to talk it through when we get back well do that the three of us well she could hear branches cracking bob and sals voices they were returning from the brook he nodded ok just then they emerged from beneath the shade of a tree with a cracked clay jug in bobs arms we found this said sal so bobs humped some water up for you about time croaked liam he even managed that stupid goofy grin for the pair of them we should eat said maddy rashim nodded yes eat eat aye im bleedin starvin we was just about to start on them coneys without you so we were he looked at maddy right she could have wrapped her arms round him then and there squeezed him blue just for liam being liam yeah chapter ad outside rome are you absolutely positive it was today rashim nodded although not as vigorously or as confidently as sal would have liked today yes of course of course of course it is i remember he muttered irritably they sat in a line in the shade of a row of bushes looking out across the flat top of the hill wild parched grass and heather swayed gently in the light breeze theyd been sitting here in the shade as the day had warmed up gradually sweltering cooking in their own sweat as the morning passed interminably slowly and the sun beat down on the arid countryside sal sighed she wasnt so sure this mad old fool was going to be their ticket home he was too skittish too unhinged too completely weird and schizo to seem reliable she looked at his lean face all ridges and old scars his wiry grey hair in tangled tufts bald patches here and there like an attack of alopecia worst of all his mouth rotten gums and brown stumps of dead teeth his breath was almost unbearable like decaying meat she wondered how old he was seventy eighty it was almost impossible to guess but then as maddy had eloquently pointed out last night seventeen years spent in a wooden box was going to mess anyone up pretty good midday midday oh yes yes it was about midday rashim muttered to himself but then again hed said last night theyd arrived first thing in the morning which was why theyd been sitting here like a row of gullible morons since daybreak maddy uhhuh if we do manage to get back to the archway what if those bobs who were after us are still there you know waiting for us well just have to be ready to fight them maddy closed her eyes there were two of them left werent there a male and a female i think so bob can handle the male the rest of us she glanced at liam im sure between us we can handle the female one she shrugged thats if we can even get back it may be possible that the tachyon beacons can be adapted to return a signal to our field office said bob if they turn up and frankly sal was pretty sure today was going to pass by without incident the four of them listening to this old loon muttering tomorrow will be the day of course it is i remember now and the next day and the next i dont want to be stuck here she said i know sighed maddy none of us do it is coming soon said rashim i promise yes his rheumy old eyes took in the wild meadow this is the place for certain yes a long slender finger pointed out at the swaying grass right there me thats the spot i arrive sal nodded less than convinced she wanted to say yeah but what if youre a whole year out huh what then mr genius but she didnt it wasnt going to help any the mood was already pretty sombre out here the other two particularly liam seemed unusually quiet and distracted normally they could count on him to fuel them all with a generous helping of unrealistic optimism and if not that to say something pretty stupid and make them laugh maybe ill go and get us some more water she said no one answered liam you thirsty he seemed to be a million miles away maddy she stirred as if shed been poked uh water you want some uh er yeah ok yes that would be good she looked across and smiled be careful kay remember to keep out of sight those scouts are out there theyd seen a few more yesterday in pairs careering along distant tracks and roads almost certainly looking for them sal picked their cracked jug up got to her feet and turned to head down the slope through the trees to the babbling brook at the bottom of the hill she decided she might just sit with her feet in the cool water for a while and there were several fig trees down there she could pick a few and bring them back for lunch that might cheer this miserable lot up be back in a bit she said not that anyone seemed to hear her sal ducked beneath the low branches picking her way slowly downhill past the humps of tree roots that surfaced from the hard clay soil like the backs of writhing sea serpents wait saleena a deep voice she turned to see bob crouching under the low thorny branches to join her maddy sent me to watch you he said as he ducked past her and pushed his way through undergrowth and low pine needle branches oh so im not the invisible girl today then bob looked back at her puzzled no i see you quite clearly she joined him bob can i ask you something of course im scared of those things those other support units why she stepped over a gnarled root why were they trying to kill us i have no information on their mission saleena you saw one of them though right they looked exactly like you did they come from the same place as you are they like brothers and sisters or something he stepped ahead and pushed the branches of a thick bush aside for her she could see the glint of the stream below a thread of silver curling its way through weatherworn boulders of flint and sandstone the unit i saw appeared to be almost identical most likely from the same foetus batch i registered his ai ident only briefly his software was only one iteration newer than mine inception date hold on she runstepped the last few yards down a steep bank and stopped herself against one of the boulders blistering hot to the touch hold on she said again you make it sound like the same people the same company made you bob scuttled down keeping an ungainly balance correct the unit i encountered was also manufactured by wg systems who are they wg systems they like a weapons manufacturer or something bob settled down on the hot stones beside the stream i will fill your jug if you like she handed it to him thanks they are one of the largest profitable organizations at the time of my inception i have only commonsource market information on them well thatll do the company was founded in by roald waldstein the same year you mean the time travel inventor correct he filed a number of technology patents in the same year in the space of less than six years he becomes the third richest man in the world and hes the one that set us timeriders up right bob shrugged that is not information i have i have however heard maddy make that speculation is she right do you think this is possible waldstein campaigns against time travel waldstein also has access to the resources and technology to have set up this agency but youre saying its also waldsteins clones that were trying to kill us affirmative she settled down beside him letting her feet drift in the cool water so she frowned does that mean he wants us dead now why if he went to all the trouble of recruiting me maddy and liam huh i do not have that information it is possible they were units that were acquired and programmed by some other organization that made more sense to her i thought we were top secret though that no one else knows about us it is possible saleena that you are no longer a secret agency remember liam mentioned that man locke the templar knight correct if he is to be believed there are people who are aware of the existence of this agency whether they actually know for cert she looked up at him momentarily frozen bob are you getting a particles yes he returned her gaze it appears that rashim was correct today is the day chapter ad outside rome maddy and liam watched the young man in silent dismay long dark hair pulled back into a ponytail sunglasses a checked shirt and jeans she turned round to see rashim staring out wideeyed and trembling my god thats you he nodded his fingers absently probing the sunken contours of his old face but hes so young whispered liam yeah said maddy he he looks like twentysomething twentyseven said rashim wistfully twentyseven it didnt make sense to maddy rashim said the exodus group had overshot by seventeen years that hed been stuck here for just seventeen years that made him just fortyfour she turned and studied his feeble frame again not old age that wasnt why he looked like this but abuse malnutrition borderline starvation and the sheer terror of being caligulas caged pet whats that yellow thing whispered liam she saw something about a yard high boxlike waddling through the tall grass behind the young man as he paced across the field several metal rods under his arm it looks like she giggled a little manically no surely what am ilosing my freakin mind is that whats happening maddy you all right there liam it looks like she shook her head it looks exactly like a stupid cartoon character i used to watch on cable the old mans face split with a nostalgic gummy smile spongebubba he crooned softly my little spongebubba they watched as the young rashim stopped pacing across the field pulled one of the iron rods out from under his arm and rammed it into the hardbaked earth he squatted down beside it as the spongeboblike robot joined him she saw him talking to it listening as its goofy plastic mouth flexed an answer and then fiddling with something on the rod a touchscreen or a keypad the top of the rod began to blink green like a navigation light from behind she heard the careful placing of approaching feet she turned to see bob and sal quietly creeping forward under the low branches of the bush to join them whos that hissed sal him liam nodded at the quivering older rashim and spongebob squarepants added maddy not quite believing she was saying that so what do we do maddy asked liam i guess one of us has to go out there and talk to him lets try not to totally freak him out though we dont want him to run away she looked at the others rashim looked like a wild completely insane hermit bob thoroughly intimidating still spattered with dots of dried blood and liam and sal were looking at her expectantly i guess its me then rashim squatted down in front of the second translation array marker and wiped the sweat from his forehead with the cuff of his shirt he was torn between getting this job done quickly getting the hell back home to the twentyfirst century and taking the time to breathe in this clean air to savour that rich blue sky untainted by pollutants to take a moment and really drink in the sensation of actually existing in history actually standing on a hilltop in italy a mere fiftyfour years after the birth of christ he was entirely alone out here his decision the less mass to transmit the higher the safety margin it was just him and his lab unit a fiveminute errand into ancient history to deploy and test the translation array markers thats all he kept looking anxiously over his shoulder for some reason half expecting an entire roman legion to descend on him at any moment with horns blaring silly really he noted the cliches one associates with wellbranded history give me the reference sequence again will you i need to check it offsets correctly righto skippa spongebubba said enthusiastically the sequence is are you ready rashim im ready fire away nine zero seven two two three rashim tapped those into the rods touchscreen go on two nine seven a pause he looked at his lab unit yeah im waiting go on uhhh rashim yes theres a person coming towards us uh rashim stood up and saw a young woman in a burgundycoloured tunic and with a mane of frizzy strawberryblonde hair striding through the grass towards them he cursed under his breath theyd checked this hilltop hundreds of times over for passing density shifts apart from signals that might be the occasional bird or a passing goat no one came here ever until now apparently dammit hed learned a smattering of latin a requirement for all the exodus candidates he quickly removed his sunglasses before she got too close wincing at the brightness of the day the clothes and his brightyellow lab unit he couldnt do anything about as she drew up in front of him he offered the young woman his most charming smile uh salve he was pretty sure hed just mangled up the pronunciation right there and then rather belatedly he realized she was wearing glasses hey she replied with a casual wave hows it going dr rashim anwar rashims jaw swung open and hung there uselessly she offered him a hand yup i speak english and yup i know precisely who you are my names maddy by the way pleased to meet you how how who i know youve got a lot of questions she smiled dont worry i know exactly what thats like he stared at her outstretched hand i know all about project exodus dr anwar so look ill cut to the chase i work for some people were well you wont have heard of us but our job is preventing foolish things like this from happening rashims mouth finally closed you youre from thatagency arent you she frowned that agency the freelancers rumours jesus ive heard rumours not sure i ever believed them but rumours yeah about the agency the agency they say that billionaire nutcase waldsteins involved in some way is is it for real maddy shrugged i cant say exactly who i my god it is isnt it rashim didnt know whether to be begging for an autograph from her or running for his very life international law on time travel was unforgiving and very final jesus i thought it was just us you know just us with a viable timetranslation system he laughed nervously but how the hell i mean weve had trillions of defence budget dollars trillions thrown at this and weve only just managed to get the system reliable enough to risk human translations she lowered her hand look we really need to talk with you project exodus is going to fail badly dr anwar ive seen the results for myself what you youve preempted us youve arrived here before now she nodded youre going to miss this timestamp by a mile its going to go badly wrong and youre all going to die this project has to stop right here she offered her hand again dr anwar rashim im not here to arrest you or hurt you or threaten you im just here to stop this nightmare happening can we talk chapter ad outside rome dr rashim anwar looked at the old man stickthin arms wrapped round knees that bulged like arthritic knucklebones they were sitting together in the shade of the trees he sipped icecold proteinplus solution from his cellpowered thermos flask offered it to the young indian girl beside him he he said pointing at the old man hes me maddy nodded the exodus groups translation overshoots those beacons you were putting out but it shouldnt they should anchor the particle signal they should mass the old rashim hissed mass we miscalculate you and me we get it wrong yes the young man shook his head vehemently his ponytail swinging like a pennant no ive calculated and recalculated the figures run simulation after simulation on the total mass were planning to send it changes changes the translation day is hurried fforward candidates changed lastminute panic its a mess the old man muttered more but it was lost in his gurgling throat why the old man was muttering a onesided conversation with himself the young scientist leaned forward and grabbed a stickthin wrist tell me why is exodus hurried forward what happened the old mans black and brown pegtooth smile looked revolting the end young me maddy looked at him did you say the end he cackled a sad dry laugh we finally do it wipe ourselves out what kill the planet with drips of poison then finally kill ourselves tidy finish hmm what is it bombs said maddy is that the end is that what happens a nuclear war rashim rocked gently on his haunches distracted as he spoke oh no bombs some of us could survive but this no nonono no one survives this what is it the old rashim grinned elley elley elley whos elley asked sal he means an ele an extinction level event replied rashim like the kt event wiped out the dinosaurs an asteroid the young man shrugged i wouldnt be surprised the way things are its not an asteroid said the old rashim he giggled it is god punishing us with a pestilence yes you mean a virus the old man cocked his head a pestilence maddy sipped from the flask and passed it back to the young rashim you need to know that your project exodus will cause a time wave that will completely rewrite history you should know theres no new york theres no america in thanks to you its all jungle said sal nothing christ time contamination is exactly what we want to achieve the futures a dead end for us dont you see theres no way forward for mankind only backwards the goal of exodus is to export the executive branch of the united states back to roman times weve got weapons weve got medicines technology databases experts in absolutely every field soldiers well whatever you intended exodus to be it ends up a disaster she nodded at the old man beside her once again lapsed into distracted muttering to himself that wreck of a human over there is the sole survivor of project exodus thats you dr anwar that how you want to end up then ill go back and suggest we reduce the translation mass we can take less and thatll reduce the potential error margin youre not going back said maddy what i cant let you go your people have to think your deployment technique failed that your translation method is too unreliable to continue any further with rashim swallowed nervously please i have to get back sorry she replied this is the way it goes she looked across at bob and liam inspecting the display screen of one of the beacon rods and the lab unit looking anxious as if they intended to use the thing as a cricket bat were using your beacons to try and get back to our time to and im afraid youre going to have to come with us bob finished tapping in the data on the small touchscreen and a light flickered green from the top of the rod this should now be sending a threadsignal of particles that can be detected by our transmission array you shouldnt be interfering with that complained the lab unit its not yours spongebubba stuck out a petulant lip very naughty do you think it will work asked liam bob shrugged if the equipment in the archway is still functioning and undamaged and there is enough power remaining to deploy a time window then there is no reason this should not work my skippa will be very angry with you chimed the lab unit liam gave bob a tired smile what would we do without you bob missed the affectionate rhetoric grow another unit chapter ad outside rome i i am not going in there i am not going with you maddy looked at the old man shed expected theyd have to get bob to wrestle the young rashim through the portal but not the old one what why he shook his head want want to die right here he nodded slowly here this place this hilltop open space he closed his eyes sniffed the air as the gentle breeze made the long grass before them and the leaves above them whisper together shaddyah you dont have to die said sal we can get you some help back home decent food get you looked at by some doctors or something youre going to be just fine already dead he rasped he looked at his younger self dont become this he said touching his own cheek with a claw of a finger he smiled and closed his eyes i found you these people must stop you stop us none of you understand do you said young rashim the worlds pretty much finished in my time weve poisoned everything the worlds a garbage pit whats left that isnt flooded is is landfill theres no hope for us any more whatever mess we made of earth we cant toy around with time like this said maddy were all going back and leaving this history as its meant to be no the old rashims eyes opened god hes in there he nodded towards the strobing beacon that bob was holding in his fist in that place is chaos young rashim shook his head with mild disgust at the rambling old man theres no way that crazy old fools me if i he finds me me and mr muzzy he gabbled if he finds us in there well be sent straight to hell for what we did straight to hell straight to hell why dont we let him stay said liam maddy turned round what let him stay liam looked at the old man with pity look at him the poor mans completely terrified we cant just leave him here hell starve or he wont survive maddy he wont make it through look at him maddy did and she could see liam was probably right it looked like a strong gust of wind would kill him let alone being bombarded with cellrupturing tachyons all right then she squatted down beside the old man and put a hand on his arm his wild rambling stopped is this what you want rashim he turned to look at her with milky madness in his wet eyes she wondered if he was even seeing her rashim can you hear me do you want to stay here yes youll be on your own we all have to go he nodded smiled have mr muzzy with me maddy shook her head it felt wrong leaving him out here his mind was mush she wasnt even sure he knew where he was even who he was any more then there seemed to be some purpose in his eyes he smiled you go i want this what what is it you want he spread his arms this let me have this she looked around at the flat hilltop the soft hiss through the dry grass the unbroken blue sky above a horizon of distant lavendertipped mountain peaks and peace peace and almost infinite space maddy got it she totally got it all right she whispered softly to him all right she smiled squeezed his arm gently savour it rashim savour every moment of it he looked at her with a glimmer of sanity thank you she stood up and beckoned the others away leaving the old man sitting hunched in the middle of the tall grass his head cocked listening to the gentle whisper of the wind fill up that jug for him lets at least leave him some water hes not coming asked sal nope chapter project exodus cheyenne mountain colorado springs still nothing the technician shook his head solemnly dr yatsushita watched the proxy density display on the main holoscreen it was flatlining the density equivalent of white noise just an interdimensional soup he took his glasses off and rubbed weary eyes it was returntime plus over three hours even at one minute past due the implication had been pretty clear just as there was no such thing as being slightly pregnant there was no such thing as being nearly successful with time translation we lost them dr anwar and that ridiculous customized lab unit of his he sat back down in his chair the other technicians in their monitorhigh cubicles sat up to get a look at the project leader wondering how to read his body language their heads bobbed above partitions like a coterie of meerkats yatsushita balled his fists hed just lost the brightest mind on his team and in a limited field like this where do you go to recruit a replacement dr yatsushita he looked up one of the beacon deployment team was standing over him we uh we picked up a faint signal one of the beacons squawked a signal for about a minute but thats all we got nothing now he shook his head its like it just got switched off or it malfunctioned the man shrugged that was probably a more likely answer the translation of dr anwar and his armful of beacon markers and that stupid yellow robot probably ended up with them being fused into a layer of rock in the middle of some mountain range or simply lost in that horrific subatomic broth that reduced the calculations of the worlds best particle physicists to little more than eenymeenymineymo guesses their system was still far too unreliable for human transmission it appeared that dr anwar had been too confident with his own calculations yes their system could send an apple fifty minutes fifty hours fifty days even fifty years into the past but once every two or three times they lost it that or they brought back apple puree all right shut it all down he sighed they were burning gigawatts of power that couldnt be wasted endlessly not in this resourcepoor time anyway shut it down he snapped louder the deployment team technician nodded and turned away quickly a few moments later the deafening hum of power surging through the giant faraday cage running across the roof of the hangar died away leaving a hollow echo behind losing rashim was going to set them back months maybe even years if they couldnt even reliably send a single human test subject there and back without losing him they certainly werent even close to ready for the proposed party of three hundred lets get the diagnostics running he called out overall the system had been powered up for a total of three hours and twentynine minutes when dr anwar had stepped confidently into one of the translation grids and disappeared they had countless terabytes of diagnostic data to sift through hopefully somewhere in there they might locate a single solitary variable that was miscalculated but he doubted it time travel seemed horrifically frighteningly random more like magic than science chapter new york the archway was empty a single webcam iris on top of a computer monitor in the middle of a messy desk studied the still darkness there was no sign of movement no sign of anyone none of the team and none of the unauthorized intruders they were dealt with for now computerbob was on his own and was going to have to wait through the iris of the webcam computerbob noted that the shutter door was smashed open bent slats of corrugated aluminium hanging from one side down to the ground on the other and outside pale daylight filtered green by a canopy of foliage seeped into this gloomy brickwork cave computerbob calculated the generator could keep the one running pc going for another seventyseven hours a lot more if he shut down the growth tubes in the back room effectively killing becks and the other foetuses held in suspended animation but he couldnt do that or didnt want to not yet at least no external feeds of data to examine and explore just this still archway just this one view across a messy desk a halfempty can of dr pepper sweet wrappers if the monitor hadnt been in sleep mode one would have seen a cursor dance across a dialogue box information maddy is messy like he didnt already know that his idling ai moved on to consider more important matters who were those intruders who sent them information the intruders had wg systems idents and ai software information the intruders had mission logs authorized by user rg waldstein two things occurred just then at almost the same moment in time firstly computerbob picked up a clear and distinct tachyon signal the timestamp location was precise and the message was perfectly straightforward for once open a portal at this timestamp immediately computerbob at once began directing power to the displacement machine it would require approximately two minutes of recharging enough to flip one of the leds on the display back from amber to green enough of a safety margin to ensure a stable portal force field the second thing was the arrival of a fresh breeze stirring the woodland outside teasing the branches of a cedar tree directly beyond the entrance right in the middle of what was normally a rubbishstrewn alleyway the hum of the displacement machine competed with the hiss of whispering leaves shifting excitedly as the breeze picked up and became a somewhat blustering gust of wind computerbob recognized the wind for what it was a bank of air pushed by the sudden shifting of reality the emergence of possibilities wrestling with each other deep within an enormous wall of approaching change the gust stirred rubbish inside the archway paper cups and burger wrappers chasing each other in a game of tag on the breakfast table the curtain that hung beside the bunk beds from an improvised rail fidgeted impatiently like a bored child swinging from a parents hand the hum meanwhile rose in pitch as it sucked in power from the generator the hum was like a cockerel announcing dawn desperately wanting to tell the empty archway that it was nearly good to go once again the cursor blinked across its black dialogue box ready to transmit displacement field activating fieldoffice bubble computerbob didnt have emotions not really he had files they were useful back when he used to live inside a wg systems waferprocessor inside an engineered human body when those files could be used to stimulate muscle movements a smile for example he missed that missed the ability to use those files in a meaningful way oh but actually he decided he could it wasnt quite the same thing but it was good enough the tachyon signal appeared to be good news it seemed that his team or at least some of them were alive still cause for some sort of a celebration the cursor scuttled along albeit briefly to form three ascii characters chapter new york air was displaced inside the archway as it gusted noisily in from the outside a sphere of pulsating energy blinked into existence and lit the gloomy archway with a bright italian sky and a parched rustcoloured field of baked earth and dry grass dark silhouettes clouded the dancing image then a moment later one of them the biggest by far stepped into the archway bob crouched legs apart sword drawn and ready to swing it his eyes swept quickly round the dim archway into the dark corners he ducked down to look under the bunk beds he crossed the floor and pulled aside the sliding door into the back room the chugging of the diesel generator spilled out as he checked inside he returned to the main archway as the wind outside began to become a hurricanelike roar standing beside the shimmering orb of mediterranean blue he beckoned the other dark shapes to join him the archway is clear he roared above the deafening whistling of wind outside and the thrashing branches of the woodland they came through one after the other liam sal dr rashim anwar and his lab unit and finally maddy she emerged into the archway swearing as she almost tripped over spongebubba goddammit out of my way sorr eee spongebubba cried out in his singsong voice and waddled a few steps back from her close the portal she shouted above the scream of wind from outside the portal collapsed behind her whats going on here shouted rashim above the roar of wind outside is this a storm time wave she shouted back a what a time wave liam hurried across to close the shutter and stopped dead in his tracks as he realized the door was ruined what happened to our door his words were lost in the roaring wind it went completely dark outside the tree trunk right there a yard beyond where their concrete floor became dirt and flora liquidized spun into strands of insubstantial matter like a wispy tendril of sugar in a candyfloss tumbler amid the pitchblack it became a swirling maelstrom of fleetingly seen things another different tree a rock formation a tipi a wooden shack an easter island monolith and then all of a sudden it was a brick wall covered in graffiti and lined with rubbish along the bottom the roaring receded quickly fading into something else entirely a commuter train rumbling over the williamsburg bridges old tracks above their heads the sound of impatient traffic bumper to bumper coming from the intersection at the end of their alleyway the distant whoop of police sirens the soft chop of a helicopter swooping across the east river somebody somewhere nearby had a thumping sound system in the back of their car noisy but so much less noisy than it had been a moment ago were back cried sal running towards the opening and the alleyway outside were back we made it liam nodded subdued were back he replied maddy crossed the floor and joined both of them standing in the ruined doorway she stared out at the brick wall the rubbish piled against it she listened to the noises of brooklyn the irritable impatient noises of blissful ignorance millions of normal lives being led all of them content with their little decisions their little dilemmas the daytoday jostle of office politics and the nightly family squabbles maddy said sal you ok what do we do now said liam they were all looking at her sal so much like a little sister lost without her leading the way liam oh god poor liam was putting a brave face on things but she knew he was affected badly by what hed discovered about himself bob useful helpful loyal like a labrador but lets not fool ourselves here nothing more than a database on muscular legs and now this dr anwar and his stupid spongebot the pair of them looking like lost sheep right now and im everyones mom ive got to come up with the whatdowedonext bit funny thing was that for the first time in a long time she knew exactly what they had to do next weve got to get out of here she said huh maddy stepped back from the ruined shutters somebody out there knows exactly where we are they know exactly when we are and who we are and they want us all dead weve got to grab what we can whatever we think were going to need and weve got to get the hell out of here liam raised his eyebrows leave this archway yes you mean like now maddy nodded i mean like right now
