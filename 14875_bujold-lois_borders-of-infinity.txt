lois mcmaster bujold borders of infinity you have a visitor lieutenant vorkosigan a little glassy panic twitched in the normally matteroffact corpsmans face he stepped aside to let the man he escorted enter miless hospital room miles caught a glimpse of the corpsman retreating hastily even before the door hissed shut behind the visitor snub nose bright eyes and an open mild expression gave the man a false air of youth though his brown hair was greying at the temples he was slight of body wore civilian clothes and radiated no aura of menace despite the corpsmans reaction in fact he had scarcely an aura at all work as a covert agent in his early days had given simon illyan chief of barrayars imperial security a lifelong habit of being inconspicuous hi boss said miles you look like hell illyan noted agreeably dont bother saluting miles snorted a laugh which hurt everything seemed to hurt except his arms bandaged and immobilized from shoulderblades to fingertips they were still numb from the surgical stunners he wriggled his hospitalgowned body further into his bedclothes futilely seeking comfort how was your bonereplacement surgery asked illyan about what i expected from having my legs done before the ugliest part was opening my right arm and hand up to pick out all the bone fragments tedious the left went a lot faster the pieces were bigger now i get to sit around for a while to see if the marrow transplants are going to take in their synthetic matrix ill be a bit anemic for a while i hope you are not going to make a habit of returning from your mission assignments on a stretcher now now this is only the second time thats happened besides eventually ill run out of unreplaced bones by the time im thirty i could be entirely plastic glumly miles considered this possibility if more than half of him became spare parts could he be declared legally dead would he ever walk into a prosthetics manufacturing plant and cry mother were the medical sedatives making him just a little spacey about your missions said illyan firmly ah so this visit wasnt just an expression of personal concern if illyan had ever owned any personal concern it was sometimes hard to tell you have my reports said miles warily your reports as usual are masterpieces of understatement and misdirection said illyan he sounded perfectly serene about it well anybody might read em you cant tell hardly anyone said illyan but just so so whats the problem money specifically accountability for same maybe it was the drugs he was stuffed with but miles could make no sense of this dont you like my work he said rather plaintively apart from your injuries the results of your latest mission are highly satisfactory began illyan theyd bygod better be miles muttered grimly and your late er adventures on earth just prior to it are still fully classified we will discuss them later ive got to report to a couple of higher authorities first miles put in urgently illyan waved this aside so i understand no these charges date to the dagoola affair and before charges miles muttered in bewilderment illyan studied him thoughtfully i consider what the emperor spends to keep up your connection to the dendarii free mercenaries to be worth it purely from an internal security standpoint were you to be permanently posted at say imperial hq here at the capital youd be a damned plotmagnet all the time not just for favor and officeseekers but for anyone who wants to touch your father through you as now miles squinted as though focusing his eyes could focus his thoughts ah in brief certain parties in imperial accounting are going over your reports from your mercenary fleets covert ops with a microscope they would like to know in more detail where certain large packets of cash have gone some of your equipmentreplacement chits have been outrageous more than once even from my point of view they would very much like to prove an ongoing pattern of peculation a courtmartial charging you with lining your own pockets at the emperors expense would be gloriously embarrassing just now for your father and his whole centrist coalition miles exhaled stunned has it gone so far not yet i fully intend to quash it before it gets off the ground but to do so i need more details so as not to get blindsided as i have sometimes been in your more tangled affairsstill remember if you do not spending a month in my own prison because of you illyan glowered into the past that was part of a plot against dad miles protested so is this if im picking up the early signals correctly but count vorvolk in accounting is their frontman and he is depressingly loyal in addition to having the emperors personal er support untouchable but manipulatable i fear hes been primed he thinks hes being a watchdog the more hes given a runaround the more tenacious hell become he must be handled with utmost care whether hes mistaken or not not breathed miles the full import of the timing of illyans visit now dawned on him not anxiety for an injured subordinate after all but to put his questions to miles just postsurgery when miles was weak hurting drugged maybe confused why dont you just fastpenta me and get it over with miles snarled because i have the report about your idiosyncratic reaction to truth drugs said illyan equably unfortunate that you could twist my arm there was a bitter taste in miless mouth illyans expression was dry and grim i thought about it then i decided to let the surgeons do it for me you can be a real sonofabitch some days simon do you know yes illyan sat unmoved and unmoving waiting watching your father cannot afford a scandal in his government this month not during this appropriations fight this plot must be quashed regardless of its truth what is said in this room will remainmust remainbetween you and me alone but i must know are you offering me an amnesty miless voice was low dangerous he could feel his heart begin to pound if necessary illyans voice was perfectly flat miles couldnt clench or even feel his fists but his toes curled he found himself gulping for air in the pulsing waves of his rage the room seemed to waver you vile bastard you dare call me a thief he rocked in the bed kicking off tangling strangling covers his medical monitor began to bleep alarms his arms were useless weights hanging from his shoulders flopping nervelessly as if i would steal from barrayar as if i would steal from my own dead he swung his feet out pulled himself upright with a mighty wrench of abdominal muscles dizzied halfblackingout he toppled forward precipitously with no hands to catch himself illyan leapt to grab him before he smashed facefirst on the matting what the hell do you think youre doing boy miles wasnt sure himself what are you doing to my patient the whitefaced military doctor cried plunging through the door this man just had major surgery the doctor was frightened and furious the corpsman in his wake merely frightened he tried to impede his superior plucking at his arm and hissing sir thats security chief illyan i know who he is i dont care if hes emperor dorcas ghost i will not have him carrying on his business here the doctor glared courageously at illyan your interrogation or whatever can take place in your own damned headquarters i will not have that kind of thing going on in my hospital this patient is not released to anybody yet illyan looked at first baffled then outraged i was not miles considered briefly clutching artistically at certain nerve junctions in his body and screaming except that he wasnt equipped to clutch at anything just at present appearances can be so damning he purred in illyans ear sinking in illyans arms he grinned evilly through clenched teeth his body shook shocky the sheen of cold sweat on his forehead quite unfeigned illyan frowned at him but put him back to bed very carefully its all right miles wheezed to the doctor its all right i was merely merely upset didnt quite seem to cover it hed felt for a moment as if the top of his head had been about to blow off never mind he felt horribly unbalanced to think that illyan whom hed known all his life whom hed assumed trusted him implicitly or why else send him on a series of such distant independent missions hed been proud to be so trusted while still a young officer with so little direct supervision in his covert ops could his whole career to date have been not desperately needed service to the imperium but just a ploy to get a dangerously clumsy vor puppy out from underfoot toy soldiers no that made no sense a peculator ugly word what a profound slur upon his honor and his wit as if he did not know where imperial funds came from or at what cost the black anger sagged into a black depression his heart hurt he felt smeared could illyanillyanreally think even for one hypothetical moment yes illyan could illyan would not be here not doing this if he were not genuinely worried the charge could be proved true to his dismay miles found himself silently crying damn the drugs illyan was staring at him in considerable disquiet one way or another miles i must defend your expenditureswhich are my departments expenditurestomorrow id rather be courtmartialed illyans lips thinned ill come back later when youve had a chance to sleep perhaps youll be more coherent the doctor fussed over him zapped him with yet another damned drug and left leadenly miles turned his face to the wall not to sleep but to remember the mountains of mourning miles heard the woman weeping as he was climbing the hill from the long lake he hadnt dried himself after his swim as the morning already promised shimmering heat lake water trickled cool from his hair onto his naked chest and back more annoyingly down his legs from his ragged shorts his leg braces chafed on his damp skin as he pistoned up the faint trail through the scrub military doubletime his feet squished in his old wet shoes he slowed curiously as he became conscious of the voices the womans voice grated with grief and exhaustion please lord please all i want is mjustice the front gate guards voice was irritated and embarrassed im no lord cmon get up woman go back to the village and report it at the district magistrates office i tell you i just came from there the woman did not move from her knees as miles emerged from the bushes and paused to take in the tableau across the paved road the magistrates not to return for weeks weeks i walked four days to get here i only have a little money a desperate hope rose in her voice and her spine bent and straightened as she scrabbled in her skirt pocket and held out her cupped hands to the guard a mark and twenty pence its all i have but the exasperated guards eye fell on miles and he straightened abruptly as if afraid miles might suspect him of being tempted by so pitiful a bribe be off woman he snapped miles quirked an eyebrow and limped across the road to the main gate whats all this about corporal he inquired easily the guard corporal was on loan from imperial security and wore the highnecked dress greens of the barrayaran service he was sweating and uncomfortable in the bright morning light of this southern district but miles fancied hed be boiled before hed undo his collar on this post his accent was not local he was a city man from the capital where a moreorless efficient bureaucracy absorbed such problems as the one on her knees before him the woman now was local and more than localshe had backcountry written all over her she was younger than her strained voice had at first suggested tall feverred from her weeping with stringy blonde hair hanging down across a ferretthin face and protuberant grey eyes if she were cleaned up fed rested happy and confident she might achieve a nearprettiness but she was far from that now despite her remarkable figure lean but fullbreastedno miles revised himself as he crossed the road and came up to the gate her bodice was all blotched with dried milk leaks though there was no baby in sight only temporarily fullbreasted her worn dress was factorywoven cloth but handsewn crude and simple her feet were bare thicklycallused cracked and sore no problem the guard assured miles go away he hissed to the woman she lurched off her knees and sat stonily ill call my sergeant the guard eyed her warily and have her removed wait a moment said miles she stared up at miles from her crosslegged position clearly not knowing whether to identify him as hope or not his clothing what there was of it offered her no clue as to what he might be the rest of him was all too plainly displayed he jerked up his chin and smiled thinly toolarge head tooshort neck back thickened with its crooked spine crooked legs with their brittle bones toooften broken drawing the eye in their gleaming chromium braces were the hill woman standing the top of his head would barely be even with the top of her shoulder he waited in boredom for her hand to make the backcountry hex sign against evil mutations but it only jerked and clenched into a fist i must see my lord count she said to an uncertain point halfway between miles and the guard its my right my daddy he died in the service its my right prime minister count vorkosigan said the guard stiffly is on his country estate to rest if he were working hed be back in vorbarr sultana the guard looked like he wished he were back in vorbarr sultana the woman seized the pause youre only a city man hes my count my right what do you want to see count vorkosigan for asked miles patiently murder growled the girlwoman the security guard spasmed slightly i want to report a murder shouldnt you report to your village speaker first inquired miles with a handdown gesture to calm the twitching guard i did hell do nothing rage and frustration cracked her voice he says its over and done he wont write down my accusation says its nonsense it would only make trouble for everybody he says i dont care i want my justice miles frowned thoughtfully looking the woman over the details checked corroborated her claimed identity added up to a solid if subliminal sense of authentic truth which perhaps escaped the professionally paranoid security man its true corporal miles said she has a right to appeal first to the district magistrate then to the counts court and the district magistrate wont be back for two weeks this sector of count vorkosigans native district had only one overworked district magistrate who rode a circuit that included the lakeside village of vorkosigan surleau but one day a month since the region of the prime ministers country estate was crawling with imperial security when the great lord was in residence and closely monitored even when he was not prudent troublemakers took their troubles elsewhere scan her and let her in said miles on my authority the guard was one of imperial securitys best trained to look for assassins in his own shadow he now looked scandalized and lowered his voice to miles sir if i let every country lunatic wander the estate at will ill take her up im going that way the guard shrugged helplessly but stopped short of saluting miles was decidedly not in uniform the gate guard pulled a scanner from his belt and made a great show of going over the woman miles wondered if hed have been inspired to harass her with a stripsearch without miless inhibiting presence when the guard finished demonstrating how alert conscientious and loyal he was he palmed open the gates lock entered the transaction including the womans retina scan into the computer monitor and stood aside in a pose of rather pointed parade rest miles grinned at the silent editorial and steered the bedraggled woman by the elbow through the gates and up the winding drive she twitched away from his touch at the earliest opportunity yet still refrained from superstitious gestures eyeing him with a strange and hungry curiosity time was such openly repelled fascination with the peculiarities of his body had driven miles to grind his teeth now he could take it with a serene amusement only slightly tinged with acid they would learn all of them they would learn do you serve count vorkosigan little man she asked cautiously miles thought about that one a moment yes he answered finally the answer was after all true on every level of meaning but the one shed asked it he quelled the temptation to tell her he was the court jester from the look of her this ones troubles were much worse than his own she had apparently not quite believed in her own rightful destiny despite her mulish determination at the gate for as they climbed unimpeded toward her goal a nascent panic made her face even more drawn and pale almost ill howhow do i talk to him she choked should i curtsey she glanced down at herself as if conscious for the first time of her own dirt and sweat and squalor miles suppressed a facetious setup starting with kneel and knock your forehead three times on the floor before speaking thats what the general staff does and said instead just stand up straight and speak the truth try to be clear hell take it from there he does not after all miless lips twitched lack experience she swallowed a hundred years ago the vorkosigans summer retreat had been a guard barracks part of the outlying fortifications of the great castle on the bluff above the village of vorkosigan surleau the castle was now a burntout ruin and the barracks transformed into a comfortable low stone residence modernized and remodernized artistically landscaped and bright with flowers the arrow slits had been widened into big glass windows overlooking the lake and comm link antennae bristled from the roof there was a new guard barracks concealed in the trees downslope but it had no arrow slits a man in the brownandsilver livery of the counts personal retainers exited the residences front door as miles approached with the strange woman in tow it was the new man what was his name pym that was it wheres mlord count miles asked him in the upper pavilion taking breakfast with mlady pym glanced at the woman waited on miles in a posture of polite inquiry ah well this woman has walked four days to lay an appeal before the district magistrates court the courts not here but the count is so she now proposes to skip the middlemen and go straight to the top i like her style take her up will you during breakfast said pym miles cocked his head at the woman have you had breakfast she shook her head mutely i thought not miles turned his hands palmout dumping her symbolically on the retainer now yes my daddy he died in the service the woman repeated faintly its my right the phrase seemed as much to convince herself as anyone else now pym was if not a hill man districtborn so it is he sighed and gestured her to follow him without further ado her eyes widened as she trailed him around the house and she glanced back nervously over her shoulder at miles little man just stand straight he called to her he watched her round the corner grinned and took the steps two at a time into the residences main entrance after a shave and cold shower miles dressed in his own room overlooking the long lake he dressed with great care as great as hed expended on the service academy ceremonies and imperial review two days ago clean underwear longsleeved cream shirt dark green trousers with the side piping highcollared green tunic tailorcut to his own difficult fit new pale blue plastic ensigns rectangles aligned precisely on the collar and poking most uncomfortably into his jaw he dispensed with the leg braces and pulled on mirrorpolished boots to the knee and swiped a bit of dust from them with his pajama pants readytohand on the floor where hed dropped them before going swimming he straightened and checked himself in the mirror his dark hair hadnt even begun to recover from that last cut before the graduation ceremonies a pale sharpfeatured face not too much dissipated bag under the grey eyes nor too bloodshotalas the limits of his body compelled him to stop celebrating well before he could hurt himself echoes of the late celebration still boiled up silently in his head crooking his mouth into a grin he was on his way now had his hand clamped firmly around the lowest rung of the highest ladder on barrayar imperial service itself there were no giveaways in the service even for sons of the old vor you got what you earned his brotherofficers could be relied on to know that even if outsiders wondered he was in position at last to prove himself to all doubters up and away and never look down never look back one last look back as carefully as hed dressed miles gathered up the necessary objects for his task the white cloth rectangles of his former academy cadets rank the handcalligraphed second copy purchased for this purpose of his new officers commission in the barrayaran imperial service a copy of his academy threeyear scholastic transcript on paper with all its commendations and demerits no point in anything but honesty in this next transaction in a cupboard downstairs he found the brass brazier and tripod wrapped in its polishing cloth and a plastic bag of very dry juniper bark chemical firesticks out the back door and up the hill the landscaped path split right going up to the pavilion overlooking it all left forking sideways to a gardenlike area surrounded by a low fieldstone wall miles let himself in by the gate good morning crazy ancestors he called then quelled his humor it might be true but lacked the respect due the occasion he strolled over and around the graves until he came to the one he sought knelt and set up the brazier and tripod humming the stone was simple general count piotr pierre vorkosigan and the dates if theyd tried to list all the accumulated honors and accomplishments theyd have had to go to microprint he piled in the bark the very expensive papers the cloth bits a clipped mat of dark hair from that last cut he set it alight and rocked back on his heels to watch it burn hed played a hundred versions of this moment over in his head over the years ranging from solemn public orations with musicians in the background to dancing naked on the old mans grave hed settled on this private and traditional ceremony played straight just between the two of them so grandfather he purred at last and here we are after all satisfied now all the chaos of the graduation ceremonies behind all the mad efforts of the last three years all the pain came to this point but the grave did not speak did not say well done you can stop now the ashes spelled out no messages there were no visions to be had in the rising smoke the brazier burned down all too quickly not enough stuff in it perhaps he stood and dusted his knees in the silence and the sunlight so what had he expected applause why was he here in the final analysis dancing out a dead mans dreamswho did his service really serve grandfather himself pale emperor gregor who cared well old man he whispered then shouted are you satisfied yet the echoes rang from the stones a throat cleared behind him and miles whirled like a scalded cat heart pounding uh my lord said pym carefully pardon me i did not mean to interrupt anything but the count your father requires you to attend on him in the upper pavilion pyms expression was perfectly bland miles swallowed and waited for the scarlet heat he could feel in his face to recede quite he shrugged the fires almost out ill clean it up later dont let anybody else touch it he marched past pym and didnt look back the pavilion was a simple structure of weathered silver wood open on all four sides to catch the breeze this morning a few faint puffs from the west good sailing on the lake this afternoon maybe only ten days precious home leave left and much miles wanted to do including the trip to vorbarr sultana with his cousin ivan to pick out his new lightflyer and then his first assignment would be coming throughship duty miles prayed hed had to overcome a major temptation not to ask his father to make sure it was ship duty he would take whatever assignment fate dealt him that was the first rule of the game and win with the hand he was dealt the interior of the pavilion was shady and cool after the glare outside it was furnished with comfortable old chairs and tables one of which bore the remains of a noble breakfastmiles mentally marked two lonelylooking oil cakes on a crumbscattered tray as his own miless mother lingering over her cup smiled across the table at him miless father casually dressed in an openthroated shirt and shorts sat in a worn armchair aral vorkosigan was a thickset greyhaired man heavyjawed heavybrowed scarred a face that lent itself to savage caricaturemiles had seen some in opposition press in the histories of barrayars enemies they had only to draw one lie to render dull those sharp penetrating eyes to create everyones parody of a military dictator and how much is he haunted by grandfather miles wondered he doesnt show it much but then he doesnt have to admiral aral vorkosigan space master strategist conqueror of komarr hero of escobar for sixteen years imperial regent supreme power on barrayar in all but name and then hed capped it confounded history and all selfsure witnesses and heaped up honor and glory beyond all that had gone before by voluntarily stepping down and transferring command smoothly to emperor gregor upon his majority not that the prime ministership hadnt made a dandy retirement from the regency and he was showing no signs yet of stepping down from that and so admiral arals life took general piotrs like an overpowering hand of cards and where did that leave ensign miles holding two deuces and the joker he must surely either concede or start bluffing like crazy the hill woman sat on a hassock a halfeaten oil cake clutched in her hands staring openmouthed at miles in all his power and polish as he caught and returned her gaze her lips pressed closed and her eyes lit her expression was strangeanger exhilaration embarrassment glee some bizarre mixture of all and what did you think i was woman being in uniform showing off his uniform miles came to attention before his father sir count vorkosigan spoke to the woman that is my son if i send him as my voice would that satisfy you oh she breathed her wide mouth drawing back in a weird fierce grin the most expression miles had yet seen on her face yes my lord very well it will be done what will be done miles wondered warily the count was leaning back in his chair looking satisfied himself but with a dangerous tension around his eyes hinting that something had aroused his true anger not anger at the woman clearly they were in some sort of agreement andmiles searched his conscience quicklynot at miles himself he cleared his throat gently cocking his head and baring his teeth in an inquiring smile the count steepled his hands and spoke to miles at last a most interesting case i can see why you sent her up ah said miles what had he got hold of hed only greased the womans way through security on a quixotic impulse for gods sake and to tweak his father at breakfast ah he continued noncommittally count vorkosigans brows rose did you not know she spoke of a murder and a marked lack of cooperation from her local authorities about it figured youd give her a lift on to the district magistrate the count settled back still further and rubbed his hand thoughtfully across his scarred chin its an infanticide case miless belly went cold i dont want anything to do with this well that explained why there was no baby to go with the breasts unusual for it to be reported weve fought the old customs for twenty years and more said the count promulgated propagandized in the cities weve made good progress in the cities murmured the countess people have access to alternatives but in the backcountrywelllittle has changed we all know whats going on but without a report a complaintand with the family invariably drawing together to protect its ownits hard to get leverage what miles cleared his throat nodded at the woman what was your babys mutation the cats mouth the woman dabbed at her upper lip to demonstrate she had the hole inside her mouth too and was a weak sucker she choked and cried but she was getting enough she was harelip the counts offworlder wife murmured half to herself translating the barrayaran term to the galactic standard and a cleft palate sounds like harra thats not even a mutation they had that back on old earth a a normal birth defect if thats not a contradiction in terms not a punishment for your barrayaran ancestors pilgrimage through the fire a simple operation could have corrected countess vorkosigan cut herself off the hill woman was looking anguished id heard the woman said my lord had made a hospital to be built at hassadar i meant to take her there when i was a little stronger though i had no money her arms and legs were sound her head was wellshaped anybody could seesurely they would have her hands clenched and twisted her voice went ragged but lem killed her first a sevenday walk miles calculated from the deep dendarii mountains to the lowland town of hassadar reasonable that a woman newly risen from childbed might delay that hike a few days an hours ride in an aircar so one is reported as a murder at last said count vorkosigan and we will treat it as exactly that this is a chance to send a message to the farthest corners of my own district you miles will be my voice to reach where it has not reached before you will dispense counts justice upon this manand not quietly either its time for the practices that brand us as barbarians in galactic eyes to end miles gulped wouldnt the district magistrate be better qualified the count smiled slightly for this case i can think of no one better qualified than yourself the messenger and the message all in one times have changed indeed miles wished himself elsewhere anywhereback sweating blood over his final examinations for instance he stifled an unworthy wail my home leave miles rubbed the back of his neck who ah who is it killed your little girl meaning who is it im expected to drag out put up against a wall and shoot my husband she said tonelessly looking atthroughthe polished silvery floorboards i knew this was going to be messy she cried and cried the woman went on and wouldnt go to sleep not nursing wellhe shouted at me to shut her up then miles prompted sick to his stomach he swore at me and went to go sleep at his mothers he said at least a working man could sleep there i hadnt slept either this guy sounds like a real winner miles had an instant picture of him a bull of a man with a bullying mannernevertheless there was something missing in the climax of the womans story the count had picked up on it too he was listening with total attention his strategysession look a sliteyed intensity of thought you could mistake for sleepiness that would be a grave mistake were you an eyewitness he asked in a deceptively mild tone that put miles on full alert did you actually see him kill her i found her dead in the midmorning lord you went into the bedroom count vorkosigan led her on weve only got one room she shot him a look as if doubtful for the first time of his total omniscience she had slept slept at last i went out to get some brillberries up the ravine a way and when i came back i should have taken her with me but i was so glad she slept at last didnt want to risk waking her tears leaked from the womans tightlyclosed eyes i let her sleep when i came back i was glad to eat and rest but i began to get full her hand touched a breast and i went to wake her what were there no marks on her not a cut throat asked the count that was the usual method for these backcountry infanticides quick and clean compared to say exposure the woman shook her head smothered i think lord it was cruel something cruel the village speaker said i must have overlain her and wouldnt take my plea against lem i did not i did not she had her own cradle lem made it with his own hands when she was still in my belly she was close to breaking down the count exchanged a glance with his wife and a small tilt of his head countess vorkosigan rose smoothly come harra down to the house you must wash and rest before miles takes you home the hill woman looked taken aback oh not in your house lady sorry its the only one ive got handy besides the guard barracks the guards are good boys but youd make em uncomfortable the countess eased her out it is clear said count vorkosigan as soon as the women were out of earshot that you will have to check out the medical facts before er popping off and i trust you will also have noticed the little problem with a positive identification of the accused this could be the ideal publicdemonstration case we want but not if theres any ambiguity about it no bloody mysteries im not a coroner miles pointed out immediately if he could wriggle off this hook quite you will take dr dea with you lieutenant dea was the prime ministers physicians assistant miles had seen him aroundan ambitious young military doctor in a constant state of frustration because his superior would never let him touch his most important patientoh he was going to be thrilled with this assignment miles predicted morosely he can take his osteo kit with him too the count went on brightening slightly in case of accidents how economical said miles rolling his eyes look uhsuppose her story checks out and we nail this guy do i have to personally one of the liveried men will be your bodyguard andif the story checksthe executioner that was only slightly better couldnt we wait for the district magistrate every judgment the district magistrate makes he makes in my place every sentence his office carries out is carried out in my name someday it will be done in your name its time you gained a clear understanding of the process historically the vor may be a military caste but a vor lords duties were never only military ones no escape damn damn damn miles sighed right well we could take the aircar i suppose and be up there in a couple of hours allow some time to find the right hole drop out of the sky on em make the message loud and clear be back before bedtime get it over with quickly the count had that sliteyed look again no he said slowly not the aircar i dont think no roads for a groundcar up that far just trails he added uneasilysurely his father could not be thinking ofi dont think id cut a very impressive figure of central imperial authority on foot sir his father glanced up at his crisp dress uniform and smiled slightly oh you dont do so badly but picture this after three or four days of beating through the bushes miles protested you didnt see us in basic or smell us ive been there said the admiral dryly but no youre quite right not on foot i have a better idea my own cavalry troop thought miles ironically turning in his saddle just like grandfather actually he was pretty sure the old man would have had some acerbic comments about the riders now strung out behind miles on the wooded trail once hed got done rolling on the ground laughing at the equitation being displayed the vorkosigan stables had shrunk sadly since the old man was no longer around to take an interest the polo string sold off the few remaining ancient and illtempered excavalry beasts put permanently out to pasture the handful of riding horses left were retained for their surefootedness and good manners not their exotic bloodlines and kept exercised and gentle for the occasional guest by a gaggle of girls from the village miles gathered his reins tensed one calf and shifted his weight slightly and fat ninny responded with a neat half turn and two precise back steps the thickset roan gelding could not have been mistaken by the most ignorant urbanite for a fiery steed but miles adored him for his dark and liquid eye his wide velvet nose his phlegmatic disposition equally unappalled by rushing streams or screaming aircars but most of all for his exquisite dressagetrained responsiveness brains before beauty just being around him made miles calmer the beast was an emotional blotter like a purring cat miles patted fat ninny on the neck if anybody asks he murmured ill tell them your name is chieftan fat ninny waggled one fuzzy ear and heaved a wooshing barrelchested sigh grandfather had a great deal to do with the unlikely parade miles now led the great guerilla general had poured out his youth in these mountains fighting the cetagandan invaders to a standstill and then reversing their tide antiflyer heatless seekerstrikers smuggled in at bloody cost from offplanet had a lot more to do with the final victory than cavalry horses which according to grandfather had saved his forces through the worst winter of that campaign mainly by being edible but through retroactive romance the horse had become the symbol of that struggle miles thought his father was being overly optimistic if he thought miles was going to cash in thusly on the old mans residual glory the guerilla caches and camps were shapeless lumps of rust and trees dammit not just weeds and scrub anymorethey had passed some earlier in todays ridethe men who had fought that war had long since gone to ground for the last time just like grandfather what was he doing here it was jump ship duty he wanted taking him high high above all this the future not the past held his destiny miless meditations were interrupted by dr deas horse which taking exception to a branch lying across the logging trail planted all four feet in an abrupt stop and snorted loudly dr dea toppled off with a faint cry hang onto the reins miles called and pressed fat ninny back down the trail dr dea was getting rather better at falling off hed landed moreorless on his feet this time he made a lunge at the dangling reins but his sorrel mare shied away from his grab dea jumped back as she swung on her haunches and then realizing her freedom bounced back down the trail tail bannering horse bodylanguage for nyah nyah ya cant catch me dr dea red and furious ran swearing in pursuit she broke into a canter no no dont run after her called miles how the hell am i supposed to catch her if i dont run after her snarled dea the space surgeon was not a happy man my medkits on that bloody beast how do you think you can catch her if you do asked miles she can fun faster than you can at the end of the little column pym turned his horse sideways blocking the trail just wait harra miles advised the anxious hill woman in passing hold your horse still nothing starts a horse running faster than another running horse the other two riders were doing rather better the woman harra csurik sat her horse wearily allowing it to plod along without interference but at least riding on balance instead of trying to use the reins as a handle like the unfortunate dea pym bringing up the rear was competent if not comfortable miles slowed fat ninny to a walk reins loose and wandered after the mare radiating an air of calm relaxation who me i dont want to catch you were just enjoying the scenery right thats it stop for a bite the sorrel mare paused to nibble at a weed but kept a wary eye on miless approach at a distance just short of starting the mare bolting off again miles stopped fat ninny and slid off he made no move toward the mare but instead stood still and made a great show of fishing in his pockets fat ninny butted his head against miles eagerly and miles cooed and fed him a bit of sugar the mare cocked her ears with interest fat ninny smacked his lips and nudged for more the mare snuffled up for her share she lipped a cube from miless palm as he slid his other arm quietly through the loop of her reins here you go dr dea one horse no running no fair wheezed dea trudging up you had sugar in your pockets of course i had sugar in my pockets its called foresight and planning the trick of handling horses isnt to be faster than the horse or stronger than the horse that pits your weakness against his strengths the trick is to be smarter than the horse that pits your strength against his weakness eh dea took his reins its snickering at me he said suspiciously thats nickering not snickering miles grinned he tapped fat ninny behind his left foreleg and the horse obediently grunted down onto one knee miles clambered up readily to his convenientlylowered stirrup does mine do that asked dr dea watching with fascination sorry no dea glowered at his horse this animal is an idiot i shall lead it for a while as fat ninny lurched back to his four feet miles suppressed a ridinginstructorly comment gleaned from his grandfathers store such as be smarter than the horse dea though dr dea was officially sworn to lord vorkosigan for the duration of this investigation space surgeon lieutenant dea certainly outranked ensign vorkosigan to command older men who outranked one called for a certain measure of tact the logging road widened out here and miles dropped back beside harra csurik her fierceness and determination of yesterday morning at the gate seemed to be fading even as the trail rose toward her home or perhaps it was simply exhaustion catching up with her shed said little all morning been sunk in silence all afternoon if she was going to drag miles all the way up to the back of beyond and then wimp out on him what ah branch of the service was your father in harra miles began conversationally she raked her fingers through her hair in a combing gesture more nervousness than vanity her eyes looked out at him through the strawcolored wisps like skittish creatures in the protection of a hedge district militia mlord i dont really remember him he died when i was real little in combat she nodded in the fighting around vorbarr sultana during vordarians pretendership miles refrained from asking which side he had been swept up onmost footsoldiers had had little choice and the amnesty had included the dead as well as the living ah do you have any sibs no lord just me and my mother left a little anticipatory tension eased in miless neck if this judgment indeed drove all the way through to an execution one misstep could trigger a blood feud among the inlaws not the legacy of justice the count intended him to leave behind so the fewer inlaws involved the better what about your husbands family hes got seven four brothers and three sisters hm miles had a mental flash of an entire team of huge menacing hill hulks he glanced back at pym feeling a trifle understaffed for his task he had pointed out this factor to the count when theyd been planning this expedition last night the village speaker and his deputies will be your backup the count had said just as for the district magistrate on court circuit what if they dont want to cooperate miles had asked nervously an officer who expects to command imperial troops the count had glinted should be able to figure out how to extract cooperation from a backcountry headman in other words his father had decided this was a test and wasnt going to give him any more clues thanks dad you have no sibs lord said harra snapping him back to the present no but surely thats known even in the backbeyond they say a lot of things about you harra shrugged miles bit down on the morbid question in his mouth like a wedge of raw lemon he would not ask it he would not he couldnt help himself like what forced out past his stiff lips everyone knows the counts son is a mutant her eyes flicked defiantwide some said it came from the offworlder woman he married some said it was from radiation from the wars or a disease from um corrupt practices in his youth among his brotherofficers that last was a new one to miles his brow lifted but most say he was poisoned by his enemies im glad most have it right it was an assassination attempt using soltoxin gas when my mother was pregnant with me but its not a mutation his thought hiccoughed through the wellworn grooves how many times had he explained thisits teratogenic not genetic im not a mutant not what the hell did a fine point of biochemistry matter to this ignorant bereaved woman for all practical purposesfor her purposeshe might as well be a mutant important he finished she eyed him sideways swaying gently in the clopaclop rhythm of her mount some said you were born with no legs and lived all the time in a float chair in vorkosigan house some said you were born with no bones and kept in a jar in the basement no doubt miles muttered but karal said hed seen you with your grandfather at hassadar fair and you were only sickly and undersized some said your father had got you into the service but others said no youd gone offplanet to your mothers home and had your brain turned into a computer and your body fed with tubes floating in a liquid i knew thered be a jar turn up in this story somewhere miles grimaced you knew you d be sorry you asked too but you went and did it anyway she was baiting him miles realized suddenly how dare she but there was no humor in her only a sharpedged watchfulness she had gone out way out on a limb to lay this murder charge in defiance of family and local authorities alike in defiance of established custom and what had her count given her for a shield and support going back to face the wrath of all her nearest and dearest miles could he handle this she must be wondering indeed or would he botch it cave and cut and run leaving her to face the whirlwind of rage and revenge alone he wished hed left her weeping at the gate the woodland fruit of many generations of terraforming forestry opened out suddenly on a vale of brown native scrub down the middle of it through some accident of soil chemistry ran a halfkilometerwide swathe of green and pinkferal roses miles realized with astonishment as they rode nearer earth roses the track dove into the fragrant mass of them and vanished he took turns with pym hacking their way through with their service bush knives the roses were vigorous and studded with thick thorns and hacked back with a vicious elastic recoil fat ninny did his part by swinging his big head back and forth and nipping off blooms and chomping them down happily miles wasnt sure just how many he ought to let the big roan eatjust because the species wasnt native to barrayar didnt mean it wasnt poisonous to horses miles sucked at his wounds and reflected upon barrayars shattered ecological history the fifty thousand firsters from earth had only meant to be the spearhead of barrayars colonization then through a gravitational anomoly the wormhole jump through which the colonists had come shifted closed irrevocably and without warning the terraforming which had begun so careful and controlled in the beginning collapsed along with everything else imported earth plant and animal species had escaped everywhere to run wild as the humans turned their attention to the most urgent problems of survival biologists still mourned the mass extinctions of native species that had followed the erosions and droughts and floods but really miles thought over the centuries of the time of isolation the fittest of both worlds had fought it out to a perfectly good new balance if it was alive and covered the ground who cared where it came from we are all here by accident like the roses they camped that night high in the hills and pushed on in the morning to the flanks of the true mountains they were now out of the region miles was personally familiar with from his childhood and he checked harras directions frequently on his orbital survey map they stopped only a few hours short of their goal at sunset of the second day harra insisted she could lead them on in the dusk from here but miles did not care to arrive after nightfall unannounced in a strange place of uncertain welcome he bathed the next morning in a stream and unpacked and dressed carefully in his new officers imperial dress greens pym wore the vorkosigan brownandsilver livery and pulled the counts standard on a telescoping aluminum pole from the recesses of his saddlebag and mounted it on his left stirrup dressed to kill thought miles joylessly dr dea wore ordinary black fatigues and looked uncomfortable if they constituted a message miles was damned if he knew what it was they pulled the horses up at midmorning before a tworoom cabin set on the edge of a vast grove of sugar maples planted whoknewhowmany centuries ago but now raggedly marching up the vale by selfseeding the mountain air was cool and pure and bright a few chickens stalked and bobbed in the weeds an algaechoked wooden pipe from the woods dribbled water into a trough which overflowed into a squishy green streamlet and away harra slid down and smoothed her skirt and climbed the porch karal she called miles waited high on horseback for the initial contact never give up a psychological advantage harra is that you came a mans voice from within he banged open the door and rushed out where have you been girl weve been beating the bushes for you thought youd broke your neck in the scrub somewhere he stopped short before the three silent men on horseback you wouldnt write down my charges karal said harra rather breathlessly her hands kneaded her skirt so i walked to the district magistrate at vorkosigan surleau to speak them myself oh girl karal breathed regretfully that was a stupid thing to do his head lowered and swayed as he stared uneasily at the riders he was a balding man of maybe sixty leathery and worn and his left arm ended in a stump another veteran speaker serg karal began miles sternly i am the voice of count vorkosigan i am charged to investigate the crime spoken by harra csurik before the counts court namely the murder of her infant daughter raina as speaker of silvy vale you are requested and required to assist me in all matters pertaining to the counts justice at this point miles ran out of prescribed formalities and was on his own that hadnt taken long he waited fat ninny snuffled the silveronbrown cloth of the standard made a few soft snapping sounds lifted by a vagrant breeze the district magistrate wasnt there put in harra but the count was karal was greyfaced staring he pulled himself together with an effort came to a species of attention and essayed a creaking halfbow whowho are you sir lord miles vorkosigan karals lips moved silently miles was no lip reader but he was pretty sure it came to a dismayed variant of oh shit this is my liveried man sergeant pym and my medical examiner lieutenant dea of the imperial service you are my lord counts son karal croaked the one and only miles was suddenly sick of the posing surely that was a sufficient first impression he swung down off ninny landing lightly on the balls of his feet karals gaze followed him down and down yeah so im short but waitll you see me dance all right if we water our horses in your trough here miles looped ninnys reins through his arm and stepped toward it uh thats for the people mlord said karal just a minute and ill fetch a bucket he hitched up his baggy trousers and trotted off around the side of the cabin a minutes uncomfortable silence then karals voice floating faintly whered you put the goat bucket zed another voice light and young behind the woodstack da the voices fell to a muffled undertone karal came trotting back with a battered aluminum bucket which he placed beside the trough he knocked out a wooden plug in the side and a bright stream arced out to splash and fill fat ninny flickered his ears and snuffled and rubbed his big head against miles smearing his tunic with red and white horsehairs and nearly knocking him off his feet karal glanced up and smiled at the horse though his smile fell away as his gaze passed on to the horses owner as fat ninny gulped his drink miles caught a glimpse of the owner of the second voice a boy of around twelve who flitted off into the woods behind the cabin karal fell to assisting miles and harra and pym in securing the horses miles left pym to unsaddle and feed and followed karal into his house harra stuck to miles like glue and dr dea unpacked his medical kit and trailed along miless boots rang loud and unevenly on the wooden floorboards my wife shell be back in the nooning said karal moving uncertainly around the room as miles and dea settled themselves on a bench and harra curled up with her arms around her knees on the floor beside the fieldstone hearth ill ill make some tea mlord he skittered back out the door to fill a kettle at the trough before miles could say no thank you no let him ease his nerves in ordinary movements then maybe miles could begin to tease out how much of this static was social nervousness and how much wasperhapsguilty conscience by the time karal had the kettle on the coals he was noticeably better controlled so miles began id prefer to commence this investigation immediately speaker it need not take long it need not take place at all mlord the babys death was naturalthere were no marks on her she was weakly she had the cats mouth who knows what else was wrong with her she died in her sleep or by some accident it is remarkable said miles dryly how often such accidents happen in this district my father the count himself has remarked on it there was no call to drag you up here karal looked in exasperation at harra she sat silent unmoved by his persuasion it was no problem said miles blandly truly mlord karal lowered his voice i believe the child might have been overlain s no wonder in her grief that her mind rejected it lem csurik hes a good boy a good provider she really doesnt want to do this her reason is just temporarily overset by her troubles harras eyes looking out from her hairthatch were poisonously cold i begin to see miless voice was mild encouraging karal brightened slightly it all could still be all right if she will just be patient get over her sorrow talk to poor lem im sure he didnt kill the babe not rush to something shell regret i begin to see miles let his tone go ice cool why harra csurik found it necessary to walk four days to get an unbiased hearing you think you believe who knows what not you it appears i hear speculationaccusationinnuendoassertion i came for facts speaker karal the counts justice doesnt turn on guesses it doesnt have to this isnt the time of isolation not even the backbeyond my investigation of the facts will begin now no judgment will berushed into before the facts are complete confirmation of lem csuriks guilt or innocence will come from his own mouth under fastpenta administered by dr dea before two witnessesyourself and a deputy of your choice simple clean and quick and maybe i can be on my way out of this benighted hole before sundown i require you speaker to go now and bring lem csurik for questioning sergeant pym will assist you karal killed another moment pouring the boiling water into a big brown pot before speaking im a travelled man lord a twentyyear service man but most folks here have never been out of silvy vale interrogation chemistry might as well be magic to them they might say it was a false confession got that way then you and your deputy can say otherwise this isnt exactly like the good old days when confessions were extracted under torture karal besides if hes as innocent as you guess hell clear himself no reluctantly karal went into the adjoining room he came back shrugging on a faded imperial service uniform jacket with a corporals rank marked on the collar the buttons of which did not quite meet across his middle anymore preserved evidently for such official functions even as in barrayaran custom one saluted the uniform and not the man in it so might the wrath engendered by an unpopular duty fall on the office and not the individual who carried it out miles appreciated the nuance karal paused at the door harra still sat wrapped in silence by the hearth rocking slightly mlord said karal ive been speaker of silvy vale for sixteen years now in all that time nobody has had to go to the district magistrate for a speaking not for water rights or stolen animals or swiving or even the time neva accused bors of tree piracy over the maple sap weve not had a blood feud in all that time i have no intention of starting a blood feud karal i just want the facts thats the thing mlord im not so in love with facts as i used to be sometimes they bite karals eyes were urgent really the man was doing everything but stand on his head and juggle catsonehandedto divert miles how overt was his obstruction likely to get silvy vale cannot be permitted to have its own little time of isolation said miles warningly the counts justice is for everyone now even if theyre small and weakly and have something wrong with them and cannot even speak for themselvesspeaker karal flinched white about the lipspoint taken evidently he trudged away up the trail pym following watchfully one hand loosening the stunner in his holster they drank the tea while they waited and miles pottered about the cabin looking but not touching the hearth was the sole source of heat for cooking and washwater there was a beaten metal sink for washing up filled by hand from a covered bucket but emptied through a drainpipe under the porch to join the streamlet running down out of the trough the second room was a bedroom with a double bed and chests for storage a loft held three more pallets the boy around back had brothers apparently the place was cramped but swept things put away and hung up on a side table sat a governmentissue audio receiver and a second and older military model opened up apparently in the process of getting minor repairs and a new power pack exploration revealed a drawer full of old parts nothing more complex than for simple audio sets unfortunately speaker karal must double as silvy vales comm link specialist how appropriate they must pick up broadcasts from the station in hassadar maybe the highpower government channels from the capital as well no other electricity of course powersat receptors were expensive pieces of precision technology they would come even here in time some communities almost as small but with strong economic coops already had them silvy vale was obviously still stuck in subsistencelevel and must needs wait till there was enough surplus in the district to gift them if the surplus was not grabbed off first by some competing want if only the city of vorkosigan vashnoi had not been obliterated by cetagandan atomics the whole district could be years ahead economically miles walked out on the porch and leaned on the rail karals son had returned down at the end of the cleared yard fat ninny was standing tethered hipshot ears aflop grunting with pleasure as the grinning boy scratched him vigorously under his halter the boy looked up to catch miles watching him and scooted off fearfully to vanish again in the scrub downslope huh muttered miles dr dea joined him theyve been gone a long time about time to break out the fastpenta no your autopsy kit i should say i fancy thats what well be doing next dea glanced at him sharply i thought you sent pym along to enforce the arrest you cant arrest a man whos not there are you a wagering man doctor ill bet you a mark they dont come back with csurik no hold itmaybe im wrong i hope im wrong here are three coming back karal pym and another were marching down the trail the third was a hulking young man bighanded heavybrowed thicknecked surly harra miles called is this your husband he looked the part by god just what miles had pictured and four brothers just like himonly bigger no doubt harra appeared by miless shoulder and let out her breath no mlord thats alex the speakers deputy oh miless lips compressed in silent frustration well i had to give it a chance to be simple karal stopped beneath him and began a wandering explanation of his emptyhanded state miles cut him off with a lift of his eyebrows pym bolted mlord said pym laconically almost certainly warned i agree he frowned down at karal who prudently stood silent facts first decisions such as how much deadly force to pursue the fugitive with second harra how far is it to your burying place down by the stream lord at the bottom of the valley about two kilometers get your kit doctor were taking a walk karal fetch a shovel mlord surely it isnt needful to disturb the peace of the dead began karal it is entirely needful theres a place for the autopsy report right in the procedural i got from the district magistrates office where i will file my completed report upon this case when we return to vorkosigan surleau i have permission from the nextofkindo i not harra she nodded numbly i have the two requisite witnesses yourself and your gorilla deputy we have the doctor and the daylightif you dont stand there arguing till sundown all we need is the shovel unless youre volunteering to dig with your hand karal miless voice was flat and grating and getting dangerous karals balding head bobbed in his distress thethe father is the legal nextofkin while he lives and you dont have his karal said miles mlord take care the grave you dig is not your own youve got one foot in it already karals hand opened in despair ill get the shovel mlord the midafternoon was warm the air golden and summersleepy the shovel bit with a steady scrunchscrunch through the soil at the hands of karals deputy downslope a bright stream burbled away over clean rounded stones harra hunkered watching silent and grim when big alex levered out the little crateso littlesergeant pym went off for a patrol of the wooded perimeter miles didnt blame him he hoped the soil at that depth had been cool these last eight days alex pried open the box and dr dea waved him away and took over the deputy too went off to find something to examine at the far end of the graveyard dea looked the clothwrapped bundle over carefully lifted it out and set it on his tarp laid out on the ground in the bright sun the instruments of his investigation were arrayed upon the plastic in precise order he unwrapped the brightlypatterned cloths in their special folds and harra crept up to retrieve them straighten and fold them ready for reuse then crept back miles fingered the handkerchief in his pocket ready to hold over his mouth and nose and went to watch over deas shoulder bad but not too bad hed seen and smelled worse dea filtermasked spoke procedurals into his recorder hovering in the air by his shoulder and made his examination first by eye and gloved touch then by scanner here my lord said dea and motioned miles closer almost certainly the cause of death though ill run the toxin tests in a moment her neck was broken see here on the scanner where the spinal cord was severed then the bones twisted back into alignment karal alex miles motioned them up to witness they came reluctantly could this have been accidental said miles very remotely possible the realignment had to be deliberate though would it have taken long seconds only death was immediate how much physical strength was required a big mans or oh not much at all any adult could have done it easily any sufficiently motivated adult miless stomach churned at the mental picture deas words conjured up the little fuzzy head would easily fit under a mans hand the twist the muffled cartilagenous crackif there was one thing miles knew by heart it was the exact tactile sensation of breaking bone oh yes motivation said dea is not my department he paused i might note a careful external examination could have found this mine did an experienced layman his eye fell cool on karal paying attention to what he was doing should not have missed it miles too stared at karal waiting overlain hissed harra her voice was ragged with scorn mlord said karal carefully its true i suspected the possibility suspected hell you knew but i feltand still feel strongly his eye flashed a wary defiance that only more grief would come from a fuss there was nothing i could do to help the baby at that point my duties are to the living so are mine speaker karal as for example my duty to the next small imperial subject in mortal danger from those who should be his or her protectors for the grave fault of being miles flashed an edged smile physically different in count vorkosigans view this is not just a case this is a test case fulcrum of a thousand cases fuss he hissed the sibilant harra rocked to the rhythm of his voice you havent begun to see fuss yet karal subsided as if folded there followed an hour of messiness yielding mainly negative data no other bones were broken the infants lungs were clear her gut and bloodstream free of toxins except those of natural decomposition her brain held no secret tumors the defect for which she had died did not extend to spina bifida dea reported fairly simple plastic surgery would indeed have corrected the cats mouth could she somehow have won access to it miles wondered what comfort this confirmation was to harra cold at best dea put his puzzle back together and harra rewrapped the tiny body in intricate meaningful folds dea cleaned his tools and placed them in their cases and washed his hands and arms and face thoroughly in the stream for rather a longer time than needed for just hygiene miles thought while the gorilla reburied the box harra made a little bowl in the dirt atop the grave and piled in some twigs and bark scraps and a sawedoff strand of her lank hair miles caught short felt in his pockets i have no offering on me that will burn he said apologetically harra glanced up surprised at even the implied offer no matter mlord her little pile of scraps flared briefly and went out like her infant rainas life but it does matter thought miles peace to you small lady after our rude invasions i will give you a better sacrifice i swear by my word as vorkosigan and the smoke of that burning will rise and be seen from one end of these mountains to the other miles charged karal and alex straightly with producing lem csurik and gave harra csurik a ride home up behind him on fat ninny pym accompanied them they passed a few scattered cabins on the way at one a couple of grubby children playing in the yard loped alongside the horses giggling and making hex signs at miles egging each other on to bolder displays until their mother spotted them and ran out and hustled them indoors with a fearful look over her shoulder in a weird way it was almost relaxing to miles the welcome hed expected not like karals and alexs strained selfconscious careful notnoticing rainas life would not have been an easy one harras cabin was at the head of a long draw just before it narrowed into a ravine it seemed very quiet and isolated in the dappled shade are you sure you wouldnt rather go stay with your mother asked miles dubiously harra shook her head she slid down off ninny and miles and pym dismounted and followed her in the cabin was of standard design a single room with a fieldstone fireplace and a wide roofed front porch water apparently came from the rivulet in the ravine pym held up a hand and entered first behind harra his hand on his stunner if lem csurik had run might he have run home first pym had been making scanner checks of perfectly innocent clumps of bushes all the way here the cabin was deserted although not long deserted it did not have the lingering dusty silence one would expect of eight days mournful disoccupation the remains of a few hasty meals sat on the sinkboard the bed was sleptin rumpled and unmade a few mans garments were scattered about automatically harra began to move about the room straightening it up reasserting her presence her existence her worth if she could not control the events of her life at least she might control one small room the one untouched item was a cradle that sat beside the bed little blankets neatly folded harra had fled for vorkosigan surleau just a few hours after the burial miles wandered about the room checking the view from the windows will you show me where you went to get your brillberries harra she led them up the ravine miles timed the hike pym divided his attention unhappily between the brush and miles alert to catch any bonebreaking stumble after flinching away from about three aborted protective grabs miles was ready to tell him to go climb a tree still there was a certain understandable selfinterest at work here if miles broke a leg it would be pym whod be stuck with carrying him out the brillberry patch was nearly a kilometer up the ravine miles plucked a few seedy red berries and ate them absently looking around while harra and pym waited respectfully afternoon sun slanted through green and brown leaves but the bottom of the ravine was already grey and cool with premature twilight the brillberry vines clung to the rocks and hung down invitingly luring one to risk ones neck reaching miles resisted their weedy temptations not being all that fond of brillberries if someone called out from your cabin you couldnt hear them up here could you remarked miles no mlord about how long did you spend picking about harra shrugged a basketful the woman didnt own a chrono an hour say and a twentyminute climb each way about a two hour time window that morning your cabin was not locked just a latch mlord hm method motive and opportunity the district magistrates procedural had emphasized damn the method was established and almost anybody could have used it the opportunity angle it appeared was just as bad anyone at all could have walked up to that cabin done the deed and departed unseen and unheard it was much too late for an aura detector to be of use tracing the shining ghosts of movements in and out of that room even if miles had brought one facts hah they were back to motive the murky workings of mens minds anybodys guess miles had as per the instructions in the district magistrates procedural been striving to keep an open mind about the accused but it was getting harder and harder to resist harras assertions shed been proved right about everything so far they left harra reinstalled in her little home going through the motions of order and the normal routine of life as if they could somehow recreate it like an act of sympathetic magic are you sure youll be all right miles asked gathering fat ninnys reins and settling himself in the saddle i cant help but think that if your husbands in the area he could show up here you say nothings been taken so its unlikely hes been here and gone before we arrived do you want someone to stay with you no mlord she hugged her broom on the porch id id like to be alone for a while well all right ill ah send you a message if anything important happens thank you mlord her tone was unpressing she really did want to be left alone miles took the hint at a wide place in the trail back to speaker karals pym and miles rode stirrup to stirrup pym was still painfully on the alert for boogies in the bushes my lord may i suggest that your next logical step be to draft all the ablebodied men in the community for a hunt for this csurik beyond doubt youve established that the infanticide was a murder interesting turn of phrase miles thought dryly even pym doesnt find it redundant oh my poor barrayar it seems reasonable at first glance sergeant pym but has it occurred to you that half the ablebodied men in this community are probably relatives of lem csuriks it might have a psychological effect create enough disruption and perhaps someone would turn him in just to get it over with hm possibly assuming he hasnt already left the area he could have been halfway to the coast before we were done at the autopsy only if he had access to transport pym glanced at the empty sky for all we know one of his subcousins had a rickety lightflyer in a shed somewhere but hes never been out of silvy vale im not sure hed know how to run where to go well if he has left the district its a problem for imperial civil security and im off the hook happy thought butone of the things that bothers me a lot are the inconsistencies in the picture im getting of our chief suspect have you noticed them cant say as i have mlord hm where did karal take you by the way to arrest this guy to a wild area rough scrub and gullies half a dozen men were out searching for harra theyd just called off their search and were on their way back when we met up with them by which i concluded our arrival was no surprise had csurik actually been there and fled or was karal just ringleading you in a circle i think hed actually been there mlord the men claimed not but as you point out they were relatives and besides they did not ah lie well they were tense karal may begrudge you his cooperation but i dont think hell quite dare disobey your direct orders he is a twentyyear man after all like pym himself miles thought count vorkosigans personal guard was legally limited to a ceremonial twenty men but given his political position their function included very practical security pym was typical of their number a decorated veteran of the imperial service who had retired to this elite private force it was not pyms fault that when he had joined he had stepped into a dead mans shoes replacing the late sergeant bothari did anyone in the universe besides himself miss the deadly and difficult bothari miles wondered sadly id like to question karal under fastpenta said miles morosely he displays every sign of being a man who knows where the bodys buried why dont you then asked pym logically i may come to that there is however a certain unavoidable degradation in a fastpenta interrogation if the mans loyal it may not be in our best longrange interest to shame him publicly it wouldnt be in public no but he would remember being turned into a drooling idiot i need more information pym glanced back over his shoulder i thought you had all the information by now i have facts physical facts a great big pile ofmeaningless useless facts miles brooded if i have to fastpenta every backbeyonder in silvy vale to get to the bottom of this i will but its not an elegant solution its not an elegant problem mlord said pym dryly they returned to find speaker karals wife back and in full possession of her home she was running in frantic circles chopping beating kneading stoking and flying upstairs to change the bedding on the three pallets driving her three sons before her to fetch and run and carry dr dea bemused was following her about trying to slow her down explaining that they had brought their own tent and food thank you and that her hospitality was not required this produced a most indignant response from ma karal my lords own son come to my house and i to turn him out in the fields like his horse id be ashamed and she returned to her work she seems rather distraught said dea looking over his shoulder miles took him by the elbow and propelled him out onto the porch just get out of her way doctor were doomed to be entertained its an obligation on both sides the polite thing to do is sort of pretend were not here till shes ready for us dea lowered his voice it might be better in light of the circumstances if we were to eat only our packaged food the chatter of a chopping knife and a scent of herbs and onions wafted enticingly through the open window oh i would imagine anything out of the common pot would be all right wouldnt you said miles if anything really worries you you can wisk it off and check it i suppose butdiscreetly eh we dont want to insult anyone they settled themselves in the homemade wooden chairs and were promptly served tea again by a boy draftee of ten karals youngest he had apparently already received private instructions in manners from one or the other of his parents for his response to miless deformities was the same flickering covert notnoticing as the adults not quite as smoothly carried off will you be sleeping in my bed mlord he asked ma says we got to sleep on the porch well whatever your ma says goes said miles ah do you like sleeping on the porch naw last time zed kicked me and i rolled off in the dark oh well perhaps if were to displace you you would care to sleep in our tent by way of trade the boys eyes widened really certainly why not waitll i tell zed he danced down the steps and shot away around the side of the house zed hey zed i suppose said dea we can fumigate it later miless lips twitched theyre no grubbier than you were at the same age surely or than i was when i was permitted the late afternoon was warm miles took off his green tunic and hung it on the back of his chair and unbuttoned the round collar of his cream shirt deas brows rose are we keeping shopmans hours then mlord on this investigation calling it quits for the day not exactly miles sipped tea thoughtfully gazing out across the yard the trees and treetops fell away down to the bottom of this feeder valley mixed scrub climbed the other side of the slope a crested fold then the long flanks of a backbone mountain beyond rose high and harsh to a summit still flecked with dwindling dirty patches of snow theres still a murderer loose out there somewhere dea pointed out helpfully you sound like pym pym miles noted had finished with their horses and was taking his scanner for another walk im waiting what for not sure the piece of information that will make sense of all this look theres only two possibilities csuriks either innocent or hes guilty if hes guilty hes not going to turn himself in hell certainly involve his relations hiding and helping him i can call in reinforcements by comm link from imperial civil security in hassadar if i want to any time twenty men plus equipment here by aircar in a couple of hours create a circus brutal ugly disruptive excitingcould be quite popular a manhunt with blood at the end of course theres also the possibility that csuriks innocent but scared in which case yes in which case theres still a murderer out there miles drank more tea i merely note if you want to catch something running after it isnt always the best way dea cleared his throat and drank his tea too in the meantime i have another duty to carry out im here to be seen if your scientific spirit is yearning for something to do to wile away the hours try keeping count of the number of vorwatchers that turn up tonight miless predicted parade began almost immediately it was mainly women at first bearing gifts as to a funeral in the absence of a comm link system miles wasnt sure by what telepathy they managed to communicate with each other but they brought covered dishes of food flowers extra bedding and offers of assistance they were all introduced to miles with nervous curtseys but seldom lingered to chat apparently a look was all their curiosity desired ma karal was polite but made it clear that she had the situation well in hand and set their culinary offerings well back of her own some of the women had children in tow most of these were sent to play in the woods in back but a small party of whispering boys sneaked back around the cabin to peek up over the rim of the porch at miles miles had obligingly remained on the porch with dea remarking that it was a better view without saying for whom for a few moments miles pretended not to notice his audience restraining pym with a hand signal from running them off yes look well look your fill thought miles what you see is what you re going to get for the rest of your lives or at any rate mine get used to it then he caught zed karals whisper as selfappointed tour guide to his cohortthat big ones the one thats come to kill lem csurik zed said miles there was an abrupt frozen silence from under the edge of the porch even the animal rustlings stopped come here said miles to a muted background of dismayed whispers and nervous giggles karals middle boy slouched warily up on to the porch you three miless pointing finger caught them in midflight wait there pym added his frown for emphasis and zeds friends stood paralyzed eyes wide heads lined up at the level of the porch floor as if stuck up on some ancient battlement as a warning to kindred malefactors what did you just say to your friends zed asked miles quietly repeat it zed licked his lips i jus said youd come to kill lem csurik lord zed was clearly now wondering if miless murderous intent included obnoxious and disrespectful boys as well that is not true zed that is a dangerous lie zed looked bewildered but dasaid it what is true is that ive come to catch the person who killed lem csuriks baby daughter that may be lem but it may not do you understand the difference but harra said lem did it and she ought to know hes her husband and all the babys neck was broken by someone harra thinks lem but she didnt see it happen what you and your friends here have to understand is that i wont make a mistake i cant condemn the wrong person my own truth drugs wont let me lem csurik has only to come here and tell me the truth to clear himself if he didnt do it but suppose he did what should i do with a man who would kill a baby zed zed shuffled well she was only a mutie then shut his mouth and reddened notlooking at miles it was perhaps a bit much to ask a twelveyearold boy to take an interest in any baby let alone a mutie one no dammit it wasnt too much but how to get a hook into that prickly defensive surface and if miles couldnt even convince one surly twelveyearold how was he to magically transmute a whole district of adults a rush of despair made him suddenly want to rage these people were so bloody impossible he checked his temper firmly your da was a twentyyear man zed are you proud that he served the emperor yes lord zeds eyes sought escape trapped by these terrible adults miles forged on well these practicesmutiekillingshame the emperor when he stands for barrayar before the galaxy ive been out there i know they call us all savages for the crimes of a few it shames the count my father before his peers and silvy vale before the district a soldier gets honor by killing an armed enemy not a baby this matter touches my honor as a vorkosigan zed besides miless lips drew back on a mirthless grin and he leaned forward intently in his chairzed recoiled as much as he daredyou will all be astonished at whatonly a mutie can do that i have sworn on my grandfathers grave zed looked more suppressed than enlightened his slouch now almost a crouch miles slumped back in his chair and released him with a weary wave of his hand go play boy zed needed no urging he and his companions shot away around the house as though released from springs miles drummed his fingers on the chair arm frowning into the silence that neither pym nor dea dared break these hillfolk are ignorant lord offered pym after a moment these hillfolk are mine pym their ignorance is a shame upon my house miles brooded how had this whole mess become his anyway he hadnt created it historically hed only just got here himself their continued ignorance anyway he amended in fairness it still made a burden like a mountain is the message so complex so difficult you dont have to kill your children anymore its not like were asking them all to learnspace navigational math that had been the plague of miless last academy semester its not easy for them shrugged dea its easy for the central authorities to make the rules but these people have to live every minute of the consequences they have so little and the new rules force them to give their margin to marginal people who cant pay back the old ways were wise in the old days even now you have to wonder how many premature reforms we can afford trying to ape the galactics and whats your definition of a marginal person dea but the margin is growing miles said aloud places like this arent up against famine every winter any more theyre not isolated in their disasters relief can get from one district to another under the imperial seal were all getting more connected just as fast as we can besides miles paused and added rather weakly perhaps you underestimate them deas brows rose ironically pym strolled the length of the porch running his scanner in yet another pass over the surrounding scrubland miles turning in his chair to pursue his cooling teacup caught a slight movement a flash of eyes behind the casementhung front window swung open to the summer airma karal standing frozen listening for how long since hed called her boy zed miles guessed arresting her attention she raised her chin as his eyes met hers sniffed and shook out the cloth shed been holding with a snap they exchanged a nod she turned back to her work before dea watching pym noticed her karal and alex returned understandably around suppertime i have six men out searching karal reported cautiously to miles on the porch now well on its way to becoming miless official hq clearly karal had covered ground since midafternoon his face was sweaty lined with physical as well as the underlying emotional strain but i think lems gone into the scrub it could take days to smoke him out theres hundreds of places to lie low out there karal ought to know you dont think hes gone to some relatives asked miles surely if he intends to evade us for long he has to take a chance on resupply on information will they turn him in when he surfaces its hard to say karal turned his hand palmout its a hard problem for em mlord hm how long would lem csurik hang around out there in the scrub anyway his whole lifehis blowntobits lifewas all here in silvy vale miles considered the contrast a few weeks ago csurik had been a young man with everything going for him a home a wife a family on the way happiness by silvy vale standards comfort and security his cabin miles had not failed to note though simple had been kept with love and energy and so redeemed from the potential squalor of its poverty grimmer in the winter to be sure now csurik was a hunted fugitive all the little he had torn away in the twinkling of an eye with nothing to hold him would he run away and keep running with nothing to run to would he linger near the ruins of his life the police force available to miles a few hours way in hassadar was an itch in his mind was it not time to call them in before he fumbled this into a worse mess but if he were meant to solve this by a show of force why hadnt the count let him come by aircar on the first day miles regretted that twoandahalfday ride it had sapped his forward momentum slowed him down to silvy vales walking pace tangled him with time to doubt had the count foreseen it what did he know that miles didnt what could he know dammit this test didnt need to be made harder by artificial stumbling blocks it was bad enough all on its own he wants me to be clever miles thought morosely worse he wants me to be seen to be clever by everyone here he prayed he was not about to be spectacularly stupid instead very well speaker karal youve done all you can for today knock off for the night call your men off too youre not likely to find anything in the dark pym held up his scanner clearly about to volunteer its use but miles waved him down pyms brows rose editorially miles shook his head slightly karal needed no further urging he dispatched alex to call off the night search with torches he remained wary of miles perhaps miles puzzled him as much as he puzzled miles dourly miles hoped so miles was not sure at what point the long summer evening segued into a party after supper the men began to drift in karals cronies silvy vales elders some were apparently regulars who shared the evening government news broadcasts on karals audio set too many names and miles darent forget a one a group of amateur musicians arrived with their homemade mountain instruments rather breathless obviously the band tapped for all the major weddings and wakes in silvy vale this all seemed more like a funeral to miles every minute the musicians stood in the middle of the yard and played miless porchhq now became his aristocratic box seat it was hard to get involved with the music when the audience was all so intently watching him some songs were serious somerather carefully at first funny miless spontaneity was frequently frozen in midlaugh by a faint sigh of relief from those around him his stiffening froze them in turn selfstymied like two people trying to dodge each other in a corridor but one song was so hauntingly beautifula lament for lost love that miles was struck to the heart elena in that moment old pain transformed to melancholy sweet and distant a sort of healing or at least the realization that a healing had taken place unwatched he almost had the singers stop there while they were perfect but feared they might think him displeased but he remained quiet and inward for a time afterward scarcely hearing their next offering in the gathering twilight at least the piles of food that had arrived all afternoon were thus accounted for miles had been afraid ma karal and her cronies had expected him to get around that culinary mountain all by himself at one point miles leaned on the rail and glanced down the yard to see fat ninny at tether making more friends a whole flock of pubescent girls were clustered around him petting him brushing his fetlocks braiding flowers and ribbons in his mane and tail feeding him tidbits or just resting their cheeks against his warm silky side ninnys eyes were halfclosed in smug content god thought miles jealously if i had half the sexappeal of that bloody horse id have more girlfriends than my cousin ivan miles considered very briefly the pros and cons of making a play for some unattached female the striding lords of old and all that no there were some kinds of stupid he didnt have to be and that was definitely one of them the service he had already sworn to one small lady of silvy vale was surely all he could bear without breaking he could feel the strain of it all around him now like a dangerous pressure in his bones he turned to find speaker karal presenting a woman to him far from pubescent she was perhaps fifty lean and little workworn she was carefully clothed in an aging bestdress her greying hair combed back and bound at the nape of her neck she bit at her lips and cheeks in quick tense motions halfsuppressed in her selfconsciousness s ma csurik mlord lems mother speaker karal ducked his head and backed away abandoning miles without aid or mercy come back you coward maam miles said his throat was dry karal had set him up dammit a public playno the other guests were retreating out of earshot too most of them mlord said ma csurik she managed a nervous curtsey uh do sit down with a ruthless jerk of his chin miles evicted dr dea from his chair and motioned the hill woman into it he turned his own chair to face hers pym stood behind them silent as a statue tight as a wire did he imagine the old woman was about to whip a needlerpistol from her skirts noit was pyms job to imagine things like that for miles so that miles might free his whole mind for the problem at hand pym was almost as much an object of study as miles himself wisely hed been holding himself apart and would doubtless continue to do so till the dirty work was over mlord said ma csurik again and stumbled again to silence miles could only wait he prayed she wasnt about to come unglued and weep on his knees or some damn thing this was excruciating stay strong woman he urged silently lem he she swallowed im sure he didnt kill the babe theres never been any of that in our family i swear it he says he didnt and i believe him good said miles affably let him come say the same thing to me under fastpenta and ill believe him too come away ma urged a lean young man who had accompanied her and now stood waiting by the steps as if ready to bolt into the dark at a motion its no good cant you see he glowered at miles she shot the boy a quelling frownanother of her five sonsand turned back more urgently to miles groping for words my lem hes only twenty lord im only twenty ma csurik miles felt compelled to point out there was another brief impasse look ill say it again miles burst out impatiently and again and again till the message penetrates all the way back to its intended recipient i cannot condemn an innocent person my truth drugs wont let me lem can clear himself he has only to come in tell him will you please she went stony guarded i havent seen him mlord but you might she tossed her head so i might not her eyes shifted to pym and away as if the sight of him burned the silver vorkosigan logos embroidered on pyms collar gleamed in the twilight like animal eyes moving only with his breathing karal was now bringing lighted lamps onto the porch but keeping his distance still maam said miles tightly the count my father has ordered me to investigate the murder of your granddaughter if your son means so much to you how can his child mean so little was she your first grandchild her face was sere no lord lems older sister she has two theyre all right she added with emphasis miles sighed if you truly believe your son is innocent of this crime you must help me prove it ordo you doubt she shifted uneasily there was doubt in her eyesshe didnt know blast it fastpenta would be useless on her for sure as miless magic wonder drug much countedupon fastpenta seemed to be having wonderfully little utility in this case so far come away ma the young man urged again its no good the mutie lord came up here for a killing they have to have one its a show damn straight thought miles acidly he was a perceptive young lunk that one ma csurik let herself be persuaded away by her angry and embarrassed son plucking at her arm she paused on the steps though and shot bitterly over her shoulder its all so easy for you isnt it my head hurts thought miles there was worse to come before the evening ended the new womans voice was grating low and angry dont you talk down to me serg karal i got a right for one good look at this mutie lord she was tall and stringy and tough like her daughter miles thought she had made no attempt to freshen up a faint reek of summer sweat hung about her working dress and how far had she walked her grey hair hung in a switch down her back a few strands escaping the tie if ma csuriks bitterness had been a stabbing pain behind the eyes this ones rage was a wringing knot in the gut she shook off karals attempted restraint and stalked up to miles in the lamplight so uh this is ma mattulich mlord karal introduced her harras mother miles rose to his feet managed a short formal nod how do you do madam he was very conscious of being a head shorter she had once been of a height with harra miles estimated but her aging bones were beginning to pull her down she merely stared she was a gumleaf chewer by the faint blackish stains around her mouth her jaw worked now on some small bit tiny chomps grinding too hard she studied him openly without subterfuge or the least hint of apology taking in his head his neck his back his short and crooked legs miles had the unpleasant illusion that she saw right through to all the healed cracks in his brittle bones as well miless chin jerked up twice in the twitchy nervousinvoluntary tic that he was sure made him look spastic before he controlled it with an effort all right said karal roughly youve seen now come away for gods sake mara his hand opened in apology to miles mara shes been pretty distraught over all this mlord forgive her your only grandchild said miles to her in an effort to be kind though her peculiar anguish repelled kindness with a scraped and bleeding scorn i understand your distress maam but there will be justice for little raina that i have sworn how can there be justice now she raged thick and low its too latea world too latefor justice mutie lordling what use do i have for your damned justice now enough mara karal insisted his brows drew down and his lips thinned and he forced her away and escorted her firmly off his porch the last lingering remnant of visitors parted for her with an air of respectful mercy except for two lean teenagers hanging on the fringes who drew away as if avoiding poison miles was forced to revise his mental image of the brothers csurik if those two were another sample there was no team of huge menacing hill hulks after all they were a team of little skinny menacing hill squirts instead not really an improvement they looked like they could move as fast as striking ferrets if they had to miless lips curled in frustration the evenings entertainments ended finally thank god close to midnight karals last cronies marched off into the woods by lantern light the repaired and repowered audio set was carried off by its owner with many thanks to karal fortunately it had been a mature and sober crowd even somber no drunken brawls or anything pym got the karal boys settled in the tent took a last patrol around the cabin and joined miles and dea in the loft the pallets stuffing had been spiked with fresh scented native herbs to which miles hoped devoutly he was not allergic ma karal had wanted to turn her own bedroom over to miless exclusive lordly use exiling herself and her husband to the porch too but fortunately pym had been able to persuade her that putting miles in the loft flanked by dea and himself was to be preferred from a security standpoint dea and pym were soon snoring but sleep eluded miles he tossed on his pallet as he turned his ploys of the day such as they had been over and over in his mind was he being too slow too careful too conservative this wasnt exactly good assault tactics surprise with a superior force the view hed gained of the terrain from karals porch tonight had been ambiguous at best on the other hand it did no good to charge off across a swamp as his fellow cadet and cousin ivan vorpatril had demonstrated so memorably once on summer maneuvers it had taken a heavy hovercab with a crane to crank the six big strong healthy fully fieldequipped young men of ivans patrol out of the chesthigh gooey black mud ivan had got his revenge simultaneously though when the cadet sniper they had been attacking fell out of his tree and broke his arm while laughing hysterically as they sank slowly and beautifully into the ooze ooze that a little guy with his laser rifle wrapped in his loincloth could swim across like a frog the war games umpire had ruled it a draw miles rubbed his forearm and grinned in memory and faded out at last miles awoke abruptly and without transition deep in the night with a sense of something wrong a faint orange glow shimmered in the blue darkness of the loft quietly so as not to disturb his sleeping companions he rose on his pallet and peered over the edge into the main room the glow was coming through the front window miles swung onto the ladder and padded downstairs for a look out doors pym he called softly pym shot awake with a snort mlord he said alarmed come down here quietly bring your stunner pym was by his side in seconds he slept in his trousers with his stunner holster and boots by his pillow what the hell pym muttered looking out too the glow was from fire a pitchy torch flung to the top of miless tent set up in the yard was burning quietly pym lurched toward the door then controlled his movements as the same realization came to him as had to miles theirs was a serviceissue tent and its combatrated synthetic fabric would neither melt nor burn miles wondered if the person whod heaved the torch had known that was this some arcane warning or a singularly inept attack if the tent had been ordinary fabric and miles in it the intended result might not have been trivial worse with karals boys in ita bursting blossom of flamemiles shuddered pym loosened his stunner in his holster and stood poised by the front door how long im not sure could have been burning like that for ten minutes before it woke me pym shook his head took a slight breath raised his scanner and vaulted into the firegilded darkness trouble mlord speaker karals anxious voice came from his bedroom door maybe wait miles halted him as he plunged for the door pyms running a patrol with a scanner and a stunner waitll he calls the allclear i think your boys may be safer inside the tent karal came up to the window caught his breath and swore pym returned in a few minutes theres no one within a kilometer now he reported shortly he helped karal take the goat bucket and douse the torch the boys who had slept through the fire woke at its quenching i think maybe it was a bad idea to lend them my tent said miles from the porch in a choked voice i am profoundly sorry speaker karal i didnt think this should never karal was spluttering with anger and delayed fright this should never have happened mlord i apologize for for silvy vale he turned helplessly peering into the darkness the night sky starflecked lovely was threatening now the boys once the facts penetrated their sleepiness thought it was all just great and wanted to return to the tent and lie in wait for the next assassin ma karal shrill and firm herded them indoors instead and made them bed down in the main room it was an hour before they stopped complaining at the injustice of it and went back to sleep miles keyed up nearly to the point of gibbering did not sleep at all he lay stiffly on his pallet listening to dea who slept breathing heavily and pym feigning sleep for courtesy and scarcely seeming to breathe at all miles was about to suggest to pym that they give up and go out on the porch for the rest of the night when the silence was shattered by a shrill squeal enormously loud painedged from outside the horses miles spasmed to his feet heart racing and beat pym to the ladder pym cut ahead of him by dropping straight over the side of the loft into an elastic crouch and beat him to the door there pyms trained bodyguards reflexes compelled him to try and thrust miles back inside miles almost bit him go dammit ive got a weapon pym good intentions frustrated swung out the cabin door with miles on his heels halfway down the yard they split to each side as a massive snorting shape loomed out of the darkness and nearly ran them down the sorrel mare loose again another squeal pierced the night from the lines where the horses were tethered ninny miles called panicked it was ninnys voice making those noises the like of which miles had not heard since the night a shed had burned down at vorkosigan surleau with a horse trapped inside ninny another grunting squeal and a thunk like someone splitting a watermelon with a mallet pym staggered back inhaling with difficulty a resonant deep stutter and tripped to the ground where he lay curled up around himself not killed outright apparently because between gasps he was managing to swear lividly miles dropped to the ground beside him checked his skullno thank god it had been pyms chest ninnys hoof had hit with that alarming sound the bodyguard only had the wind knocked out of him maybe a cracked rib miles more sensibly ran around to the front of the horse lines ninny fat ninny was jerking his head against his rope attempting to rear he squealed again his whiterimmed eyes gleaming in the darkness miles ran to his head ninny boy what is it his left hand slid up the rope to ninnys halter his right stretched to stroke ninnys shoulder soothingly fat ninny flinched but stopped trying to rear and stood trembling the horse shook his head miless face and chest were suddenly spattered with something hot and dark and sticky dea miles yelled dea nobody slept through this uproar six people tumbled off the porch and down the yard and not one of them thought to bring a light no the brilliant flare of a cold light sprang from between dr deas fingers and ma karal was struggling even now to light a lantern dea get that damn light over here miles demanded and stopped to choke his voice back down an octave to its usual carefullycultivated deeper register dea galloped up and thrust the light toward miles then gasped his face draining my lord are you shot in the flare the dark liquid soaking miless shirt glowed suddenly scarlet not me miles said looking down at his chest in horror a flash of memory turned his stomach over cold at the vision of another bloodsoaked death that of the late sergeant bothari whom pym had replaced would never replace dea spun pym hes all right said miles a long inhaling wheeze rose from the grass a few meters off the exhalation punctuated with obscenities but he got kicked by the horse get your medkit miles peeled deas fingers off the cold light and dea dashed back to the cabin miles held the light up to ninny and swore in a sick whisper a huge cut a third of a meter long and of unknown depth scored ninnys glossy neck blood soaked his coat and runneled down his foreleg miless fingers touched the wound fearfully his hands spread on either side trying to push it closed but the horses skin was elastic and it pulled apart and bled profusely as fat ninny shook his head in pain miles grabbed the horses nosehold still boy somebody had been going for ninnys jugular and had almost made it ninnytame petted friendly trusting ninnywould not have moved from the touch until the knife bit deep karal was helping pym to his feet as dr dea returned miles waited while dea checked pym over then called here dea zed looking quite as horrified as miles helped to hold ninnys head as dea made inspection of the cut i took tests dea complained sotto voce as he worked i beat out twentysix other applicants for the honor of becoming the prime ministers personal physician i have practiced the procedures of seventy separate possible medical emergencies from coronary thrombosis to attempted assassination nobodynobody told me my duties would include sewing up a damned horses neck in the middle of the night in the middle of a howling wilderness but he kept working as he complained so miles didnt quash him but kept gently petting ninnys nose and hypnotically rubbing the hidden pattern of his muscles to soothe and still him at last ninny relaxed enough to rest his slobbery chin on miless shoulder do horses get anesthetics asked dea plaintively holding his medical stunner as if not sure just what to do with it this one does said miles stoutly you treat him just like a person dea this is the last animal that the count my grandfather personally trained he named him i watched him get born we trained him together grandfather had me pick him up and hold him every day for a week after he was foaled till he got too big horses are creatures of habit grandfather said and take first impressions to heart forever after ninny thought i was bigger than he was dea sighed and made busy with anesthetic stun cleansing solution antibiotics muscle relaxants and biotic glue with a surgeons touch he shaved the edges of the cut and placed the reinforcing net zed held the light anxiously the cut is clean said dea but it will undergo a lot of flexingi dont suppose it can very well be immobilized in this position no hardly this should do if he were a human id tell him to rest at this point hell be rested miles promised firmly will he be all right now i suppose so how the devil should i know dea looked highly aggrieved but his hand sneaked out to recheck his repairs general piotr miles assured him would have been very pleased with your work miles could hear him in his head now snorting damned technocrats nothing but horse doctors with a more expensive set of toys grandfather would have loved being proved right you ah never met my grandfather did you before my time my lord said dea ive studied his life and campaigns of course of course pym had a handlight now and was limping with karal in a slow spiral around the horse lines inspecting the ground karals eldest boy had recaptured the sorrel mare and brought her back and retethered her her tether had been torn loose not cut had the mysterious attackers choice of equine victim been random or calculated how calculated was ninny attacked as a mere symbol of his master or had the person known how passionately miles loved the animal was this vandalism a political statement or an act of preciselydirected subtle cruelty what have i ever done to you miless thought howled silently to the surrounding darkness they got away whoever it was pym reported out of scanner range before i could breathe again my apologies mlord they dont seem to have dropped anything on the ground there had to have been a knife at least a knife its haft gory with horse blood in a pattern of perfect fingerprints would have been extremely convenient just now miles sighed ma karal drifted up and eyed deas medkit as he cleaned and repacked it all that she muttered under her breath for a horse miles refrained barely from leaping to a hot defense of the value of this particular horse how many people in silvy vale had ma karal seen suffer and die in her lifetime for lack of no more medical technology than what dea was carrying under his arm just now guarding his horse miles watched from the porch as dawn crept over the landscape he had changed his shirt and washed off pym was inside getting his ribs taped miles sat with his back to the wall and a stunner on his lap as the night mists slowly grew grey the valley was a grey blur fogshrouded the hills darker rolls of fog beyond directly overhead grey thinned to a paling blue the day would be fine and hot once the fog burned away it was surely time now to call out the troops from hassadar this was getting just too weird his bodyguard was half out of commission true it was miless horse that had rendered him so not the mystery attacker but just because the attacks hadnt been fatal didnt mean they hadnt been intended so perhaps a third attack would be brought off more expertly practice makes perfect miles felt unstrung with nervous exhaustion how had he let a mere horse become such a handle on his emotions bad that almost unbalancedyet ninnys was surely one of the truly innocent pure souls miles had ever known miles remembered the other innocent in the case then and shivered in the damp it was cruel lord something cruel pym was right the bushes could be crawling with csurik assassins right now dammit the bushes were crawlingover there a movement a damping wave of branch lashing in recoil fromwhat miless heart lurched in his chest he adjusted his stunner to full power slipped silently off the porch and began his stalk crouching low taking advantage of cover wherever the long grasses of the yard had not been trampled flat by the activities of the last day and night miles froze like a predatory cat as a shape seemed to coalesce out of the mist a lean young man not too tall dressed in the baggy trousers that seemed to be standard here stood wearily by the horse lines staring up the yard at karals cabin he stood so for a full two minutes without moving miles held a bead on him with his stunner if he dared make one move toward ninny the young man walked back and forth uncertainly then crouched on his heels still gazing up the yard he pulled something from the pocket of his loose jacketmiless finger tightened on the trigger but he only put it to his mouth and bit an apple the crunch carried clearly in the damp air and the faint perfume of its juices he ate about half then stopped seeming to have trouble swallowing miles checked the knife at his belt made sure it was loose in its sheath ninnys nostrils widened and he nickered hopefully drawing the young mans attention he rose and walked over to the horse the blood pulsed in miless ears louder than any other sound his grip on the stunner was damp and whiteknuckled the young man fed ninny his apple the horse chomped it down big jaw rippling under his skin then cocked his hip dangled one hind hoof and sighed hugely if he hadnt seen the man eat off the fruit first miles might have shot him on the spot it couldnt be poisoned the man made to pet ninnys neck then his hand drew back in startlement as he encountered deas dressing ninny shook his head uneasily miles rose slowly and stood waiting the man scratched ninnys ears instead looked up one last time at the cabin took a deep breath stepped forward saw miles and stood stock still lem csurik said miles a pause a frozen nod lord vorkosigan said the young man miles nodded in turn csurik swallowed vor lord he quavered do you keep your word what a bizarre opening miless brows climbed hell go with it yes are you coming in yes and no mlord which a bargain lord i must have a bargain and your word on it if you killed raina no lord i swear it i didnt then you have nothing to fear from me lem csuriks lips thinned what the devil could this hill man find ironic how dare he find irony in miless confusion irony but no amusement oh lord breathed csurik i wish that were so but i have to prove it to harra harra must believe meyou have to make her believe me lord you have to make me believe you first fortunately that isnt hard you come up to the cabin and make that same statement under fastpenta and i will rule you cleared csurik was shaking his head why not said miles patiently that csurik had turned up at all was strong circumstantial indication of his innocence unless he somehow imagined he could beat the drug miles would be patient for oh three or four seconds at least then by god hed stun him drag him inside tie him up till he came round and get to the bottom of this before breakfast the drugthey say you cant hold anything back it would be pretty useless if you could csurik stood silent a moment are you trying to conceal some lesser crime on your conscience is that the bargain you wish to strike an amnesty it might be possible if its short of another murder that is no lord ive never killed anybody then maybe we can deal because if youre innocent i need to know as soon as possible because it means my work isnt finished here thats thats the trouble mlord csurik shuffled then seemed to come to some internal decision and stood sturdily ill come in and risk your drug and ill answer anything about me you want to ask but you have to promiseswearyou wont ask me about about anything else anybody else do you know who killed your daughter not for sure csurik threw his head back defiantly i didnt see it i have guesses i have guesses too thats as may be lord just sos they dont come from my mouth thats all i ask miles bolstered his stunner and rubbed his chin hm a very slight smile turned one corner of his lip i admit it would be moreelegantto solve this case by reason and deduction than brute force even so tender a force as fastpenta csuriks head lowered i dont know elegant lord but i dont want it to be from my mouth decision bubbled up in miles straightening his spine yes he knew now he had only to run through the proofs step by chained step just like space math very well i swear by my word as vorkosigan i shall confine my questions to the facts to which you were an eyewitness i will not ask you for conjectures about persons or events for which you were not present there will that do csurik bit his lip yes lord if you keep your word try me suggested miles his lips wrinkled back on a vulpine smile absorbing the implied insult without comment csurik climbed the yard beside miles as if to an executioners block their entrance created a tableau of astonishment among karal and his family clustered around their wooden table where dea was treating pym pym and dea looked rather blanker till miles made introduction dr dea get out your fastpenta heres lem csurik come to talk with us miles steered lem to a chair the hill man sat with his hands clenched pym a red and purpling bruise showing at the edges of the white tape circling his chest took up his stunner and stepped back dr dea muttered under his breath to miles as he got out the hypospray howd you do that miless hand brushed his pocket he pulled out a sugar cube and held it up and grinned through the c of his thumb and finger dea snorted but pursed his lips with reluctant respect lem flinched as the hypospray hissed on his arm as if he expected it to hurt count backwards from ten dea instructed by the time lena reached three he had relaxed at zero he giggled karal ma karal pym gather round said miles you are my witnesses boys stay back and stay quiet no interruptions please miles ran through the preliminaries half a dozen questions designed to set up a rhythm and kill time while the fastpenta took full effect lem csurik grinned foolishly lolling in his chair and answered them all with sunny good will fastpenta interrogation had been part of miless military intelligence course at the service academy the drug seemed to be working exactly as advertised oddly enough did you return to your cabin that morning after you spent the night at your parents yes mlord lem smiled about what time midmorning nobody here had a chrono that was probably as precise an answer as miles was likely to get what did you do when you got there called for harra she was gone though it frightened me that she was gone thought she mightve run out on me lem hiccoughed i want my harra later was the baby asleep she was she woke up when i called for harra started crying again it goes right up your spine what did you do then lems eyes widened i got no milk she wanted harra theres nothing i could do for her did you pick her up no lord i let her lay there was nothing i could do for her harra shed hardly let me touch her she was that nervous about her told me id drop her or something you didnt shake her to stop her screaming no lord i let her lay i left to look down the path for harra then where did you go lem blinked my sisters id promised to help haul wood for a new cabin bellamother sisteris getting married ysee and he was beginning to wander as was normal for this drug stop said miles lem fell silent obediently swaying slightly in his chair miles considered his next question carefully he was approaching the fine line here did you meet anyone on the path answer yes or no yes dea was getting excited who ask him who miles held up his hand you can administer the antagonist now dr dea arent you going to ask him it could be vital i cant i gave my word administer the antagonist now doctor fortunately the confusion of two interrogators stopped lems mumbled willing reply to deas question dea bewildered pressed his hypospray against lems arm lems eyes halfclosed snapped open within seconds he sat up straight and rubbed his arm and his face who did you meet on the path dea asked him directly lems lips pressed tight he looked for rescue to miles dea looked too why wont you ask him because i dont need to said miles i know precisely who lem met on the path and why he went on and not back it was rainas murderer as i shall shortly prove andwitness this karal ma karalthat information did not come from lems mouth confirm karal nodded slowly i see mlord that was very good of you miles gave him a direct stare his mouth set in a tight smile and when is a mystery no mystery at all karal reddened not replying for a moment then he said you may as well keep on like youre going mlord theres no stopping you now i suppose no miles sent runners to collect the witnesses ma karal in one direction zed in a second speaker karal and his eldest in a third he had lem wait with pym dea and himself having the shortest distance to cover ma karal arrived back first with ma csurik and two of her sons in tow his mother fell on lem embracing him and then looking fearfully over her shoulder at miles the younger brothers hung back but pym had already moved between them and the door its all right ma lem patted her on the back or anyway im all right im clear lord vorkosigan believes me she glowered at miles still holding lems arm you didnt let the mutie lord give you that poison drug did you not poison miles denied in fact the drug may have saved his life that damn near makes it a medicine id say however he turned toward lems two younger brothers and folded his arms sternly i would like to know which of you young morons threw the torch on my tent last night the younger one whitened the elder hotly indignant noticed his brothers expression and cut his denial off in midsyllable you didnt he hissed in horror nobody said the white one nobody did miles raised his eyebrows there followed a short choked silence well nobody can make his apologies to speaker and ma karal then said miles since it was their sons who were sleeping in the tent last night i and my men were in the loft the boys mouth opened in dismay the youngest karal stared at the pale csurik brother his agemate and whispered importantly you dono you idiot didnt ya know that tent wouldnt burn its real imperial service issue miles clasped his hands behind his back and fixed the csuriks with a cold eye rather more to the point it was attempted assassination upon your counts heir which carries the same capital charge of treason as an attempt upon the count himself or perhaps dono didnt think of that dono was thrown into flummoxed confusion no need for fastpenta here the kid couldnt carry off a lie worth a damn ma csurik now had hold of donos arm too without letting go of lems she looked as frantic as a hen with too many chicks trying to shelter them from a storm i wasnt trying to kill you lord cried dono what were you trying to do then youd come to kill lem i wanted to make you go away frighten you away i didnt think anyone would really get hurti mean it was only a tent youve never seen anything burn down i take it have you ma csurik lems mother nodded lips tight clearly torn between a desire to protect her son from miles and a desire to beat dono till he bled for his potentially lethal stupidity well but for a chance you could have killed or horribly injured three of your friends think on that please in the meantime in view of your youth and ah apparent mental defectiveness i shall hold the treason charge in return speaker karal and your parents shall be responsible for your good behavior in future and decide what punishment is appropriate ma csurik melted with relief and gratitude dono looked like hed rather have been shot his brother poked him and whispered mental defective ma csurik slapped the taunter on the side of his head suppressing him effectively what about your horse mlord asked pyrn i do not suspect them of the business with the horse miles replied slowly the attempt to fire the tent was plain stupidity the other was a different order of calculation altogether zed who had been permitted to take pyms horse returned then with harra up behind him harra entered speaker karals cabin saw lem and stopped with a bitter glare lem stood openhanded his eyes wounded before her so lord harra said you caught him her jaw was clenched in joyless triumph not exactly said miles he came here and turned himself in hes made his statement under fastpenta and cleared himself lem did not kill raina harra turned from side to side but i saw hed been there hed left his jacket and took his good saw and wood planer away with him i knew hed been back while i was out there must be something wrong with your drug miles shook his head the drug worked fine your deduction was correct as far as it went lem did visit the cabin while you were out but when he left raina was still alive crying vigorously it wasnt lem she swayed who then i think you know i think youve been working very hard to deny that knowledge hence your excessive focus on lem as long as you were sure it was lem you didnt have to think about the other possibilities but who else would care harra cried who else would bother who indeed sighed miles he walked to the front window and glanced down the yard the fog was clearing in the full light of morning the horses were moving uneasily dr dea would you please get a second dose of fastpenta ready miles turned paced back to stand before the fireplace its coals still banked for the night the faint heat was pleasant on his back dea was staring around the hypospray in his hand clearly wondering to whom to administer it my lord he queried brows lowering in demand for explanation isnt it obvious to you doctor miles asked lightly no my lord his tone was slightly indignant nor to you pym not entirely mlord pyms glance and stunner aim wavered uncertainly to harra i suppose its because neither of you ever met my grandfather miles decided he died just about a year before you entered my fathers service pym he was born at the very end of the time of isolation and lived through every wrenching change this century has dealt to barrayar he was called the last of the old vor but really he was the first of the new he changed with the times from the tactics of horse cavalry to that of flyer squadrons from swords to atomics and he changed successfully our present freedom from the cetagandan occupation is a measure of how fiercely he could adapt then throw it all away and adapt again at the end of his life he was called a conservative only because so much of barrayar had streamed past him in the direction he had led prodded pushed and pointed all his life he changed and adapted and bent with the wind of the times then in his agefor my father was his youngest and sole surviving son and did not himself marry till middleagein his age he was hit with me and he had to change again and he couldnt he begged for my mother to have an abortion after they knew more or less what the fetal damage would be he and my parents were estranged for five years after i was born they didnt see each other or speak or communicate everyone thought my father moved us to the imperial residence when he became regent because he was angling for the throne but in fact it was because the count my grandfather denied him the use of vorkosigan house arent family squabbles jolly fun bleeding ulcers run in my family we give them to each other miles strolled back to the window and looked out ah yes here it came the reconciliation was gradual when it became quite clear there would be no other son miles went on no dramatic denouement it helped when the medics got me walking it was essential that i tested out bright most important of all i never let him see me give up nobody had dared interrupt this lordly monologue but it was clear from several expressions that the point of it was escaping them since half the point was to kill time miles was not greatly disturbed by their failure to track footsteps sounded on the wooden porch outside pym moved quietly to cover the door with an unobscured angle of fire dr dea said miles sighting through the window would you be so kind as to administer that fastpenta to the first person through the door as they step in youre not waiting for a volunteer my lord not this time the door swung inward and dea stepped forward raising his hand the hypospray hissed ma mattulich wheeled to face dea the skirts of her work dress swirling around her veined calves hissing in returnyou dare her arm drew back as if to strike him but slowed in midswing and failed to connect as dea ducked out of her way this unbalanced her and she staggered speaker karal coming in behind caught her by the arm and steadied her you dare she wailed again then turned to see not only dea but all the other witnesses waiting ma csurik ma karal lern harra pym her shoulders sagged and then the drug cut in and she just stood a silly smile fighting with anguish for possession of her harsh face the smile made miles ill but it was the smile he needed sit her down dea speaker karal they guided her to the chair lately vacated by lem csurik she was fighting the drug desperately flashes of resistance melting into flaccid docility gradually the docility became ascendant and she sat draped in the chair grinning helplessly miles sneaked a peek at harra she stood white and silent utterly closed for several years after the reconciliation miles had never been left with his grandfather without his personal bodyguard sergeant bothari had worn the counts livery but been loyal to miles alone the one man dangerous enoughsome said crazy enoughto stand up to the great general himself there was no need miles decided to spell out to these fascinated people just what interrupted incident had made his parents think sergeant bothari a necessary precaution let general piotrs untarnished reputation servemiles now as he willed miless eyes glinted lem lowered his head if i had knownif i had guessedi wouldnt have left them alone together mlord i thoughtharras mother would take care of her i couldnt havei didnt know how harra did not look at him harra did not look at anything let us conclude this miles sighed again he requested formal witness from the crowd in the room and cautioned against interruptions which tended to unduly confuse a drugged subject he moistened his lips and turned to ma mattulich again he began with the standard neutral questions name birthdate parents names checkable biographical facts ma mattulich was harder to lull than the cooperative lem had been her responses scattered and staccato miles controlled his impatience with difficulty for all its deceptive ease fastpenta interrogation required skill skill and patience hed got too far to risk a stumble now he worked his questions up gradually to the first critical ones were you there when raina was born her voice was low and drifting dreamy the birth came in the night lem he went for jean the midwife the midwifes son was supposed to go for me but he fell back to sleep i didnt get there till morning and then it was too late theyd all seen seen what the cats mouth the dirty mutation monsters in us cut them out ugly little man this last miles realized was an aside upon himself her attention had hung up on him hypnotically muties make more muties they breed faster overrun i saw you watching the girls you want to make mutie babies on clean women poison us all time to steer her back to the main issue were you ever alone with the baby after that no jean she hung around jean knows me she knew what i wanted none of her damn business and harra was always there harra must not know harra must not why should she get off so soft the poison must be in her must have come from her da i lay only with her da and they were all wrong but the one miles blinked what were all wrong across the room miles saw speaker karals mouth tighten the headman caught miless glance and stared down at his own feet absenting himself from the proceedings lem his lips parted in absorption and the rest of the boys were listening with alarm harra hadnt moved all my babies ma mattulich said harra looked up sharply at that her eyes widening was harra not your only child miles asked it was an effort to keep his voice cool calm he wanted to shout he wanted to be gone from here no of course not she was my only clean child i thought i thought but the poison must have been hidden in her i fell on my knees and thanked god when she was born clean a clean one at last after so many so much pain i thought i had finally been punished enough she was such a pretty baby i thought it was over at last but she must have been mutie after all hidden tricksy sly how many miles choked babies did you have four besides harra my last and you killed all four of them speaker karal miles saw gave a slow nod to his feet no said ma mattulich indignation broke through the fastpenta wooze briefly two were born dead already the first one and the twistedup one the one with too many fingers and toes and the one with the bulgy head those i cut cut out my mother she watched over me to see i did it right harra i made it soft for harra i did it for her so you have in fact murdered not one infant but three said miles frozenly the younger witnesses in the room karals boys and the csurik brothers looked horrified the older ones ma mattulichs contemporaries who must have lived through the events with her looked mortified sharing her shame yes they all must have known murdered said ma mattulich no i cut them out i had to i had to do the right thing her chin lifted proudly then drooped killed my babies to please to please i dont know who and now you call me a murderer damn you what use is your justice to me now i needed it thenwhere were you then suddenly shockingly she burst into tears which wavered almost instantly into rage if mine must die then so must hers why should she get off so soft spoiled her i tried my best i did my best its not fair the fastpenta was not keeping up with this no it was working miles decided but her emotions were too overwhelming upping the dose might level her emotional surges at some risk of respiratory arrest but it would not elicit any more complete a confession miless belly was trembling a reaction he trusted he concealed it had to be completed now why did you break rainas neck instead of cutting her throat harra she must not know said ma mattulich poor baby it would look like she just died miles eyed lem speaker karal it seems a number of others shared your opinion that harra should not know i didnt want it to be from my mouth repeated lem sturdily i wanted to save her double grief mlord said karal shed had so much miles met harras eyes at that i think you all underestimate her your excessive tenderness insults both her intelligence and will she comes from a tough line that one harra inhaled controlling her own trembling she gave miles a short nod as if to say thank you little man he returned her a slight inclination of the head yes i understand im not sure yet where justice lies in this case said miles but this i swear to you the days of cooperative concealment are over no more secret crimes in the night daylights here and speaking of crimes in the night he turned back to ma mattulich was it you who tried to cut my horses throat last night i tried said ma mattulich calmer now in a wave of fastpenta mellowness but it kept rearing up on me why my horse miles could not keep exasperation from his voice though a calm even tone was enjoined upon fastpenta interrogators by the training manual i couldnt get at you said ma mattulich simply miles rubbed his forehead retroactive infanticide by proxy he muttered you said ma mattulich and her loathing came through even the nauseating fastpenta cheer you are the worst all i went through all i did all the grief and you come along at the end a mutie made lord over us all and all the rules changed betrayed at the end by an offworlder womans weakness you make it all for nothing hate you dirty mutie her voice trailed off in a drugged mumble miles took a deep breath and looked around the room the stillness was profound and no one dared break it i believe he said that concludes my investigation into the facts of this case the mystery of rainas death was solved the problem of justice unfortunately remained miles took a walk the graveyard though little more than a crude clearing in the woodland was a place of peace and beauty in the morning light the stream burbled endlessly shifting green shadows and blinding brilliant reflections the faint breeze that had shredded away the last of the night fog whispered in the trees and the tiny shortlived creatures that everyone on barrayar but biologists called bugs sang and twittered in the patches of native scrub well raina miles sighed and what do i do now pym lingered by the borders of the clearing giving miles room its all right miles assured the tiny grave pyms caught me talking to dead people before he may think im crazy but hes far too welltrained to say so pym in fact did not look happy nor altogether well miles felt rather guilty for dragging him out by rights the man should be resting in bed but miles had desperately needed this time alone pym wasnt just suffering the residual effect of having been kicked by ninny he had been silent ever since miles had extracted the confession from ma mattulich miles was unsurprised pym had steeled himself to play executioner to their imagined hill bully the substitution of a mad grandmother as his victim had clearly given him pause he would obey whatever order miles gave him though miles had no doubt of that miles considered the peculiarities of barrayaran law as he wandered about the clearing watching the stream and the light turning over an occasional rock with the toe of his boot the fundamental principle was clear the spirit was to be preferred over the letter truth over technicalities precedent was held subordinate to the judgment of the man on the spot alas the man on the spot was himself there was no refuge for him in automated rules no hiding behind the law says as if the law were some living overlord with a real voice the only voice here was his own and who would be served by the death of that halfcrazed old woman harra the relationship between mother and daughter had been wounded unto death by this miles had seen that in their eyes yet still harra had no stomach for matricide miles rather preferred it that way having her standing by his ear crying for bloody revenge would have been enormously distracting just now the obvious justice made a damn poor reward for harras courage in reporting the crime raina ah that was more difficult id like to lay the old gargoyle right there at your feet small lady miles muttered to her is it your desire does it serve you what would serve you was this the great burning he had promised her what judgment would reverberate along the entire dendarii mountain range should he indeed sacrifice these people to some larger political statement regardless of their wants or should he forget all that make his judgment serve only those directly involved he scooped up a stone and flung it full force into the stream it vanished invisibly in the rocky bed he turned to find speaker karal waiting by the edge of the graveyard karal ducked his head in greeting and approached cautiously so mlord said karal just so said miles have you come to any conclusion not really miles gazed around anything less than ma mattulichs death seems inadequate justice and yet i cannot see who her death would serve neither could i thats why i took the position i did in the first place no said miles slowly no you were wrong in that for one thing it very nearly got lem csurik killed i was getting ready to pursue him with deadly force at one point it almost destroyed him with harra truth is better slightly better at least it isnt a fatal error surely i can do something with it i didnt know what to expect of you at first admitted karal miles shook his head i meant to make changes a difference now i dont know speaker karals balding forehead wrinkled but we are changing not enough not fast enough youre young yet thats why you dont see how much how fast look at the difference between harra and her mother godlook at the difference between ma mattulich and her mother there was a harridan speaker karal shuddered i remember her all right and yet she was not so unusual in her day so far from having to make change i dont think you could stop it if you tried the minute we finally get a powersat receptor up here and get on the comm net the past will be done and over as soon as the kids see the futuretheir futuretheyll be mad after it theyre already lost to the old ones like ma mattulich the old ones know it too dont believe they dont know it why dyou think we havent been able to get at least a small unit up here yet not just the cost the old ones are fighting it they call it off planet corruption but its really the future they fear theres so much still to be done oh yes we are a desperate people no lie but we have hope i dont think you realize how much youve done just by coming up here ive done nothing said miles bitterly sat around mostly and now i swear im going to end up doing more nothing and then go home hell speaker karal pursed his lips looked at his feet at the high hills you are doing something for us every minute mutie lord do you think you are invisible miles grinned wolfishly oh karal im a oneman band i am im a parade as you say just so ordinary people need extraordinary examples so they can say to themselves well if he can do that i can surely do this no excuses no quarter yes i know that game been playing it all my life i think said karal barrayar needs you to go on being just what you are barrayar will eat me if it can yes said karal his eyes on the horizon so it will his gaze fell to the graves at his feet but it swallows us all in the end doesnt it you will outlive the old ones or in the beginning miles pointed down dont tell me who im going to outlive tell raina karals shoulders slumped true struth make your judgment lord ill back you miles assembled them all in karals yard for his speaking the porch now having become his podium the interior of the cabin would have been impossibly hot and close for this crowd suffocating with the afternoon sun beating on the roof though outdoors the light made them squint they were all here everyone they could round up speaker karal ma karal their boys all the csuriks most of the cronies who had attended last nights funereal festivities men women and children harra sat apart lem kept trying to hold her hand though from the way she flinched it was clear she didnt want to be touched ma mattulich sat displayed by miless side silent and surly flanked by pym and an uncomfortablelooking deputy alex miles jerked up his chin settling his head on the high collar of his dress greens as polished and formal as pyms batmans expertise could make him the imperial service uniform that miles had earned did these people know he had earned it or did they all imagine it a mere gift from his father nepotism at work damn what they thought he knew he stood before his people and gripped the porch rail i have concluded the investigation of the charges laid before the counts court by harra csurik of the murder of her daughter raina by evidence witness and her own admission i find mara mattulich guilty of this murder she having twisted the infants neck until it broke and then attempted to conceal that crime even when that concealment placed her soninlaw lem csurik in mortal danger from false charges in light of the helplessness of the victim the cruelty of the method and the cowardly selfishness of the attempted concealment i can find no mitigating excuse for the crime in addition mara mattulich by her own admission testifies to two previous infanticides some twenty years ago of her own children these facts shall be announced by speaker karal in every corner of silvy vale until every subject has been informed he could feel ma mattulichs glare boring into his back yes go on and hate me old woman i will bury you yet and you know it he swallowed and continued the formality of the language a sort of shield before him for this unmitigated crime the only proper sentence is death and i so sentence mara mattulich but in light of her age and close relation to the nextmostinjured party in the case harra csurik i choose to hold the actual execution of that sentence indefinitely out of the corner of his eye miles saw pym let out very carefully and covertly a sigh of relief harra combed at her strawcolored bangs with her fingers and listened intently but she shall be as dead before the law all her property even to the clothes on her back now belongs to her daughter harra to dispose of as she wills mara mattulich may not own property enter contracts sue for injuries nor exert her will after death in any testament she shall not leave silvy vale without harras permission harra shall be given power over her as a parent over a child or as in senility in harras absence speaker karal will be her deputy mara mattulich shall be watched to see she harms no other child further she shall die without sacrifice no one not harra nor any other shall make a burning for her when she goes into the ground at last as she murdered her future so her future shall return only death to her spirit she will die as the childless do without remembrance a low sigh swept the older members of the crowd before miles for the first time mara mattulich bent her stiff neck some miles knew would find this only spiritually symbolic others would see it as literally lethal according to the strength of their beliefs the literalminded such as those who saw mutation as a sin to be violently expiated but even the less superstitious miles saw in their faces found the meaning clear so miles turned to ma mattulich and lowered his voice every breath you take from this moment on is by my mercy every bite of food you eat by harras charity by charity and mercysuch as you did not giveyou shall live dead woman some mercy mutie lord her growl was low weary beaten you get the point he said through his teeth he swept her a bow infinitely ironic and turned his back on her i am the voice of count vorkosigan this concludes my speaking miles met harra and lem afterwards in speaker karals cabin i have a proposition for you miles controlled his nervous pacing and stood before them youre free to turn it down or think about it for a while i know youre very tired right now as are we all had he really been in silvy vale only a day and a half it seemed like a century his head ached with fatigue harra was redeyed too first of all can you read and write some harra admitted speaker karal taught us some and ma larmier well good enough you wouldnt be starting completely blind look a few years back hassadar started a teachers college its not very big yet but its begun there are some scholarships i can swing one your way if you will agree to live in hassadar for three years of intense study me said harra i couldnt go to a college i barely know any of that stuff knowledge is what youre supposed to have coming out not going in look they know what theyre dealing with in this district they have a lot of remedial courses its true youd have to work harder to catch up with the townbred and the lowlanders but i know you have courage and i know you have will the rest is just picking yourself up and ramming into the wall again and again until it falls down you get a bloody forehead so what you can do it i swear you can lem sitting beside her looked worried he captured her hand again three years he said in a small voice gone away the school stipend isnt that much said miles but lem i understand you have carpenters skills theres a building boom going on in hassadar right now hassadars going to be the next vorkosigan vashnoi i think im certain you could get a job between you you could live lem looked at first relieved then extremely worried but they all use power toolscomputersrobots by no means and they werent all born knowing how to use that stuff either if they can learn it you can besides the rich pay well for handwork unique oneoff items if the qualitys good i can see you get a start which is usually the toughest moment after that you should be able to figure it out all right to leave silvy vale said harra in a dismayed tone only in order to return thats the other half of the bargain i can send a comm unit up here a small one with a portable power pack that lasts a year somebodyd have to hump down to vorkosigan surleau to replace it annually no big problem the whole set up wouldnt cost much more than oh a new lightflyer such as the shiny red one miles had coveted in a dealers showroom in vorbarr sultana very suitable for a graduation present he had pointed out to his parents the credit chit was sitting in the top drawer of his dresser in the lake house at vorkosigan surleau right now its not a massive project like installing a powersat receptor for the whole of silvy vale or anything the holovid would pick up the educational satellite broadcasts from the capital set it up in some central cabin add a couple of dozen laplinks for the kids and youve got an instant school all the children would be required to attend with speaker karal to enforce it though once theyd discovered the holovid youd probably have to beat them to make them go home i ah miles cleared his throat thought you might name it the raina csurik primary school oh said harra and began to cry for the first time that grueling day lem patted her clumsily she returned the grip of his hand at last i can send a lowlander up here to teach said miles ill get one to take a shortterm contract till youre ready to come back but he or she wont understand silvy vale like you do wouldnt understand why youyou already know you know what they cant teach in any lowland college harra scrubbed her eyes and looked upnot very far upat him you went to the imperial academy i did his chin jerked up then i she said shakily can manage hassadar teachers college the name was awkward in her mouth at first at any rate ill try mlord ill bet on you miles agreed both of you just ah a smile sped across his mouth and vanished stand up straight and speak the truth eh harra blinked understanding an answering halfsmile lit her tired face equally briefly i will little man fat ninny rode home by air the next morning in a horse van along with pym dr dea went along with his two patients and his nemesis the sorrel mare a replacement bodyguard had been sent with the groom who flew the van from vorkosigan surleau who stayed with miles to help him ride the remaining two horses back down well miles thought hed been considering a camping trip in the mountains with his cousin ivan as part of his home leave anyway the liveried man was the laconic veteran esterhazy whom miles had known most of his life excellent company for a man who didnt want to talk about it unlike ivan you could almost forget he was there miles wondered if esterhazys assignment had been random chance or a mercy of the counts esterhazy was good with horses they camped overnight by the river of roses miles walked up the vale in the evening light desultorily looking for the spring of it indeed the floral barrier did seem to peter out a couple of kilometers upstream merging into slightly less impassable scrub miles plucked a rose checked to make sure that esterhazy was nowhere in sight and bit into it curiously clearly he was not a horse a cut bunch would probably not survive the trip back as a treat for ninny ninny could settle for oats miles watched the evening shadows flowing up along the backbone of the dendarii range high and massive in the distance how small those mountains looked from space little wrinkles on the skin of a globe he could cover with his hand all their crushing mass made invisible which was illusory distance or nearness distance miles decided distance was a damned lie had his father known this miles suspected so he contemplated his urge to throw all his money not just a lightflyers worth at those mountains to quit it all and go teach children to read and write to set up a free clinic a powersat net or all of these at once but silvy vale was only one of hundreds of such communities buried in these mountains one of thousands across the whole of barrayar taxes squeezed from this very district helped maintain the very elite military school hed just spenthow much of their resources in how much would he have to give back just to make it even now he was himself a planetary resource his training had made him so and his feet were set on their path what god means you to do miless theist mother claimed could be deduced from the talents he gave you the academic honors miles had amassed by sheer brute work but the war games outwitting his opponents staying one step aheada necessity true he had no margin for errorthe war games had been an unholy joy war had been no game here once not so long ago it might be so again what you did best that was what was wanted from you god seemed to be lined up with the emperor on that point at least if no other miles had sworn his officers oath to the emperor less than two weeks ago puffed with pride at his achievement in his secret mind he had imagined himself keeping that oath through blazing battle enemy torture whathaveyou even while sharing cynical cracks afterwards with ivan about archaic dress swords and the sort of people who insisted on wearing them but in the dark of subtler temptations those which hurt without heroism for consolation he foresaw the emperor would no longer be the symbol of barrayar in his heart peace to you small lady he thought to raina youve won a twisted poor modern knight to wear your favor on his sleeve but its atwisted poor world we were both born into that rejects us without mercy and ejects us without consultation at least i wont just tilt at windmills for you ill send in sappers to mine the twirling suckers and blast them into the sky he knew who he served now and why he could not quit and why he must not fail are you feeling better said illyan cautiously somewhat miles replied carefully and waited he could outwait illyan now oh yes the security chief pulled up a chair and settled himself by miless bedside regarded miles and pursed his lips my apologies lord vorkosigan for doubting your word you owe me that miles agreed yes nevertheless illyan frowned into the middle distance i wonder miles if youve ever realized the extent that in your position as your fathers son it is not only necessary to be honest but to appear so as my fathers sonno said miles flatly illyan snorted involuntarily ha perhaps not his fingers drummed be that as it may count vorvolk has seized on two discrepancies in your mercenary covert ops reports wild cost overruns in what should have been the simplest of tasks personnel pickups i realize dagoola blew up on you but what about the first time the first time what theyre looking again at the pickup you made from jacksons whole their theory being that your successfullyconcealed initial peculation there tempted you to larger efforts at dagoola that was almost two years ago miles protested theyre reaching illyan agreed theyre looking hard they want to nail you to the wall in public if they possibly can i am as it were trying to confiscate the hammer dammit he added irritably dont look at me like that theres nothing personal in it if you were anyone elses son the matter would not have arisenyou know it i know it and they know it financial oversight audits by untouchable vor bores are not my idea of an amusement my one hope is to tire him out and make him go away so give miles sighed sir i am at your disposal as always what dyou want to know explain the equipment bill for the jacksons whole pick up it was all accounted for in my report at the time i thought miles tried to remember accounted for yes explained no we left half a cargo of highclass weaponry on the dock at fell station if we hadnt you might have been out a scientist a ship and a subordinate yes said illyan he templed his fingers and leaned back in his chair why ah its a long story complicated yknow despite himself miles smiled in memory can this still be just between you and me illyan tilted his head all right labyrinth miles contemplated the image of the globe glowing above the vid plate crossed his arms and stifled queasiness the planet of jacksons whole glittering wealthy corrupt jacksonians claimed their corruption was entirely importedif the galaxy were willing to pay for virtue what it paid for vice the place would be a pilgrimage shrine in miless view this seemed rather like debating which was superior maggots or the rotten meat they fed off still if jacksons whole didnt exist the galaxy would probably have had to invent it its neighbors might feign horror but they wouldnt permit the place to exist if they didnt find it a secretly useful interface with the subeconomy the planet possessed a certain liveliness anyway not as lively as a century or two back to be sure in its hijackerbase days but its cutthroat criminal gangs had senesced into syndicate monopolies almost as structured and staid as little governments an aristocracy of sorts naturally miles wondered how much longer the major houses would be able to fight off the creeping tide of integrity house dyne detergent bankinglaunder your money on jacksons whole house fell weapons deals with no questions asked house bharaputra illegal genetics worse house ryoval whose motto was dreams made flesh surely the damndestmiles used the adjective preciselyprocurer in history house hargraves the galactic fence primfaced middlemen for ransom dealsyou had to give them credit hostages exchanged through their good offices came back alive mostly and a dozen smaller syndicates variously and shiftingly allied even we find you useful miles touched the control and the vid image vanished his lip curled in suppressed loathing and he called up his ordnance inventory for one final check of his shopping list a subtle shift in the vibrations of the ship around him told him they were matching orbitsthe fast cruiser ariel would be docking at fell station within the hour his console was just extruding the completed data disk of weapons orders when his cabin door chimed followed by an alto voice over its comm admiral naismith enter he plucked off the disk and leaned back in his station chair captain thorne sauntered in with a friendly salute well be docking in about thirty minutes sir thank you bel bel thorne the ariels commander was a betan hermaphrodite manwoman descendant of a centuriespast geneticsocial experiment every bit as bizarre in miless private opinion as anything rumored to be done for money by house ryovals ethicsfree surgeons a fringe effort of betan egalitarianism run amok hermaphroditism had not caught on and the original idealists hapless descendants remained a minority on hypertolerant beta colony except for a few stray wanderers like bel as a mercenary officer thorne was conscientious loyal and aggressive and miles liked himherit betan custom used the neuter pronouna lot however miles could smell bels floral perfume from her bel was emphasizing the female side today and had been increasingly for the five days of this voyage normally bel chose to come on ambiguoustomale soft short brown hair and chiselled beardless facial features counteracted by the greyandwhite dendarii military uniform assertive gestures and wicked humor it worried miles exceedingly to sense bel soften in his presence turning to his computer consoles holovid plate miles again called up the image of the planet they were approaching jacksons whole looked demure enough from a distance mountainous rather cold the populated equator was only temperateringed in the vid by a lacy schematic net of colored satellite tracks orbital transfer stations and authorized approach vectors have you ever been here before bel once when i was a lieutenant in admiral osers fleet said the mercenary house fell has a new baron since then their weaponry still has a good reputation as long as you know what youre buying stay away from the sale on neutron hand grenades heh for those with strong throwing arms fear not neutron hand grenades arent on the list he handed the data disk to bel bel sidled up and leaned over the back of miless station chair to take it shall i grant leaves to the crew while were waiting for the barons minions to load cargo how about yourself there used to be a hostel near the docks with all the amenities pool sauna great food bels voice lowered i could book a room for two id only figured to grant day passes necessarily miles cleared his throat i am a woman too bel pointed out in a murmur among other things youre so hopelessly monosexual miles sorry awkwardly he patted the hand that had somehow come to rest on his shoulder bel sighed and straightened so many are miles sighed too perhaps he ought to make his rejection more emphaticthis was only about the seventh time hed been round with bel on this subject it was almost ritualized by now almost but not quite a joke you had to give the betan credit for either optimism or obtuseness or miless honesty added genuine feeling if he turned round now he knew he might surprise an essential loneliness in the hermaphrodites eyes never permitted on the lips he did not turn round and who was he to judge another miles reflected ruefully whose own body brought him so little joy what did bel straight and healthy and of normal height if unusual genital arrangements find so attractive in a little halfcrippled parttime crazy man he glanced down at the grey dendarii officers uniform he wore the uniform he had won if you cant be seven feet tall be seven feet smart his reason had so far failed to present him with a solution to the problem of thorne though have you ever thought of going back to beta colony and seeking one of your own miles asked seriously thorne shrugged too boring thats why i left its so very safe so very narrow mind you a great place to raise kids one corner of miless mouth twisted up thorne grinned you got it youre an almost perfect betan yknow almost you have the accent the injokes miles went a little still where do i fail thorne touched miless cheek miles flinched reflexes said thorne ah i wont give you away i know bel was leaning in again i could polish that last edge never mind said miles slightly flushed we have a mission inventory said thorne scornfully thats not a mission said miles thats a cover ah ha thorne straightened up at last at last it doesnt take a genius we came to purchase ordnance but instead of taking the ship with the biggest cargo capacity you chose the ariel the fleets fastest theres no deader dull routine than inventory but instead of sending a perfectly competent quartermaster youre overseeing it personally i do want to make contact with the new baron fell said miles mildly house fell is the biggest arms supplier this side of beta colony and a lot less picky about who its customers are if i like the quality of the initial purchase they could become a regular supplier a quarter of fells arms are betan manufacture marked up said thorne again ha and while were here miles went on a certain middleaged man is going to present himself and sign on to the dendarii mercenaries as a medtech at that point all station passes are cancelled we finish loading cargo as quickly as possible and we leave thorne grinned in satisfaction a pickup very good i assume were being wellpaid very if he arrives at his destination alive the man happens to be the top research geneticist of house bharaputras laboratories hes been offered asylum by a planetary government capable of protecting him from the long arms of baron luigi bharaputras enforcers his soontobeformer employer is expected to be highly irate at the lack of a months notice we are being paid to deliver him to his new masters alive and not ah forcibly debriefed of all his trade secrets since house bharaputra could probably buy and sell the whole dendarii free mercenary fleet twice over out of petty cash i would prefer we not have to deal with baron luigis enforcers either so we shall be innocent suckers all we did was hire a bloody medtech sir and we shall be irate ourselves when he deserts after we arrive at fleet rendezvous off escobar sounds good to me conceded thorne simple so i trust miles sighed hopefully why after all shouldnt things run to plan just this once the purchasing offices and display areas for house fells lethal wares were situated not far from the docks and most of house fells smaller customers never penetrated further into fell station but shortly after miles and thorne placed their orderabout as long as needed to verify a credit chitan obsequious person in the green silk of house fells uniform appeared and pressed an invitation into admiral naismiths hand to a reception in the barons personal quarters four hours later giving up the pass cube to baron fells major domo at the sealed entrance to the stations private sector miles checked thorne and himself over for their general effect dendarii dress uniform was a grey velvet tunic with silver buttons on the shoulders and white edging matching grey trousers with white side piping and grey synthasuede bootsperhaps just a trifle effete well he hadnt designed it hed just inherited it live with it the interface to the private sector was highly interesting miless eye took in the details while the major domo scanned them for weapons lifesupportin fact all systemsappeared to be run separately from the rest of the station the area was not only scalable it was detachable in effect not station but shipengines and armament around here somewhere miles bet though it could be lethal to go looking for them unescorted the major domo ushered them through pausing to announce them on his wrist comm admiral miles naismith commanding dendarii free mercenary fleet captain bel thorne commanding the fast cruiser ariel dendarii free mercenary fleet miles wondered who was on the other end of the comm the reception chamber was large and gracefully appointed with iridescent floating staircases and levels creating private spaces without destroying the illusions of openness every exit miles counted six had a large greengarbed guard by it trying to look like a servant and not succeeding very well one whole wall was a vertigoinducing transparent viewport overlooking fell stations busy docks and the bright curve of jacksons whole bisecting the starspattered horizon beyond a crew of elegant women in green silk saris rustled among the guests offering food and drink grey velvet miles decided after one glance at the other guests was a positively demure choice of garb he and bel would blend right into the walls the thin scattering of fellow privileged customers wore a wide array of planetary fashions but they were a wary bunch little groups sticking together no mingling guerrillas it appeared did not speak to mercenaries nor smugglers to revolutionaries the gnostic saints of course spoke only to the one true god and perhaps to baron fell some party commented bel i went to a pet show with an atmosphere like this once the high point was when somebodys tau cetan beaded lizard got loose and ate the bestinshow from the canine division hush miles grinned out of the corner of his mouth this is business a greensarid woman bowed silently before them offering a tray thorne raised a brow at milesdo we why not miles murmured were paying for it in the long run i doubt the baron poisons his customers its bad for business business is emperor here laissezfaire capitalism gone completely over the edge he selected a pink tidbit in the shape of a lotus and a mysterious cloudy drink thorne followed suit the pink lotus alas turned out to be some sort of raw fish it squeaked against his teeth miles committed swallowed it anyway the drink was potently alcoholic and after a sip to wash down the lotus he regretfully abandoned it on the first level surface he could find his dwarfish body refused to handle alcohol and he had no desire to meet baron fell while either semicomatose or giggling uncontrollably the more metabolically fortunate thorne kept beverage in hand a most extraordinary music began from somewhere a racing rich complexity of harmonics miles could not identify the instrument instruments surely he and thorne exchanged a glance and by mutual accord drifted toward the sound around a spiraling staircase backed by the panoply of station planet and stars they found the musician miless eyes widened house ryovals surgeons have surely gone too far this time little decorative colored sparkles defined the spherical field of a large nullgee bubble floating within it was a woman her ivory arms flashed against her green silk clothes as she played all four of her ivory arms she wore a flowing kimonolike belted jacket and matching shorts from which the second set of arms emerged where her legs should have been her hair was short and soft and ebony black her eyes were closed and her rosetinted face bore the repose of an angel high and distant and terrifying her strange instrument was fixed in air before her a flat polished wooden frame strung across both top and bottom with a bewildering array of tight gleaming wires soundboard between she struck the wires with four felted hammers with blinding speed both sides at once her upper hands moving at counterpoint to her lowers music poured forth in a cascade good god said thorne its a quaddie its a what a quaddie shes a long way from home shesnot a local product by no means im relieved i think where the devil does she come from then about two hundred years agoabout the time hermaphrodites were being invented a peculiar wryness flashed across thornes face there was this rush of genetic experimentation on humans in the wake of the development of the practical uterine replicator followed shortly by a rush of laws restricting such but meanwhile somebody thought theyd make a race of free fall dwellers then artificial gravity came in and blew them out of business the quaddies fledtheir descendants ended up on the far side of nowhere way beyond earth from us in the nexus theyre rumored to keep to themselves mostly very unusual to see one this side of earth hsh lips parted thorne tracked the music as unusual as finding a betan hermaphrodite in a free mercenary fleet miles thought but the music deserved undivided attention though few in this paranoid crowd seemed to even be noticing it a shame miles was no musician but even he could sense an intensity of passion in the playing that went beyond talent reaching for genius an evanescent genius sounds woven with time and like time forever receding beyond ones futile grasp into memory alone the outpouring of music dropped to a haunting echo then silence the fourarmed musicians blue eyes opened and her face came back from the ethereal to the merely human tense and sad ah breathed thorne stuck its empty glass under its arm raised hands to clap then paused hesitant to become conspicuous in this indifferent chamber miles was all for being inconspicuous perhaps you can speak to her he suggested by way of an alternative you think brightening thorne tripped forward swinging down to abandon the glass on the nearest handy floor and raising splayed hands against the sparkling bubble the hermaphrodite mustered an entranced ingratiating smile uh thornes chest rose and fell good god bel tonguetied never thought id see it ask her what she calls that thing she plays miles supplied helpfully the fourarmed woman tilted her head curiously and starfished gracefully over her boxy instrument to hover politely before thorne on the other side of the glittering barrier yes what do you call that extraordinary instrument thorne asked its a doublesided hammer dulcimer maamsir her servanttoguest dull tone faltered a moment fearing to give insult officer captain bel thorne bel supplied instantly beginning to recover accustomed smooth equilibrium commanding the dendarii fast cruiser ariel at your service how ever did you come to be here i had worked my way to earth i was seeking employment and baron fell hired me she tossed her head as if to deflect some implied criticism though bel had offered none you are a true quaddie youve heard of my people her dark brows rose in surprise most people i encounter here think i am a manufactured freak a little sardonic bitterness edged her voice thorne cleared its throat im betan myself ive followed the history of the early genetics explosion with a rather more personal interest thorne cleared its throat again betan hermaphrodite you see and waited anxiously for the reaction damn bel never waited for reactions bel sailed on and let the chips fall anyhow wouldnt interfere with this for all the world miles faded back slightly rubbing his lips to wipe off a twitching grin as all thornes most masculine mannerisms reasserted themselves from spine to fingertips and outward into the aether her head tilted in interest one upper hand rose to rest on the sparkling barrier not far from bels are you youre a genetic too then oh yes and tell me whats your name nicol nicol is that all i mean its lovely my people dont use surnames ah and uh what are you doing after the party at this point alas interference found them heads up captain miles murmured thorne drew up instantly cool and correct and followed miless gaze the quaddie floated back from the force barrier and bowed her head over her hands held palmtopalm and palmtopalm as a man approached miles too came to a polite species of attention georish stauber baron fell was a surprisingly old man to have succeeded so recently to his position miles thought in the flesh he looked older than the holovid miles had viewed of him at his own mission briefing the baron was balding with a white fringe of hair around his shiny pate jovial and fat he looked like somebodys grandfather not miless miless grandfather had been lean and predatory even in his great age and the old counts title had been as real as such things got not the courtesynobility of a syndicate survivor jolly red cheeks or no miles reminded himself baron fell had climbed a pile of bodies to attain this high place admiral naismith captain thorne welcome to fell station rumbled the baron smiling miles swept him an aristocratic bow thorne somewhat awkwardly followed suit ah he must copy that awkwardness next time of such little details were cover identities made and blown have my people been taking care of your needs thank you yes so far the proper businessmen so glad to meet you at last the baron rumbled on weve heard a great deal about you here have you said miles encouragingly the barons eyes were strangely avid quite a gladhand for a little tinpot mercenary eh this was a little more stroke than was reasonable even for a highticket customer miles banished all hint of wariness from his return smile patience let the challenge emerge dont rush to meet what you cannot yet see good things i hope remarkable things your rise has been as rapid as your origins are mysterious hell hell what kind of bait was this was the baron hinting that he actually knew admiral naismiths real identity this could be sudden and serious trouble nofear outran its cause wait forget that such a person as lieutenant lord vorkosigan barrayaran imperial security ever existed in this body its not big enough for the two of us anyway boy yet why was this fat shark smiling so ingratiatingly miles cocked his head neutrally the story of your fleets success at vervain reached us even here so unfortunate about its former commander miles stiffened i regret admiral osers death the baron shrugged philosophically such things happen in the business only one can command he could have been an outstanding subordinate pride is so dangerous smiled the baron indeed miles bit his tongue so he thinks i arranged osers death so let him that there was one less mercenary than there appeared in this room that the dendarii were now through miles an arm of the barrayaran imperial service so covert most of them didnt even know it themselves it would be a dull syndicate baron who couldnt find profit in those secrets somewhere miles matched the barons smile and added nothing you interest me exceedingly continued the baron for example theres the puzzle of your apparent age and your prior military career if miles had kept his drink hed have knocked it back in one gulp right then he clasped his hands convulsively behind his back instead dammit the pain lines just didnt age his face enough if the baron was indeed seeing right through the pseudomercenary to the twentythreeyearold security lieutenantand yet he usually carried it off the baron lowered his voice do the rumors run equally true about your betan rejuvenation treatment so thats what he was on about miles felt faint with relief what interest could you have in such treatments my lord he gibbered lightly i thought jacksons whole was the home of practical immortality its said there are some here on their third cloned body i am not one of them said the baron rather regretfully miless brows rose in genuine surprise surely this man didnt spurn the process as murder some unfortunate medical impediment he said injecting polite sympathy into his voice my regrets sir in a manner of speaking the barons smile revealed a sharp edge the brain transplant operation itself kills a certain irreducible percentage of patients yeah thought miles starting with of the clones whose brains are flushed to make room another percentage suffer varying sorts of permanent damage those are the risks anyone must take for the reward but the reward is so great but then there are a certain number of patients indistinguishable from the first group who do not die on the operating table by accident if their enemies have the subtlety and clout to arrange it i have a number of enemies admiral naismith miles made a little whowouldthinkit gesture flipping up one hand and continued to cultivate an air of deep interest i calculate my present chances of surviving a brain transplant to be rather worse than the average the baron went on so ive an interest in alternatives he paused expectantly oh said miles oh indeed he regarded his fingernails and thought fast its true i once participated in an unauthorized experiment a premature one as it happens pushed too eagerly from animal to human subjects it was not successful no said the baron you appear in good health miles shrugged yes there was some benefit to muscles skin tone hair but my bones are the bones of an old man fragile true subject to acute osteoinflammatory attacksthere are days when i cant walk without medication also true dammit a recent and unsettling medical development my life expectancy is not considered good for example if certain parties here ever figure out who admiral naismith really is it could go down to as little as fifteen minutes so unless youre extremely fond of pain and think you would enjoy being crippled i fear i must disrecommend the procedure the baron looked him up and down disappointment pulled down his mouth i see bel thorne who knew quite well there was no such thing as the fabled betan rejuvenation treatment was listening with wellconcealed enjoyment and doing an excellent job of keeping the smirk off its face bless its little black heart still said the baron your scientific acquaintance may have made some progress in the intervening years i fear not said miles he died he spread his hands helplessly old age oh the barons shoulders sagged slightly ah there you are fell a new voice cut across them the baron straightened and turned the man who had hailed him was as conservatively dressed as fell and flanked by a silent servant with bodyguard written all over him the bodyguard wore a uniform a highnecked red silk tunic and loose black trousers and was unarmed everyone on fell station went unarmed except fells men the place had the most strictlyenforced weapons regs miles had ever encountered but the pattern of calluses on the lean bodyguards hands suggested he might not need weapons his eyes flickered and his hands shook just slightly a hyperalertness induced by artificial aidsif ordered he could strike with blinding speed and adrenalininsane strength he would also retire young metabolically crippled for the rest of his short life the man he guarded was also youngsome great lords son miles wondered he had long shining black hair dressed in an elaborate braid smooth dark olive skin and a highbridged nose he couldnt be older than miless real age yet he moved with a mature assurance ryoval baron fell nodded in return as a man to an equal not a junior still playing the genial host fell added officers may i introduce baron ryoval of house ryoval admiral naismith captain thorne they belong to the illyricanbuilt mercenary fast cruiser in dock ry that you may have noticed havent got your eye for hardware im afraid georish baron ryoval bestowed a nod upon them of a man being polite to his social inferiors for the principle of it miles bowed clumsily in return dropping miles from his attention with an almost audible thump ryoval stood back with his hands on his hips and regarded the nullgee bubbles inhabitant my agent didnt exaggerate her charms fell smiled sourly nicol had withdrawnrecoiledwhen ryoval first approached and now floated behind her instrument fussing with its tuning pretending to be fussing with its tuning her eyes glanced warily at ryoval then returned to her dulcimer as if it might put some magic wall between them can you have her play ryoval began and was interrupted by a chime from his wrist comm excuse me georish looking slightly annoyed he turned halfaway from them and spoke into it ryoval and this had better be important yes mlord a thin voice responded this is manager deem in sales and demonstrations we have a problem that creature house bharaputra sold us has savaged a customer ryovals greekstatue lips rippled in a silent snarl i told you to chain it with duralloy we did my lord the chains held but it tore the bolts right out of the wall stun it we have then punish it suitably when it awakes a sufficiently long period without food should dull its aggressionits metabolism is unbelievable what about the customer give him whatever comforts he asks for on the house i dont think hell be in shape to appreciate them for quite some time hes in the clinic now still unconscious ryoval hissed put my personal physician on his case ill take care of the rest when i get back downside in about six hours ryoval out he snapped the link closed morons he growled he took a controlled meditative breath and recalled his social manner as if booting it up out of some stored memory bank pardon the interruption please georish fell waved an understanding hand as if to say business as i was saying can you have her play something ryoval nodded to the quaddie fell clasped his hands behind his back his eyes glinting in a falsely benign smile play something nicol she gave him an acknowledging nod positioned herself and closed her eyes the frozen worry tensing her face gradually gave way to an inner stillness and she began to play a slow sweet theme that established itself rolled over and began to quicken enough ryoval flung up a hand shes precisely as described nicol stumbled to a halt in midphrase she inhaled through pinched nostrils clearly disturbed by her inability to drive the piece through to its destined finish the frustration of artistic incompletion she stuck her hammers into their holders on the side of the instrument with short savage jerks and crossed her upper and lower arms both thornes mouth tightened and it crossed its arms in unconscious echo miles bit his lip uneasily my agent conveyed the truth ryoval went on then perhaps your agent also conveyed my regrets said fell dryly he did but he wasnt authorized to offer more than a certain standard ceiling for something so unique theres no substitute for direct contact i happen to be enjoying her skills where they are said fell at my age enjoyment is much harder to obtain than money so true yet other enjoyments might be substituted i could arrange something quite special not in the catalog her musical skills ryoval which are more than special they are unique genuine not artificially augmented in any way not to be duplicated in your laboratories my laboratories can duplicate anything sir ryoval smiled at the implied challenge except originality by definition ryoval spread his hands in polite acknowledgment of the philosophical point fell miles gathered was not just enjoying the quaddies musical talent he was vastly enjoying the possession of something his rival keenly wanted to buy that he had absolutely no need to sell oneupsmanship was a powerful pleasure it seemed even the famous ryoval was having a tough time coming up with a better and yet if ryoval could find fells price what force on jacksons whole could save nicol miles suddenly realized he knew what fells price could be would ryoval figure it out too ryoval pursed his lips lets discuss a tissue sample then it would do her no damage and you could continue to enjoy her unique services uninterrupted it would damage her uniqueness circulating counterfeits always brings down the value of the real thing you know that ry grinned baron fell not for some time ryoval pointed out the lead time for a mature clone is at least ten yearsah but you know that he reddened and made a little apologetic bow as if he realized hed just committed some faux pas by the thinning of fells lips he had indeed said fell coldly at this point bel thorne tracking the interplay interrupted in hot horror you cant sell her tissues you dont own them shes not some jacksons whole construct shes a freeborn galactic citizen both barons turned to bel as if the mercenary were a piece of furniture that had suddenly spoken out of turn miles winced he can sell her contract said ryoval mustering a glassy tolerance which is what we are discussing a private discussion bel ignored the hint on jacksons whole what practical difference does it make if you call it a contract or call it flesh ryoval smiled a little cool smile none whatsoever possession is rather more than nine points of the law here its totally illegal legal my dearahyou are betan arent you that explains it said ryoval and illegal is whatever the planet you are on chooses to call so and is able to enforce i dont see any betan enforcers around here to impose their peculiar version of morality on us all do you fell fell was listening with raised brows caught between amusement and annoyance bel twitched so if i were to pull out a weapon and blow your head off it would be perfectly legal the bodyguard tensed balance and centerofgravity flowing into launch position quash it bel miles muttered under his breath but ryoval was beginning to enjoy baiting his betan interruptor you have no weapon but legality aside my subordinates have instructions to avenge me it is as it were a natural or virtual law in effect youd find such an illadvised impulse to be illegal indeed baron fell caught miless eye and tilted his head just slightly time to intervene time to move on captain miles said we arent the barons only guests here try the hot buffet suggested fell affably ryoval pointedly dropped bel from his attention and turned to miles do stop by my establishment if you get downside admiral even a betan could stand to expand the horizons of his experience im sure my staff could find something of interest in your price range not any more said miles baron fell already has our credit chit ah too bad your next trip perhaps ryoval turned away in easy dismissal bel didnt budge you cant sell a galactic citizen down there gesturing jerkily to the curve of the planet beyond the viewport the quaddie nicol watching from behind her dulcimer had no expression at all upon her face but her intense blue eyes blazed ryoval turned back feigning sudden surprise why captain i just realized betanyou must be a genuine genetic hermaphrodite you possess a marketable rarity yourself i can offer you an eyeopening employment experience at easily twice your current rate of pay and you wouldnt even have to get shot at i guarantee youd be extremely popular group rates miles swore he could see thornes blood pressure skyrocketing as the meaning of what ryoval had just said sunk in the hermaphrodites face darkened and it drew breath miles reached up and grasped bel by the shoulder hard the breath held no said ryoval cocking his head oh well but seriously i would pay well for a tissue sample for my files bels breath exploded my clonesiblings to bebesome sort of sexslaves into the next century over my dead bodyor yours you bel was so mad it was stuttering a phenomenon miles had never seen in seven years acquaintance including combat so betan smirked ryoval stop it ry growled fell ryoval sighed oh very well but its so easy we cant win bel hissed miles its time to withdraw the bodyguard was quivering fell gave miles an approving nod thank you for your hospitality baron fell miles said formally good day baron ryoval good day admiral said ryoval regretfully giving up what was obviously the best sport hed had all day you seem a cosmopolitan sort for a betan perhaps you can visit us sometime without your moral friend here a war of words should be won with words i dont think so miles murmured racking his brain for some stunning insult to withdraw on what a shame said ryoval we have a doganddwarf act im sure youd find fascinating there was a moments absolute silence fry em from orbit bel suggested tightly miles grinned through clenched teeth bowed and backed off bels sleeve clutched firmly in his hand as he turned he could hear ryoval laughing fells major domo appeared at their elbows within moments this way to the exit please officers he smiled miles had never before been thrown out of any place with such exquisite politeness back aboard the ariel in dock thorne paced the wardroom while miles sat and sipped coffee as hot and black as his own thoughts sorry i lost my temper with that squirt ryoval bel apologized gruffly squirt hell said miles the brain in that body has got to be at least a hundred years old he played you like a violin no we couldnt expect to count coup on him i admit it would have been nice if youd had the sense to shut up he sucked air to cool his scalded tongue bel made a disturbed gesture of acknowledgment and paced on and that poor girl trapped in that bubblei had one chance to talk to her and i blew iti blithered she really had brought out the male in thorne miles reflected wryly happens to the best of us he murmured he smiled into his coffee then frowned no better not to encourage thornes interest in the quaddie after all she was clearly much more than just one of fells house servants they had one ship here a crew of twenty even if he had the whole dendarii fleet to back him hed want to think twice about offending baron fell in fells own territory they had a mission speaking of which where was their blasted pickup why hadnt he yet contacted them as arranged the intercom in the wall bleeped thorne strode to it thorne here this is corporal nout at the portside docking hatch theres a woman here whos asking to see you thorne and miles exchanged a raisedbrows glance whats her name asked thorne an offside mumble then she says its nicol thorne grunted in surprise very well have her escorted to the wardroom yes captain the corporal failed to kill his intercom before turning away and his voice drifted back stay in this outfit long enough you see one of everything nicol appeared in the doorway balanced in a float chair a hovering tubular cup that seemed to be looking for its saucer enameled in a blue that precisely matched her eyes she slipped it through the doorway as easily as a woman twitching her hips zipped to a halt near miless table and adjusted the height to that of a person sitting the controls run by her lower hands left her uppers entirely free the lower body support must have been customdesigned just for her miles watched her maneuver with great interest he hadnt been sure she could even live outside her nullgee bubble hed expected her to be weak she didnt look weak she looked determined she looked at thorne thorne looked all cheered up nicol how nice to see you again she nodded shortly captain thorne admiral naismith she glanced back and forth between them and fastened on thorne miles thought he could see why he sipped coffee and waited for developments captain thorne you are a mercenary are you not yes and pardon me if i misunderstood but it seemed to me you had a certain empathy for my situation an understanding of my position thorne rendered her a slightly idiotic bow i understand you are dangling over a pit her lips tightened and she nodded mutely she got herself into it miles pointed out her chin lifted and i intend to get myself out of it miles turned a hand palmout and sipped again she readjusted her float chair a nervous gesture ending at about the same altitude it began it seems to me said miles that baron fell is a formidable protector im not sure you have anything to fear from ryovals er carnal interest in you as long as fells in charge baron fell is dying she tossed her head or at any rate he thinks he is so i gathered why doesnt he have a clone made he did it was all set up with house bharaputra the clone was fourteen years old fullsized then a couple of months ago somebody assassinated the clone the baron still hasnt found out for sure who did it though he has a little list headed by his halfbrother thus trapping him in his aging body what a fascinating tactical maneuver miles mused whats this unknown enemy going to do next i wonder just wait i dont know said nicol the barons had another clone started but its not even out of the replicator yet even with growth accelerators itd be years before it would be mature enough to transplant and it has occurred to me that there are a number of ways the baron could die besides ill health between now and then an unstable situation miles agreed i want out i want to buy passage out then why he asked said miles dryly dont you just go plunk your money down at the offices of one of the three galactic commercial passenger lines that dock here and buy a ticket its my contract said nicol when i signed it back on earth i didnt realize what it would mean once i got to jacksons whole i cant even buy my way out of it unless the baron chooses to let me and somehow it seems to cost more and more just to live here i ran a calculation it gets much worse before my time is up how much time asked thorne five more years ouch said thorne sympathetically so you ah want us to help you jump a syndicate contract said miles making little wet coffee rings on the table with the bottom of his mug smuggle you out in secret i suppose i can pay i can pay more right now than ill be able to next year this wasnt the gig i expected when i came here there was talk of recording a vid demo it never happened i dont think its ever going to happen i have to be able to reach a wider audience if im ever to pay my way back home back to my people i want out of here before i fall down that gravity well she jerked an upper thumb in the general direction of the planet they orbited people go downside here who never come up again she paused are you afraid of baron fell no said thorne as miles said yes they exchanged a sardonic look we are inclined to be careful of baron fell miles suggested thorne shrugged agreement she frowned and maneuvered to the table she drew a wad of assorted planetary currencies out of her green silk jacket and laid it in front of miles would this bolster your nerve thorne fingered the stack flipped through it at least a couple thousand betan dollars worth at conservative estimate mostly in middle denominations though a betan single topped the pile camouflaging its value to a casual glance well said thorne glancing at miles and what do we mercenaries think of that miles leaned back thoughtfully in his chair the kept secret of miless identity wasnt the only favor thorne could call in if it chose miles remembered the day thorne had helped capture an asteroid mining station and the pocket dreadnought triumph for him with nothing but sixteen troops in combat armor and a hell of a lot of nerve i encourage creative financing on the part of my commanders he said at last negotiate away captain thorne smiled and pulled the betan dollar off the stack you have the right idea thorne said to the musician but the amount is wrong her hand went uncertainly to her jacket and paused as thorne pushed the rest of the stack of currency minus the single back to her what thorne picked up the single and snapped it a few times this is the right amount makes it an official contract you see bel extended a hand to her after a bewildered moment she shook it deal said thorne happily hero said miles holding up a warning finger beware ill call in my veto if you cant come up with a way to bring this off in dead secret thats my cut of the price yes sir said thorne several hours later miles snapped awake in his cabin aboard the ariel to an urgent bleeping from his comconsole whatever he had been dreaming was gone in the instant though he had the vague idea it had been something unpleasant biological and unpleasant naismith here this is the duty officer in nav and com sir you have a call originating from the downside commercial comm net he says to tell you its vaughn vaughn was the agreedupon code name of their pickup his real name was dr canaba miles grabbed his uniform jacket and shrugged it on over his black tshirt passed his hands futilely through his hair and slid into his console station chair put him through the face of a man on the high side of middle age materialized above miless vid plate tanskinned racially indeterminate features short wavy hair greying at the temples more arresting was the intelligence that suffused those features and quickened the brown eyesyep thats my man thought miles with satisfaction here we go but canaba looked more than tense he looked distraught admiral naismith yes vaughn canaba nodded where are you asked miles downside you were to meet us up here i know somethings come up a problem what sort of problem ahis this channel secure canaba laughed bitterly on this planet nothing is secure but i dont think im being traced but i cant come up yet i need help vaughn we arent equipped to break you out against superior forcesif youve become a prisoner he shook his head no its not that ive lost something i need help to get it back id understood you were to leave everything you would be compensated later its not a personal possession its something your employer wants very badly certain samples have been removed from my power they wont take me without them dr canaba took miles for a mercenary hireling entrusted with minimum classified information by barrayaran security so all i was asked to transport was you and your skills they didnt tell you everything the hell they didn t barrayar would take you stark naked and be grateful what was this canaba met miless frown with a mouth set like iron i wont leave without them or the deals off and you can whistle for your pay mercenary he meant it damn miless eyes narrowed this is all a bit mysterious canaba shrugged acknowledgment im sorry but i must meet with me and ill tell you the rest or go i dont care which but a certain thing must be accomplished must be expiated he trailed off in agitation miles took a deep breath very well but every complication you add increases your risk and mine this had better be worth it oh admiral breathed canaba sadly it is to me it is to me snow sifted through the little park where canaba met them giving miles something new to swear at if only he hadnt run out of invective hours ago he was shivering even in his dendariiissue parka by the time canaba walked past the dingy kiosk where miles and bel roosted they fell in behind him without a word bharaputra laboratories were headquartered in a downside town miles frankly found worrisome guarded shuttleport guarded syndicate buildings guarded municipal buildings guarded walled residential compounds in between a crazy disorder of neglected aging structures that didnt seem to be guarded by anyone occupied by people who slunk it made miles wonder if the two dendarii troopers hed detailed to shadow them were quite enough but the slithery people gave them a wide berth they evidently understood what guards meant at least during daylight canaba led them into one of the nearby buildings its lift tubes were outoforder its corridors unheated a darklydressed maybefemale person scurried out of their way in the shadows reminding miles uncomfortably of a rat they followed canaba dubiously up the safety ladder set in the side of a dead lift tube down another corridor and through a door with a broken palmlock into an empty dirty room greyly lit by an unpolarized but intact window at least they were out of the wind i think we can talk safely here said canaba turning and pulling off his gloves bel said miles thorne pulled an assortment of antisurveillance detectors from its parka and ran a scan as the two guards prowled the perimeters one stationed himself in the corridor the second near the window it scans clean said bel at last as if reluctant to believe its own instruments for now rather pointedly bel walked around canaba and scanned him too canaba waited with bowed head as if he felt he deserved no better bel set up the sonic baffler miles shrugged back his hood and opened his parka the better to reach his concealed weapons in the event of a trap he was finding canaba extraordinarily hard to read what were the mans motivations anyway there was no doubt house bharaputra had assured his comforthis coat the rich cut of his clothing beneath it spoke of that and though his standard of living surely would not drop when he transferred his allegiance to the barrayaran imperial science institute he would not have nearly the opportunities to amass wealth on the side that he had here so he wasnt in it for the money miles could understand that but why work for a place like house bharaputra in the first place unless greed overwhelmed integrity you puzzle me dr canaba said miles lightly why this midcareer switch im pretty well acquainted with your new employers and frankly i dont see how they could outbid house bharaputra there that was a properly mercenary way to put it they offered me protection from house bharaputra although if youre it he looked doubtfully down at miles ha and hell the man really was ready to bolt leaving miles to explain the failure of his mission to chief of imperial security illyan in person they bought our services said miles and therefore you command our services they want you safe and happy but we cant begin to protect you when you depart from a plan designed to maximize your safety throw in random factors and ask us to operate in the dark i need full knowledge of whats going on if im to take full responsibility for the results no one is asking you to take responsibility i beg your pardon doctor but they surely have oh said canaba i see he paced to the window back but will you do what i ask i will do what i can happy canaba snorted god he shook his head wearily inhaled decisively i never came here for the money i came here because i could do research i couldnt do anywhere else not hedged round with outdated legal restrictions i dreamed of breakthroughs but it became a nightmare the freedom became slavery the things they wanted me to do constantly interrupting the things i wanted to do oh you can always find someone to do anything for money but theyre secondraters these labs are full of secondraters the very best cant be bought ive done things unique things that bharaputra wont develop because the profit would be too small never mind how many people it would benefiti get no credit no standing for my workevery year i see in the literature of my field galactic honors going to lesser men because i cannot publish my results he stopped lowered his head i doubtless sound like a megalomaniac to you ah said miles you sound quite frustrated the frustration said canaba woke me from a long sleep wounded egoit was only wounded ego but in my pride i rediscovered shame and the weight of it stunned me stunned me where i stood do you understand does it matter if you understand ah he paced away to the wall and stood facing it his back rigid uh miles scratched the back of his head ruefully yeah id be glad to spend many fascinating hours listening to you explain it to me on my ship outbound canaba turned with a crooked smile you are a practical man i perceive a soldier well god knows i need a soldier now things are that screwed up eh it happened suddenly i thought i had it under control go on sighed miles there were seven synthesized genecomplexes one of them is a cure for a certain obscure enzyme disorder one of them will increase oxygengeneration in space station algae twentyfold one of them came from outside bharaputra labs brought in by a manwe never found out who he really was but death followed him several of my colleagues who had worked on his project were murdered all in one night by the commandos who pursued himtheir records destroyedi never told anyone id borrowed an unauthorized tissue sample to study ive not unravelled it fully yet but i can tell you its absolutely unique miles recognized that one and almost choked reflecting upon the bizarre chain of circumstances that had placed an identical tissue sample in the hands of dendarii intelligence a year ago terrence sees telepathy complexand the main reason why his imperial majesty suddenly wanted a top geneticist dr canaba was in for a little surprise when he arrived at his new barrayaran laboratory but if the other six complexes came anywhere near matching the value of the known one security chief illyan would peel miles with a dull knife for letting them slip through his fingers miless attention to canaba abruptly intensified this sidetrip might not be as trivial as hed feared together these seven complexes represent tens of thousands of hours of research time mostly mine some of othersmy lifes work id planned from the beginning to take them with me i bundled them up in a viral insert and placed them bound and dormant in a live canaba faltered organism for storage an organism i thought that no one would think to look at for such a thing why didnt you just store them in your own tissue miles asked irritably then you couldnt lose em canabas mouth opened i never thought of that how elegant why didnt i think of that his hand touched his forehead wonderingly as if probing for systems failure his lips tightened again but it would have made no difference i would still need to he fell silent its about the organism he said at last the creature another long silence of all the things i did canaba continued lowly of all the interruptions this vile place imposed on me there is one i regret the most you understand this was years ago i was younger i thought i still had a future here to protect and it wasnt all my doingguilt by committee eh spread it around make it easy say it was his fault her doing well its mine now you mean its mine now thought miles grimly doctor the more time we spend here the greater the chance of compromising this operation please get to the point yes yes well a number of years ago house bharaputra laboratories took on a contract to manufacture a new species made to order i thought it was house ryoval that was famous for making people or whatever to order said miles they make slaves oneoff they are very specialized and small their customer base is surprisingly small there are many rich men and there are i suppose many depraved men but a house ryoval customer has to be a member of both sets and the overlap isnt as large as youd think anyway our contract was supposed to lead to a major production run far beyond ryovals capabilities a certain subplanetary government hardpressed by its neighbors wanted us to engineer a race of supersoldiers for them what again said miles i thought that had been tried more than once this time we thought we could do it or at least the bharaputran hierarchy was willing to take their money but the project suffered from too much input the client our own higherups the genetics project members everybody had ideas they were pushing i swear it was doomed before it ever got out of the design committee a supersoldier designed by a committee ye gods the mind boggles miless eyes were wide in fascination so then what happened it seemed to several of us that the physical limits of the merely human had already been reached once a say muscle system has been brought to perfect health stimulated with maximum hormones exercised to a certain limit thats all you can do so we turned to other species for special improvements i for instance became fascinated by the aerobic and anaerobic metabolism in the muscles of the thoroughbred horse what said thorne shocked there were other ideas too many i swear they werent all mine you mixed human and animal genes breathed miles why not human genes have been spliced into animals from the crude beginningsit was almost the first thing tried human insulin from bacteria and the like but till now no one dared do it in reverse i broke the barrier cracked the codes it looked good at first it was only when the first ones reached puberty that all the errors became fully apparent well it was only the initial trial they were meant to be formidable but they ended up monstrous tell me miles choked were there any actual combatexperienced soldiers on the committee i assume the client had them they supplied the parameters said canaba said thorne in a suffused voice i see they were trying to reinvent the enlisted man miles shot thorne a quelling glower and tapped his chrono dont let us interrupt doctor there was a short silence canaba began again we ran off ten prototypes then the client went out of business they lost their war why am i not surprised miles muttered under his breath funding was cut off the project was dropped before we could apply what we had learned from our mistakes of the ten prototypes nine have since died there was one left we were keeping it at the labs due to difficulties in boarding it out i placed my gene complexes in it they are there still the last thing i meant to do before i left was kill it a mercy a responsibility my expiation if you will and then prodded miles a few days ago it was suddenly sold to house ryoval as a novelty apparently baron ryoval collects oddities of all sorts for his tissue banks miles and bel exchanged a look i had no idea it was to be sold i came in in the morning and it was gone i dont think ryoval has any idea of its real value its there now as far as i know at ryovals facilities miles decided he was getting a sinus headache from the cold no doubt and what pray dyou want us soldiers to do about it get in there somehow kill it collect a tissue sample only then will i go with you and stomach twinges what both ears and the tail canaba gave miles a cold look the left gastrocnemius muscle thats where i injected my complexes these storage viruses arent virulent they wont have migrated far the greatest concentration should still be there i see miles rubbed his temples and pressed his eyes all right well take care of it this personal contact between us is very dangerous and id rather not repeat it plan to report to my ship in fortyeight hours will we have any trouble recognizing your critter i dont think so this particular specimen topped out at just over eight feet i want you to know the fangs were not my idea i see it can move very fast if its still in good health is there any help i can give you i have access to painless poisons youve done enough thank you please leave it to us professionals eh it would be best if its body can be destroyed entirely no cells remaining if you can thats why plasma arcs were invented youd best be on your way yes canaba hesitated admiral naismith yes i it might also be best if my future employer didnt learn about this they have intense military interests it might excite them unduly oh said milesadmiral naismithlieutenant lord vorkosigan of the barrayaran imperial service i dont think you have to worry about that is fortyeight hours enough for your commando raid canaba worried you understand if you dont get the tissue ill go right back downside i will not be trapped aboard your ship you will be happy its in my contract said miles now youd better get gone i must rely on you sir canaba nodded in suppressed anguish and withdrew they waited a few minutes in the cold room to let canaba put some distance between them the building creaked in the wind from an upper corridor echoed an odd shriek and later a laugh abruptly cut off the guard shadowing canaba returned he made it to his ground car all right sir well said thorne i suppose well need to get hold of a plan of ryovals facilities first i think not said miles if were to raid raid hell im not risking my men on anything so idiotic i said id slay his sin for him i didnt say how the commercial comconsole net at the downside shuttleport seemed as convenient as anything miles slid into the booth and fed the machine his credit card while thorne lurked just outside the viewing angle and the guards outside guarded he encoded the call in a moment the vid plate produced the image of a sweetfaced receptionist with dimples and a white fur crest instead of hair house ryoval customer services how may i help you sir id like to speak to manager deem in sales and demonstrations said miles smoothly about a possible purchase for my organization who may i say is calling admiral miles naismith dendarii free mercenary fleet one moment sir you really think theyll just sell it bel muttered from the side as the girls face was replaced by a flowing pattern of colored lights and some syrupy music remember what we overheard yesterday said miles im betting its on sale cheap he must try not to look too interested in a remarkably short time the colored glop gave way to the face of an astonishingly beautiful young man a blueeyed albino in a red silk shirt he had a huge livid bruise up one side of his white face this is manager deem may i help you admiral miles cleared his throat carefully a rumor has been brought to my attention that house ryoval may have recently acquired from house bharaputra an article of some professional interest to me supposedly it was the prototype of some sort of new improved fighting man do you know anything about it deems hand stole to his bruise and palpated it gently then twitched away indeed sir we do have such an article is it for sale oh ye i mean i think some arrangement is pending but it may still be possible to bid on it would it be possible for me to inspect it of course said deem with suppressed eagerness how soon there was a burst of static and the vid image split deems face abruptly shrinking to one side the new face was only too familiar bel hissed under its breath ill take this call deem said baron ryoval yes my lord deems eyes widened in surprise and he cut out ryovals image swelled to occupy the space available so betan ryoval smiled it appears i have something you want after all miles shrugged maybe he said neutrally if its in my price range i thought you gave all your money to fell miles spread his hands a good commander always has hidden reserves however the actual value of the item hasnt yet been established in fact its existence hasnt even been established oh it exists all right and it is impressive adding it to my collection was a unique pleasure id hate to give it up but for you ryoval smiled more broadly it may be possible to arrange a special cut rate he chuckled as at some secret pun that escaped miles a special cut throat is more like it oh i propose a simple trade said ryoval flesh for flesh you may overestimate my interest baron ryovals eyes glinted i dont think so he knows i wouldnt touch him with a stick if it werent something pretty compelling so name your proposal then ill trade you even bharaputras pet monsterah you should see it admiralfor three tissue samples three tissue samples that will if you are clever about it cost you nothing ryoval held up one finger one from your betan hermaphrodite a second finger one from yourself a third finger making a w and one from baron fells quaddie musician over in the corner bel thorne appeared to be suppressing an apopleptic fit quietly fortunately that third could prove extremely difficult to obtain said miles buying time to think less difficult for you than me said ryoval fell knows my agents my overtures have put him on guard you represent a unique opportunity to get in under that guard given sufficient motivation im certain its not beyond you mercenary given sufficient motivation very little is beyond me baron said miles semirandomly well then i shall expect to hear from you withinsaytwentyfour hours after that time my offer will be withdrawn ryoval nodded cheerfully good day admiral the vid blanked well then echoed miles well what said thorne with suspicion youre not actually seriously considering thatvile proposal are you what does he want my tissue sample for for gods sake miles wondered aloud for his dog and dwarf act no doubt said thorne nastily now now hed be dreadfully disappointed when my clone turned out to be six feet tall im afraid miles cleared his throat it wouldnt actually hurt anyone i suppose to take a small tissue sample whereas a commando raid risks lives bel leaned back against the wall and crossed its arms not true youd have to fight me for mine and hers miles grinned sourly so so so lets go find a map of ryovals flesh pit it seems were going hunting house ryovals palatial main biologicals facility wasnt a proper fortress just some guarded buildings some bloody big guarded buildings miles stood on the roof of the liftvan and studied the layout through his nightglasses fog droplets beaded in his hair the cold damp wind searched for chinks in his jacket much as he searched for chinks in ryovals security the white complex loomed against the dark forested mountainside its front gardens floodlit and fairylike in the fog and frost the utility entrances on the near side looked more promising miles nodded slowly to himself and climbed down off the rented liftvan artistically brokedown on the little mountain sidetrail overlooking ryovals he swung into the back out of the piercing wind all right people listen up his squad hunkered around as he set up the holovid map in the middle the colored lights of the display sheened their faces tall ensign murka thornes secondincommand and two big troopers sergeant laureen anderson was the van driver assigned to outside backup along with trooper sandy hereld and captain thorne miles harbored a secret barrayaran prejudice against taking female troops inside ryovals that he trusted he concealed it went double for bel thorne not that ones sex would necessarily make any difference to the adventures that might follow in the event of capture if even a tenth of the bizarre rumors hed heard were true nevertheless laureen claimed to be able to fly any vehicle made by man through the eye of a needle not that miles figured shed ever done anything so domestic as thread a needle in her life she would not question her assignment our main problem remains that we still dont know where exactly in this facility bharaputras creature is being kept so first we penetrate the fence the outer courts and the main building here and here a red thread of light traced their projected route at miless touch on the control board then we quietly pick up an inside employee and fastpenta him from that point on were racing time since we must assume hell be promptly missed the key word is quietly we didnt come here to kill people and we are not at war with ryovals employees you carry your stunners and keep those plasma arcs and the rest of the toys packed till we locate our quarry we dispatch it fast and quietly i get my sample his hand touched his jacket beneath which rested the collection case that would keep the tissue alive till they got back to the ariel then we fly if anything goes wrong before i get that very expensive cut of meat we dont bother to fight our way out not worth it they have peculiar summary ways of dealing with murder charges here and i dont see the need for any of us to end up as spare parts in ryovals tissue banks we wait for captain thorne to arrange a ransom and then try something else we hold a lever or two on ryoval in case of emergencies dire emergencies bel muttered if anything goes wrong after the butchermission is accomplished its back to combat rules that sample will then be irreplaceable and must be got back to captain thorne at all costs laureen you sure of our emergency pickup spot yes sir she pointed on the vid display everybody else got that any questions suggestions lastminute observations communications check then captain thorne their wrist comms all appeared to be in good working order ensign murka shrugged on the weapons pack miles carefully pocketed the blueprint map cube that cost them a nearransom from a certain pliable construction company just a few hours ago the four members of the penetration team slipped from the van and merged with the frosty darkness they slunk off through the woods the frozen crunchy layer of plant detritus tended to slide underfoot exposing a layer of slick mud murka spotted a spy eye before it spotted them and blinded it with a brief burst of microwave static while they scurried past the useful big guys made short work of boosting miles over the wall miles tried not to think about the ancient pub sport of dwarf tossing the inner court was stark and utilitarian loading docks with big locked doors rubbish collection bays and a few parked vehicles footsteps echoed and they ducked down in a rubbish bay a redclad guard passed slowly waving an infrared scanner they crouched and hid their faces in their infrared blank ponchos looking like so many bags of garbage no doubt then it was tiptoe up to the loading docks ducts the key to ryovals facility had turned out to be ducts for heating for access to poweroptics cables for the comm system narrow ducts quite impassable to a big guy miles slipped out of his poncho and gave it to a trooper to fold and pack miles balanced on murkas shoulders and cut his way through the first ductlet a ventilation grille high on the wall above the loading dock doors miles handed the grille down silently and after a quick visual scan for unwanted company slithered through it was a tight fit even for him he let himself down gently to the concrete floor found the door control box shorted the alarm and raised the door about a meter his team rolled through and he let the door back down as quietly as he could so far so good they hadnt yet had to exchange a word they made it to cover on the far side of the receiving bay just before a redcoveralled employee wandered through driving an electric cart loaded with cleaning robots murka touched miless sleeve and looked his inquirythis one miles shook his head not yet a maintenance man seemed less likely than an employee from the inner sanctum to know where their quarry was kept and they didnt have time to litter the place with the unconscious bodies of false trials they found the tunnel to the main building just as the map cube promised the door at the end was locked as expected it was up on murkas shoulders again a quick zizz of miless cutters loosened a panel in the ceiling and he crawled throughthe frail supporting framework would surely not have held a man of greater weightand found the power cables running to the door lock he was just looking over the problem and pulling tools out of his pocketed uniform jacket when murkas hand reached up to thrust the weapons pack beside him and quietly pull the panel back into place miles flung himself to his belly and pressed his eye to the crack as a voice from down the corridor bellowed freeze swear words screamed through miless head he clamped his jaw on them he looked down on the tops of his troopers heads in a moment they were surrounded by halfadozen redclad blacktrousered armed guards what are you doing here snarled the guard sergeant oh shit cried murka please mister dont tell my co you caught us in here hed bust me back to private huh said the guard sergeant he prodded murka with his weapon a lethal nerve disrupter hands up who are you mnames murka we came in on a mercenary ship to fell station but the captain wouldnt grant us downside passes think of itwe come all the way to jacksons whole and the sonofabitch wouldnt let us go downside bloody puredick wouldnt let us see ryovals the redtunicd guards were doing a fast scanandsearch none too gently and finding only stunners and the portion of securitypenetration devices that murka had carried i made a bet we could get in even if we couldnt afford the front door murkas mouth turned down in great discouragement looks like i lost looks like you did growled the guard sergeant drawing back one of his men held up the thin collection of baubles theyd stripped off the dendarii theyre not equipped like an assassination team he observed murka drew himself up looking wonderfully offended we arent the guard sergeant turned over a stunner awol are you not if we make it back before midnight murkas tone went wheedling look m cos a right bastard suppose theres any way you could see your way clear that he doesnt find out about this one of murkas hands drifted suggestively past his wallet pocket the guard sergeant looked him up and down smirking maybe miles listened with openmouthed delight murka if this works im promoting you murka paused any chance of seeing inside first not the girls even just the place so i could say that id seen it this isnt a whorehouse soldier boy snapped the guard sergeant murka looked stunned what this is the biologicals facility oh said murka you idiot one of the troopers put in on cue miles sprinkled silent blessings down upon his head none of the three so much as flicked an eyeball upward but the man in town told me began murka what man said the guard sergeant the man who took mmoney said murka a couple of redtunicd guards were beginning to grin the guard sergeant prodded murka with his nerve disrupter get going soldier boy back that way this is your lucky day you mean we get to see inside said murka hopefully no said the guard sergeant i mean we arent going to break both your legs before we throw you out on your ass he paused and added more kindly theres a whorehouse back in town he slipped murkas wallet out of his pocket checked the name on the credit card and put it back and removed all the loose currency the guards did the same to the outragedlooking troopers dividing the assorted cash up among them they take credit cards and youve still got till midnight now move and so miless squad was chivvied ignominiously but intact down the tunnel miles waited till the whole mob was well out of earshot before keying his wrist comm bel yes came back the instant reply trouble murka and the troops were just picked up by ryovals security i believe the boy genius has just managed to bullshit them into throwing them out the back door instead of rendering them down for parts ill follow as soon as i can well rendezvous and regroup for another try miles paused this was a total bust they were now worse off than when theyd started ryovals security would be stirred up for the rest of the long jacksonian night he added to the comm im going to see if i cant at least find out the location of the critter before i withdraw should improve our chances of success next round bel swore in a heartfelt tone be careful you bet watch for murka and the boys naismith out once hed identified the right cables it was the work of a moment to make the door slide open he then had an interesting dangle by his fingertips while coaxing the ceiling panel to fall back into place before he dropped from maximum downward extension fearful for his bones nothing broke he slipped across the portal to the main building and took to the ducts as soon as possible the corridors having been proved dangerous he lay on his back in the narrow tube and balanced the blueprint holocube on his belly picking out a new and safer route not necessarily passable to a couple of husky troopers and where did one look for a monster a closet it was at about the third turn inching his way through the system dragging the weapon pack that he became aware that the territory no longer matched the map hell and damnation were these changes in the system since its construction or a subtly sabotaged map well no matter he wasnt really lost he could still retrace his route he crawled along for about thirty minutes discovering and disarming two alarm sensors before they discovered him the time factor was getting seriously pressing soon he would have toah there he peered through a vent grille into a dim room filled with holovid and communications equipment small repairs the map cube named it it didnt look like a repairs shop another change since ryoval had moved in but a man sat alone with his back to miless wall perfect too good to pass up breathing silently moving slowly miles eased his dartgun out of the pack and made sure he loaded it with the right cartridge fastpenta spiked with a paralyzer a lovely cocktail blended for the purpose by the ariels medtech he sighted through the grille aimed the needlenose of the dart gun with tense precision and fired bullseye the man slapped the back of his neck once and sat still hand falling nervelessly to his side miles grinned briefly cut his way through the grille and lowered himself to the floor the man was welldressed in civiliantype clothesone of the scientists perhaps he lolled in his chair a little smile playing around his lips and stared with unalarmed interest at miles he started to fall over miles caught him and propped him back upright sit up now thats right you cant talk with your face in the carpet now can you nooo the man bobbled his head and smiled agreeably do you know anything about a genetic construct a monstrous creature just recently bought from house bharaputra and brought to this facility the man blinked and smiled yes fastpenta subjects did tend to be literal miles reminded himself where is it being kept downstairs where exactly downstairs in the subbasement the crawlspace around the foundations we were hoping it would catch some of the rats you see the man giggled do cats eat rats do rats eat cats miles checked his mapcube yes that looked good in terms of the penetration team getting in and out though it was still a large search area broken up into a maze by structural elements running down into the bedrock and speciallyset lowvibration support columns running up into the laboratories at the lower edge where the mountainside sloped away the space ran highceilinged and very near the surface a possible breakout point the space thinned to headcracking narrowness and then to bedrock at the back where the building wedged into the slope all right miles opened his dart case to find something that would lay his victim out cold and nonquestionable for the rest of the night the man pawed at him and his sleeve slipped back to reveal a wristcomm almost as thick and complex as miless own a light blinked on it miles looked at the device suddenly uneasy this room by the way who are you moglia chief of security ryoval biologicals the man recited happily at your service sir oh indeed you are miless suddenlythick fingers scrabbled faster in his dart case damn damn damn the door burst open freeze mister miles hit the tightbeam alarmselfdestruct on his own wrist comm and flung his hands up and the wrist comm off in one swift motion not by chance moglia sat between miles and the door inhibiting the trigger reflexes of the entering guards the comm melted as it arced through the airno chance of ryoval security tracing the outside squad through it now and bel would at least know something had gone wrong the security chief chuckled to himself temporarily fascinated by the task of counting his own fingers the redclad guard sergeant backed by his squad thundered into what was now screamingly obvious to miles as the security operations room to jerk miles around slam him facefirst into the wall and begin frisking him with vicious efficiency within moments he had separated miles from a clanking pile of incriminating equipment his jacket boots and belt miles clutched the wall and shivered with the pain of several expertlyapplied nerve jabs and the swift reversal of his fortune the security chief when unpentad at last was not at all pleased with the guard sergeants confession about the three uniformed men he had let go with a fine earlier in the evening he put the whole guard shift on full alert and sent an armed squad out to try and trace the escaped dendarii then with an apprehensive expression on his face very like the guardsergeants during his mortified admission compounded with sour satisfaction contemplating miles and druginduced nauseahe made a vid call my lord said the security chief carefully what is it moglia baron ryovals face was sleepy and irritated sorry to disturb you sir but i thought you might like to know about the intruder we just caught here not an ordinary thief judging from his clothes and equipment strangelooking fellow sort of a tall dwarf he squeezed in through the ducts moglia held up tissuecollection kit chipdriven alarmdisarming tools and miless weapons by way of evidence the guard sergeant bundled miles stumbling into range of the vids pickup he was asking a lot of questions about bharaputras monster ryovals lips parted then his eyes lit and he threw back his head and laughed i should have guessed stealing when you should be buying admiral he chortled oh very good moglia the security chief looked fractionally less nervous do you know this little mutant my lord yes indeed he calls himself miles naismith a mercenarybills himself as an admiral selfpromoted no doubt excellent work moglia hold him and ill be there in the morning and deal with him personally hold him how sir ryoval shrugged amuse yourselves freely when ryovals image faded miles found himself pinned between the speculative glowers of both the security chief and the guard sergeant just to relieve feelings a burly guard held miles while the security chief delivered a blow to his belly but the chief was still too ill to really enjoy this as he should came to see bharaputras toy soldier did you he gasped rubbing his own stomach the guard sergeant caught his chiefs eye you know i think we should give him his wish the security chief smothered a belch and smiled as at a beatific vision yes miles praying they wouldnt break his arms found himself being frogmarched down a complex of corridors and lift tubes by the burly guard followed by the sergeant and the chief they took a last lifttube to the very bottom a dusty basement crowded with stored and discarded equipment and supplies they made their way to a locked hatch set in the floor it swung open on a metal ladder descending into obscurity the last thing we threw down there was a rat the guard sergeant informed miles cordially nine bit its head right off nine gets very hungry got a metabolism like an ore furnace the guard forced miles onto the ladder and down it a meter or so by the simple expedient of striking at his clinging hands with a truncheon miles hung just out of range of the stick eyeing the dimly lit stone below the rest was pillars and shadows and a cold dankness nine called the guard sergeant into the echoing darkness nine dinner come and catch it the security chief laughed mockingly then clutched his head and groaned under his breath ryoval had said hed deal with miles personally in the morning surely the guards understood their boss wanted a live prisoner didnt they didnt he is this the dungeon miles spat blood and peered around no no just a basement the guard sergeant assured him cheerily the dungeon is for the paying customers heh heh heh still chortling at his own humor he kicked the hatch closed the chink of the locking mechanism rained down then silence the bars of the ladder bit chill through miless socks he hooked an arm around an upright and tucked one hand into the armpit of his black tshirt to warm it briefly his grey trousers had been emptied of everything but a ration bar his handkerchief and his legs he clung there for a long time going up was futile going down singularly uninviting eventually the startling ganglial pain began to dull and the shaking physical shock to wear off still he clung cold it could have been worse miles reflected the sergeant and his squad could have decided they wanted to play lawrence of arabia and the six turks commodore tung miless dendarii chief of staff and a certified military history nut had been plying miles with a series of classic military memoirs lately how had colonel lawrence escaped an analogous tight spot ah yes played dumb and persuaded his captors to throw him out in the mud tung must have pressed that bookfax on murka too the darkness miles discovered as his eyes adjusted was only relative faint luminescent panels in the ceiling here and there shed a sickly yellow glow he descended the last two meters to stand on solid rock he pictured the newsfax back home on barrayarbody of imperial officer found in fleshczars dream palace death from exhaustio dammit this wasnt the glorious sacrifice in the emperors service hed once vowed to risk this was just embarrassing maybe bharaputras creature would eat the evidence with this morose comfort in mind he began to limp from pillar to pillar pausing listening looking around maybe there was another ladder somewhere maybe there was a hatch someone had forgotten to lock maybe there was still hope maybe there was something moving in the shadows just beyond that pillar miless breath froze then eased again as the movement materialized into a fat albino rat the size of an armadillo it shied as it saw him and waddled rapidly away its claws clicking on the rock only an escaped lab rat a bloody big rat but still only a rat the huge rippling shadow struck out of nowhere at incredible speed it grabbed the rat by its tail and swung it squealing against a pillar dashing out its brains with a crunch a flash of a thick clawlike fingernail and the white furry body was ripped open from sternum to tail frantic fingers peeled the skin away from the rats body as blood splattered miles first saw the fangs as they bit and tore and buried themselves in the rats tissues they were functional fangs not just decorative set in a protruding jaw with long lips and a wide mouth yet the total effect was lupine rather than simian a flat nose ridged powerful brows high cheekbones hair a dark matted mess and yes fully eight feet tall a rangy tensemuscled body climbing back up the ladder would do no good the creature could pluck him right off and swing him just like the rat levitate up the side of a pillar oh for suctioncup fingers and toes something the bioengineering committee had missed somehow freeze and play invisible miles settled on this last defense by defaulthe was paralyzed with terror the big feet bare on the cold rock also had clawlike toenails but the creature was dressed in clothes made of green labcloth a belted kimonolike coat and loose trousers and one other thing they didn t tell me it was female she was almost finished with the rat when she looked up and saw miles bloodyfaced bloodyhanded she froze as still as he in a spastic motion miles whipped the squashed ration bar from his trouser thighpocket and extended it toward her in his outstretched hand dessert he smiled hysterically dropping the rats stripped carcass she snatched the bar out of his hand ripped off the cover and devoured it in four bites then she stepped forward grabbed him by an arm and his black tshirt and lifted him up to her face the clawed fingers bit into his skin and his feet dangled in air her breath was about what he would have guessed her eyes were raw and burning water she croaked they didnt tell me she talked um umwater squeaked miles quite there ought to be water around herelook up at the ceiling all those pipes if youll um put me down good girl ill try and spot a water pipe or something slowly she lowered him back to his feet and released him he backed carefully away his hands held out open at his sides he cleared his throat and tried to bring his voice back down to a low soothing tone lets try over here the ceiling gets lower or rather the bedrock rises over near that light panel there that thin composite plastic tubewhites the usual colorcode for water we dont want grey thats sewage or red thats the poweroptics no telling what she understood tone was everything with creatures if you uh could hold me up on your shoulders like ensign murka i could have a go at loosening that joint there he made pantomime gestures uncertain if anything was getting through to whatever intelligence lay behind those terrible eyes the bloody hands easily twice the size of his own grabbed him abruptly by the hips and boosted him upward he clutched the white pipe inched along it to a screwjoint her thick shoulders beneath his feet moved along under him her muscles trembled it wasnt all his own shaking the joint was tighthe needed toolshe turned with all his strength in danger of snapping his fragile finger bones suddenly the joint squeaked and slid it gave the plastic collar was moving water began to spray between his fingers one more turn and it sheared apart and water arced in a bright stream down onto the rock beneath she almost dropped him in her haste she put her mouth under the stream wide open let the water splash straight in and all over her face coughing and guzzling even more frantically than shed gone at the rat she drank and drank and drank she let it run over her hands her face and head washing away the blood and then drank some more miles began to think shed never quit but at last she backed away and pushed her wet hair out of her eyes and stared down at him she stared at him for what seemed like a full minute then suddenly roared cold miles jumped ah cold right me too my socks are wet heat you want heat lessee uh lets try back this way where the ceilings lower no point here the heat would all collect up there out of reach no good she followed him with all the intensity of a cat tracking a well rat as he skittered around pillars to where the crawl spaces floor rose to genuine crawlheight about four feet there that one that was the lowest pipe he could find if we could get this open he pointed to a plastic pipe about as big around as his waist its full of hot air being pumped along under pressure no handy joints though this time he stared at his puzzle trying to think this composite plastic was extremely strong she crouched and pulled then lay on her back and kicked up at it then looked at him quite woefully try this nervously he took her hand and guided it to the pipe and traced long scratches around the circumference with her hard nails she scratched and scratched then looked at him again as if to say this isnt working try kicking and pulling again now he suggested she must have weighed three hundred pounds and she put it all behind the next effort kicking then grabbing the pipe planting her feet on the ceiling and arching with all her strength the pipe split along the scratches she fell with it to the floor and hot air began to hiss out she held her hands her face to it nearly wrapped herself around it sat on her knees and let it blow across her miles crouched down and stripped off his socks and flopped them over the warm pipe to dry now would be a good opportunity to run if only there were anywhere to run to but he was reluctant to let his prey out of his sight his prey he considered the incalculable value of her left calf muscle as she sat on the rock and buried her face in her knees they didnt tell me she wept he pulled out his regulation handkerchief an archaic square of cloth hed never understood the rationale for the idiotic handkerchief except perhaps that where soldiers went there would be weeping he handed it to her here mop your eyes with this she took it and blew her big flat nose in it and made to hand it back keep it miles said uh what do they call you i wonder nine she growled not hostile it was just the way her strained voice came out of that big throat what do they call you good god a complete sentence miles blinked admiral miles naismith he arranged himself crosslegged she looked up transfixed a soldier a real officer and then more doubtfully as if seeing him in detail for the first time you miles cleared his throat firmly quite real a bit down on my luck just at the moment he admitted me too she said glumly and sniffled i dont know how long ive been in this basement but that was my first drink three days i think said miles have they not ah given you any food either no she frowned the effect with the fangs was quite overpowering this is worse than anything they did to me in the lab and i thought that was bad its not what you dont know thatll hurt you the old saying went its what you do know that isnt so miles thought of his map cube miles looked at nine miles pictured himself taking this entire missions carefullyworkedout strategy plan delicately between thumb and forefinger and flushing it down a wastedisposal unit the ductwork in the ceiling niggled at his imagination nine would never fit through it she clawed her wild hair away from her face and stared at him with renewed fierceness her eyes were a strange light hazel adding to the wolfish effect what are you really doing here is this another test no this is real life miless lips twitched i ah made a mistake guess i did too she said lowering her head miles pulled at his lip and studied her through narrowed eyes what sort of life have you had i wonder he mused half to himself she answered literally i lived with hired fosterers till i was eight like the clones do then i started to get big and clumsy and break thingsthey brought me to live at the lab after that it was all right i was warm and had plenty to eat they cant have simplified you too much if they seriously intended you to be a soldier i wonder what your iq is he speculated a hundred and thirtyfive miles fought off stunned paralysis i see did you ever get any training she shrugged i took a lot of tests they were ok except for the aggression experiments i dont like electric shocks she brooded a moment i dont like experimental psychologists either they lie a lot her shoulders slumped anyway i failed we all failed how can they know if you failed if you never had any proper training miles said scornfully soldiering entails some of the most complex cooperative learned behavior ever inventedive been studying strategy and tactics for years and i dont know half yet its all up here he pressed his hands urgently to his head she looked across at him sharply if thats so she turned her huge clawed hands over staring at them then why did they do this to me miles stopped short his throat was strangely dry so admirals lie too sometimes even to themselves after an unsettled pause he asked did you never think of breaking open a water pipe youre punished for breaking things or i was maybe not you youre human did you ever think of escaping breaking out its a soldiers duty when captured by the enemy to escape survive escape sabotage in that order enemy she looked upward at the whole weight of house ryoval pressing overhead who are my friends ah yes there is that point and where would an eightfoottall genetic cocktail with fangs run to he took a deep breath no question what his next move must be duty expediency survival all compelled it your friends are closer than you think why do you think i came here why indeed she shot him a silent puzzled frown i came for you id heard of you im recruiting or i was things went wrong and now im escaping but if you came with me you could join the dendarii mercenaries a top outfitalways looking for a few good men or whatever i have this mastersergeant who who needs a recruit like you too true sergeant dyeb was infamous for his sour attitude about women soldiers insisting that they were too soft any female recruit who survived his course came out with her aggression highly developed miles pictured dyeb being dangled by his toes from a height of about eight feet he controlled his runaway imagination in favor of concentration on the present crisis nine was looking unimpressed very funny she said coldly making miles wonder for a wild moment if shed been equipped with the telepathy gene complexno she predated thatbut im not even human or hadnt you heard miles shrugged carefully human is as human does he forced himself to reach out and touch her damp cheek animals dont weep nine she jerked as from an electric shock animals dont lie humans do all the time not all the time he hoped the light was too dim for her to see the flush in his face she was watching his face intently prove it she tilted her head as she sat crosslegged her pale gold eyes were suddenly burning speculative uh sure how take off your clothes what take off your clothes and lie down with me as humans do men and women her hand reached out to touch his throat the pressing claws made little wells in his flesh blrp choked miles his eyes felt wide as saucers a little more pressure and those wells would spring forth red fountains i am about to die she stared into his face with a strange frightening bottomless hunger then abruptly she released him he sprang up and cracked his head on the low ceiling and dropped back down the stars in his eyes unrelated to love at first sight her lips wrinkled back on a fanged groan of despair ugly she wailed her clawed nails raked across her cheeks leaving red furrows too ugly animal you dont think im human she seemed to swell with some destructive resolve no no no gibbered miles lurching to his knees and grabbing her hands and pulling them down its not that its just uhhow old are you anyway sixteen sixteen god he remembered sixteen sexobsessed and dying inside every minute a horrible age to be trapped in a twisted fragile abnormal body god only knew how he had survived his own selfhatred then nohe remembered how hed been saved by one who loved him arent you a little young for this he tried hopefully how old were you fifteen he admitted before thinking to lie but it was traumatic didnt work out at all in the long run her claws turned toward her face again dont do that he cried hanging on it reminded him entirely too much of the episode of sergeant bothari and the knife the sergeant had taken miless knife away from him by superior force not an option open to miles here will you calm down he yelled at her she hesitated its just that uh an officer and gentleman doesnt just fling himself onto his lady on the bare ground one one sits down gets comfortable has a little conversation drinks a little wine plays a little music slows down youre hardly warm yet here sit over here where its warmest he positioned her nearer the broken duct got up on his knees behind her tried rubbing her neck and shoulders her muscles were tense they felt like rocks under his thumbs any attempt on his part to strangle her would clearly be futile i cant believe this trapped in ryovals basement with a sexstarved teenage werewolf there was nothing about this in any of my imperial training manuals he remembered his mission which was to get her left calf muscle back to the ariel alive dr canaba if i survive you and i are going to have a little talk about this her voice was muffled with grief and the odd shape of her mouth you think im too tall not at all he was getting hold of himself a bit he could lie faster i adore tall women ask anyone who knows me besides i made the happy discovery some time back that height difference only matters when were standing up when were lying down its ah less of a problem a rapid mental review of everything hed ever learned by trial and error mostly error about women was streaming uninvited through his mind it was harrowing what did women want he shifted around and took her hand earnestly she stared back equally earnestly waiting for instruction at this point the realization came over miles that he was facing his first virgin he smiled at her in total paralysis for several seconds nine youve never done this before have you ive seen vids she frowned introspectively they usually start with kisses but a vague gesture toward her misshapen mouth maybe you dont want to miles tried not to think about the late rat shed been systematically starved after all vids can be very misleading for women especially the first timeit takes practice to learn your own body responses woman friends have told me im afraid i might hurt you and then youll disembowel me she gazed into his eyes thats all right i have a very high pain threshold but i dont this was mad she was mad he was mad yet he could feel a creeping fascination for thepropositionrising from his belly to his brain like a fey fog no doubt about it she was the tallest female thing he was ever likely to meet more than one woman of his acquaintance had accused him of wanting to go mountainclimbing he could get that out of his system once for all damn i do believe shed clean up good she was not without a certain charm was not the wordwhatever beauty there was to be found in the strong the swift the leanly athletic the functioning form once you got used to the scale of it she radiated a smooth heat he could feel from hereanimal magnetism the suppressed observer in the back of his brain supplied power whatever else it was it would certainly be astonishing one of his mothers favorite aphorisms drifted through his head anything worth doing she always said is worth doing well dizzy as a drunkard he abandoned the crutch of logic for the wings of inspiration well then doctor he heard himself muttering insanely let us experiment kissing a woman with fangs was indeed a novel sensation being kissed backshe was clearly a fast learnerwas even more novel her arms circled him ecstatically and from that point on he lost control of the situation somehow though some time later coming up for air he did look up to ask nine have you ever heard of the black widow spider no what is it never mind he said airily it was all very awkward and clumsy but sincere and when he was done the water in her eyes was from joy not pain she seemed enormously how else pleased with him he was so unstrung he actually fell asleep for a few minutes pillowed on her body he woke up laughing you really do have the most elegant cheekbones he told her tracing their line with one finger she leaned into his touch cuddled up equally to him and the heat pipe theres a woman on my ship who wears her hair in a sort of woven braid in the backit would look just great on you maybe she could teach you how she pulled a wad of her hair forward and looked crosseyed at it as if trying to see past the coarse tangles and filth she touched his face in turn you are very handsome admiral huh me he ran a hand over the nights beard stubble sharp features the old pain lines she must be blinded by my putative rank eh your face is very alive and your eyes see what theyre looking at nine he cleared his throat paused dammit thats not a name thats a number what happened to ten he died maybe i will too her strangecolored eyes added silently before her lids shuttered them is nine all they ever called you theres a long biocomputer codestring thats my actual designation well we all have serial numbers miles had two now that he thought of it but this is absurd i cant call you nine like some robot you need a proper name a name that fits you he leaned back onto her warm bare shouldershe was like a furnace they had spoken truly about her metabolismand his lips drew back on a slow grin taura taura her long mouth gave it a skewed and lilting accent its too beautiful for me taura he repeated firmly beautiful but strong full of secret meaning perfect ah speaking of secrets was now the time to tell her about what dr canaba had planted in her left calf or would she be hurt as someone falsely courted for her moneyor his title miles faltered i think now that we know each other better that its time for us to blow out of this place she stared around into the grim dimness how well thats what we have to figure out eh i confess ducts rather spring to my mind not the heat pipe obviously hed have to go anorexic for months to fit in it besides hed cook he shook out and pulled on his black tshirthed put on his trousers immediately after hed woke that stone floor sucked heat remorselessly from any flesh that touched itand creaked to his feet god he was getting too old for this sort of thing already the sixteenyearold clearly possessed the physical resilience of a minor goddess what was it hed gotten into at sixteen sand that was it he winced in memory of what it had done to certain sensitive body folds and crevices maybe cold stone wasnt so bad after all she pulled her pale green coat and trousers out from under herself dressed and followed him in a crouch until the space was sufficient for her to stand upright they quartered and requartered the underground chamber there were four ladders with hatches all locked there was a locked vehicle exit to the outside on the downslope side a direct breakout might be simplest but if he couldnt make immediate contact with thorne it was a twentysevenkilometer hike to the nearest town in the snow in his sock feether bare feet and if they got there he wouldnt be able to use the vidnet anyway because his credit card was still locked in the security ops office upstairs asking for charity in ryovals town was a dubious proposition so break straight out and be sorry later or linger and try to equip themselves risking recapture and be sorry sooner tactical decisions were such fun ducts won miles pointed upward to the most likely one think you can break that open and boost me in he asked taura she studied it nodded slowly the expression closing on her face she stretched up and moved along to a soft metal clad joint slipped her clawhard fingernails under the strip and yanked it off she worked her fingers into the exposed slot and hung on it as if chinning herself the duct bent open under her weight there you go she said she lifted him up as easily as a child and he squirmed into the duct this one was a particularly close fit though it was the largest he had spotted as accessible in this ceiling he inched along it on his back he had to stop twice to suppress a residual hysteriatinged laughing fit the duct curved upward and he slithered around the curve in the darkness only to find that it split here into a y each branch halfsized he cursed and backed out taura had her face turned up to him an unusual angle of view no good that way he gasped reversing direction gymnastically at the gap he headed the other way this too curved up but within moments he found a grille a tightlyfitted unbudgable unbreakable and with his bare hands uncuttable grille taura might have the strength to rip it out of the wall but taura couldnt fit through the duct to reach it he contemplated it a few moments right he muttered and backed out again so much for ducts he reported to taura uh could you help me down she lowered him to the floor and he dusted himself futilely lets look around some more she followed him docilely enough though something in her expression hinted she might be losing faith in his admiralness a bit of detailing on a column caught his eye and he went to take a closer look in the dim light it was one of the lowvibration support columns two meters in diameter set deep in the bedrock in a well of fluid it ran straight up to one of the labs no doubt to provide an ultrastable base for certain kinds of crystal generation projects and the like miles rapped on the side of the column it rang hollow ah yes makes sense concrete doesnt float too well eh a groove in the side outlined an access port he ran his fingers around it probing there was a concealed something he stretched his arms and found a twin spot on the opposite side the spots yielded slowly to the hard pressure of his thumbs there was a sudden pop and hiss and the whole panel came away he staggered and barely kept from dropping it down the hole he turned it sideways and drew it out well well miles grinned he stuck his head through the port looked down and up black as pitch rather gingerly he reached his arm in and felt around there was a ladder running up the damp inside for access for cleaning and repairs the whole column could apparently be filled with fluid of whatever density at need filled it would have been selfpressuresealed and unopenable carefully he examined the inner edge of the hatch openable from either side by god lets go see if theres any more of these further up it was slow going feeling for more grooves as they ascended in the blackness miles tried not to think about the fall should he slip from the slimy ladder tauras deep breathing below him was actually rather comforting they had gone up perhaps three stories when miless chilled and numbing fingers found another groove hed almost missed it it was on the opposite side of the ladder from the first he then discovered the hard way that he didnt have nearly the reach to keep one arm hooked around the ladder and press both release catches at the same time after a terrifying slip trying he clung spasmodically to the ladder till his heart stopped pounding taura he croaked ill move up and you try it not much up was left the column ended a meter or so above his head her extra arm length was all that was neededthe catches surrendered to her big hands with a squeak of protest what do you see miles whispered big dark room maybe a lab makes sense climb back down and put that lower panel back on no sense advertising where we went miles slipped through the hatch into the darkened laboratory while taura accomplished her chore he dared not switch on a light in the windowless room but a few instrument readouts on the benches and walls gave enough ghostly glow for his darkadapted eyes that at least he didnt trip over anything one glass door led to a hallway a heavily electronicallymonitored hallway with his nose pressed to the glass miles saw a red shape flit past a crosscorridor guards here what did they guard taura oozed out of the access hatch to the columnwith difficulty and sat down heavily on the floor her face in her hands concerned miles nipped back to her you all right she shook her head no hungry what already that was supposed to be a twentyfour hour rater ration bar not to mention the two or three kilos of meat shed had for an appetizer for you maybe she wheezed she was shaking miles began to see why canaba had dubbed his project a failure imagine trying to feed a whole army of such appetites napoleon would quail maybe the rawboned kid was still growing daunting thought there was a refrigerator at the back of the lab if he knew lab techs ah ha indeed in among the test tubes was a package with half a sandwich and a large if bruised pear he handed them to taura she looked vastly impressed as if hed conjured them from his sleeve by magic and devoured them at once and grew less pale miles foraged further for his troop alas the only other organics in the fridge were little covered dishes of gelatinous stuff with unpleasant multicolored fuzz growing in them but there were three big shiny walkin wall freezers lined up in a row miles peered through a glass square in one thick door and risked pressing the wall pad that turned on the light inside within were row on row on row of labelled drawers full of clear plastic trays frozen samples of some kind thousandsmiles looked again and calculated more carefully hundreds of thousands he glanced at the lighted control panel by the freezer drawer the temperature inside was that of liquid nitrogen three freezers millions of miles sat down abruptly on the floor himself taura do you know where we are he whispered intensely sorry no she whispered back creeping over that was a rhetorical question i know where we are where ryovals treasure chamber what that miles jerked his thumb at the freezer is the barons hundredyearold tissue collection my god its value is almost incalculable every unique irreplaceable mutant bizarre bit hes begged bought borrowed or stolen for the last threefourths of a century all lined up in neat little rows waiting to be thawed and cultured and cooked up into some poor new slave this is the living heart of his whole human biologicals operation miles sprang to his feet and pored over the control panels his heart raced and he breathed openmouthed laughing silently feeling almost like he was about to pass out oh shit oh god he stopped swallowed could it be done these freezers had to have an alarm system monitors surely piped up to security ops at the very least yes there was a complex device for opening the doorthat was fine he didnt want to open the door he left it untouched it was systems readout he was after if he could bugger up just one sensor was the thing broadcastoutput to several outside monitor locations or did they run an optic thread to just one the lab benches supplied him with a small hand light and drawers and drawers of assorted tools and supplies taura watched him in puzzlement as he darted here there taking inventory the freezer monitor was broadcastoutput inaccessible could he hit it on the input side he levered off a smokedark plastic cover as silently as he could there there the optic thread came out of the wall pumping continuous information about the freezers interior environment it fit into a simple standard receiver plug on the more daunting black box that controlled the door alarm thered been a whole drawer full of assorted optic threads with various ends and yadaptors out of the spaghettitangle he drew what he needed discarding several with broken ends or other damage there were three optical data recorders in the drawer two didnt work the third did a quick festoon of optic thread a swift unplugging and plugging and he had one freezer talking to two control boxes he set the freed thread to talking to the datacorder he simply had to chance the blip during transfer if anyone checked theyd find all seemed well again he gave the datacorder several minutes to develop a nice continuous replay loop crouching very still with even the tiny hand light extinguished taura waited with the patience of a predator making no noise one two three and he set the datacorder to talking to all three control boxes the real thread plugs hung forlornly loose would it work there were no alarms going off no thundering herd of irate security troops taura come here she loomed beside him baffled have you ever met baron ryoval asked miles yes once when he came to buy me did you like him she gave him an areyououtofyourmind look yeah i didnt much care for him either restrained murder in point of fact he was now meltingly grateful for that restraint would you like to rip his lungs out if you could her clawed hands clenched try me good he smiled cheerily i want to give you your first lesson in tactics he pointed see that control the temperature in these freezers can be raised to almost degrees centigrade for heat sterilization during cleaning give me your finger one finger gently more gently than that he guided her hand the least possible pressure you can apply to the dial and still move now the next he pulled her to the next panel and the last he exhaled still not quite able to believe it and the lesson is he breathed its not how much force you use its where you apply it he resisted the urge to scrawl something like the dwarf strikes back across the front of the freezer with a flow pen the longer the baron in his mortal rage took to figure out who to pursue the better it would take several hours to bring all that mass in there from liquid nitrogen temperature up to welldone but if no one came in till morning shift the destruction would be absolute miles glanced at the time on the wall digital dear god hed spent a lot of time in that basement wellspent but still now he said to taura who was still meditating on the dial and her hand with her gold eyes glowing we have to get out of here now we really have to get out of here lest her next tactics lesson turn out to be dont blow up the bridge youre standing on miles allowed nervously contemplating the doorlocking mechanism more closely plus what lay beyondamong other things the soundactivated wallmounted monitors in the halls featured automatic laser firemiles almost went to turn the freezer temperatures back down his chipdriven dendarii tools now locked in the security ops office might barely have handled the complex circuitry in the priedopen control box but of course he couldnt get at his tools without his tools a nice paradox it shouldnt surprise miles that ryoval saved his most sophisticated alarm system for this labs one and only door but it made the room a much worse trap than even the subbasement he made another tour of the lab with the filched hand light checking drawers again no computerkeys came to hand but he did find a big crude pair of cutters in a drawer full of rings and clamps and bethought him of the duct grille that had lately defeated him in the basement so the passage up to this lab had merely been the illusion of progress toward escape theres no shame in a strategic retreat to a better position he whispered to taura when she balked at reentering the support columns dark tube this is a deadend here maybe literally the doubt in her tawny eyes was strangely unsettling a weight in his heart still dont trust me eh well maybe those who have been greatly betrayed need great proof stick with me kid he muttered under his breath swinging into the tube were going places her doubt was merely masked under lowered eyelids but she followed him sealing the hatch behind them with the hand light the descent was slightly less nasty than the ascent into the unknown had been there were no other exits to be found and shortly they stood on the stone they had started from miles checked the progress of their ceiling waterspout while taura drank again the splattering water ran off in a flat greasy trickle downslope given the vast size of the chamber it would be some days before the pool collecting slowly against the lower wall offered any useful strategic possibilities though there was always the hope it might do a bit to undermine the foundations taura boosted him back into the duct wish me luck he murmured over his shoulder muffled by the close confines goodbye she said he could not see the expression on her face there was none in her voice see you later he corrected firmly a few minutes of vigorous wriggling brought him back to his grille it opened onto a dark room stacked with stuff part of the basement proper quiet and unoccupied the snip of his cutters biting through the grille seemed loud enough to bring down ryovals entire security force but none appeared maybe the security chief was sleeping off his drug hangover a scrabbling noise not of miless own making echoed thinly through the duct and miles froze he flashed his light down a sidebranching tube twin red jewels flashed back the eyes of a huge rat he briefly considered trying to clout it and haul it back to taura no when they got back to the ariel hed give her a steak dinner two steak dinners the rat saved itself by turning and scampering away the grille parted at last and he squeezed into the storage room what time was it anyway late very late the room gave onto a corridor and on the floor at the end one of the access hatches gleamed dully miless heart rose in serious hope once hed got taura they must next try to reach a vehicle this hatch like the first was manual no sophisticated electronics to disarm it relocked automatically upon closing however miles jammed it with his clippers before descending the ladder he aimed his light aroundtaura he whispered where are you no immediate answer no glowing gold eyes flashing in the forest of pillars he was reluctant to shout he slapped down the rungs and began a silent fast trot through the chamber the cold stone draining the heat through his socks and making him long for his lost boots he came upon her sitting silently at the base of a pillar her head turned sideways resting on her knees her face was pensive sad really it didnt take long at all to begin reading the subtleties of feeling in her wolfish features time to march soldier girl miles said her head lifted you came back what did you think i was going to do of course i came back youre my recruit arent you she scrubbed her face with the back of a big pawhand miles corrected himself severelyand stood up and up guess i must be her outslung mouth smiled slightly if you didnt have a clue what the expression was it could look quite alarming ive got a hatch open weve got to try to get out of this main building back to the utility bay i saw several vehicles parked there earlier whats a little theft after with a sudden whine the outside vehicle entrance downslope to their right began to slide upward a rush of cold dry air swept through the dankness and a thin shaft of yellow dawn light made the shadows blue they shielded their eyes in the unexpected glare out of the bright squinting haze coalesced halfadozen redclad forms doubletiming it weapons at the ready tauras hand was tight on miless run he started to cry and bit back the shout no way could they outrun a nerve disrupter beam a weapon which at least two of the guards now carried miless breath hissed out through his teeth he was too infuriated even to swear theyd been so close security chief moglia sauntered up what still in one piece naismith he smirked unpleasantly nine must have finally realized its time to start cooperating eh nine miles squeezed her hand hard hoping the message would be properly understood as wait she lifted her chin guess so she said coldly its about time said moglia be a good girl and well take you upstairs and feed you breakfast after this good miless hand signalled she was watching him closely for cues now moglia prodded miles with his truncheon time to go dwarf your friends have actually made ransom surprised me miles was surprised himself he moved toward the exit still towing taura he didnt look at her did as little as possible to draw unwanted attention to their er togetherness while still maintaining it he let go of her hand as soon as their momentum was established what the hell miles thought as they emerged into the blinking dawn up the ramp and onto a circle of tarmac slick with glittering rime a most peculiar tableau was arranged there bel thorne and one dendarii trooper armed with stunners shifted uneasilynot prisoners half a dozen armed men in the green uniform of house fell stood at the ready a float truck emblazoned with fells logo was parked at the tarmacs edge and nicol the quaddie wrapped in white fur against the frost hovered in her float chair at the stunnerpoint of a big greenclad guard the light was grey and gold and chilly as the sun lifting over the dark mountains in the distance broke through the clouds is that the man you want the greenuniformed guard captain asked bel thorne thats him thornes face was white with an odd mixture of relief and distress admiral are you all right thorne called urgently its eyes widened taking in miless tall companion what the hells that she is recruittrainee taura miles said firmly hoping bel would unravel the several meanings packed in that sentence and ryovals guards wouldnt bel looked stunned so evidently miles had got at least partly through security chief moglia looked suspicious but baffled miles was clearly a problem moglia thought he was about to get rid of however and he thrust his bafflement aside to deal with the more important person of fells guard captain what is this miles hissed at bel sidling closer until a redclad guard lifted his nerve disrupter and shook his head moglia and fells captain were exchanging electronic data on a report panel heads bent together evidently the official documentation when we lost you last night i was in a panic bel pitched its voice low toward miles a frontal assault was out of the question so i ran to baron fell to ask for help but the help i got wasnt quite what i expected fell and ryoval cooked up a deal between them to exchange nicol for you i swear i only found out the details an hour ago bel protested at nicols thinlipped glower in its direction i see miles paused are we planning to refund her dollar sir bels voice was anguished we had no idea what was happening to you in there we were expecting ryoval to start beaming up a holocast of obscene and ingenious tortures starring you at any minute like commodore tung says on hemmedin ground use subterfuge miles recognized one of tungs favorite sun tzu aphorisms on bad days tung had a habit of quoting the yeardead general in the original chinese when tung was feeling benign they got a translation miles glanced around adding up weapons men equipment most of the green guards carried stunners thirteen to three four he glanced at nicol maybe five on desperate ground sun tzu advised fight could it get much more desperate than this ah said miles just what the devil did we offer baron fell in exchange for this extraordinary charity or is he doing it out of the goodness of his heart bel shot him an exasperated look then cleared its throat i promised youd tell him the real truth about the betan rejuvenation treatment bel thorne shrugged unhappily i thought once wed got you back wed figure something out but i never thought hed offer nicol to ryoval i swear down in the long valley miles could see a bead moving on the thin gleam of monorail the morning shift of bioengineers and technicians janitors and office clerks and cafeteria cooks was due to arrive soon miles glanced at the white building looming above pictured the scene to come in that third floor lab as the guards deactivated the alarms and let them in to work as the first one through the door sniffed and wrinkled his nose and said plaintively whats that awful smell has medtech vaughn signed aboard the ariel yet miles asked within the hour yeah well it turns out we didnt need to kill his fatted calf after all it comes with the package miles nodded toward taura bel lowered its voice still further thats coming with us youd better believe it vaughn didnt tell us everything to put it mildly ill explain later miles added as the two guard captains broke up their teteatete moglia swung his truncheon jauntily heading toward miles meantime you made a slight miscalculation this isnt hemmedin ground this is desperate ground nicol i want you to know the dendarii dont give refunds nicol frowned in bewilderment bels eyes widened as it checked out the oddscalculating them thirteen to three miles could tell truly bel choked a subtle hand signal down by its trouser seam brought the trooper to full alert truly desperate miles reiterated he inhaled deeply now taura attack miles launched himself toward moglia not so much actually expecting to wrestle his truncheon from him as hoping to maneuver moglias body between himself and the fellows with the nerve disruptors the dendarii trooper who had been paying attention to details dropped one of the nerve disrupter wielders with his first stunner shot then rolled away from the seconds return fire bel dropped the second nerve disrupter man and leapt aside two red guards aiming their stunners at the running hermaphrodite were lifted abruptly by their necks taura cracked their heads together unscientifically but hard they fell to hands and knees groping blindly for their lost weapons fells green guards hesitated not certain just whom to shoot until nicol her angels face alight suddenly shot skyward in her float chair and dropped straight down again on the head of her guard who was distracted by the fight he fell like an ox nicol flipped her floater sideways as greenguard stunner fire found her shielding herself from its flare and shot upwards again taura picked up a red guard and threw him at a green one they both went down in a tangle of arms and legs the dendarii trooper closed on a green guard handtohand to shield himself from stunner blast fells captain wouldnt buy the maneuver and ruthlessly stunned them both a sound tactic with the numbers on his side moglia got his truncheon up against miless windpipe and started to press meanwhile yelling into his wrist comm calling for backup from security ops a green guard screamed as taura yanked his arm out of its shoulder socket and swung him into the air by the dislocated joint at another one aiming his stunner at her colored lights danced before miless eyes fells captain focusing on taura as the biggest threat dropped to stunner fire from bel thorne as nicol whammed her float chair into the back of the last green guard left standing the float truck miles croaked go for the float truck bel cast him a desperate look and sprinted toward it miles fought like an eel until moglia got a hand down to his boot drew a sharp thin knife and pressed it to miless neck hold still snarled moglia thats better he straightened in the sudden silence realizing hed just pulled domination from disaster everybody hold still bel froze with its hand on the floattrucks door pad a couple of the men splayed on the tarmac twitched and moaned now stand away fromglk said moglia tauras voice whispered past moglias ear a soft soft growl drop the knife or ill rip your throat out with my bare hands miless eyes wrenched sideways trying to see around his own clamped head as the sharp edge sang against his skin i can kill him before you do croaked moglia the little man is mine taura crooned you gave him to me yourself he came back for me hurt him one little bit and ill tear your head off and then ill drink your blood miles felt moglia being lifted off his feet the knife clattered to the pavement miles sprang away staggering taura held moglia by his neck her claws biting deep i still want to rip his head off she growled petulantly remembrance of abuse sparking in her eyes leave him gasped miles believe me in a few hours hes going to be suffering a more artistic vengeance than anything we can dream up bel galloped back to stun the security chief at cant miss range while taura held him out like a wet cat miles had taura throw the unconscious dendarii over her shoulder while he ran around to the back of the float truck and released the doors for nicol who zipped her chair inside they tumbled within dropped the doors and bel at the controls shot them into the air a siren was going off somewhere in ryovals wrist comm wrist comm miles babbled stripping his unconscious trooper of the device bel where is our drop shuttle parked we came in at a little commercial shuttleport just outside ryovals town about forty kilometers from here anybody left manning it anderson and nout whats their scrambled comm channel twentythree miles slid into the seat beside bel and opened the channel it took a small eternity for sergeant anderson to answer fully thirty or forty seconds while the float truck streaked above the treetops and over the nearest ridge laureen i want you to get your shuttle into the air we need an emergency pickup soonest were in a house fell float truck heading miles thrust his wrist under bels nose north from ryoval biologicals bel recited at about two hundred sixty kilometers per hour which is all the faster this crate will go home in on our screamer miles set the wrist comm emergency signal dont wait for clearance from ryovals shuttleport traffic control cause you wont get it have nout patch my comm through to the ariel you got it sir andersons thin voice came cheerily back over his comm static and another few seconds excruciating delay then an excited voice murka here i thought you were coming out right behind us last night you all right sir temporarily is medtech vaughn aboard yes sir all right dont let him off assure him i have his tissue sample with me really howd you never mind how get all the troops back aboard and break from the station into free orbit plan to make a flying pickup of the drop shuttle and tell the pilotofficer to plot a course for the escobar wormhole jump at max acceleration as soon as were clamped on dont wait for clearance were still loading cargo abandon any thats still unloaded are we in serious shit sir mortal murka right sir murka out i thought we were all supposed to be as quiet as mice here on jacksons whole bel complained isnt this all a bit splashy the situations changed thered be no negotiating with ryoval for nicol or for taura either after what we did last night i struck a blow for truth and justice back there that i may live to regret briefly tell you about it later anyway do you really want to stick around while i explain to baron fell the real truth about the betan rejuvenation treatment oh thornes eyes were alight as it concentrated on its flying id pay money to watch that sir ha no for one last moment back there all the pieces were in our hands potentially anyway miles began exploring the readouts on the floattrucks simple control panel wed never get everybody together again never one maneuvers to the limit but the golden moment demands action if you miss it the gods damn you forever and vice versa speaking of action did you see taura take out seven of those guys miles chortled in memory whats she going to be like after basic training bel glanced uneasily over its shoulder to where nicol had her float chair lodged and taura hunkered in the back along with the body of the unconscious trooper i was too busy to keep count miles swung out of his seat and made his way into the back to check on their precious live cargo nicol you were great he told her you fought like a falcon i may have to give you a discount on that dollar nicol was still breathless ivory cheeks flushed an upper hand shoved a strand of black hair out of her sparkling eyes i was afraid theyd break my dulcimer a lower hand stroked a big boxshaped case jammed into the floatchairs cup beside her then i was afraid theyd break bel taura sat leaning against the truck wall a bit green miles knelt beside her taura dear are you all right he gently lifted one clawed hand to check her pulse which was bounding nicol gave him a rather strange look at his tender gesture her float chair was wedged as far from taura as it could get hungry taura gasped again but of course all that energy expenditure anybody got a ration bar a quick check found an onlyslightlynibbled rat bar in the stunned troopers thigh pocket which miles immediately liberated miles smiled benignly at taura as she wolfed it down she smiled back as best she could with her mouth full no more rats for you after this miles promised silently three steak dinners when we get back to the ariel and a couple of chocolate cakes for dessert the floattruck jinked taura reviving somewhat extended her feet to hold nicols dented cup in place against the far wall and keep it from bouncing around thank you said nicol warily taura nodded company bel thorne called over its shoulder miles hastened forward two aircars were coming up fast behind them ryovals security doubtless beefed up tougher than the average civilian police car yes bel jinked again as a plasma bolt boiled past leaving bright green streaks across miless retinas quasimilitary and seriously annoyed their pursuers were this is one of fells trucks we ought to have something to fling back at them there was nothing in front of miles that looked like any kind of weaponscontrol a whoomp a scream from nicol and the float truck staggered in air righted itself under bels hands a roar of air and vibration miles cranked his head around franticallyone top back corner of the trucks cargo area was blown away the rear door was fused shut on one side whanging loose along the opposite edge taura still braced the float chair nicol now had her upper hands wrapped around tauras ankles ah said thorne no armor what did they think this was going to be a peaceful mission miles checked his wrist comm laureen are you in the air yet coming sir well if youve ever itched to redline it nows your chance nobodys going to complain about your abusing the equipment this time thank you sir she responded happily they were losing speed and altitude hang on bel yelled over its shoulder and suddenly reversed thrust their closing pursuers shot past them but immediately began climbing turns bel accelerated again another scream from the back as their live cargo was thus shifted toward the nowdubious rear doors the dendarii hand stunners were of no use at all miles clambered into the back again looking for some sort of luggage compartment gun rack anythingsurely fells people did not rely only on the fearsome reputation of their house for protection the padded benches along each side of the cargo compartment upon which fells guard squad had presumably sat swung up on storage space the first was empty the second contained personal luggagemiles had a brief flash of strangling an enemy with someones pajama pants flinging underwear into thruster airintakesthe third compartment was also empty the fourth was locked the float truck rocked under another blast part of the top peeled away in the wind miles grabbed for taura and the truck plummeted downward miless stomach and the rest of him seemed to float upward they were all flattened to the floor again as bel pulled up the float truck shivered and lurched and all miles and taura the unconscious trooper nicol in her float chair were flung forward in a tangle as the truck plowed to a tilted stop in a copse of frostblackened scrub bel blood streaming down its face clambered back to them crying out out out miles stretched for the new opening in the roof jerked his hand back at the burning touch of hot slagged metal and plastics taura standing up stuck her head out through the hole then crouched back down to boost miles through he slithered to the ground looked around they were in an unpeopled valley of native vegetation flanked by ropy ridgy hills flying up the slot toward them came the two pursuing aircars swelling slowingcorning in for a capture or just taking careful aim the ariels combat drop shuttle roared up over the ridge and descended like the black hand of god the pursuing aircars looked suddenly much smaller one veered off and fled the second was smashed to the ground not by plasma fire but by a swift swat from a tractor beam not even a trickle of smoke marked where it went down the drop shuttle settled demurely beside them in a deafening crackling crush of shrubbery its hatch extended and unfolded itself in a sort of suave selfsatisfied salute showoff miles muttered he pulled the woozy thornes arm over his shoulder taura carried the stunned man nicols battered cup stuttered through the air and they all staggered gratefully to their rescue subtle noises of protest emanated from the ship around him as miles stepped into the ariels shuttle hatch corridor his stomach twitched queasily from an artificial gravity not quite in synch with overloaded engines they were on their way breaking orbit already miles wanted to get to nav and com as quickly as possible though the evidence so far suggested that murka was carrying on quite competently anderson and nout hauled in the downed trooper now moaning his way to consciousness and turned him over to the medtech waiting with a float pallet thorne who had acquired a temporary plas dressing for the forehead cut during the shuttle flight sent nicol in her damaged float chair after them and whisked off toward nav and com miles turned to encounter the man he least wanted to see dr canaba hovered anxiously in the corridor his tanned face strained you said miles to canaba in a voice dark with rage canaba stepped back involuntarily miles wanted but was too short to pin canaba to the wall by his neck and regretfully dismissed the idea of ordering trooper nout to do it for him miles pinned canaba with a glare instead you coldblooded doubledealing sonofabitch you set me up to murder a sixteenyearold girl canaba raised his hands in protest you dont understand taura ducked through the shuttle hatch her tawny eyes widened in a surprise only exceeded by canabas why dr canaba what are you doing here miles pointed to canaba you stay there he ordered thickly he tampered his anger down and turned to the shuttle pilot laureen yes sir miles took taura by the hand and led her to sergeant anderson laureen i want you to take recruittrainee taura here in tow and get her a square meal all she can eat and i do mean all then help her get a bath a uniform and orient her to the ship anderson eyed the towering taura warily er yes sir shes had a hell of a time miles felt compelled to explain then paused and added do us proud its important yes sir said anderson sturdily and led off taura following with an uncertain backward glance to miles and canaba miles rubbed his stubbled chin conscious of his stains and stink feardriven weariness stretching his nerves taut he turned to the stunned geneticist all right doctor he snarled make me understand try real hard i couldnt leave her in ryovals hands said canaba in agitation to be made a victim or worse an agent of his his merchandized depravities didnt you ever think of asking us to rescue her but said canaba confused why should you it wasnt in your contracta mercenary doctor youve been living on jacksons whole too damn long i knew that back when i was throwing up every morning before going to work canaba drew himself up with a dry dignity but admiral you dont understand he glanced down the corridor in the direction taura had gone i couldnt leave her in ryovals hands but i cant possibly take her to barrayar they kill mutants there er said miles given pause theyre attempting to reform those prejudices or so i understand but youre quite right barrayar is not the place for her i had hoped when you came along not to have to do it to kill her myself not an easy task ive known her too long but to leave her down there would have been the most vile condemnation thats no lie well shes out of there now same as you if we can keep so miles was frantic to get to nav and com and find out what was happening had ryoval launched pursuit yet had fell would the space station guarding the distant wormhole exit be ordered to block their escape i didnt want to just abandon her dithered canaba but i couldnt take her with me i should hope not youre totally unfit to have charge of her im going to urge her to join the dendarii mercenaries it would seem to be her genetic destiny unless you know some reason why not but shes going to die miles stopped short and you and i are not he said softly after a moment then more loudly why how soon its her metabolism another mistake or concatenation of mistakes i dont know when exactly she could go another year or two or five or ten or fifteen or fifteen yes though not likely but early still and yet you wanted to take from her what little she had why to spare her the final debilitation is rapid but very painful to judge from what some of the other prototypes went through the females were more complex than the males im not certain but its a ghastly death especially ghastly as ryovals slave i dont recall encountering a lovely death yet and ive seen a variety as for duration i tell you we could all go in the next fifteen minutes and where is your tender mercy then he had to get to nav and com i declare your interest in her forfeit doctor meanwhile let her grab what life she can but she was my projecti must answer for her no shes a free woman now she must answer for herself how free can she ever be in that body driven by that metabolism that facea freaks lifebetter to die painlessly than to have all that suffering inflicted on her miles spoke through his teeth with emphasis no its not canaba stared at him shaken out of the rutted circle of his unhappy reasoning at last thats right doctor miless thought glittered get your head out of your ass and look at me finally why should you care asked canaba i like her rather better than i like you i might add miles paused daunted by the thought of having to explain to taura about the gene complexes in her calf and sooner or later theyd have to retrieve them unless he could fake it pretend the biopsy was some sort of medical standard operating procedure for dendarii induction no she deserved more honesty than that miles was highly annoyed at canaba for putting this false note between himself and taura and yetwithout the gene complexes would he have indeed gone in after her as his boast implied extended and endangered his assigned mission just out of the goodness of his heart yeah devotion to duty or pragmatic ruthlessness which was which he would never know now his anger receded and exhaustion washed in the familiar postmission downtoo soon the mission was far from over miles reminded himself sternly he inhaled you cant save her from being alive dr canaba too late let her go let go canabas lips were unhappily tight but head bowing he turned his hands palmout page the admiral miles heard thorne say as he entered nav and com then belay that as heads swivelled toward the swish of the doors and they saw miles good timing sir whats up miles swung into the com station chair thorne indicated ensign murka was monitoring ships shielding and weapons systems while their jump pilot sat at the ready beneath the strange crown of his headset with its chemical cannulae and wires pilot padgets expression was inward controlled and meditative his consciousness fully engaged even merged with the ariel good man baron ryoval is on the com for you said thorne personally i wonder if hes checked his freezers yet miles settled in before the vid link how long have i kept him waiting less than a minute said the com officer hm let him wait a little longer then whats been launched in pursuit of us nothing so far reported murka miless brows rose at this unexpected news he took a moment to compose himself wishing hed had time to clean up shave and put on a fresh uniform before this interview just for the psychological edge he scratched his itching chin and ran his hands through his hair and wriggled his damp sock toes against the deck matting which they barely reached he lowered his station chair slightly straightened his spine as much as he could and brought his breathing under control all right bring him up the rather blurred background to the face that formed over the vid plate seemed faintly familiarah yes the security ops room at ryoval biologicals baron ryoval had arrived personally on that scene as promised it took only one glance at the dusky contorted expression on ryovals youthful face to fill in the rest of the scenario miles folded his hands and smiled innocently good morning baron what can i do for you die you little mutant ryoval spat you there isnt going to be a bunker deep enough for you to burrow in ill put a price on your head that will have every bounty hunter in the galaxy all over you like a second skinyoull not eat or sleepill have you yes the baron had seen his freezers all right recently gone entirely was the suave contemptuous dismissal of their first encounter yet miles was puzzled by the drift of his threats it seemed the baron expected them to escape jacksonian local space true house ryoval owned no space fleet but why not rent a dreadnought from baron fell and attack now that was the ploy miles had most expected and feared that ryoval and fell and maybe bharaputra too would combine against him as he attempted to carry off their prizes can you afford to hire bounty hunters now asked miles mildly i thought your assets were somewhat reduced though you still have your surgical specialists i suppose ryoval breathing heavily wiped spittle from his mouth did my dear little brother put you up to this who said miles genuinely startled yet another player in the game baron fell i was not aware you were related said miles little brother you lie badly sneered ryoval i knew he had to be behind this youll have to ask him miles shot at random his head spinning as the new datum rearranged all his estimates damn his mission briefing which had never mentioned this connection concentrating in detail only on house bharaputra halfbrothers only surelyyes hadnt nicol mentioned something about fells halfbrother ill have your head for this foamed ryoval shipped back frozen in a box ill have it encased in plastic and hang it over myno better double the money for the man who brings you in alive you will die slowly after infinite degradation in all miles was glad the distance between them was widening at high acceleration ryoval interrupted his own tirade dark brows snapping down in sudden suspicion or was it bharaputra who hired you trying to block me from cutting in on their biologicals monopoly at the last not merging as they promised why now drawled miles would bharaputra really mount a plot against the head of another house do you have personal evidence that they do that sort of thing orwho did kill your ah brothers clone the connections were locking into place at last ye gods it seemed miles and his mission had blundered into the middle of an ongoing power struggle of byzantine complexity nicol had testified that fell had never pinned down the killer of his young duplicate shall i guess you know bloody well snapped ryoval but which of them hired you fell or bharaputra which ryoval miles realized knew absolutely nothing yet of the real dendarii mission against house bharaputra and with the atmosphere among the houses being what it apparently was it could be quite a long time before they got around to comparing notes the longer the better from miless point of view he began to suppress then deliberately released a small smile what cant you believe it was just my personal blow against the genetic slave trade a deed in honor of my lady this reference to taura went straight over ryovals head he had his ideafixee now and its ramifications and his rage were an effective block against incoming data really it should not be at all hard to convince a man who had been conspiring deeply against his rivals that those rivals were conspiring against him in turn fell or bharaputra ryoval reiterated furiously did you think to conceal a theft for bharaputra with that wanton destruction theft miles wondered intently not of taura surelyof some tissue sample bharaputra had been dealing for perhaps oh ho isnt it obvious said miles sweetly you gave your brother the motive in your sabotage of his plans to extend his life and you wanted too much from bharaputra so they supplied the method placing their supersoldier inside your facility where i could rendezvous with her they even made you pay for the privilege of having your security screwed you played right into our hands the master plan of course miles buffed his fingernails on his tshirt was mine miles glanced up through his eyelashes ryoval seemed to be having trouble breathing the baron cut the vid connection with an abrupt swat of his shaking hand blackout humming thoughtfully miles went to get a shower he was back in nav and com in fresh greyandwhites full of salicylates for his aches and contusions and with a mug of hot black coffee in his hands as antidote to his squinting red eyes when the next call came in so far from breaking into a tirade like his halfbrother baron fell sat silent a moment in the vid just staring at miles miles burning under his gaze felt extremely glad hed had the chance to clean up so had baron fell missed his quaddie at last had ryoval communicated to him yet any part of the smouldering paranoid misconceptions miles had so lately fanned to flame no pursuit had yet been launched from fell stationit must come soon or not at all or any craft light enough to match the ariels acceleration would be too light to match its firepower unless fell planned to call in favors from the consortium of houses that ran the jumppoint station one more minute of this heavy silence miles felt and he would break into uncontrollable blither fortunately fell spoke at last you seem admiral naismith baron fell rumbled whether accidentally or on purpose to be carrying off something that does not belong to you quite a few somethings miles reflected but fell referred only to nicol if miles read him right we were compelled to leave in rather a hurry he said in an apologetic tone so im told fell inclined his head ironically he must have had a report from his hapless squad commander but you may yet save yourself some trouble there was an agreedupon price for my musician its of no great difference to me if i give her up to you or to ryoval as long as i get that price captain thorne working the ariels monitors flinched under miless glance the price you refer to i take it is the secret of the betan rejuvenation technique said miles quite ah hum miles moistened his lips baron i cannot fell turned his head station commander launch pursuit ships wait miles cried fell raised his brows you reconsider good its not that i will not tell you said miles desperately its just that the truth would be of no use to you none whatsoever still i agree you deserve some compensation i have another piece of information i could trade you more immediately valuable oh said fell his voice was neutral but his expression was black you suspected your halfbrother ryoval in the murder of your clone but could not chain any evidence to him am i right fell looked fractionally more interested all my agents and bharaputras could not turn up a connection we tried im not surprised because it was bharaputras agents who did the deed well it was possible anyway fells eyes narrowed killed their own product he said slowly i believe ryoval struck a deal with house bharaputra to betray you said miles rapidly i believe it involved the trade of some unique biological samples in ryovals possession i dont think cash alone would have been worth their risk the deal was done on the highest levels obviously i dont know how they figured to divide the spoils of house fell after your eventual deathmaybe they didnt mean to divide it at all they seem to have had some ultimate plan of combining their operations for some larger monopoly of biologicals on jacksons whole a corporate merger of sorts miles paused to let this sink in may i suggest you may wish to reserve your forces and favors against enemies more er intimate and immediate than myself besides you have all our credit chit but we have only half our cargo will you call it even fell glowered at him for a full minute the face of a man thinking in three different directions at once miles knew the feeling he then turned his head and grated out of the corner of his mouth hold pursuit ships miles breathed again i thank you for this information admiral said fell coldly but not very much i shall not impede your swift exit but if you or any of your ships appear in jacksonian space again oh baron said miles sincerely staying far far away from here is fast becoming one of my dearest ambitions youre wise fell growled and moved to cut the link baron fell miles added impulsively fell paused for your future informationis this link secured yes the true secret of the betan rejuvenation techniqueis that there is none dont be taken in again i look the age i do because it is the age i am make of it what you will fell said absolutely nothing after a moment a faint wintry smile moved his lips he shook his head and cut the com just in case miles lingered on in sort of a glassy puddle in one corner of nav and com until the comm officer reported their final clearance from jumppoint station traffic control but miles calculated houses fell ryoval and bharaputra were going to be too busy with each other to concern themselves with him at least for a while his late transfer of information both true and false among the combatantsto each according to his measurehad the feel of throwing one bone to three starving rabid dogs he almost regretted not being able to stick around and see the results almost hours after the jump he woke in his cabin fully dressed but with his boots set neatly by his bed with no memory of how hed got there he rather fancied murka must have escorted him if hed fallen asleep while walking alone hed surely have left the boots on miles first checked with the duty officer as to the ariels situation and status it was refreshingly dull they were crossing a blue star system between jump points on the route to escobar unpeopled and empty of everything but a smattering of routine commercial traffic nothing pursued them from the direction of jacksons whole miles had a light meal not sure if it was breakfast lunch or dinner his biorhythm being thoroughly askew from shiptime after his downside adventures he then sought out thorne and nicol he found them in engineering a tech was just polishing out the last dent in nicols float chair nicol now wearing a white tunic and shorts trimmed with pink piping lay sprawled on her belly on a bench watching the repairs it gave miles an odd sensation to see her out of her cup it was like looking at a hermit crab out of its shell or a seal on the shore she looked strangely vulnerable in onegee yet in null gee shed looked so right so clearly at ease hed stopped noticing the oddness of the extra arms very quickly thorne helped the tech fit the float cups blue shell over its reconditioned antigrav mechanism and turned to greet miles as the tech proceeded to lock it in place miles sat downbench from nicol from the looks of things he told her you should be free of pursuit from baron fell he and his halfbrother are going to be fully occupied avenging themselves on each other for a while makes me glad im an only child hm she said pensively you should be safe thorne offered encouragingly ohno its not that nicol said i was just thinking about my sisters time was i couldnt wait to get away from them now i cant wait to see them again what are you plans now miles asked ill stop at escobar first she replied its a good nexus crossing from there i should be able to work my way back to earth from earth i can get to orient iv and from there im sure i can get home is home your goal now theres a lot more galaxy to be seen out this way thorne pointed out im not sure if dendarii rosters can be stretched to include a ships musician but she was shaking her head home she said firmly im tired of fighting onegee all the time im tired of being alone im starting to have nightmares about growing legs thorne sighed faintly we do have a little colony of downsiders living among us now she added suggestively to thorne theyve fitted out their own asteroid with artificial gravityquite like the real thing downside only not as drafty miles was faintly alarmedto lose a ship commander of proven loyalty ah said thorne in a pensive tone to match nicols a long way from my home your asteroid belt will you return to beta colony then someday she asked or are the dendarii mercenaries your home and family not quite that passionate for me said thorne i mainly stick around due to an overwhelming curiosity to see what happens next thorne favored miles with a peculiar smile thorne helped load nicol back into her blue cup after a brief systems check she was hovering upright again as mobilemore mobilethan her legged companions she rocked and regarded thorne brightly its only three more days to escobar orbit said thorne to nicol rather regretfully stillseventytwo hours minutes how much can you do in minutes or how often thought miles dryly especially if you dont sleep sleep per se was not what bel had in mind if miles recognized the signs good luckto both of them meanwhile thorne maneuvered nicol into the corridor let me show you around the ship illyricanbuiltthats out your way a bit i understand its quite a story how the ariel first fell into dendarii handswe were the oseran mercenaries back then nicol made encouraging noises miles suppressed an envious grin and turned the other way up the corridor to search out dr canaba and arrange the discharge of his last unpleasant duty bemusedly miles set aside the hypospray hed been turning over in his hands as the door to sickbay sighed open he swivelled in the medtechs station chair and glanced up as taura and sergeant anderson entered my word he murmured anderson sketched a salute reporting as ordered sir tauras hand twitched uncertain whether to attempt to mimic this military greeting or not miles gazed up at taura and his lips parted with involuntary delight tauras transformation was all hed dreamed of and more he didnt know how anderson had persuaded the stores computer to so exceed its normal parameters but somehow shed made it disgorge a complete dendarii undress kit in tauras size crisp greyandwhite pocketed jacket grey trousers polished ankletopping boots tauras face and hair were clean enough to outshine her boots her dark hair was now drawn back in a thick neat and rather mysterious braid coiling up the back of her headmiles could not make out where the ends wentand glinting with unexpected mahogany highlights she looked if not exactly wellfed at least less rawly starving her eyes bright and interested not the haunted yellow flickers in bony caverns hed first seen even from this distance he could tell that rehydration and the chance to brush her teeth and fangs had cured the ketonelaced breath that several days in ryovals subbasement on a diet of raw rats and nothing had produced the dirtencrusted scale was smoothed away from her huge hands andinspired touchher clawed nails had been not blunted but neatened and sharpened and then enamelled with an iridescent pearlwhite polish that complemented her greyandwhites like a flash of jewelry the polish had to have been shared out of some personal stock of the sergeants outstanding anderson said miles in admiration anderson smirked proudly that about what you had in mind sir yes it was tauras face reflected his delight straight back at him what did you think of your first wormhole jump he asked her her long lips rippled what happened when she tried to purse them miles guessed i was afraid i was getting sick i was so dizzy all of a sudden till sergeant anderson explained what it was no little hallucinations or odd timestretching effects no but it wasntwell it was quick anyway hm it doesnt sound like youre one of the fortunatesor unfortunatesto be screened for jump pilot aptitudes from the talents you demonstrated on ryovals landing pad yesterday morning tactics should be loathe to lose you to nav and com miles paused thank you laureen what did my page interrupt routine systems checks on the drop shuttles putting them to bed i was having taura look over my shoulder while i worked right carry on ill send taura back to you when shes done here anderson exited reluctantly clearly curious miles waited till the doors swished closed to speak again sit down taura so your first twentyfour hours with the dendarii have been satisfactory she grinned settling herself carefully in a station chair which creaked just fine ah he hesitated you understand when we reach escobar you do have the option to go your own way youre not compelled to join us i could see you got some kind of start downside there what her eyes widened in dismay no i mean do i eat too much not at all you fight like four men we can bloody well afford to feed you like three but i need to set a few things straight before you make your trainees oath he cleared his throat i didnt come to ryovals to recruit you a few weeks before bharaputra sold you do you remember dr canaba injecting something into your leg with a needle not a hypospray oh yes she rubbed her calf halfconsciously it made a knot what ah did he tell you it was an immunization shed been right miles reflected when theyd first met humans did lie a lot well it wasnt an immunization canaba was using you as a live repository for some engineered biological material molecularly bound dormant material he added hastily as she twisted around and looked at her leg in disquiet it cant activate spontaneously he assures me my original mission was only to pick up dr canaba but he wouldnt leave without his gene complexes he planned to take me with him she said in thrilled surprise so i should thank him for sending you to me miles wished he could see the look on canabas face if she did yes and no specifically no he rushed roughly on before his nerve failed him you have nothing to thank him for nor me either he meant to take only your tissue sample and sent me to get it would you rather have left me atis that why escobar she was still bewildered it was your good luck miles plunged on that id lost my men and was disarmed when we finally met canaba lied to me too in his defense he seems to have had some dim idea of saving you from a brutal life as ryovals slave he sent me to kill you taura he sent me to slay a monster when he should have been begging me to rescue a princess in disguise im not too pleased with dr canaba nor with myself i lied through my teeth to you down in ryovals basement because i thought i had to to survive and win her face was confused congealing the light in her eyes fading then you didnt really think i was human on the contrary your choice of test was an excellent one its much harder to lie with your body than with your mouth when i er demonstrated my belief it had to be real looking at her he still felt a twinge of lurching lunatic joy somatic residual from that adventureofthebody he supposed he always would feel something male conditioning no doubt would you like me to demonstrate it again he asked halfhopefully then bit his tongue no he answered his own question if i am to be your commanderwe have these nonfraternization rules mainly to protect those of lower rank from exploitation though it can work bothahem he was digressing dreadfully he picked up the hypospray fiddled with it nervously and put it back down anyway dr canaba has asked me to lie to you again he wanted me to sneak up on you with a general anesthetic so he could biopsy back his sample hes a coward you may have noticed hes outside now shaking in his shoes for fear youll find out what he intended for you i think a local zap with a medical stunner would suffice id sure want to be conscious and watching if he were working on me anyway he flicked the hypospray contemptuously with one finger she sat silent her strange wolfish facethough miles was getting used to itunreadable you want me to let him cut into my leg she said at last yes then what then nothing that will be the last of dr canaba for you and jacksons whole and all the rest of it that i promise though if youre doubtful of my promises i can understand why the last she breathed her face lowered then rose and her shoulders straightened then lets get it over with there was no smile to her long mouth now canaba as miles expected was not happy to be presented with a conscious subject miles truly didnt care how unhappy canaba was about it and after one look at his cold face canaba didnt argue canaba took his sample wordlessly packaged it carefully in the biotainer and fled with it back to the safety and privacy of his own cabin as soon as he decently could miles sat with taura in sickbay till the medical stun wore off enough for her to walk without stumbling she sat without speaking for a long time he watched her still features wishing beyond measure he knew how to relight those gold eyes when i first saw you she said softly it was like a miracle something magic everything id wished for longed for food water heat revenge escape she gazed down at her polished claws friends and glanced up at him touching what else do you wish for taura miles asked earnestly slowly she replied i wish i were normal miles was silent too i cant give you what i dont possess myself he said at length the words seemed to lie in inadequate lumps between them he roused himself to a better effort no dont wish that i have a better idea wish to be yourself to the hilt find out what youre best at and develop it hopscotch your weaknesses there isnt time for them look at nicol so beautiful sighed taura or look at captain thorne and tell me what normal is and why i should give a damn for it look at me if you will should i kill myself trying to overcome men twice my weight and reach in unarmed combat or should i shift the ground to where their muscle is useless cause it never gets close enough to apply its strength i havent got time to lose and neither have you do you know how little time demanded taura suddenly ah said miles cautiously do you i am the last survivor of my creche mates how could i not know her chin lifted defiantly then dont wish to be normal said miles passionately rising to pace youll only waste your precious time in futile frustration wish to be great that at least you have a fighting chance for great at whatever you are a great trooper a great sergeant a great quartermaster for gods sake if thats what comes with ease a great musician like nicolonly think how horrible if she were wasting her talents trying to be merely normal miles paused selfconsciously in his pep talk thinking easier to preach than practice taura studied her polished claws and sighed i suppose its useless for me to wish to be beautiful like sergeant anderson it is useless for you to try to be beautiful like anyone but yourself said miles be beautiful like taura ah that you can do superbly well he found himself gripping her hands and ran one finger across an iridescent claw though laureen seems to have grasped the principle you might be guided by her taste admiral said taura slowly not releasing his hands are you actually my commander yet sergeant anderson said something about orientation and induction tests and an oath yes all that will come when we make fleet rendezvous till then technically youre our guest a certain sparkle was beginning to return to her gold eyes then till thenit wouldnt break any dendarii rules would it if you showed me again how human i am one more time it must be miles thought akin to the same drive that used to propel men to climb sheer rock faces without an antigrav belt or jump out of ancient aircraft with nothing to stop them going splat but a wad of silk cloth he felt the fascination rising in him the deathdefying laugh slowly he said in a strangled voice do it right this time have a little conversation drink a little wine play a little music without ryovals guard squad lurking overhead or ice cold rock under my her eyes were huge and gold and molten you did say you liked to practice what you were great at miles had never realized how susceptible he was to flattery from tall women a weakness he must guard against sometime they retired to his cabin and practiced assiduously till halfway to escobar whatever happened to the wolf girl inquired illyan after a long fascinated silence ah shes doing well im glad to say she made sergeant not long ago my dendarii fleet surgeon has her on some meds to slow her metabolism down a bit somewhat experimental will they increase her lifespan then miles shrugged i wish we knew maybe were hoping well illyan shifted that leaves dagoola about which i might remind you the only report i had from you before the other operatives took over was that er excessively succinct one you filed from mahata solaris that was only meant to be preliminary i thought id be reporting home sooner than this thats not a problemor at any rate not a problem for count vorvolk dagoola miles cough it up and then you can get some sleep miles frowned wearily it started out so simply almost as simple as the jacksons whole job then things went wrong then things went very wrong so begin at the beginning the beginning god well the borders of infinity how could i have died and gone to hell without noticing the transition the opalescent force dome capped a surreal and alien landscape frozen for a moment by miless disorientation and dismay the dome defined a perfect circle half a kilometer in diameter miles stood just inside its edge where the glowing concave surface dove into the hardpacked dirt and disappeared his imagination followed the arc buried beneath his feet to the far side where it erupted again to complete the sphere it was like being trapped inside an eggshell an unbreakable eggshell within was a scene from an ancient limbo dispirited men and women sat or stood or mostly lay down singly or in scattered irregular groups across the breadth of the arena miless eye searched anxiously for some remnant of order or military grouping but the inhabitants seemed splashed randomly as a liquid across the ground perhaps he had been killed just now just entering this prison camp perhaps his captors had betrayed him to his death like those ancient earth soldiers who had lured their victims sheeplike into poisoned showers diverting and soothing their suspicions with stone soap until their final enlightenment burst upon them in a choking cloud perhaps the annihilation of his body had been so swift his neurons had not had time to carry the information to his brain why else did so many antique myths agree that hell was a circular place dagoola iv top security prison camp this was it this naked dinner plate miles had vaguely visioned barracks marching guards daily head counts secret tunnels escape committees it was the dome that made it all so simple miles realized what need for barracks to shelter prisoners from the elements the dome did it what need for guards the dome was generated from without nothing inside could breach it no need for guards or head counts tunnels were a futility escape committees an absurdity the dome did it all the only structures were what appeared to be big grey plastic mushrooms evenly placed about every hundred meters around the perimeter of the dome what little activity there was seemed clustered around them latrines miles recognized miles and his three fellow prisoners had entered through a temporary portal which had closed behind them before the brief bulge of force dome containing their entry vanished in front of them the nearest inhabitant of the dome a man lay a few meters away upon a sleeping mat identical to the one miles now clutched he turned his head slightly to stare at the little party of newcomers smiled sourly and rolled over on his side with his back to them nobody else nearby even bothered to look up holy shit muttered one of miless companions he and his two buddies drew together unconsciously the three had been from the same unit once theyd said miles had met them bare minutes ago in their final stages of processing where they had all been issued their total supply of worldly goods for life in dagoola a single pair of loose grey trousers a matching shortsleeved grey tunic a rectangular sleeping mat rolled up a plastic cup that was all that and the new numbers encoded upon their skins it bothered miles intensely that their captors had chosen to locate the numbers in the middle of their backs where they couldnt see them he resisted a futile urge to twist and crane his neck anyway though his hand snaked up under his shirt to scratch a purely psychosomatic itch you couldnt feel the encode either some motion appeared in the tableau a group of four or five men approaching the welcoming committee at last miles was desperate for information where among all these countless grey men and womenno not countless miles told himself firmly they were all accounted for here the battered remnants of the rd and th armored allterrain rangers the ingenious and tenacious civilian defenders of garson transfer station winowehs nd battalion had been captured almost intact and the th commandos survivors of the hightech fortress at fallow core particularly the survivors of fallow core ten thousand two hundred fourteen exactly the plant marilacs finest ten thousand two hundred fifteen counting himself ought he to count himself the welcoming committee drew up in a ragged bunch a few meters away they looked tough and tall and muscular and not noticeably friendly dull sullen eyes full of a deadly boredom that even their present calculation did not lighten the two groups the five and the three sized each other up the three turned and started walking stiffly and prudently away miles realized belatedly that he not a part of either group was thus left alone alone and immensely conspicuous selfconsciousness bodyconsciousness normally held at bay by the simple fact that he didnt have time to waste on it returned to him with a rush too short too oddlookinghis legs were even in length now after the last operation but surely not long enough to outrun these five and where did one run to in this place he crossed off flight as an option fight get serious this isnt going to work he realized sadly even as he started walking toward them but it was more dignified than being chased down with the same result he tried to make his smile austere rather than foolish no telling whether he succeeded hi there can you tell me where to find colonel guy tremonts th commando division one of the five snorted sardonically two moved behind miles well a snort was almost speech expression anyway a start a toehold miles focused on that one whats your name and rank and company soldier no ranks in here mutant no companies no soldiers no nothing miles glanced around surrounded of course naturally you got some friends anyway the talker almost smiled you dont miles wondered if perhaps he had been premature in crossing off flight as an option i wouldnt count on that if i wereunh the kick to his kidneys from behind cut him offhe damn near bit his tonguehe fell dropping bedroll and cup and landing in a tangle a barefoot kick no combat boots this time thank godby the rules of newtonian physics his attackers foot ought to hurt just as much as his back fine jolly maybe theyd bruise their knuckles punching him out one of the gang gathered up miless late wealth cup and bedroll want his clothes theyre too little for me naw yeah said the talker take em anyway maybe bribe one of the women the tunic was jerked off over miless head the pants over his feet miles was too busy protecting his head from random kicks to fight much for his clothes trying obliquely to take as many hits as possible on his belly or ribcage not arms or legs or jaw a cracked rib was surely the most injury he could afford right now here at the beginning a broken jaw would be the worst his assailants desisted only a little before they discovered by experimentation the secret weakness of his bones thats how it is in here mutant said the talker slightly winded i was born naked miles panted from the dirt didnt stop me cocky little shit said the talker slow learner remarked another the second beating was worse than the first two cracked ribs at leasthis jaw barely escaped being smashed at the cost of something painfully wrong in his left wrist flung up as a shield this time miles resisted the impulse to offer any verbal parting shots he lay in the dirt and wished he could pass out he lay a long time cradled in pain he was not sure how long the illumination from the force dome was even and shadowless unchanging timeless like eternity hell was eternal was it not this place had too damn many congruencies with hell that was certain and here came another demon miles blinked the approaching figure into focus a man as bruised and naked as miles himself gauntribbed starveling knelt in the dirt a few meters away his face was bony aged by stresshe might have been forty or fiftyor twentyfive his eyes were unnaturally prominent due to the shrinking of his flesh their whites seemed to gleam feverishly against the dirt darkening his skin dirt not beard stubbleevery prisoner in here male and female had their hair cut short and the air follicles stunned to prevent regrowth perpetually cleanshaven and crewcut miles had undergone the same process bare hours ago but whoever had processed this fellow must have been in a hurry the hair stunner had missed a line of his cheek and a few dozen hairs grew there like a stripe on a badlymown lawn even curled as they were miles could see they were several centimeters long draggling down past the mans jaw if only he knew how fast hair grew he could calculate how long this fellow had been here too long whatever the numbers miles thought with an inward sigh the man had the brokenoff bottom half of a plastic cup which he pushed cautiously toward miles his breath whistled raggedly past his yellowish teeth from exertion or excitement or diseaseprobably not disease they were all well immunized here escape even through death was not that easy miles rolled over and propped himself stiffly on his elbow regarding his visitor through the thinning haze of his aches and pains the man scrabbled back slightly smiled nervously he nodded toward the cup water better drink the cups cracked and it all leaks out if you wait too long thanks croaked miles a week ago or in a previous lifetime depending on how you counted time miles had dawdled over a selection of wines dissatisfied with this or that nuance of flavor his lips cracked as he grinned in memory he drank it was perfectly ordinary water lukewarm faintly redolent of chlorine and sulfur a refined body but the bouquet is a bit presumptuous the man squatted in studied politeness until miles finished drinking then leaned forward on his knuckles in restrained urgency are you the one miles blinked am i the what the one the other one i should say the scripture says there has to be two uh miles hesitated cautiously what exactly does the scripture say the mans right hand wrapped over his knobby left wrist around which was tied a rag screwed into a sort of rope he closed his eyes his lips moved a moment and then he recited aloud but the pilgrims went up that hill with ease because they had these two men to lead them by the arms also they had left their garments behind them for though they went in with them they came out without them his eyes popped back open to stare hopefully at miles so now we begin to see why this guy seems to be all by himself are you perchance the other one miles shot at a venture the man nodded shyly i see um how was it that he always attracted the nut cases he licked the last drops of water from his lips the fellow might have some screws loose but he was certainly an improvement over the last lot always presuming he didnt have another personality or two of the homicidal loonie variety tucked away in his head no in that case hed be introducing himself as the chosen two and not be looking for outside assistance um whats your name suegar suegar right all right my name is miles by the way huh suegar grimaced in a sort of pleased irony your name means soldier did you know uh yeah so ive been told but youre not a soldier no subtle expensive trick of clothing line or uniform style here to hide from himself if no one else the peculiarities of his body miles flushed they were taking anything toward the end they made me a recruiting clerk i never did get to fire my gun listen suegar how did you come to know you were the one or at any rate one of the ones is it something youve always known it came on me gradually confessed suegar shifting to sit crosslegged im the only one in here with the words ysee he caressed his rag rope again ive hunted all up and down the camp but they only mock me it was a kind of process of elimination ysee when they all gave up but me ah miles too sat up only gasping a little in pain those ribs were going to be murder for the next few days he nodded toward the rope bracelet is that where you keep your scripture can i see it and how the hell had suegar ever gotten a plastic flimsy or loose piece of paper or whatever in here suegar clutched his arms protectively to his chest and shook his head theyve been trying to take them from me for months ysee i cant be too careful until you prove youre the one the devil can quote scripture yknow yes that was rather what i had in mind who knew what opportunities suegars scripture might contain well maybe later for now keep dancing are there any other signs asked miles you see i dont know that im your one but on the other hand i dont know im not either i just got here after all suegar shook his head again its only five or six sentences ysee you have to interpolate a lot ill bet miles did not voice the comment aloud however did you come by it or get it in here it was at port lisma ysee just before we were captured said suegar housetohouse fighting one of my boot heels had come a bit loose and it clicked when i walked funny with all that barrage coming down around our ears how a little thing like that can get under your skin there was this bookcase with a glass front real antique books made of paperi smashed it open with my gun butt and tore out part of a page from one and folded it up to stick in my boot heel to make a sort of shim ysee and stop the clicking didnt look at the book didnt even know it was scripture till later at least i think its scripture it sounds like scripture anyway it must be scripture suegar twisted his beard hairs nervously around his finger when we were waiting to be processed id pulled it out of my boot just idlelike yknow i had it in my handthe processing guard saw it but he just didnt take it away from me probably thought it was just a harmless piece of paper didnt know it was scripture i still had it in my hand when we were dumped in here dyou know its the only piece of writing in this whole camp he added rather proudly it must be scripture well you take good care of it then advised miles kindly if youve preserved it this long it was obviously meant to be your job yeah suegar blinked tears im the only one in here with a job arent i so i must be one of the ones sounds good to me said miles agreeably say ah he glanced around the vast featureless dome how do you find your way around in here anyway the place was decidedly undersupplied with landmarks it reminded miles of nothing so much as a penguin rookery yet penguins seemed able to find their rocky nests he was going to have to start thinking like a penguinor get a penguin to direct him he studied his guide bird who had gone absent and was doodling in the dirt circles naturally wheres the mess hall miles asked more loudly where did you get that water water taps are on the outside of the latrines said suegar but they only work part of the time no mess hall we just get rat bars sometimes sometimes said miles angrily he could count suegars ribs dammit the cetagandans are claiming loudly to be treating their pows by interstellar judiciary commission rules so many square meters of space per person calories a day at least fifty grams of protein two liters of drinking wateryou should be getting at least two ijc standard ration bars a day are they starving you after a while suegar sighed you dont really care if you get yours or not the animation that his interest in miles as a new and hopeful object in his world had lent suegar seemed to be falling away his breathing had slowed his posture slumped he seemed about to lie down in the dirt miles wondered if suegars sleeping mat had suffered the same fate as his own quite some time ago probably look suegari think i may have a relative in this camp somewhere a cousin of my mothers dyou think you could help me find him it might be good for you to have a relative suegar agreed its not good to be by yourself here yeah i found that out but how can you find anyone it doesnt look too organized oh therestheres groups and groups everyone pretty much stays in the same place after a while he was in the th commandos where are they none of the old groups are left much he was colonel tremont colonel guy tremont oh an officer suegars forehead wrinkled in worry that makes it harder you werent an officer were you better not let on if you were i was a clerk repeated miles because theres groups here who dont like officers a clerk youre probably ok then were you an officer suegar asked miles curiously suegar frowned at him twisted his beard hairs marilac armys gone if theres no army it cant have officers can it miles wondered briefly if he might get farther faster by just walking away from suegar and trying to strike up a conversation with the next random prisoner he came across groups and groups and presumably groups like the five burly surly brothers he decided to stick with suegar for a while longer for one thing he wouldnt feel quite so naked if he wasnt naked by himself can you take me to anybody who used to be in the th miles urged suegar anew anybody who might know tremont by sight you dont know him wed never met in person ive seen vids of him but im afraid his appearance may be changed by now suegar touched his own face pensively yeah probably miles clambered painfully to his feet the temperature in the dome was just a little cool without clothes a voiceless draft raised the hairs on his arms if he could just get one garment back would he prefer his pants to cover his genitals or his shirt to disguise his crooked back screw it no time he held out a hand to help suegar up come on suegar glanced up at him you can always tell a newcomer youre still in a hurry in here you slow down your brain slows down your scripture got anything to say on that inquired miles impatiently they therefore went up here with much agility and speed through the foundation of the city twin verticals appeared between suegars eyebrows as he frowned speculatively at miles thank you thought miles ill take it he pulled suegar up come on then neither agility nor speed but at least progress suegar led him on a shambling walk across a quarter of the camp through some groups in wide arcs around others miles saw the surly brothers again at a distance sitting on their collection of mats miles upped his estimation of the size of the tribe from five to about fifteen some men sat in twos or threes or sixes a few sat alone as far as possible from any others which still wasnt very far the largest group by far consisted entirely of women miles studied them with electric interest as soon as his eyes picked up the size of their unmarked boundary there were several hundred of them at least none were matless although some shared their perimeter was actually patrolled by groups of half a dozen or so strolling slowly about they apparently defended two latrines for their exclusive use tell me about the girls suegar miles urged his companion with a nod toward their group forget the girls suegars grin actually had a sardonic edge they do not put out what not at all none of them i mean here we all are with nothing to do but entertain each other id think at least some of them would be interested miless reason raced ahead of suegars answer mired in unpleasantness how unpleasant did it get in here for answer suegar pointed upward to the dome you know were all monitored in here they can see everything pick up every word if they want that is if theres still anybody out there they may have all gone away and just forgotten to turn the dome off i have dreams about that sometimes i dream that im here in this dome forever then i wake up and im here in this dome sometimes im not sure if im awake or asleep except that the food is still coming and once in a whilenot so often anymoresomebody new like you the food could be automated though i suppose you could be a dream theyre still out there said miles grimly suegar sighed you know in a way im almost glad monitored yes miles knew all about the monitoring he put down an urge to wave and call hi mom monitoring must be a stultifying job for the goons out there he wished they might be bored to death but whats that got to do with the girls suegar well at first everybody was pretty inhibited by that he pointed skywards again then after a while we discovered that they didnt interfere with anything we did at all there were some rapes since then things have beendeteriorating hm then i suppose the idea of starting a riot and breaching the dome when they bring troops inside to restore order is a nogo that was tried once a long time ago dont know how long suegar twisted his hairs they dont have to come inside to stop a riot they can reduce the domes diameterthey reduced it to about a hundred meters that time nothing to stop them reducing it down to one meter with all of us still inside if they choose it stopped the riot anyway or they can reduce the gas permeability of the dome to zilch and just let us breathe ourselves into a coma thats happened twice i see said miles it made his neck crawl a bare hundred or so meters away the side of the dome began to bulge inward like an aneurysm miles touched suegars arm whats happening there more new prisoners being delivered suegar glanced around uh oh were not in a real good position here he hovered a moment as if uncertain whether to go forward or back a wave of movement rippled through the camp from the bulge outward of people getting to their feet faces turned magnetically toward the side of the dome little knots of men came together a few sprinters began running some people didnt get up at all miles glanced back towards the womens group about half of them were forming rapidly into a sort of phalanx were so closewhat the hell maybe weve got a chance said suegar come on he started toward the bulge at his most rapid pace a jog miles perforce jogged too trying to jar his ribs as little as possible but he was quickly winded and his rapid breathing added an excruciating torque to his torso what are we doing miles started to pant to suegar before the domes extruding bulge dissolved with a fading twinkle and he saw what they were doing saw it all before the force domes shimmering barrier now sat a dark brown pile roughly a meter high two meters deep three meters wide ijc standard ration bars miles recognized rat bars apocryphally named after their supposed principal ingredient fifteen hundred calories each twentyfive grams of protein fifty percent of the human mdr for vitamins a b c and the rest of the alphabettasted like a shingle sprinkled with sugar and would sustain life and health forever or for as long as you could stand to keep eating them shall we have a contest children to guess how many rat bars are in that pile miles thought no contest i dont even have to measure the height and divide by three centimeters it has to be exactly how ingenious the cetagandan psy ops corps must contain some remarkable minds if they ever fell into his hands miles wondered should he recruit themor exterminate them this brief fantasy was overwhelmed by the need to keep to his feet in the present reality as or so people minus the wholly despairing and those too weak to move all tried to descend on the same six square meters of the camp at once the first sprinters reached the pile grabbed up armloads of rat bars and started to sprint off some made it to the protection of friends divided their spoils and started to move away from the center of the growing human maelstrom others failed to dodge clots of operators like the burly surly brothers and were violently relieved of their prizes the second wave of sprinters who didnt get away in time were pinned up against the side of the dome by the incoming bodies miles and suegar unfortunately were in this second category miless view was reduced to a sweating heaving stinking swearing mass of elbows and chests and backs eat eat suegar urged around stuffed cheeks as he and miles were separated by the pack but the bar miles had grabbed was twisted out of his hands before he had gathered his wits enough to follow suegars advice anyway his hunger was nothing to his terror of being crushed or worse falling underfoot his own feet pummeled over something soft but he was unable to push back with enough strength to give the personman woman who knewa chance to get up again in time the press lessened and miles found the edge of the crowd and broke free again he staggered a little way off and fell to the dirt to sit shaken and shaking pale and cold his breath rasped unevenly in his throat it took him a long time to get hold of himself again sheer chance that this had hit his rawest nerve his darkest fears threatened his most dangerous weakness i could die here he realized without ever seeing the enemys face but there seemed to be no new bones broken except possibly in his left foot he was not too sure about his left foot the elephant who had trod on it was surely getting more than his fair share of rat bars all right miles thought at last thats enough time spent on rr on your feet soldier it was time to go find colonel tremont guy tremont the real hero of the siege of fallow core the defiant one the one whod held and held and held after general xian fled after baneri was killed xian had sworn to return but then xian had run into that meat grinder at vassily station hq had promised resupply but then hq and its vital shuttleport had been taken by the cetagandans but by this time tremont and his troops had lost communication so they held waiting and hoping eventually resources were reduced to hope and rocks rocks were versatile they could either be boiled for soup or thrown at the enemy at last fallow core was taken not surrendered taken guy tremont miles wanted very much to meet guy tremont on his feet and looking around miles spotted a distant shambling scarecrow being pelted off from a group with clods of dirt suegar paused out of range of their missiles still pointing to the rag on his wrist and talking the three or four men he was haranguing turned their backs to him by way of a broad hint miles sighed and started trudging toward him hey suegar he called and waved when he got closer oh there you are suegar turned and brightened and joined him i lost you suegar rubbed dirt out of his eyebrows nobody wants to listen yknow yeah well most of them have heard you at least once by now right probly twenty times i keep thinking i might have missed one ysee maybe the very one the other one well id be glad to listen to you but ive really got to find colonel tremont first you said you knew somebody oh right this way suegar led off again thanks say is every chow call like that last one pretty much whats to keep somegroupfrom just taking over that arc of the dome its never issued at the same place twice they move it all around the perimeter there was a lot of strategy debated at one time as to whether it was better to be at the center sos youre never more than half a diameter away or near the edge sos to be up front at least part of the time some guys had even worked out the mathematics of it probabilities and all that which do you favor oh i dont have a spot i move around and take my chances his right hand touched his rag its not the most important thing anyway still it was good to eattoday whatever day this is today is november earth common era oh is that all suegar pulled his beard strands out straight and rolled his eyes attempting to look across his face at them thought id been here longer than that why it hasnt even been three years huh he added apologetically in here its always today mm said miles so the rat bars are always delivered in a pile like that eh yeah damned ingenious yeah suegar sighed rage barely breathed was camouflaged in that sigh in the twitch of suegars handsso my madman is not so simple here we are suegar added they paused before a group defined by half a dozen sleeping mats in a rough circle one man looked up and glowered go away suegar i aint in the mood for a sermon that the colonel whispered miles naw his names oliver i knew hima long time ago he was at fallow core though suegar whispered back he can take you to him suegar bundled miles forward this is miles hes new wants to talk to you suegar himself backed away helpfully miles realized suegar was aware of his unpopularity it seemed miles studied the next link in his chain oliver had managed to retain his grey pajamas sleeping mat and cup intact which reminded miles again of his own nakedness on the other hand oliver did not seem to be in possession of any illgotten duplicates oliver might be as burly as the surly brothers but was not otherwise related that was good not that miles in his present state need have any more worries about thievery oliver stared at miles without favor then seemed to relent what dyou want he growled miles opened his hands im looking for colonel guy tremont aint no colonels in here boy he was a cousin of my mothers nobody in the familynobody in the outside worldhas heard anything from or about him since fallow core fell iim not from any of the other units or pieces of units that are in here colonel tremont is the only person i know anything about at all miles clasped his hands together and tried to look waiflike real doubt shook him drew down his brows is he still alive even oliver frowned relative eh he scratched the side of his nose with a thick finger i suppose you got a right but it wont do you any good boy if thats what youre thinking i miles shook his head at this point i just want to know come on then oliver levered himself to his feet with a grunt and lumbered off without looking over his shoulder miles limped in his wake are you taking me to him oliver made no answer until theyd finished their journey only a few dozen meters among and between sleeping mats one man swore one spat most ignored them one mat lay at the edge of a group almost far enough away to look alone a figure lay curled up on his side with his back to them oliver stood silent big fists on hips and regarded it is that the colonel miles whispered urgently no boy oliver sucked on his lower lip only his remains miles alarmed knelt down oliver was speaking poetically miles realized with relief the man breathed colonel tremont sir miless heart sank again as he saw that breathing was about all that tremont did he lay inert his eyes open but fixed on nothing they did not even flick toward miles and dismiss him with contempt he was thin thinner than suegar even miles traced the angle of his jaw the shape of his ear from the holovids hed studied the remains of a face like the ruined fortress of fallow core it took nearly an archeologists insight to recognize the connections between past and present he was dressed his cup sat upright by his head but the dirt around his mat was churned to acrid stinking mud from urine miles realized tremonts elbows were marked with lesions the beginning of decubiti bedsores a damp patch on the grey fabric of his trousers over his body hips hinted at more advanced and horrible sores beneath yet somebody must be tending him miles thought or he wouldnt be looking even this good oliver knelt beside miles bare toes squishing in the mud and pulled a hunk of rat bar from beneath the elastic waistband of his trousers he crumbled a bit between his thick fingers and pushed it between tremonts lips eat he whispered the lips almost moved the crumbs dribbled to the mat oliver tried again seemed to become conscious of miless eyes upon him and stuffed the rest of the rat bar back into his pants with an unintelligible grumble waswas he injured when fallow core was overrun asked miles head injury oliver shook his head fallow core wasnt stormed boy but it fell on october th it was reported and it fell on october th fallow core was betrayed oliver turned and walked away before his stiffened face could betray any emotion miles knelt in the mud and let his breath trickle out slowly so and so was this the end of his quest then he wanted to pace and think but walking still hurt too much he hobbled a little way off trying not to accidentally infringe upon the territory of any sizeable group and sat then lay in the dirt with his hands behind his head staring up at the pearly glow of the dome sealed like a lid over them all he considered his options one two three he considered them carefully it didnt take long i thought you didnt believe in good guys and bad guys he had cauterized his emotions hed thought coming in here for his own protection but he could feel his carefully cultivated impartiality slipping he was beginning to hate that dome in a really intimate personal way aesthetically elegant form united with function as perfectly as an eggshell a marvel of physicsperverted into an instrument of torture subtle torture miles reviewed the interstellar judiciary commissions rules for the treatment of pows to which cetaganda was a signatory so many square meters of space per person yes they were certainly supplied with that no prisoner to be solitarily confined for a period exceeding twentyfour hoursright no solitude in here except by withdrawal into madness no dark periods longer than twelve hours that was easy no dark periods at all the perpetual glare of noon instead no beatingsindeed the guards could say with truth that they never laid a hand on their prisoners they just watched while the prisoners beat each other up instead rapes even more strictly forbidden doubtless handled the same way miles had seen what they could do with their issue of two ijc standard ration bars per person per day the rat bar riot was a particularly neat touch he thought no one could fail to participate he rubbed his growling stomach the enemy might have seeded the initial breakdown by sending in a short pile but maybe notthe first person who snatched two instead of one left another foodless maybe next time that one took three to make up for it and so it quickly snowballed breaking down any hope of order pitting group against group person against person in a scrambling dogfight a twiceaday reminder of their powerlessness and degradation none could afford for long to hold themselves aloof unless they wished to embrace slow starvation no forced laborhah check that would require the imposition of order access to medical personnelright the various units own medics must be mixed in out there somewhere he reran the wording of that paragraph through his memory againby god it did say personnel didnt it no medicine just medical personnel emptyhanded naked doctors and medtechs his lips drew back in a mirthless grin accurate lists of prisoners taken had been duly dispatched as required but no other communication communication this lack of word from the outside world might drive even him crazy shortly it was as bad as prayer talking to a god who never talked back no wonder they all seemed touched with a sort of solipsistic schizophrenia here their doubts infected him was anybody still out there could his voice be heard and understood ah blind faith the leap of faith his right hand clenched as if crushing an eggshell this he enunciated clearly calls for a major change of plans he drove himself to his feet to go find suegar again miles found him not far off hunkered in the dirt doodling suegar looked up with a brief smile did oliver take you toto your cousin yes but i came too late hes dying yeah i was afraid that might be the case sorry me too miles was momentarily distracted from his purpose by a practical curiosity suegar what do they do with dead bodies here theres a rubbish pile of sorts over against one side of the dome the dome sort of extrudes and laps it up every once in a while same way as food and new prisoners are introduced usually by the time a body swells and starts to stink somebodyll drag it over there i take em sometimes no chance of anybody sneaking out in the rubbish pile i suppose they microwaveincinerate it all before the portals opened ah miles took a deep breath and launched himself suegar its come to me i am the other one suegar nodded serenely unsurprised id had it figured miles paused nonplussed was that all the response he had expected something more energetic either pro or con it came to me in a vision he declared dramatically following his script anyway oh yeah suegars attention sharpened gratifyingly ive never gotten a vision he added with envy had to figure it all out yknow from context whats it like a trance shit and here i thought this guy talked with elves and angels miles backed down slightly no its like a thought only more compelling it storms your willburns like lust only not so easy to satisfy not like a trance because it drives you outward not inward he hesitated unsettled having spoken more truth than hed intended suegar looked vastly encouraged oh good i was afraid for a second you might be one of those guys who start talking to people nobody else can see miles glanced upward involuntarily returned his gaze straightly to suegar so thats a vision why ive felt like that his eyes seemed to focus and intensify didnt you recognize it in yourself asked miles blandly not by name its not a comfortable thing to be chosen so i tried to evade it for a long time but god finds ways of dealing with draft dodgers youre too modest suegar youve believed in your scripture but not in yourself dont you know that when youre given a task youre given the power to accomplish it as well suegar sighed in joyous satisfaction i knew it was a job for two its just like the scripture said uh right so now we are two but we must be more i guess wed better start with your friends that wont take much time said suegar wryly you got a step two in mind i hope then well start with your enemies or your nodding acquaintances well start with the first bleeding body that crosses our path it doesnt matter where we start because i mean to have them all in the end all to the last and least a particularly apt quote shot across his memory and he declaimed vigorously those who have ears let them hear all miles sent a prayer up from his heart with that one all right miles pulled suegar to his feet lets go preach to the unconverted suegar laughed suddenly i had a top kick once who used to say lets go kick some ass in just that tone of voice that too miles grimaced you understand universal membership in this congregation wont come all voluntary but you leave the recruiting to me hear suegar stroked his beard hairs regarded miles from beneath raised brows a clerk eh right yes sir they started with oliver miles gestured may we step into your office oliver rubbed his nose with the back of his hand and sniffed let me give you a piece of advice boy you aint gonna make it in here as a standup comic every joke that can possibly be made has been run into the ground even the sick ones very well miles sat crosslegged near olivers mat but not too near suegar hunkered down behind miless shoulder not so welded to the ground as if ready to skip backwards if necessary ill lay it out straight then i dont like the way things are run around here olivers mouth twisted sardonically he did not comment aloud he didnt need to im going to change them miles added shit said oliver and rolled back over starting here and now after a moments silence oliver added go away or ill pound you suegar started to get up miles irritably motioned him back down he was a commando suegar whispered worriedly he can break you in half ninetenths of the people in this camp can break me in half including the girls miles whispered back its not a significant consideration miles leaned forward grasped olivers chin and twisted his face back toward him suegar sucked his breath through his teeth with a whistle at this dangerous tactic now theres this about cynicism sergeant its the universes most supine moral position real comfortable if nothing can be done then youre not some kind of shit for not doing it and you can lie there and stink to yourself in perfect peace oliver batted miless hand down but did not turn away again rage flared in his eyes suegar tell you i was a sergeant he hissed no its written on your forehead in letters of fire listen up oliver oliver rolled over and up as far as supporting his upper body with his knuckles on his sleeping mat suegar flinched but did not flee you listen up mutant oliver snarled weve done it all already weve done drill and games and clean living exercise and cold showers except there aint no cold showers weve done group sings and floor shows weve done it by the numbers by the book by candlelight weve done it by force and made real war on each other after that we did sin and sex and sadism till we were ready to puke weve done it all at least ten times you think youre the first reformer to come through here no oliver miles leaned into his face his eyes boring into olivers burning eyes unscorched his voice fell to a whisper i think im the last oliver was silent a moment then barked a laugh by god suegar has found his soulmate at last two loonies together just like his scripture says miles paused thoughtfully sat up as straight as his spine would allow read me your scripture again suegar the full text he closed his eyes for total concentration also to discourage interruptions from oliver suegar rustled around and cleared his throat nervously for those that shall be the heirs of salvation he began thus they went along toward the gate now you must note that the city stood upon a mighty hill but the pilgrims went up that hill with ease because they had these two men to lead them by the arms also they had left their mortal garments behind them in the river for though they went in with them they came out without them they therefore went up here with much agility and speed through the foundation upon which the city was framed higher than the clouds they therefore went up through the regions of the air he added apologetically it breaks off there thats where i tore the page not sure what that signifies probably means that after that youre supposed to improvise for yourself miles suggested opening his eyes again so that was the raw material he was building on he had to admit the last line in particular gave him a turn a chill like a bellyfull of cold worms so be it forward there you are oliver thats what im offering the only hope worth breathing for salvation itself very uplifting sneered oliver uplifted is just what i intend you all to be youve got to understand oliver im a fundamentalist i take my scriptures very literally oliver opened his mouth then closed it with a snap miles had his utter attention communication at last miles breathed inwardly we have connected it would take a miracle said oliver at last to uplift this whole place mine is not a theology of the elect i intend to preach to the masses even he was definitely getting into the swing of this the sinners heaven is for everyone but miracles by their very nature must break in from outside we dont carry them in our pockets you dont thats for sure muttered oliver with a glance at miless undress we can only pray and prepare ourselves for a better world but miracles come only to the prepared are you prepared oliver miles leaned forward his voice vibrating with energy sh olivers voice trailed off he glanced for confirmation oddly enough at suegar is this guy for real he thinks hes faking it said suegar blandly but hes not hes the one all right and tight the cold worms writhed again dealing with suegar miles decided was like fencing in a hall of mirrors your target though real was never quite where it looked like it should be oliver inhaled hope and fear belief and doubt intermingled in his face how shall we be saved revrend ahcall me brother miles i think yes tell mehow many converts can you deliver on your own naked unsupported authority oliver looked extremely thoughtful just let them see that light and theyll follow it anywhere well well salvation is for all to be sure but there may be certain temporary practical advantages to maintaining a priesthood i mean blessed also are they who do not see and yet believe its true agreed oliver that if your religion failed to deliver a miracle that a human sacrifice would certainly follow ah quite miles gulped you are a man of acute insight thats not an insight said oliver thats a personal guarantee yes well to return to my question how many followers can you raise im talking bodies here not souls oliver frowned cautious still maybe twenty can any of them bring in others branch out hook in more maybe make them your corporals then i think we had better disregard any previous ranks here call it ah the army of the reborn no the reformation army that scans better we shall be reformed the body has disintegrated like the caterpillar in its chrysalis into nasty green gook but we shall reform into the butterfly and fly away oliver sniffed again just what reforms you planning just one i think the food oliver gave him a disbelieving stare you sure this isnt just a scam to get yourself a free meal true i am getting hungry miles backed off from the joke as oliver remained icily unimpressed but so are a lot of other people by tomorrow we can have them all eating out of our hands when would you want these twenty guys by the next chow call good hed startled the man that soon you understand oliver the belief that you have all the time in the world is an illusion this place fosters on purpose resist it youre sure in a hurry so you got a dental appointment i think not besides im only half your mass i gotta move twice as fast just to keep up the momentum twenty plus by next chow call what the hell do you think youre gonna be able to do with twenty guys were going to take the food pile olivers lips tightened in disgust not with twenty guys youre not no go besides its been done i told you wed made real war in here itd be a quick massacre and then after weve taken itwe redistribute it fair and square one rat bar per customer all controlled and quartermasterly to sinners and all by the next chow call everybody whos ever been shorted will be coming over to us and then well be in a position to deal with the hard cases youre nuts you cant do it not with twenty guys did i say we were only going to have twenty guys suegar did i say that suegar listening in rapt fascination shook his head well i aint sticking my neck out to get pounded unless you can produce some visible means of support said oliver this could get us killed can do miles promised recklessly one had to start lifting somewhere his imaginary bootstraps would do well enough i will deliver troops to the sacred cause by chow call you do that and ill walk the perimeter of this camp naked on my hands retorted oliver miles grinned i may hold you to that sergeant twenty plus by chow call miles stood come on suegar oliver waved them off irritably they retreated in good order when miles looked back over his shoulder oliver had arisen and was walking toward a group of occupied mats tangential to his own waving down an apparent acquaintance so where do we get troops before next chow call suegar asked i better warn you oliver was the best thing i had the next is bound to be tougher what said miles is your faith wavering so soon i believe said suegar i just dont see maybe that makes me blessed i dunno im surprised i thought it was pretty obvious there miles pointed across the camp toward the unmarked border of the womens group oh suegar stopped short oh oh i dont think so miles yes lets go you wont get in there without a changeofsex operation what as goddriven as you are havent you tried to preach your scripture to them i tried got pounded tried elsewhere after that miles paused and pursed his lips studying suegar it wasnt defeat or you wouldnt have hung on long enough to meet me was itah shame that drained your usual resolve you got something to work off in that quarter suegar shook his head not personally except maybe sins of omission i just didnt have the heart to harass em any more this whole place is suffering from sins of omission a relief that suegar wasnt some sort of selfconfessed rapist miless eyes swept the scene teasing out the pattern from the limited cues of position grouping activity yes predator pressure produces herd behavior socialfragmentation here being what it is the pressure must be pretty high to hold a group of that size together but i hadnt noticed any incidents since i got here it comes and goes said suegar phases of the moon or something phases of the moon right miles sent up a prayer of thanks in his heart to whatever gods might beto whom it may concernthat the cetagandans appeared to have implanted some standard timerelease antiovulant in all their female prisoners along with their other immunizations bless the forgotten individual whod put that clause in the ijc rules forcing he cetagandans into more subtle forms of legal torture and yet would the presence of pregnancies infants and children among the prisoners have been another destabilizing stressor a stabilizing force deeper and stronger than all the previous loyalties the cetagandans seemed to have so successfully broken down from a purely logistical viewpoint miles was elated that the question was theoretical well miles took a deep breath and pulled an imaginary hat down over his eyes at an aggressive angle im new here and so temporarily unembarrassed let he who is without sin cast the first lure besides i have an advantage for this sort of negotiation im clearly not a threat he marched forward ill wait for you here called suegar helpfully and hunkered down where he was miles timed his forward march to intersect a patrol of six women strolling down their perimeter he arranged himself in front of them and swept off his imaginary hat to hold strategically over his crotch good afternoon ladies allow me to apologize for mbeh his opening line was interrupted by a mouthful of dirt abruptly acquired as his legs were swept backward and his shoulders forward by the four women who had parted around him dumping him neatly on his face he had not even managed to spit it out when he found himself plucked up and whirled dizzily through the air still facedown by hands grasping his arms and legs a muttered count of three and he was soaring in a short forlorn arc to land in a heap not far from suegar the patrollers walked on without another word see what i mean said suegar miles turned his head to look at him you had that trajectory calculated to the centimeter didnt you he said smearily just about agreed suegar i figured they could heave you quite a bit farther than usual on account of your size miles scrambled back up to a sitting position still trying to get his wind damn the ribs which had grown almost bearable but which now wrung his chest with electric agony at every breath in a few minutes he got up and brushed himself off as an afterthought he picked up his invisible hat too dizzied he had to brace his hands on his knees a moment all right he muttered back we go miles its gotta be done suegar no other choice anyway i cant quit once ive started ive been told im pathologically persistent i cant quit suegar opened his mouth to object then swallowed his protest right he said he settled down crosslegged his right hand unconsciously caressing his rag rope library ill wait till you call me in he seemed to fall into a reverie or meditationor maybe a doze miless second foray ended precisely like the first except that his trajectory was perhaps a little wider and a little higher the third attempt went the same way but his flight was much shorter good he muttered to himself must be tiring em out this time he skipped in parallel to the patrol out of reach but well within hearing look he panted you dont have to do this piecemeal let me make it easy for you i have this teratogenic bone disorderim not a mutant you understand my genes are normal its just their expression got distorted from my mother being exposed to a certain poison while she was pregnantit was a oneshot thing wont affect any children i might havei always felt it was easier to get dates when that was clearly understood not a mutantanyway my bones are brittle in fact any one of you could probably break every one in my body you may wonder why im telling you all this in fact i usually prefer not to advertise ityou have to stop and listen to me im not a threatdo i look like a threata challenge maybe not a threatare you going to make me run all around this camp after you slow down for gods sake he would be out of wind and therefore verbal ammunition very shortly at this rate he hopped around in front of them and planted himself arms outstretched so if you are planning to break every bone in my body please do it now and get it over with because im going to keep coming back here until you do at a brief hand signal from their leader the patrol stopped facing him take him at his word suggested a tall redhead her short brush of electric copper hair fascinated miles to distraction he pictured missing masses of it having fallen to the floor at the clippers of the ruthless cetagandan prison processors ill break the left arm if youll break the right conr she continued if thats what it takes to get you to stop and listen to me for five minutes so be it miles responded not retreating the redhead stepped forward and braced herself locking his left elbow in an arm bar putting on the pressure five minutes right miles added desperately as the pressure mounted her stare scorched his profile he licked his lips closed his eyes held his breath and waited the pressure reached criticalhe rose on his toes she released him abruptly so that he staggered men she commented disgustedly always gotta make everything a peeing contest biology is destiny gasped miles popping his eyes back open or are you some kind of pervertdo you get off on being beaten up by women god i hope not he remained unbetrayed by unauthorized salutes from his nether parts just barely if he was going to be around that redhead much he was definitely going to have to get his pants back somehow if i said yes would you refrain just to punish me he offered shit no it was just a thought cut the crap beatrice said the patrol leader at a jerk of her head the redhead stepped back into formation all right runt youve got your five minutes maybe thank you maam miles took a breath and reordered himself as best he could with no uniform to adjust first let me apologize for intruding upon your privacy in this undress practically the first persons i met upon entering this camp were a selfhelp groupthey helped themselves to my clothes among other things i saw that confirmed beatricetheredhead unexpectedly pitts bunch miles pulled off his hat and swept her a bow with it yes thank you you moon people behind you when you do that she commented dispassionately thats their lookout responded miles for myself i want to talk to your leader or leaders i have a serious plan for improving the tone of this place with which i wish to invite your group to collaborate bluntly you are the largest remaining pocket of civilization not to mention military order in here id like to see you expand your borders it takes everything weve got to keep our borders from being overrun son replied the leader no can do so take yourself off jack yourself off too suggested beatrice you aint gettin any in here miles sighed and turned his hat around in his hands by its wide brim he spun it for a moment on one finger and locked eyes with the redhead note my hat it was the one garment i managed to keep from the ravages of the burly surly brotherspitts bunch you say she snorted at the turn of phrase those jerks why just a hat why not pants why not a fulldress uniform while youre at it she added sarcastically a hat is a more useful object for communicating you can make broad gestures he did so denote sincerity he held it over his heart or indicate embarrassment over his genitals with a hangdog crouch or rage he flung it to earth as if he might drive it into the ground then picked it up and brushed it off carefully or determination he jammed it on his head and yanked the brim down over his eyes or make courtesies he swept it off again in salute to her do you see the hat she was beginning to be amused yes do you see the feathers on the hat yes describe them ohplumey things how many two bunched together do you see the color of the feathers she drew back suddenly selfconscious again with a sidewise glance at her companions no when you can see the color of the feathers said miles softly youll also understand how you can expand your borders to infinity she was silent her face closed and locked but the patrol leader muttered maybe this little runt better talk to tris just this once the woman in charge had clearly been a front line trooper once not a tech like the majority of the females she had certainly not acquired the muscles that flowed like braided leather cords beneath her skin from crouching by the hour in front of a holovid display in some rearechelon underground post she had toted the real weapons that spat real death and sometimes broke down had rammed against the limits of what could really be done by flesh and bone and metal and been marked by that deforming press illusion had been burned out of her like an infection leaving a cauterized scar rage burned permanently in her eyes like a fire in a coal seam underground and unquenchable she might be thirtyfive or forty god im in love thought miles brother miles wants you for the reformation army then got hold of his thoughts here now was the makeorbreak point for his scheme and all the persiflage verbal misdirection charm chutzpah and bullshit he could muster werent going to be enough not even tied up with a big blue bow the wounded want power nothing else they think it will keep them from being hurt again this one will not be interested in suegars strange messageat least not yet miles took a deep breath maam im here to offer you command of this camp she stared at him as if he were something shed found growing on the walls in a dark corner of the latrine her eyes raked over his nudity miles could feel the claw marks glowing from his chin to his toes which you store in your duffel bag no doubt she growled command of this camp doesnt exist mutant so its not yours to give deliver him to our perimeter in pieces beatrice he ducked the redhead he would pursue correction of the mutant business later command of this camp is mine to create he asserted note please that what i offer is power not revenge revenge is too expensive a luxury commanders cant afford it tris uncoiled from her sleeping mat to her full height then had to bend her knees to bring her face level to his hissing too bad little turd you almost interest me because i want revenge on every man in this camp then the cetagandans have succeeded youve forgotten who your real enemy is say rather that ive discovered who my real enemy is do you want to know the things theyve done to usour own guys the cetagandans want you to believe this a wave of his hand embraced the camp is something youre doing to each other so fighting each other you become their puppets they watch you all the time you know voyeurs of your humiliation her glance flicked upward infinitesimally good it was almost a disease among these people that they would look in any direction at all in preference to up at the dome power is better than revenge suggested miles not flinching before her snakecold set face her hot coal eyes power is a live thing by which you reach out to grasp the future revenge is a dead thing reaching out from the past to grasp you and youre a bullshit artist she interrupted reaching out to grasp whatevers going down ive got you pegged now this is power she flexed her arm under his nose muscles coiling and loosing this is the only power that exists in here you havent got it and youre looking for some to cover your ass but youve come to the wrong store no miles denied and tapped his forehead this is power and i own the store this controls that he slapped his bunched fist men may move mountains but ideas move men minds can be reached through bodieswhat else is the point of all this he waved at the camp but to reach your minds through your bodies but that power flows both ways and the outflow is the stronger tide when you have allowed the cetagandans to reduce your power to that alone he squeezed her bicep for emphasisit was like squeezing a rock covered in velvet and she tensed enraged at the liberty then you have allowed them to reduce you to your weakest part and they win they win anyway she snapped shrugging him off he breathed relief that she hadnt chosen to break his arm nothing that we do within this circle will result in any net change were still prisoners whatever we do they can cut off the food or the damn air or squeeze us to mush and times on their side if we spill our guts restoring orderif thats what youre trying to work up toall they have to do is wait for it to break down again were beaten were taken theres nobody left out there were here forever and youd better start getting used to the idea ive heard that song before said miles use your head if they meant to keep you forever they could have incinerated you at the start and saved the considerable expense of operating this camp no its your minds they want you are all here because you were marilacs best and brightest the hardest fighters the strongest baddest most dangerous the ones any potential resisters to the occupation would look to for leadership its the cetagandans plan to break you and then return you to your world like little innoculated infections counseling surrender to your people when this is killed he touched her forehead oh so lightly then the cetagandans have nothing more to fear from this one finger on her bicep and you will all go free to a world whose horizon will encircle you just like this dome and just as inescapably the wars not over you are here because the cetagandans are still waiting for the surrender of fallow core he thought for a moment she might murder him strangle him on the spot she must certainly prefer ripping him apart to letting him see her weep she regained her protective bitter tension with a toss of her head a gulp of air if thats true then following you puts us farther from freedom not closer damn a logician to boot she didnt have to pound him she could parse him to death if he didnt scramble he scrambled there is a subtle difference between being a prisoner and being a slave i dont mistake either for being free neither do you she fell silent staring at him through slitted eyes pulling unconsciously on her lower lip youre an odd one she said at last why do you say you and not we miles shrugged casually blasthe rapidly reviewed his pitchshe was right he had a little too close to the edge there he might yet make an opportunity of the mistake though do i look like the flower of marilacs military might im an outsider trapped in a world i never made a travellera pilgrimjust passing through ask suegar she snorted that loonie shed missed the catch rats as elli would say he missed elli try again later dont discount suegar he has a message for you i found it fascinating ive heard it i find it irritating so what do you want out of this and dont tell me nothing cause i wont believe you frankly i think youre after command of the camp yourself and im not volunteering to be your stepping stone in some empirebuilding scheme she was thinking at speed now and constructively actually following out trains of thought besides that of having him removed to her border in bits he was getting warmer i only wish to be your spiritual advisor i do not wantindeed cant usecommand just an advisor it must have been something about the term advisor that clicked some old association of hers her eyes flicked fully open suddenly he was close enough to see her pupils dilate she leaned forward and her index finger traced the faint indentations on his face beside his nose caused by certain control leads in a space armor helmet she straightened again and her first two fingers in a v caressed the deeper marks permanently flanking her own nose what did you say you were before a clerk recruiting office miles replied sturdily i see and if what she saw was the absurdity of someone claiming to be a rearechelon clerk having worn combat armor often and long enough to have picked up its stigmata he was in maybe she coiled herself back on her sleeping mat and gestured toward its other end sit down chaplain and keep talking suegar was genuinely asleep when miles found him again sitting up crosslegged and snoring miles tapped him on the shoulder wake up suegar were home he snorted to consciousness god i miss coffee huh he blinked at miles youre still in one piece it was a near thing look this garmentsintheriver bitnow that weve found each other do we have to go on being naked or is the prophecy sufficiently fulfilled huh can we get dressed now miles repeated patiently whyi dont know i suppose if we were meant to have clothes theyd be given to us miles prodded and pointed there theyre given to us beatrice stood a few meters away in a hipshot pose of bored exasperation a bundle of grey cloth under her arm you two loonies want this stuff or not im going back you got them to give you clothes suegar whispered in amazement us suegar us miles motioned to beatrice i think its all right she fired the bundle at him sniffed and stalked away thanks miles called he shook out the fabric two sets of grey pajamas one small one large miles had only to turn up the bottoms of the pants legs one fold to keep them from catching under his heels they were stained and stiff with old sweat and dirt and had probably been peeled off a corpse miles reflected suegar crawled into his and stood fingering the grey fabric in wonder they gave us clothes gave us he muttered howd you do that they gave us everything suegar come on ive got to talk to oliver again miles dragged suegar off determinedly i wonder how much time weve actually got before the next chow call two in each twentyfourhour cycle to be sure but i wouldnt be surprised if its irregular to increase your temporal disorientationafter all its the only clock in here movement caught miless eye a man running it wasnt the occasional flurry of someone outrunning a hostile group this one just ran head down flat out bare feet thumping the dirt in frantic rhythm he followed the perimeter generally except for a detour around the border of the womens group as he ran he wept whats this miles asked suegar with a nod at the approaching figure suegar shrugged it takes you like that sometimes when you cant stand sitting in here any more i saw a guy run till he died once around and around and around well miles decided this ones running to us hes gonna be running away from us in a second then help me catch him miles hit him low and suegar high suegar sat on his chest miles sat on his right arm halving his effective resistance he must have been a very young soldier when he was capturedmaybe he had lied about his age at inductionfor even now he had a boys face ravaged by tears and his personal eternity inside this hollow pearl he inhaled in sobbing gasps and exhaled in garbled obscenities after a time he quieted miles leaned into his face and grinned wolfishly you a party animal boy yeah his whiterimmed eyes rolled right and left but no rescue approached how bout your friends they party animals too the best the boy asserted perhaps secretly shaken by the suspicion that hed fallen into the hands of someone even crazier than himself you better clear off me mutant or theyll take you apart i want to invite you and your friends to a major party miles chanted we gonna have a party tonight thats an historical event you know where to find sergeant oliver late of the th commandos yeah the boy admitted cautiously well you go get your friends and report to him you better reserve your seat aboard his vehicle now cause if youre not on it you gonna be under it the reformation army is moving out you copy copy he gasped as suegar pressed his fist into the boys solar plexus for emphasis tell him brother miles sent you miles called as the boy staggered off glancing nervously over his shoulder you cant hide in here if you dont show ill send the cosmic commandos to find you suegar shook out his cramped limbs his new used clothes think hell come miles grinned fight or flight that onell be all right he stretched himself recaptured his original orientation oliver in the end they had not twenty but oliver had picked up fortysix the running boy brought in eighteen the signs of order and activity in the area brought in the curiousa drifter at the edge of the group had only to ask whats going on to be inducted and promoted to corporal on the spot interest among the spectators was aroused to a fever when olivers troops marched up to the womens borderand were admitted within they picked up another seventyfive volunteers instantly do you know whats going on miles asked one such as he fed them through a short gauntlet of inspection and sent them off to one of the fourteen command groups he had devised no the man admitted he waved an arm eagerly toward the center of the womens group but i wanta go where theyre going miles cut the admissions off at total in deference to triss growing nervousness at this infiltration of her borders and promptly turned the courtesy into a card in his own hand in their stillcontinuing strategy debate tris wanted to divide her group in the usual way half for the attack half to maintain home base and keep the borders from collapsing miles was insisting on an allout effort if we win you wont need guards anymore what if we lose miles lowered his voice we dont dare lose this is the only time well have surprise on our side yes we can fall backregrouptry againi for one am preparedno compelledto keep trying till it kills me but after this what were trying to do will be fully apparent to any countergroup and theyll have time to plan counterstrategies of their own i have a particular aversion to stalemates i prefer winning wars to prolonging them she sighed momentarily drained tired old ive been at war a long time yknow after a while even losing a war can start to look preferable to prolonging it he could feel his own resolve slip sucked into the vortex of that same black doubt he pointed upwards dropping his voice to a rasping whisper but not surely to those bastards she glanced upwards her shoulders straightened no not to those she took a deep breath all right chaplain youll get your allout effort just once oliver returned from a circuit of the command groups and squatted beside them theyve got their orders how manys tris contributing to each group commandant tris miles quickly corrected for her as her brows beetled its gonna be an allout shot youll get every walking body in here oliver made a quick calculation in the dirt with his finger for a stylus thatll put about fifty in each groupought to be enough matter of fact what say we set up twenty groups itll speed distribution when we get the lines set up could make the difference between bringing this off and not no miles cut in quickly as tris began to nod agreement it has to be fourteen fourteen battle groups make fourteen lines for fourteen piles fourteen isis a theologically significant number he added as they stared doubtfully at him why asked tris for the fourteen apostles miles intoned tenting his hands piously tris shrugged suegar scratched his head started to speakmiles speared him with a baleful glance and he stilled oliver eyed him narrowly huh but he did not argue further then came the waiting miles stopped worrying about his uppermost fearthat their captors would introduce the next food pile early before his plans were in placeand started worrying about his second greatest fear that the food pile would come so late hed lose control of his troops and they would start to wander off bored and discouraged getting them all assembled had made miles feel like a man pulling on a goat with a rope made of water never had the insubstantial nature of the idea seemed more selfapparent oliver tapped him on the shoulder and pointed here we go a side of the dome about a third of the way around the edge from them began to bulge inward the timing was perfect his troops were at the peak of readiness too perfect the centagandans had been watching all this surely they wouldnt miss an opportunity to make life more difficult for their prisoners if the food pile wasnt early it had to be late or miles bounded to his feet screaming wait wait wait for my order his sprint groups wavered drawn toward the anticipated goal but oliver had chosen his group commanders wellthey held and held their groups and looked to oliver they had been soldiers once oliver looked to tris flanked by her lieutenant beatrice and tris looked to miles angrily what is it now were gonna lose our advantage she began as the general stampede throughout the camp started toward the bulge if im wrong miles moaned im going to kill myselfwait dammit on my order i cant seesuegar give me a boost he clambered up on the thin mans shoulders and stared toward the bulge the force wall had only half twinkled out when the first distant cries of disappointment met his straining ears miless head swivelled frantically how many wheels within wheelsif the cetagandans knew and he knew they knew and they knew he knew they knew and he cut off his internal gibber as a second bulge began on the opposite side of the camp from the first miless arm flung out pointing toward it like a man rolling dice there there go go go tris caught on then whistling and shooting him a look of startled respect before whirling and dashing off to doubletime the main body of their troops after the sprint groups miles slithered off suegar and started limping after he glanced back over his shoulder as the rolling grey mass of humanity crashed up against the opposite side of the dome and reversed itself he felt suddenly like a man trying to outrun a tidal wave he indulged himself with one brief anticipatory whimper and limped faster one more chance to be mortally wrongno his sprint groups had reached the pile and the pile was really there already they were starting to break it down the support troops surrounded them with a wall of bodies as they began to spread out along the perimeter of the dome the cetagandans had outfoxed themselves this time miles was reduced from the commanders eagle overview to the grunts wormseye as the tidal wave overtook him someone shoved him from behind and his face hit the dirt he thought he recognized the back of the surly pitt vaulting over him but he wasnt certain surly pitt would have stepped on not over him suegar yanked him up by the left arm and miles bit back a scream of pain there was enough howling already miles recognized the running boy squaring off with another tough miles shoved past him with a shouted reminderyoure supposed to be yelling get in line not get fucked the signal always gets degraded in combat he muttered to himself always beatrice materialized beside him miles clung to her instantly beatrice had personal space her own private perimeter maintained even as miles watched by a casual elbow to somebodys jaw with a quite sickening crack if he tried that miles reflected enviously not only would he smash his own elbow but his opponents nipple would probably be quite undamaged speaking of nipples he found himself face towell not faceconfronting the redhead he resisted the urge to cuddle into the soft grey fabric covering home base with a contented sigh on the grounds that it would certainly get both his arms broken he uncrossed his eyes and looked up into her face cmon she said and dragged him off through the mob was the noise level dropping the human wall of his own troops parted just enough to let them squeeze through they were near the exit point of the chow line it was working by god it was working the fourteen command groups still bunched rather too closely along the dome wallbut that could be improved next runwere admitting the hungry supplicants one at a time the expediters kept the lines moving at top speed and channeled the alreadysupplied along the perimeter behind the human shield wall in a steady stream to flow back out into the larger camp at the edge of the mob oliver had put his toughestlooking bravos to work in pairs patrolling the outflow and making sure no ones rat bar was taken by force it was a long time since anyone here had had a chance to be a hero not a few of the newlyappointed policemen were approaching their work with great enthusiasmmaybe some personal grudges being worked off theremiles recognized one of the burly surlys prone beneath a pair of patrollers apparently getting his face beaten in miles remembering what he was about tried not to find music in the meaty thunks of fist on flesh miles and beatrice and suegar bucked the stream of rat barclutching prisoners back toward the distribution piles with a slightly regretful sigh miles sought out oliver and dispatched him to the exit to restore order among his orderkeepers tris had the distribution piles and their immediate lines under tight control miles congratulated himself on having the women hand out the food he had definitely tuned into a deep emotional resonance there not a few of the prisoners even muttered a sheepish thank you as their rat bars were shoved into their hands and so did the ones in line behind them when their turns came nyah miles thought upward to the bland and silent dome you dont have the monopoly on psychological warfare any more you bastards were gonna reverse your peristalsis and i hope you barf your bowels out an altercation at one of the food piles interrupted his meditations miless lip curled with annoyance as he saw pitt in the middle of it he limped hastily toward it pitt it appeared had repaid his rat bar not with a thank you but with a leer a jeer and a filthy remark at least three of the women within hearing were trying to rip him apart without success he was big and beefy and had no inhibitions about fighting back one of the females not much taller than miles himself was knocked back in a heap and didnt get up again in the meantime the line was jammed and the smooth civilized flow of wouldbe diners totally disrupted miles cursed under his breath you you you andyou miles tapped shoulders grab that guy get him out of hereback to the dome wall miless draftees were not terribly pleased with their assignment but by this time tris and beatrice had run up and led the attack with rather more science pitt was seized and pulled away behind the lines miles made sure the rat bar distribution pile was running again before turning his attention to the savage foulmouthed pitt oliver and suegar had joined him by this time im gonna rip the bastards balls off tris was saying i command a military command miles interrupted if this one is accused of disorderly conduct you should court martial him he is a rapist and a murderer she replied icily executions too good for him hes got to die slowly miles pulled suegar aside its tempting but i feel real uneasy about handing him over to her just now and yet real uneasy why is that suegar eyed him respectfully i think youre right you see theres theres too many guilty pitt now in a foaming fury spotted miles you you little cuntlicking wimpyou think they can protect you he jerked his head toward tris and beatrice they aint got the muscle weve run em over before and well run em over again we wouldnta lost the damn war if wed had real soldierslike the barrayarans they didnt fill their army with cunts and cuntlickers and they ran the cetagandans right off their planet somehow miles growled drawn in i doubt youre an expert in the barrayarans defense of their homeworld in the first cetagandan war or you might have learned something did tris make you an honorary girl mutant jeered pitt in return it wouldnt take much why am i standing here bandying words with this lowlife crazy miles asked himself as pitt raved on no time lets finish it miles stepped back and folded his arms has it occurred to any of you yet that this man is clearly a cetagandan agent even pitt was shocked to silence the evidence is plain miles went on forcefully raising his voice so all bystanders could hear he is a ringleader in your disruption by example and guile he has corrupted the honest soldiers around him set them one against another you were marilacs best the cetagandans could not count on your fall so they planted a seed of evil among you just to make sure and it workedwonderfully well you never suspected oliver grabbed miless ear and muttered brother milesi know this guy hes no cetagandan agent hes just one of a whole lot of oliver miles hissed back through clenched teeth shut up and continued in his clearest paradeground bellow of course hes a cetagandan spy a mole and all this time you thought this was something you were doing to yourselves and where the devil does not exist miles thought to himself it may become expedient to invent him his stomach churned but he kept his face set in righteous rage he glanced at the faces around him not a few were as white as his must be though for a different reason a low mutter rose among them partly bewildered partly ominous pull off his shirt miles ordered and lay him down on his face suegar give me your cup suegars plastic cup had a jagged point along its broken edge miles sat on pitts buttocks and using the point as a stylus scratched the words ceta spy across pitts back in large print he dug deep and ruthlessly and the blood welled pitt screamed and swore and bucked miles scrambled to his feet shaking and breathless from more than just the physical exertion now he ordered give him his rat bar and escort him to the exit triss teeth opened in objection clicked back down her eyes burned into pitts back as he was hustled off her gaze turned rather more doubtfully to miles as she stood on one side of him and oliver on the other do you really think he was a cetagandan she asked miles lowly no way scoffed oliver what the hells the charade all about brother miles i dont doubt triss accusation of his other crimes said miles tightly you must know but he couldnt be punished for them without dividing the camp and so undermining triss authority this way tris and the women have their revenge without half the men being set against them the commandants hands are clean yet justice is done on a criminal and a hard case who would doubtless be stockade bait outside is removed from under our feet furthermore any likeminded souls are handed a warning they cant ignore it works on every level olivers face had grown expressionless after a silent moment he remarked you fight dirty brother miles i cant afford to lose miles shot him a black look from beneath his own lowered brows can you olivers lips tightened no tris made no comment at all miles personally oversaw the delivery of rat bars to all those prisoners too sick or weak or beaten to have attempted the chow line colonel tremont lay too still upon his mat curled up staring blankly oliver knelt and closed the drying fixed eyes the colonel might have died anytime in the last few hours im sorry said miles sincerely sorry i came so late well said oliver well he stood chewing on his lip shook his head and said no more miles and suegar tris and beatrice helped oliver carry the body mat clothes cup and all to the rubbish pile oliver shoved the rat bar he had reserved under the dead mans arm no one attempted to strip the corpse after they had turned away although another one stiffening there had already been so robbed lying naked and tumbled they stumbled across pitts body shortly thereafter the cause of death was most probably strangulation but the face was so battered that its empurpling was not a certain clue tris squatting beside it looked up at miles in slow reestimation i think you may be right about power after all little man and revenge i thought i could never get my fill of it she sighed contemplating the thing beside her yeah that too thank you miles prodded the body with his toe make no mistake that is a loss for our side miles made suegar let somebody else drag it to the rubbish pile miles held a council of war immediately after chow call tremonts pallbearers whom miles had begun to think of as his general staff and the fourteen group leaders gathered around him at a spot near the borders of the womens group miles paced back and forth before them gesturing energetically i commend the group leaders for an excellent job and sergeant oliver for choosing them by bringing this off we have bought not only the allegiance of the greater part of the camp but time as well each chow call after this should run a little easier a little smoother each become a reallife practice drill for the next and make no mistake this is a military exercise were at war again weve already suckered the cetagandans into breaking their carefully calculated routine and making a countermove we acted they reacted strange as it may all seem to you we had the offensive advantage now we start planning our next strategies i want your thinking on what the next cetagandan challenge will be actually i want you thinking period so much for the sermoncommandant tris take over miles forced himself to sit down crosslegged yielding the floor to his chosen one whether she wanted it or not he reminded himself that tris had been a field officer not a staff officer she needed the practice more than he did of course they can send in short piles again like they did before she began after clearing her throat its been suggested thats how this mess got started in the first place her glance crossed miless who nodded encouragingly this means were going to have to start keeping head counts and work out a strict rotation schedule in advance of people to divide their rations with the shortchanged each group leader must choose a quartermaster and a couple of accountants to doublecheck his count an equally disruptive move the cetagandans may try miles couldnt help putting in is to send in an overstock giving us the interesting problem of how to equitably divide the extras id provide for that too if i were you he smiled blandly up at tris she raised an eyebrow at him and continued they may also try dividing the chow pile complicating our problem of capturing it so as to strictly control its redistribution are there any other really dirty tricks any of you can anticipate she couldnt help glancing at miles one of the group leaders raised his hand hesitantly maam theyre listening to all this arent we doing their thinking for them miles rose to answer that one loud and clear of course theyre listening weve doubtless got their quivering attention he made a rude gesture domewards let them every move they make is a message from outside a shadow marking their shape information about them well take it suppose said another group leader even more hesitantly they cut off our air again permanently then said miles smoothly they lose their hardwon position oneup on the ijc which theyve gone to enormous trouble to gain its a propaganda coup theyve been making much of lately particularly since our side in the stress of the way things are going back home hasnt been able to maintain its own troops in style let alone any captured cetagandans the cetagandans whose published view is that theyre sharing their imperial government with us out of cultural generosity are claiming this as a demonstration of their superior civilization and good manners some jeers and catcalls marked the prisoners view of this assertion and miles smiled and went on the death rate reported for this camp is so extraordinary its caught the ijcs attention the cetagandans have managed to account for it so far through three separate ijc inspections but would be a bit extreme even for them to justify a shiver of agreement compressed rage ran through his rapt listeners miles sat again oliver leaned over to him to whisper how the hell did you come by all that information miles smirked did it sound convincing good oliver sat back looking unnerved you dont have any inhibitions at all do you not in combat tris and her group leaders spent the next two hours laying out chow call scenario flow charts and their tactical responses at each branching they broke up to let the group leaders pass it on to their chosen subordinates and oliver to his crew of supplementary enforcers tris paused before miles who had succumbed to gravity sometime during the second hour and now lay in the dirt staring somewhat blankly at the dome blinking in an effort to keep his blurring eyes open he had not slept in the day and a half before entering this place he was not sure how much time had passed since then i thought of one more scenario tris remarked what do we do if they do nothing at all do nothing change nothing miles smiled sleepily it seems most probable that attempted doublecross on the last chow call was a slip on their part i think but in the absence of an enemy how long can we go on pretending were an army she persisted you scraped us up off the bottom for this when it runs down at last what then miles curled up on his side drowning in weird and shapeless thoughts and enticed by the hint of an erotic dream about a tall aggressive redhead his yawn cracked his face then we pray for a miracle remind me to discuss miracles with you later he halfwoke once when somebody shoved a sleeping mat under him he gave beatrice a sleepy bedroom smile crazy mutant she snarled at him and rolled him roughly onto the pad dont you go thinking this was my idea why suegar miles muttered i think she likes me he cuddled back into the entwining limbs of the dreambeatrice in fleeting peace to miless secret dismay his analysis proved right the cetagandans returned to their original rat bar routine unresponsive again to their prisoners internal permutations miles was not sure he liked that true it gave him ample opportunity to finetune his distribution scheme but some harassment from the dome would have directed the prisoners attention outward given them a foe again above all broken the paralyzing boredom of their lives in the long run tris must prove right i hate an enemy who doesnt make mistakes miles muttered irritably and flung his efforts into events he could control he found a phlegmatic prisoner with a steady heartbeat to lie in the dirt and count his own pulse and began timing distribution and then working on reducing timing its a spiritual exercise he announced when he had his fourteen quartermasters start issuing the rat bars at a time with thirtyminute breaks between groups its a change of pace he explained in an aside to tris if we cant induce the cetagandans to provide some variety well just have to do it ourselves he also finally got an accurate head count of the surviving prisoners miles was everywhere exhorting producing pushing restraining if you really want it to go faster make more bleeding piles oliver protested dont blaspheme said miles and went to work inducing his groups to cart their rat bars away to distribution piles spaced evenly around the perimeter at the end of the nineteenth chow call since he had entered the camp miles judged his distribution system complete and theologically correct calling every two chow calls a day he had been there nine days im all done he realized with a groan and its too early weeping because you have no more worlds to conquer inquired tris with a sarcastic grin by the thirtysecond chow call the system was still running smoothly but miles was getting frayed welcome to the long haul said beatrice dryly you better start pacing yourself brother miles if what tris says is true were going to be in here even longer because of you i must remember to thank you for that properly sometime she treated him to a threatening smirk and miles prudently remembered an errand on the opposite side of the camp she was right miles thought depressed most prisoners here counted their captivity not in days and weeks but months and years he himself was likely to be gibbering nuts in a space of time that most of them would regard as a mere breath he wondered glumly what form his madness would take manic inspired by the glittering delusion that he wassaythe conquerer of komarr or depressive like tremont curling up in himself until he was no one at all a sort of human black hole miracles there had been leaders throughout history who had been wrong in their timing for armageddon leading their shorn flocks up the mountain to await an apotheosis that never came their later lives were usually marked by obscurity and drinking problems nothing to drink in here miles wanted about six doubles right now now now now miles took to walking the dome perimeter after each chow call partly to make or at least pretend to inspection partly to burn off a little of his uncomfortably accumulating nervous energy it was getting harder and harder to sleep there had been a period of quiet in the camp after the chow calls were successfully regulated as if their ordering had been a crystal dropped in a supersaturated solution but in the last few days the number of fistfights broken up by the enforcers had risen the enforcers themselves were getting quicker to violence acquiring a potentially unsavory swagger phases of the moon who could outrace the moon slow down miles complained suegar ambling along beside him sorry miles restrained his stride and broke his selfabsorption to look around the glowing dome rose on his left hand seeming to pulse to an unsettling hum just out of the range of his hearing quiet spread out on his right groups of people mostly sitting not that much visible change since his first day in here maybe a little less tension maybe a little more concerted care being taken of the injured or ill phases of the moon he shook off his unease and smiled cheerfully at suegar you getting any more positive responses to your sermons these days miles asked wellnobody tries to beat me up anymore said suegar but then i havent been preaching so often being busy with the chow calls and all and then there are the enforcers now its hard to say you going to keep trying oh yes suegar paused ive seen worse places than this yknow i was at a mining camp once when i was scarcely more than a kid a fire gem strike for a change instead of one big company or the government muscling in it had gotten divided up into hundreds and hundreds of little claims usually about two meters square guys dug out there by hand with trowels and whisk broomsbig fire gems are delicate yknow theyll shatter at a careless blowthey dug under the broiling sun day after day a lot of these guys had less clothes than us now a lot of em didnt eat as good or as regular working their butts off more accidents more disease than here there were fights too in plenty but they lived for the future performed the most incredible feats of physical endurance for hope all voluntary they were obsessed they werewell you remind me a lot of them they wouldnt quit for nothing they turned a mountain into a chasm in a year with hand trowels it was nuts i loved it this place suegar glanced around just makes me scared shitless his right hand touched his rag rope bracelet itll suck up your future swallow you downits like death is just a formality after that zombie town suicide city the day i stop trying this placell eat me mm agreed miles they were nearing what miles thought of as the farthest point of their circuit across the camp from the womens group at whose nowpermeable borders miles and suegar kept their sleeping mats a couple of men walking the perimeter from the opposite direction coalesced with another greypajamad pair as if casually and spontaneously three more arose from their mats on miless right he could not be sure without turning his head but miles thought he caught more peripheral motion closing in behind him the approaching four stopped a few meters in front of them miles and suegar hesitated greyclad men all variously larger than miles who wasntfrowning full of a fierce tension that arced to miles and screed down his nerves miles recognized only one of them an exsurly brother hed seen in pitts company miles didnt bother taking his eyes off pitts lieutenant to look around for enforcers for one thing he was pretty sure one of the men in the company facing them was an enforcer and the worst of it was getting corneredif you could call it that in herewas his own fault for letting his movements fall into a predictable daily routine a stupid basic beginners mistake that inexcusable pitts lieutenant stepped forward chewing on his lip staring at miles with hollowed eyes hes psyching himself up miles realized if all he wanted was to beat me to a pulp he could do it in his sleep the man slid a carefullybraided rag rope through his fingers a strangling cord no it wasnt going to be another beating this time it was going to be premeditated murder you said pitts lieutenant hoarsely i couldnt figure you out at first youre not one of us you could never have been one of us mutant you gave me the clue yourself pitt wasnt a cetagandan spy you are and lunged forward miles dodged overwhelmed by onslaught and insight damn hed known there must be a good reason scragging pitt that way had felt so much like a mistake despite its efficiency the false accusation was twoedged as dangerous to its wielder as its victimpitts lieutenant might even believe his accusation truemiles had started a witchhunt poetic justice that he be its first victim but where would it end no wonder their captors hadnt interfered lately their silent cetagandan watchers must be falling off their station chairs laughing right nowmistake piled on mistake culminating here by dying stupidly like vermin at the hands of vermin in this verminous hole hands grabbed him he contorted spasmodically kicking out but only halfbroke their hold beside him suegar whirled kicked struck shouted with demonic energy he had reach but lacked mass miles lacked both reach and mass still suegar managed to break an assailants hold on miles for a moment suegars left arm lashing out for a backhand blow was caught and locked miles winced in sympathetic anticipation of the familiar muffled crack of breaking bones but instead the man stripped off the rag rope bracelet from suegars wrist hey suegar the man taunted dancing backward look what i got suegars head swivelled his attention wrenched from his determined defense of miles the man peeled the wrinkled tattered piece of paper from its cloth covering and waved it in the air suegar cried out in dismay and started to plunge toward him but found himself blocked by two other bodies the man tore the paper in half twice then paused as if momentarily puzzled how to dispose of itthen with a sudden grin stuffed the pieces in his mouth and started chewing suegar screamed dammit cried miles furiously it was me you wanted you didnt have to do that he jammed his fist with all his strength into the smirking face of the nearest attacker whose attention had been temporarily distracted by suegars show he could feel his bones shatter all the way back through his wrist he was so damn tired of the bones tired of being hurt again and again suegar was screaming and sobbing and trying to gain on the paper chewer who stood and chewed on through his grin suegar had lost all science in his attack flailing like a windmill miles saw him go down then had no attention left for anything but the anaconda coil of the strangling cord settling over his own neck he managed to get one hand between the cord and his throat but it was the broken one cables of pain shuddered up his arm seeming to burrow under his skin all the way to his shoulder the pressure in his head mounted to bursting closing down his vision dark purple and yellow moirepatterned clouds boiled up in his eyes like thunder heads a flashing brush of red hair sizzled past his tunneling vision he was on the ground then with blood wonderful blood thudding back into his oxygenstarved brain it hurtgood hot and pulsing he lay for a moment not caring about anything else it would be so good not to have to get up again the damn dome cold and white and featureless mocked his returning vision miles jerked onto his knees staring around wildly beatrice some enforcers and some of olivers commando buddies were chasing miless wouldbe assassins across the camp miles had probably only passed out for a few seconds suegar lay on the ground a couple of meters off miles crawled over to suegar the thin man lay curled up around his stomach his face pale green and clammy involuntary shivers coursing through his body not good shocky keep patient warm and administer synergine no synergine miles peeled clumsily out of his tunic and laid it over suegar suegar you all right beatrice chased the barbarians off suegar looked up and smiled briefly but the smile was reabsorbed almost immediately by distancing pain beatrice came back eventually mussed and breathing heavily you loonies she greeted them dispassionately you dont need a bodyguard you need a bloody keeper she flopped onto her knees beside miles to stare at suegar her lips thinned to a white slit she glanced at miles her eyes darkening the creases between her brows deepening ive changed my mind miles thought dont start caring for me beatrice dont start caring for anybody youll only get hurt over and over and over you better come back to my group said beatrice i dont think suegar can walk beatrice rounded up some muscle and the thin man was rolled onto a sleeping mat and carried too much like colonel tremonts corpse for miless taste back to their nowusual sleeping place find a doctor for him miles demanded beatrice came back strongarming an angry older woman hes probably got a busted belly snarled the doctor if i had a diagnostic viewer i could tell you just what was busted you got a diagnostic viewer he needs synergine and plasma you got any i could cut him and glue him back together and speed his healing with electrastim if i had an operating theatre put him back on his feet in three days no sweat you got an operating theatre i thought not stop looking at me like that i used to think i was a healer it took this place to teach me i was nothing but an interface between the technology and the patient now the technology is gone and im just nothing but what can we do asked miles cover him up in a few days hell either get better or die depending on what got busted thats all she paused standing with folded arms and regarding suegar with rancor as if his injury was a personal affront and so it was for her another load of grief and failure grinding her hardwon healers pride into the dirt i think hes going to die she added i think so too said miles then what did you want me for she stomped off later she came back with a sleeping mat and a couple of extra rags and helped put them around and over suegar for added insulation then stomped off again tris reported to miles we got those guys who tried to kill you rounded up what do you want done with em let them go said miles wearily theyre not the enemy the hell theyre not theyre not my enemies anyway it was just a case of mistaken identity im just a hapless traveller passing through wake up little man i dont happen to share olivers belief in your miracle youre not passing through here this is the last stop miles sighed im beginning to think youre right he glanced at suegar breathing shallowly and too fast beside whom he crouched in watch youre almost certainly right by this time nevertheless let them go why she wailed outraged because i said to because i asked you to would you have me beg for them aargh no all right she wheeled away running he hands through her clipped hair and muttering under her breath a timeless time passed suegar lay on his side not speaking though his eyes flicked open now and then to stare unseeing miles moistened his lips with water periodically a chow call came and went without incident or miless participation beatrice passed by and dropped two rat bars beside them stared at them with a carefullyhardened gaze of general disapproval and stalked off miles cradled his injured hand and sat crosslegged mentally reviewing the catalogue of errors that had brought him to this pass he contemplated his seeming genius for getting his friends killed he had a sick premonition that suegars death was going to be almost as bad as sergeant botharis six years ago and he had known suegar only weeks not years repeated pain as he had reason to know made one more afraid of injury not less a growing gutwrenching dread not again never again he lay back and stared at the dome the white unblinking eye of a dead god and had more friends than he knew already been killed by this megalomanic escapade it would be just like the cetagandans to leave him in here all unknowing and let the growing doubt and fear gradually drive him crazy swiftly drive him crazythe gods eye blinked miles blinked in sympathetic nervous recoil opened his eyes wide stared at the dome as if his eyes could bore right through it had it blinked had the flicker been hallucinatory was he losing it it flickered again miles shot to his feet inhaling inhaling inhaling the dome blinked out for a brief instant planetary night swept in fog and drizzle and the kiss of a cold wet wind this planets unfiltered air smelled like rotten eggs the unaccustomed dark was blinding chow call miles screamed at the top of his lungs then limbo transmuted to chaos in the brilliant flash of a smart bomb going off beyond a cluster of buildings red light glared off the underside of an enormous billowing cloud of debris blasting upward a racketing string of similar hits encircled the camp peeled back the night deafened the unprotected miles still screaming could not hear his own voice a returning fire from the ground clawed the clouds with lines of colored light tris her eyes stunned rocketed past him miles grabbed her by the arm with his good hand and dug in his heels to brake her yanking her down so he could scream in her ear this is it get the fourteen group leaders organized make em get their first blocks of lined up and waiting all around the perimeter find oliver weve got to get the enforcers moving to get the rest waiting their turn under control if this goes exactly as we drilled it well all get off i hope but if they mob the shuttles like they used to mob the rat bar pile none of us will you copy i never believedi didnt thinkshuttles you dont have to think weve drilled this fifty times just follow the chow drill the drill you sneaky little sonofabitch the acknowledging wave of her arm as she dashed off was very like a salute a string of flares erupted in the sky above the camp as if a white strobe of lightning went on and on casting a ghastly illumination on the scene below the camp seethed like a termite mound kicked over men and women were running every which way in shouting confusion not exactly the orderly vision miles had had in mind why for example had his people chosen a night drop and not a daytime onehe would grill his staff later on that point after he got done kissing their feet beatrice miles waved her down start passing the word were doing the chow call drill but instead of a rat bar each person gets a shuttle seat make em understand thatdont let anybody go haring off into the night or theyll miss their flight then come back here and stay by suegar i dont want him getting lost or trampled on guard you copy im not a damn dog what shuttles the sound miless ears had been straining for penetrated the din at last a highpitched multifaceted whine that grew louder and louder they loomed down out of the boiling scarlettinged clouds like monstrous beetles carapaced and winged feet extending even as they watched fully armored combat drop shuttles two three six seven eight miless lips moved as he counted thirteen fourteen by god they had managed to get b out of the shop in time miles pointed my shuttles beatrice stood with her mouth open staring upward my god theyre beautiful he could almost see her mind start to ratchet forward but theyre not ours not cetagandan either who the hell miles bowed this is a paid political rescue mercenaries were not something wriggling with too many legs that you found in your sleeping bag the proper tone of voice is mercenaries with a glad cry butbutbut go dammit argue later she flung up her hands and ran miles himself started tackling every person within reach passing on the order of the day he captured one of olivers tall commando buddies and demanded a boost on his shoulders a quick look around showed fourteen coagulating knots of people in the mob scattered around the perimeter in nearly the right positions the shuttles hovered engines howling then thumped to the ground one by one all around the camp itll have to do miles muttered to himself he slapped the commandos shoulder down he forced himself to walk to the nearest shuttle a run on the shuttles being just the scenario he had poured out blood and bone and pride these lastthree fourweeks to avoid a quartet of fullyarmed and halfarmored troops were the first down the shuttle ramp taking up guard positions good they even had their weapons pointed in the right direction toward the prisoners they were here to rescue a larger patrol fully armored followed to gallop off double time leapfrogging their own coveringfire range into the dark toward the cetagandan installations surrounding the dome circle hard to judge which direction held the most danger from the continuing fireworks his fighter shuttles were providing plenty of external distraction for the cetagandans at last came the man miles most wanted to see the shuttles comm officer lieutenant uh he connected face and name murka over here murka spotted him he fumbled excitedly with his equipment and called into his audio pickup commodore tung hes here i got him miles peeled the comm set ruthlessly from the lieutenants head who obligingly ducked down to permit the theft and jammed it on his own head lefthanded in time to hear tungs voice reply tinnily well for gods sake dont lose him again murka sit on him if you have to i want my staff called miles into the pickup have you retrieved elli and elena yet how much time have we got for this yes sir no and about two hoursif were lucky tungs voice snapped back good to have you back aboard admiral naismith youre telling me get elena and elli priority one working tung out miles turned to find that the rat bar group leader in this section had actually succeeded in marshalling his first group of and was engaged in making the second sit back down in a block to wait their turns excellent the prisoners were being channeled up the ramp one at a time through a strange gauntlet a mercenary slit the back of each grey tunic with a swift slice from a vibraknife a second mercenary slapped each prisoner across the back with a medical stunner a third made a pass with a surgical handtractor roughly ripping out the cetagandan serial numbers encoded beneath the skin he didnt bother to waste time on bandaging after go to the front and sit five across go to the front and sit five across go to the front he chanted droning in time to his hypnotically moving device miless sometimeadjutant captain thorne appeared hurrying out of the glare and black shadows flanked by one of the fleets ships surgeons andpraise bea soldier carrying some of miless clothes and boots miles dove for the boots but was captured instead by the surgeon she ran a med stunner between his bare uneven shoulderblades and zipped a handtractor across in its path ow miles yelped couldnt you wait one bleeding second for the stun to cut in the pain faded rapidly to numbness as miless left hand patted for the damage whats this all about sorry sir said the surgeon insincerely stop that your fingers are dirty she applied a plastic bandage rank hath its privileges captain botharijesek and commander quinn learned something from their fellow cetagandan prison monitors that we hadnt known before you went in these encodes are permeated with drug beads whose lipid membranes are kept aligned by a lowpower magnetic field the cetagandans were generating in the dome an hour out of the dome and the membranes start to break down releasing a poison about four hours later the subject diesvery unpleasantly a little insurance against escapes i guess miles shuddered and said faintly i see he cleared his throat and added more loudly captain thorne mark a commendation with highest honorsto commander elli quinn and captain elena botharijesek the ah our employers intelligence service didnt even have that one in fact our employers intelligence data lacked on a truly vast number of points i shall have to speak to them sharplywhen i present the bill for this expanded operation before you put that away doctor numb my hand please miles stuck out his right hand for the surgeons inspection did it again did you muttered the surgeon id think youd learn a pass with the medical stunner and miless swollen hand disappeared from his senses entirely nothing left from the wrist down only his eyes assured him it was still attached to his arm yes but will they pay for the expanded operation asked captain thorne anxiously this started out as a oneshot lightning strike to hook out one guy just the sort of thing little outfits like us specialize innow its straining the whole dendarii fleet these damn prisoners outnumber us two to one this wasnt in the original contract what if our perennial mystery employer decides to stiff us they wont said miles my word buttheres no doubt ill have to deliver the bill in person god help them then muttered the surgeon and took herself off to continue pulling encodes from the waiting prisoners commodore ky tung a squat middleaged eurasian in halfarmor and a command channel headset turned up at miless elbow as the first shuttles loaded with prisoners clapped their locks shut and screamed up into the black fog they took off in firstcome firstserved positions no waiting knowing tungs passion for tight formations miles judged time must be their most dangerous limiting factor what are we loading these guys onto upstairs miles asked tung we gutted a couple of used freighters we can cram about in the holds of each the ride out is going to be fast and nasty theyll all have to lie down and breathe as little as possible what are the cetagandans scrambling to catch us right now barely more than some police shuttles most of their local space military contingent just happens to be on the other side of their sun just now which is why we just happened to pick this moment to drop by we had to wait for their practice maneuvers again in case you were starting to wonder what was keeping us in other words the same scenario as our original plan to pull colonel tremont except expanded by a factor of and weve got to get in what four lifts instead of one said miles yeah but get this grinned tung they sited these prison camps on this miserable outpost planet sos they wouldnt have to expend troops and equipment guarding themcounted on distance from marilac and the downgearing of the war there to discourage rescue attempts but in the period since you went in half of their original guard complement has been pulled to other hot spots half they were relying on the dome miles eyed him and for the bad news he murmured tungs smile soured this round our total time window is only two hours ouch half their local space fleet is still too many and theyll be back in two hours one hour forty minutes now a sidewise flick of tungs eyes betrayed the location of his ops clock holovidprojected by his command headset into the air at a corner of his vision miles did a calculation in his head and lowered his voice are we going to be able to lift the last load depends on how fast we can lift the first three said tung his ordinarily stoic face was more unreadable than ever betraying neither hope nor fear which depends in turn on how effectively i managed to drill them all what was done was done what was coming was not yet miles wrenched his attention to the immediate now have you found elli and elena yet i have three patrols out searching he hadnt found them yet miless guts tightened i wouldnt have even attempted to expand this operation in midstream if i hadnt known they were monitoring me and could translate all those oblique hints back into orders did they get em all right asked tung we argued over some of their interpretations of your doubletalk on the vids miles glanced around they got em right you got vids of all this a startled wave of miless hand took in the circle of the camp of you anyway right off the cetagandan monitors they bursttransmitted them all daily veryerentertaining sir tung added blandly some people would find entertainment in watching someone swallow slugs miles reflected very dangerous when was your last communication with them yesterday tungs hand clamped on miless arm restraining an involuntary leap you cant do better than my three patrols sir and i havent any to spare to go looking for you yah yah miles slapped his right fist into his left palm in frustration before remembering that was a bad idea his two coagents his vital link between the dome and the dendarii missing the cetagandans shot spies with depressing consistency after usually a series of interrogations that rendered death a welcome release he tried to reassure himself with logic if theyd blown their covers as cetagandan monitor techs and been interrogated tung would have run into a meat grinder here he hadnt ergo they hadnt of course they might have been killed by friendly fire just now friends he had too many friends to stay sane in this crazy business you miles retrieved his clothes from the stillwaiting soldier go over there he pointed and find a redhaired lady named beatrice and an injured man named suegar bring them to me carry him carefully he has internal injuries the soldier saluted and marched off ah the pleasure again of being able to give a command without having to follow it up with a supporting theological argument miles sighed exhaustion waited to swallow him lurking at the edge of his adrenalinspurred bubble of hyperconsciousness all the factorsshuttles timing the approaching enemy distance to the getaway jump point formed and reformed in all their possible permutations in his mind small variations in timing in particular multiplied into major troubles but hed known it would be like this back when hed started a miracle theyd got this far nohe glanced at tung at thornenot a miracle but the extraordinary initiative and devotion of his people well done oh well done thorne helped him as he fumbled to dress himself onehanded where the hell is my command headset miles asked we were told you were injured sir and in a state of exhaustion you were scheduled for immediate evacuation damn presumptuous of somebody miles bit back ire no place in this schedule for running errands topside besides if he had his headset hed be tempted to start giving orders and he wasnt yet sufficiently briefed on the internal complexities of the operation from the dendarii fleets point of view miles swallowed his observer status without further comment it did free him for rear guard miless batman reappeared with beatrice and four drafted prisoners carrying suegar on his mat to lay at miless feet get my surgeon miles said his soldier obediently trotted off and found her she knelt beside the semiconscious suegar and pulled the encode from his back a knot of tension unwound in miless neck at the reassuring hiss of a hypospray of synergine how bad miles demanded not good the surgeon admitted checking her diagnostic viewer burst spleen oozing hemorrhage in the stomachthis one had better go direct to surgery on the command ship medtech she motioned to a dendarii waiting with the guards for the return of the shuttle and gave triage instructions the medtech swathed suegar in a thin foil heat wrap ill make sure he gets there promised miles he shivered envying the heat wrap a little as the drizzly acid fog beaded in his hair and coiled into his bones tungs expression and attention were abruptly absorbed by a message from his comm set miles who had yielded lieutenant murkas headset back to him so that he might continue his duties shifted from foot to foot in agony for news elena elli if ive killed you tung spoke into his pickup good well done report to the a drop site a jerk of his chin switched channels sim nout fall back with your patrols to your shuttle drop site perimeters theyve been found miles found himself bent over with his hand supported on gelid knees waiting for his head to clear his heart lurching in huge slow gulps elli and elena are they all right they didnt call for a medtech you sure you dont need one yourself youre green im all right miless heart steadied and he straightened up to meet beatrices questing eyes beatrice would you please go get tris and oliver for me i need to talk to them before the next shuttle relay goes up she shook her head helplessly and wheeled away she did not salute on the other hand she didnt argue either miles was insensibly cheered the booming racket around the dome circle had died down to the occasional whine of smallarms fire human cry or blurred amplified voice fires burned in the distance redorange glows in the muffling fog not a surgically clean operation the cetagandans were going to be extremely pissed when theyd counted their casualties miles judged time to be gone and long gone he tried to keep the poisoned encodes in mind as anodyne to the vision of cetagandan clerks and techs crushed in the rubble of their burning buildings but the two nightmares seemed to amplify instead of cancelling each other out here came tris and oliver both looking a little wildeyed beatrice took up station at triss right shoulder congratulations miles began before they could speak he had a lot of ground to cover and not much time left you have achieved an army a wave of his arm swept the orderly array of prisonersexprisonersspread across the camp in their shuttle groups they waited quietly most seated on the ground or was it the cetagandans who had ingrained such patience in them whatever temporarily said tris this is the lull i believe if things hot up if you lose one or more shuttles if somebody panics and it spreads you can tell anybody whos inclined to panic they can ride up with me if itll make them feel better ahbetter also mention that im going up in the last load said miles tung dividing his attention between this confab and his headset grimaced in exasperation at this news thatll settle em grinned oliver give them something to think about anyway conceded tris now im going to give you something to think about the new marilac resistance youre it said miles my employer originally engaged me to rescue colonel tremont that he might raise a new army and carry on the fight when i found him as he was dying i had to decide whether to follow the letter of my contract and deliver a catatonic or a corpse or the spiritand deliver an army i chose this and i chose you two you must carry on colonel tremonts work i was only a field lieutenant began tris in horror in chorus with olivers im a grunt not a staff officer colonel tremont was a genius you are his heirs now i say so look around you do i make mistakes in choosing my subordinates after a moments silence tris muttered apparently not build yourselves a staff find your tactics geniuses your technical wizards and put em to work for you but the drive and the decisions and the direction must be yours forged in this pit it is you two who will remember this place and so remember what it is you are doing and why always oliver spoke quietly and when do we muster out of this army brother miles my time was up during the siege of fallow core if id been anywhere else i could have gone home until the cetagandan army of occupation rolled down your street even then the odds arent good the odds were worse for barrayar in its day and they ran the cetagandans right off it took twenty years and more blood than either of you have seen in your lives combined but they did it asserted miles oliver seemed more struck by this historical precedent than tris who said skeptically barrayar had those crazy vor warriors nuts who rushed into battle who liked to die marilac just doesnt have that sort of cultural tradition were civilizedor we were once let me tell you about the barrayaran vor cut in miles the loonies who sought a glorious death in battle found it very early on this rapidly cleared the chain of command of the accumulated fools the survivors were those who learned to fight dirty and live and fight another day and win and win and win and for whom nothing not comfort or security not family or friends or their immortal souls was more important than winning dead men are losers by definition survival and victory they werent supermen or immune to pain they sweated in confusion and darkness and with not onehalf the physical resources marilac possessed even now they won when youre vor miles ran down a little there is no mustering out after a silence tris said even a volunteer patriotic army must eat and we wont beat the cetagandans by firing spitballs at them there will be financial and military aid forthcoming through a covert channel other than myself if there is a resistance command to deliver it to tris measured oliver by eye the fire in her burned closer to the surface than miles had ever seen it coursing down those corded muscles the whine of the first returning shuttles pierced the fog she spoke quite softly and here i thought i was the atheist sergeant and you were the believer are you coming with meor mustering out olivers shoulders bowed with the weight of history miles realized not defeat for the heat in his eyes matched triss coming he grunted miles caught tungs eyes how we doing tung shook his head held up fingers about six minutes slow unloading upstairs right miles turned back to tris and oliver i want you both to go up on this wave in separate shuttles one to each troopship when you get there start expediting the offloading of your people lieutenant murka will give you your shuttle assignment he motioned murka over and packed them off beatrice lingered im inclined to panic she informed miles in a distant tone her bare toe smudged whorls in the dampening dirt i dont need a bodyguard anymore miles said he grinned a keeper maybe a smile lighted her eyes that did not yet reach her mouth later miles promised himself later he would make that mouth laugh the second wave of shuttles began to lift even as the remnants of the returning first wave were still landing miles prayed everyones sensors were operating properly passing each other in this fog their timing could only get more ragged from now on the fog itself was coagulating into a cold rain silver needles pelting down the focus of the operation was narrowing rapidly now more of machines and numbers and timing less of loyalties and souls and fearsome obligations an emotionally pathological mind devoid of love and fear might even call it fun miles thought he began jotting scores lefthanded in the dirt numbers up down in transit remaining but the dirt was turning to gluey black mud and did not retain the impressions shit tung hissed suddenly through clenched teeth the air before his face blurred in a flurry of vidprojected incoming information his eyes flicking through it with practiced rapidity his right hand bunched and twitched as if tempted to wrench off his headset and stamp it into the mud in frustration and disgust that tears it we just lost two shuttles out of the second wave which two miless mind screamed oliver tris he forced his first question to be how i swear if they crashed into each other im going to go find a wall and beat my head on it till i go numb cetagandan fighter broke through our cordon he was going for the troop freighters but we nailed him in time almost in time you got identifications on which two shuttles and were they loaded or returning tungs lips moved in subvocalization a fully loaded b returning empty loss total no survivors fighter shuttle from the triumph is disabled by enemy fire pilot recovery now in progress he hadnt lost his commanders his handpicked and carefully nurtured successors to colonel tremont were safe he opened his eyes squeezed shut in pain to find beatrice to whom the shuttle ids meant nothing waiting anxiously for interpretation two hundred dead she whispered two hundred six miles corrected the faces names voices of the six familiar dendarii fluttered through his memory the ciphers must have had faces too he blocked them out as too crushing an overload these things happen beatrice muttered numbly you all right of course im all right these things happen inevitable i am not a weepy wimp who folds under fire she blinked rapidly lifting her chin give me something to do anything quickly miles added for her right he pointed across the camp got to pel and liant divide their remaining shuttle groups into blocks of thirtythree and add them to each of the remaining thirdwave shuttle groups well have to send the third wave up overloaded then report back to me go quick the rest will be back in minutes yessir she saluted for her sake not his for order structure rationality a lifeline he returned the salute gravely they were already overloaded objected tung as soon as she was out of earshot theyre going to fly like bricks with squeezed on board and theyll take longer to load on here and unload topside yes god miles gave up scratching figures in the useless mud run the numbers through the computer for me ky i dont trust myself to add two and two just now how far behind will we be by the time the main body of the cetagandans comes in range come close as you can no fudge factors please tung mumbled into his headset reeled off numbers margins timing miles tracked every detail with predatory intensity tung concluded bluntly at the end of the last wave five shuttles are still going to be waiting to unload when the cetagandan fire fries us a thousand men and women may i respectfully suggest sir that the time has come to start cutting our losses added tung you may commodore option one maximally efficient only drop seven shuttles in the last wave leave the last five shuttle loads of prisoners on the ground theyll be retaken but at least theyll be alive tungs voice grew persuasive on this last line only one problem ky i dont want to stay here you can still be on the last shuttle up just like you said by the way sir have i expressed myself yet sir on what a genuinely dumbshit piece of grandstanding that is eloquently with your eyebrows a while ago and while im inclined to agree with you have you noticed yet how closely the remaining prisoners keep watching me have you ever watched a cat sneaking up on a horned hopper tung stirred uneasily eyes taking in the phenomenon miles described i dont fancy gunning down the last thousand in order to get my shuttle into the air skewed as we are they might not realize there were no more shuttles coming till after you were in the air so we just leave them standing there waiting for us the sheep look up but are not fed right you like that option ky makes me want to puke butconsider the others and the dendarii fleet the idea of dropping them all down the rat hole in a predoomed effort to pack up all thesemiserable sinners of yours makes me want to puke a lot more ninetenths of a loaf is much better than none point taken let us go on to option two please the flight out of orbit is calculated on the speed of the slowest ship which is the freighters and the triumph remains the swiftest betcher ass tung had captained the triumph once and the best armored ya so tung saw perfectly well where he was being driven his obtuseness was but a form of oblique balking so the first seven shuttles up on the last wave lock onto the troop freighters and boost on schedule we call back five of the triumph s fighter pilots and dump and destroy their craft ones damaged already right the last five of these drop shuttles clamp to the triumph in their place protected from the nowarriving fire of the cetagandan ships by the triumphs full shielding pack the prisoners into the triumphs corridors lock shuttle hatches boost like hell the added mass of a thousand people would be less than that of a couple of the drop shuttles dump and blow them too if you have to to fit the massacceleration window would overload life support the emergency oxygen will take us to the wormhole jump point after jump the prisoners can be distributed among the other ships at our leisure tungs voice grew anguished those combat drop shuttles are brand new and my fightersfive of themdo you realize how hard it will be to recoup the funds to replace em it comes to i asked you to calculate the time ky not the price tag said miles through his teeth he added more quietly ill tack them on to our bill for services rendered you ever hear the term cost overrun boy you will tung switched his attention back to his headset itself but an extension of the tactics room aboard the triumph calculations were made new orders entered and executed it flies sighed tung buys a damned expensive fifteen minutes if nothing else goes wrong he trailed off in a frustrated mumble as impatient as miles himself with his inability to be three places at once there comes my shuttle back tung noted aloud he glanced at miles plainly unwilling to leave his admiral to his own devices as plainly itching to be out of the acid rain and dark and mud and closer to the nerve center of operations get gone said miles you cant ride up with me anyway its against procedure procedure hah said tung blackly with the liftoff of the third wave there were barely prisoners left on the ground things were thinning out winding down the armored combat patrols were falling back now from their penetration of the surrounding cetagandan installations back toward their assigned shuttle landing sites a dangerous turning of the tide should some surviving cetagandan officer recover enough organization to harry their retreat see you aboard the triumph tung emphasized he paused to brace lieutenant murka out of miless earshot miles grinned in sympathy for the overworked lieutenant in no doubt about the orders tung was now laying on him if murka didnt come back with miles in tow hed probably be wisest not to come back at all nothing left now but a little last waiting hurry up and wait waiting miles realized was very bad for him it allowed his selfgenerated adrenalin to wear off allowed him to feel how tired and hurt he really was the illuminating flares were dying to a red glow there was really very little time between the fading of the labored thunder of the last third wave shuttle to depart and the screaming whine of the first fourthwave shuttle plunging back alas that this had more to do with being skewed than being swift the marilacans still waited in their rat bar blocks discipline still holding of course nobodyd told them about the little problem in timing they faced but the nervous dendarii patrols chivvying them up the ramps kept things moving at a pace to miless taste rear guard was never a popular position to draw even among the lunatic fringe who defaced their weapons with notches and giggled among themselves while speculating upon newer and more grotesque methods of blowing away their enemies miles saw the semiconscious suegar carried up the ramp first suegar would actually reach the triumphs sickbay faster in his company miles calculated on this direct flight than had he been sent on an earlier shuttle to one of the troop freighters and had to await a safe moment to transfer the arena they were leaving had grown silent and dark sodden and sad ghostly will break the doors of hell and bring up the dead there was something not quite right about the halfremembered quote no matter this shuttles armored patrol the last drew back out of the fog and darkness electronically whistled in like a pack of sheepdogs by their master murka who stood at the foot of the ramp as liaison between the ground patrol and the shuttle pilot who was expressing her anxiety to be gone with little whining revs on the engines then from the darknessplasma fire sizzling through the rainsodden saturated air some cetagandan heroofficer troop tech who knewhad crawled up out of the rubble and found a weapon and an enemy to fire it at splintered afterimages red and green danced in miless eyes a dendarii patroller rolled out of the dark a glowing line across the back of his armor smoking and sparking until quenched in the black mud his armor legs seized up and he lay wriggling like a frantic fish in an effort to peel out of it a second plasma burst illaimed spent itself turning a few kilometers of fog and rain to superheated steam on a straight line to some unknown infinity just what they needed to be pinned down by sniper fire now a pair of dendarii rear guards started back into the fog an excited prisonerye gods it was pitts lieutenant againgrabbed up the armorparalyzed soldiers weapon and made to join them no come back later and fight on your own time you jerk miles sloshed toward murka fall back load up get in the air dont stop to fight no time some of the last of the prisoners had fallen flat to the ground burrowing like mudpuppies a sound sensible reflex in any other context miles dashed among them slapping rumps get aboard up the ramp go go go beatrice popped up out of the mud and mimicked him shakily driving her fellows before her miles skidded to a stop beside his fallen dendarii and snapped the armor clamps open lefthanded the soldier kicked off his fatal carapace rolled to his feet and limped for the safety of the shuttle miles ran close behind him murka and one patrolman waited at the foot of the ramp get ready to pull in the ramp and lift on my mark murka began to the shuttle pilot r his words were lost in an explosive pop as the plasma beam sliced across his neck miles could feel the searing heat from it pass centimeters above his head as he stood next to his lieutenant murkas body crumpled miles dodged paused to yank off murkas comm headset the head came too miles had to brace it with his numb hand to pull the headset free the weight of the head its density and roundness hammered into his senses the precise memory of it would surely be with him until his dying day he let it fall by murkas body he staggered up the ramp a last armored dendarii pulling on his arm he could feel the ramp sag peculiarly under their feet glanced down to see a halfmelted seam across it where the plasma arc that had killed murka had passed on he fell through the hatchway clutching the headset and yelling into it lift lift mark now go who is this came the shuttle pilots voice back naismith yes sir the shuttle heaved off the ground engines roaring even before the ramp had withdrawn the ramp mechanism labored metal and plastic complainingthen jammed on the twisted distortion of the melt get that hatch sealed back there the shuttle pilots voice yowled over the headset ramps jammed miles yowled back jettison it the ramp mechanism skreeled and shrieked reversing itself the ramp shuddered jammed again hands reached out to thump on it urgently youll never get it that way beatrice across the hatch from miles yelled fiercely and twisted around to kick at it with her bare feet the wind of their flight screamed over the open hatchway buffeting and vibrating the shuttle like a giant blowing across the top of a bottle to a chorus of shouting thumping and swearing the shuttle lurched abruptly onto its side men women and loose equipment tangled across the tilting deck beatrice kicked bloodily at a final buggered bolt the ramp tore loose at last beatrice sliding fell with it miles dove at her lunging across the hatchway if he connected he never knew for his right hand was a senseless blob he saw her face only as a white blur as she whipped away into the blackness it was like a silence a great silence in his head although the roar of wind and engines screaming and swearing and yelling went on as before it was lost somewhere between his ears and his brain and went unregistered he saw only a white blur smearing into the darkness repeated again and again replaying like a looping vid he found himself crouched on his hands and knees the shuttles acceleration sucking him to the deck theyd gotten the hatch closed the merely human babble within seemed muffled and thin now that the roaring voices of the gods were silenced he looked up into the pale face of pitts lieutenant crouched beside him still clutching the unfired dendarii weapon hed grabbed up in that other lifetime youd better kill a whole lot of cetagandans for marilac boy miles rasped to him at last you better be worth something to somebody cause ive sure paid too much for you the marilacans face twitched uncertainly too cowed even to try to look apologetic miles wondered what his own face must look like from the reflection in that mirror strange very strange miles began to crawl forward looking for something somebody formless flashes made yellow streaks in the corners of his vision an armored dendarii her helmet off pulled him to his feet sir hadnt you better come forward to the pilots compartment sir yes all right she got an arm around him under his arm so he didnt fall down again they picked their way forward in the crowded shuttle through marilacans and dendarii mixed faces were drawn to him marked him fearfully but none dared an expression of any kind miless eye was caught by a silver cocoon as they neared the forward end wait he fell to his knees beside suegar a hit of hope suegar hey suegar suegar opened his eyes to slits no telling how much of this he was taking in through the pain and the shock and the drugs youre on your way now we made it made the timing with all ease with agility and speed up through the regions of the air higher than the clouds you had the scripture right you did suegars lips moved miles bent his head closer wasnt really a scripture suegar whispered i knew it you knew it dont shit me miles paused coldstoned then he leaned forward again no brother he whispered for though we went in clothed we have surely come out naked suegars lips puffed on a dry laugh miles didnt weep until after theyd made the wormhole jump illyan sat silent miles lay back pale and exhausted a stupid trembling concealed in his belly making his voice shake sorry thought id got over it so much craziness has happened since then no time to think digest combat fatigue illyan suggested the combat only lasted a couple of hours ah id reckon it at six weeks by that account whatever but if your count vorvolk wants to argue that i should have traded lives for equipment well i had maybe five minutes to make a decision under enemy fire if id had a month to study it id have come to the same conclusion and ill stand behind it now in a court martial or any goddamn arena he wants to fight me in calm down illyan advised i will deal with vorvolk and his shadowadvisors i think no i guarantee their little plot will not intrude further on your recovery lieutenant vorkosigan his eyes glinted illyan had served thirty years in imperial security miles reminded himself aral vorkosigans dog still had teeth im sorry my carelessness shook your confidence in me sir said miles it was an odd wound that doubt had dealt him miles could feel it still an invisible ache in his chest slow to heal so trust was more of a feedback loop than he had ever realized was illyan right should he pay more attention to appearances ill try to be more intelligent in future illyan gave him an indecipherable look his mouth set neck oddly flushed so shall i lieutenant the swish of the door the sweep of skirts countess vorkosigan was a tall woman hair gone redroan with a stride that had never quite accommodated itself to barrayaran female fashions she wore the long rich skirts of a vorclass matron as cheerfully as a child playing dressup and about as convincingly mlady illyan nodded rising hello simon goodbye simon she grinned back that doctor you spooked begs me to use my superior firepower to throw you out i know you officers and gentlemen have business but its time to wrap it up or so the medical monitors indicate she glanced at miles a frown flickered across her easygoing features a hint of steel illyan caught it too and bowed were quite finished mlady no problem so i trust chin lifted she watched him out miles studying that steady profile realized with a sudden lurch just why the death of a certain tall aggressive redhead might still be wringing his gut long after his reconciliation to other casualties for which he was surely no less responsible ha how late we come to our insights and how uselessly still a tightness eased in his throat as countess vorkosigan turned back to him you look like a defrosted corpse love her lips brushed his forehead warmly thank you mother miles chirped that nice commander quinn who brought you in says you havent been eating properly as usual ah miles brightened where is quinn can i see her not here she is excluded from classified areas to wit this imperial military hospital on the grounds of her being foreign military personnel barrayarans that was captain cordelia naismiths betan astronomical survey retired favorite swear word delivered with a multitude of inflections as the occasion demanded this time with exasperation i took her to vorkosigan house to wait thank you i owe a lot to quinn so i gather she smiled at him you can be at the long lake three hours after you delude that doctor into releasing you from this
