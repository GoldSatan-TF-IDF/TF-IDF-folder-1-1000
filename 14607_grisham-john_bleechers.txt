john grisham bleachers the road to rake field ran beside the school past the old band hall and the tennis courts through a tunnel of two perfect rows of red and yellow maples planted and paid for by the boosters then over a small hill to a lower area covered with enough asphalt for a thousand cars the road stopped in front of an immense gate of brick and wrought iron that announced the presence of rakefield and beyond the gate was a chainlink fence that encircled the hallowed ground on friday nights the entire town of messina waited for the gate to open then rushed to the bleachers where seats were claimed and nervous pregame rituals were followed the black paved pasture around rake field would overflow long before the opening kickoff sending the outoftown traffic into the dirt roads and alleys and remote parking zones behind the schools cafeteria and its baseball field opposing fans had a rough time in messina but not nearly as rough as the opposing teams driving slowly along the road to rake field was neely crenshaw slowly because he had not been back in many years slowly because when he saw the lights of the field the memories came roaring back as he knew they would he rolled through the red and yellow maples bright in their autumn foliage their trunks had been a foot thick inneelys glory days and now their branches touched above him and their leaves dropped like snow and covered the road to rake field it was late in the afternoon in october and a soft wind from the north chilled the air he stopped his car near the gate and stared at the field all movements were slow now all thoughts weighted heavily with sounds and images of another life when he played the field had no name none was needed every person in messina knew it simply as the field the boys are on the field early this morning they would say at the cafes downtown what time are we cleaning up the field they would ask at the rotary club rake says we need new visitors bleachers at the field they would say at the boosters meeting rakes got em on the field late tonight they would say at the beer joints north of town no piece of ground in messina was more revered than the field not even the cemetery after rake left they named it after him neely was gone by then of course long gone with no plans to return why he was returning now wasnt completely clear but deep in his soul hed always known this day would come the day somewhere out there in the future when he was called back hed always known that rake would eventually die and of course there would be a funeral with hundreds of former players packed around the casket all wearing their spartan green all mourning the loss of a legend they loved and hated but hed told himself many times that he would never return to the field as long as rake was alive in the distance behind the visitors stands were the two practice fields one with lights no other school in the state had such a luxury but then no other town worshiped its football as thoroughly and collectively as messina neely could hear a coachs whistle and the thump and grunts of bodies hitting each other as the latest spartan team got ready for friday night he walked through the gate and across the track painted dark green of course the end zone grass was manicured and suitable for putting but there were a few wild sprigs inching up the goalpost and there was a patch or two of weeds in one corner and now that hed noticedneely looked even closer and saw untrimmed growth along the edge of the track in the glory days dozens of volunteers gathered every thursday afternoon and combed the field with gardening shears snipping out every wayward blade of grass the glory days were gone they left with rake now messina football was played by mortals and the town had lost its swagger coach rake had once cursed loudly at a welldressed gentleman who committed the sin of stepping onto the sacred bermuda grass of the field the gentleman backtracked quicklythen walked around the sideline and when he drew closer rake realized he had just cursed the mayor of messina the mayor was offended rake didnt care no one walked on his fieldthe mayor unaccustomed to being cursed set in motion an illfated effort to fire rake who shrugged it off the locals defeated the mayor four to one as soon as his name appeared on the next ballot in those days eddie rake had more political clout in messina than all the politicians combined and he thought nothing of it neely stuck to the sideline and slowly made his way toward the home stands then he stopped cold and took a deep breath as the pregame jitters hit him hard the roar of a longago crowd came back a crowd packed tightly together up there in the bleachers with the band in the center of things blaring away with its endless renditions of the spartan fight song and on the sideline just a few feet away he could see number nervously warming up as the mob worshiped him number was a high school ailamerican a highly recruited quarterback with a golden arm fast feet plenty of size maybe the greatest messina ever produced number was neely crenshaw in another life he walked a few steps along the sideline stopped at the fifty where rake had coached hundreds of games and looked again at the silent bleachers where ten thousand people once gathered on friday nights to pour their emotions upon a high school football team the crowds were half that now hed heard fifteen years had passed since number had thrilled so many fifteen years sinceneely had played on the sacred turf how many times had he promised himself he would never do what he was now doing how many times had he sworn he would never come back on a practice field in the distance a coach blew a whistle and someone was yelling butneely barely heard it instead he was hearing the drum corps of the band and the raspy unforgettable voice of mr bo michael on the public address and the deafening sound of the bleachers rattling as the fans jumped up and down and he heard rake bark and growl though his coach seldom lost his cool in the heat of battle the cheerleaders were over therebouncing chanting short skirts tights tanned and firm legsneely had his pick back then his parents sat on the forty eight rows down from the press box he waved at his mother before every kickoff she spent most of the game inprayer certain he would break his neck the college recruiters got passes to a row of chairbacked seats on the fifty prime seating someone counted thirtyeight scouts for the garnet central game all there to watch number over a hundred colleges wrote letters his father still kept them thirtyone offered full scholarships whenneely signed with tech there was a press conference and headlines ten thousand seats up in the bleachers for a town with a population of eight thousand the math had never worked but they piled in from the county from out in the sticks where there was nothing else to do on friday night they got their paychecks and bought their beer and they came to town to the field where they clustered in one raucous pack at the north end of the stands and made more noise than the students the band and the townsfolk combined when he was a boy his father had kept him away from the north end those county people down there were drinking and sometimes fighting and they yelled foul language at the officials a few years later number adored the racket made by those county people and they certainly adored him the bleachers were silent now waiting he moved slowly down the sideline hands stuck deep in his pockets a forgotten hero whose star had faded so quicklythe messina quarterback for three seasonsover a hundred touchdowns hed never lost on this field the games came back to him though he tried to block them out those days were gone he told himself for the hundredth time long gone in the south end zone the boosters had erected a giant scoreboard and mounted around it on large white placards with bold green lettering was the history of messina footballand thus the history of the townundefeated seasons in and when rake was not yet thirty years old then in the streak began with perfect seasons for the rest of that decade and into the next a month afterneely was born in messina lost to south wayne in the state championship and the streak was over eightyfour wins in a row a national record at that time and eddie rake was a legend at the age of thirtynine neelys father had told him of the unspeakable gloom that engulfed the town in the days after that loss as if eightyfour straight victories were not enough it was a miserable winter but messina endured next season rakes boys went and slaughteredsouth wayne for the state title other state championships followed in and then the droughtfrom until neelys senior year messina went undefeated each season easily won its conference and playoffs only to lose in the state finals there was discontent in messina the locals in the coffee shops were not happy the oldtimers longed for the days of the streak some school in california won ninety in a row and the entire town of messina was offended to the left of the scoreboard on green placards with white lettering were the tributes to the greatest of all messina heroes seven numbers had been retired withneelys being the last next to itwas number worn by jesse trapp a linebacker who played briefly at miami then went to prison in rake had retired number worn by roman armstead the only messina spartan to play in the nfl beyond the south end zone was a field house that any small college would envy it had a weight room and lockers and a visitors dressing room with carpet and showers it too was built by the boosters after an intense capital campaign that lasted one winter and consumed the entire town no expense was spared not for the messina spartans football team coach rake wanted weights and lockers and coaches offices and the boosters practically forgot about christmas there was something different now somethingneely had not seen before just past the gate that led to the field house there was a monument with a brick base and a bronze bust on itneely walked over to take a look it was rake an oversized rake with wrinkles on the forehead and the familiar scowl around the eyes yet just a hint of a smile he wore the same weathered messina cap hed worn for decadesa bronze eddie rake at fifty not the old man of seventy under it was a plaque with a glowing narrative including the details that almost anyone on the streets of messina could rattle off from memorythirtyfour years as coach of the spartans wins losses state titles and from to an undefeated streak that ended at it was an altar andneely could see the spartans bowing before it as they made their way onto the field each friday night the wind picked up and scattered leaves in front ofneely practice was over and the soiled and sweaty players were trudging toward the field house he didnt want to be seen so he walked down the track and through a gate he climbed up thirty rows and sat all alone in the bleachers high above rake field with a view of the valley to the east church steeples rose above the gold and scarlet trees of messina in the distance the steeple on the far left belonged to the methodist church and a block behind it unseen from the bleachers was a handsome twostory home the town had given to eddie rake on his fiftieth birthday and in that home miss lila and her three daughters and all the rest of the rakes were now gathered waiting for the coach to take his last breath no doubt the house was full offriends too with trays of food covering the tables and flowers stacked everywhere were any former players thereneely thought not the next car into the parking lot stopped nearneelys this spartan wore a coat and tie and as he walked casually across the track he too avoided stepping onto the playing surface he spottedneely and climbed the bleachers how long you been here he asked as they shook hands not long neely said is he dead no not yet paul curry caught fortyseven of the sixtythree touchdown passesneely threw in their threeyear career togethercrenshaw to curry time and time again practically unstoppable they had been cocaptains they were close friends whod drifted apart over the years they still called each other three or four times a year pauls grandfather built the first messina bank so his future had been sealed at birth then he married a local girl from another prominent family neelywas the best man and the wedding had been his last trip back to messina hows the familyneely asked finemonas pregnant of course shes pregnantfive or six only four neely shook his head they were sitting three feet apart both gazing into the distance chatting but preoccupied there was noise from the field house as cars and trucks began leaving hows the teamneely asked not bad won four lost two the coach is a young guy from missouri i like him talents thin missouri yeah nobody within a thousand miles would take the job neely glanced at him and said youve put on some weight im a banker and a rotarian but i can still outrun you paul stopped quickly sorry that hed blurted out the last phrase neelys left knee was twice the size of his right im sure you can neely said with a smile no harm done they watched the last of the cars and trucks speed away most of them squealing tires or at least trying toa lesser spartan tradition then things were quiet again do you ever come here when the place is emptyneely asked i used to and walk around the field and remember what it was like back then i did until i gave it uphappens to all of us this is the first time ive come back here since they retired my number and you havent given it up youre still living back then still dreaming still the ailamerican quarterback i wish id never seen a football you had no choice in this town rake had us in uniforms when we were in the sixth grade four teamsred blue gold and black remember no green because every kid wanted to wear green we played tuesday nights and drew more fans than most high schools we learned the same plays rake was calling on friday nightthe same system we dreamed of being spartans and playing before ten thousand fanatics by the ninth grade rake himself was supervising our practices and we knew all forty plays in his bookknew them in our sleep i still know them neely said sodo i remember the time he made us run slotwaggleright for two solid hours in practice yeah because you kept screwin up then we ran bleachers until we puked that was rake neely mumbled you count the years until you get a varsity jersey then youre a hero an idol a cocky bastard because in this town you can do no wrong you win and win and youre the king of your own little world then poof its gone you play your last game and everybody cries you cant believe its over then another team comes right behind you and youre forgotten it was so long ago fifteen years pal when i was in college i would come home for the holidays and stay away from this place i wouldnt even drive by the school never saw rake didnt want to then one night in the summertime right before i went back to college just a month or so before they fired him i bought a sixpack and climbed up here and replayed all the gamesstayed for hours i could see us out there scoring at will kicking ass every game it was wonderful then it hurt like hell because it was over our glory days gone in a flash did you hate rake that night no i loved him then it changed every day for most of us does it hurt now not anymore after i got married we bought season tickets joined the booster club the usual stuff that everybody else does over time i forgot about being a hero and became just another fan you come to all the games paul pointed down to the left sure the bank owns a whole block of seats you need a whole block with your family mona is very fertile evidentlyhow does she look she looks pregnant i mean you know is she in shape other words is she fat thats it no she exercises two hours a day and eats only lettuce she looks great and shell want you over for dinner tonight for lettuce for whatever you want can i call her no not yetlets just talk there was no talk for a long time they watched a pickup truck roll to a stop near the gate the driver was a heavyset man with faded jeans a denim cap a thick beard and a limp he walked around the end zone and down the track and as he stepped up to the bleachers he noticedneely and curry sitting higher watching every move he made he nodded at them climbed a few rows then sat and gazed at the field very still and very alone thats orley short paul said finally putting a name with a facelate seventies i remember him neely saidslowest linebacker in history and the meanestallconference i think played one year at a juco then quit to cut timber for the rest of his life rake loved the loggers didnt he didnt we all four loggers on defense and a conference titlewas automatic another pickup stopped near the first another hefty gentleman in overalls and denim lumbered his way to the bleachers where he greeted orley short and sat beside him their meeting did not appear to be planned cant place him paul said struggling to identify the second man and frustrated that he could not in three and a half decades rake had coached hundreds of boys from messina and the county most of them had never left rakes players knew each other they were members of a small fraternity whose membership was forever closed you should get back more often paul said when it was time to talk again why folks would like to see you maybe i dont want to see them why not i dont know you think people here still hold a grudge because you didnt win the heisman no theyll remember you all right but youre history youre still their allamerican but that was a long time ago walk in renfrows cafe and maggie still has that huge photo of you above the cash register i go there for breakfast every thursday and sooner or later two oldtimers will start debatingwho was the greatest messina quarterback neely crenshaw or wally webb webb started for four years won fortysix in a row never lost etc etc but crenshaw played against black kids and the game was faster and tougher crenshaw signed with tech but webb was too small for the bigtime theyll argue forever they still love youneely thanks but ill skip it whatever it was another life come on give it up enjoy the memories i cant rakes back there then why are you here i dont know a telephone buzzed from somewhere deep in pauls nice dark suit he found it and said currya pause im at the field with crenshawa pause yep hes here i swear okay paul slapped the phone shut and tucked it into a pocket that was silo he said i told him you might be coming neely smiled and shook his head at the thought of silo mooney i havent seen him since we graduated he didnt graduate if you recall oh yeahi forgot had that little problem with the policeschedulefour controlled substances his father kicked him out of the house a month before we graduated now i remember he lived in rakes basement for a few weeksthen joined the army whats he doing now well lets say hes in the midst of a very colorful career he left the army with a dishonorable discharge bounced around for a few years offshore on the rigs got tired of honest work and came back to messina where he peddled drugs until he got shot at i assume the bullet missed by an inch and silo tried to go straight i loaned him five thousand dollars to buy the old franklins shoe store and he set himself up as an entrepreneur he cut the prices of his shoes while at the same time doubling hisemployees wages and went broke within a year he sold cemetery lots then used cars then mobile homes i lost track of him for a while one day he walked into the bank and paid back everything he owed in cash said hed finally struck gold in messina yepsomehow he swindled old man joslin out of his junkyard east of town he fixed up a warehouse and in the front half he runs a legitimate body shopa cash cow in the back half he runs a chop shop specializing in stolen pickupsa real cash cow he didnt tell you this no he didnt mention the chop shop but i do his banking and secrets are hard to keep around here hes got some deal with a gang of thieves in the carolinas whereby they ship him stolen trucks he breaks them down and moves the parts its all cash and evidently theres plenty of it the cops not yet but everybody who deals with him is very careful i expect the fbi to walk in any day with a subpoena so im ready sounds just like silo neely said hes a messdrinks heavily lots of women throws cash around everywherelooks ten years older why am i not surprised does he still fight all the timebe careful what you say about rake nobody loves him like silo hell come after you dont worry as the center on offense and the noseguard on defense silo mooney owned the middle of every field he played on he was just under six feet tall with a physique that resembled well a silo everything was thickchest waist legsarms withneely and paul he started for three years unlike the other two silo averaged three personal fouls in every game once he had four one in each quarter twice he got ejected for kicking opposing linemen in the crotch he lived for the sight of blood on the poor boy lined up against him got that sumbitch bleedin now he would growl in the huddle usually late in the first half he wont finish the game go ahead and kill him neely would say egging on a mad dog one less defensive lineman madeneelys job much easier no messina player had ever been cursed by coach rake with as much frequency and enthusiasm as silo mooney no one had deserved it as much no one craved the verbal abuse as much as silo at the north end of the bleachers down where the rowdies from the county once raised so much hell an older man moved quietly up to the top row and sat down he was too far away to be recognized and he certainly wanted to be alone he gazed at the field and was soon lost in his own memories the first jogger appeared and began plodding counterclockwise around the track it was the time of day when the runners and walkers drifted to the field for a few laps rake had never allowed such nonsense but after he was sacked a movement arose to open the track to the people whod paid for it a maintenance man was usually loitering somewhere nearby watching to make sure no one dared step on the grass of rake field there was no chance of that wheres floydneely asked still in nashville picking his guitar and writing bad musicchasing the dream ontario hes here working at the post office he and takita have three kids shes teaching school and as sweet as always theyre in church five times a week so hes still smiling always denny still here teaches chemistry in that building right over there never misses a game did you take chemistry i did not neither didi i had straight as and never cracked a book you didnt have to you were the ailamerican and jesses still in jail oh yeah hell be there for a long time where is he bufordi see his mother every now and then and i always ask about him it makes her cry but i cant help it wonder if he knows about rakeneely said paul shrugged and shook his head and there was another gap in the conversation as they watched an old man struggle in a painful trot along the track he was followed by two large young women both burning more energy talking than walking did you ever learn the true story of why jesse signed with miamineely asked not really lots of rumors about money but jesse would never say remember rakes reaction yeah he wanted to kill jesse i think rake had made some promises to the recruiter from am rake always wanted to deliver the prizes neely said with an air of experience he wanted me at state thats where you shouldve gone too late for that whyd you sign with tech i liked their quarterback coach no one liked their quarterback coach what was the real reason you really want to know yes after fifteen years i really want to know fifty thousand bucks in cash no yepstate offered forty am offered thirtyfivea few others were willing to pay twenty you never told me that i never told anyone until now its such a sleazy business you took fifty thousand dollars in cash from tech paul asked slowly five hundred onehundreddollarbills stuffed in an unmarked red canvas bag and placed in the trunk of my car one night while i was at the movies with screamer next morning i committed to tech did your parents know are you crazy my father wouldve called the ncaa whyd you take it every school offered cash paul dont be naive it was part of the game im notnaive im just surprised at you why i couldve signed with tech for nothing or i couldve taken the money fifty thousand bucks to an eighteenyearold idiot is like winning the lottery but still every recruiter offered cash paul there wasnt a single exception i figured it was just part of the business howd you hide the money stuffed it here and therewhen i got to tech i paid cash for a new car it didnt last long and your parents werent suspicious they were but i was away at college and they couldnt keep up with everything you saved none of it why save money when youre on the payroll what payroll neely reshifted his weight and gave an indulging smile dont patronize me asshole paul said oddly enough most of us didnt play football at the division one level remember the gator bowl my freshman year sure everyone here watched it i came off the bench in the second half threw three touchdowns ran for a hundred yardswon the game on a lastsecond pass a star isborn im the greatest freshman in the country blah blah blah well when i got back to school there was a small package in my pobox five thousand bucks in cash the note said nice game keep it up it was anonymous themessage was clearkeep winning and the money will keep coming so i wasnt interested in saving money silos pickup had a custom paint job that was an odd mix between gold and red the wheels glistened with silver and the windows werepitch black there he is paul said asthe truck rolled to a stop near the gate what kind of truck is thatneely asked stolen im sure silo himself had been customizeda leather wwii bomber jacket black denim pants black boots he hadnt lost weight hadnt gained any either and still looked like a nose tackle as he walked slowly around the edge of the field it was the walk of a messina spartan almost a strut almost a challenge to anyone to utter a careless word silo could still put on the pads snap the ball and draw blood instead he gazed at something in the middle of the field perhaps it was himself a long time ago perhaps he heard rake barking at him whatever silo heard or saw stopped him on the sideline for a momentthen he climbed the steps with his hands stuck deep in the pockets of his jacket he was breathing hard when he got toneely he bearhugged his quarterback and asked him where hed been for the past fifteen years greetings were exchanged insults swapped there was so much ground to cover that neither wanted to begin they sat three in a row and watched another jogger limp by silo was subdued and when he spoke it was almost in a whisper so where are you living these days the orlando area neely said what kind of work you in real estate you got a family no just one divorceyou oh im sure i got lots of kids i just dont know about emnever marriedyou makin money getting byim not on the forbes list ill probably crack it next year silo said what kind of business neely asked glancing down at paul automotive parts silo said i stopped by rakes this afternoon miss lila and the girls are there along with the grandkids and neighbors house is full of folks all sittin around just waitin for rake to die did you see him paul asked no hes somewhere in the back with a nurse miss lila said he didnt want anybody to see him in his last dayssaid hes just a skeleton the image of eddie rake lying in a dark bed with a nurse nearby counting the minutes chilled the conversation for a long time until the day he was fired he coached in cleats and shorts and never hesitated to demonstrate the proper blocking mechanics or the finer points of a stiff arm rake relished physical contact with his players but not the slap on the back for a job well done rake liked to hit and no practice session was complete until he angrily threw down his clipboard and grabbed someone by the shoulder padsthe bigger the better in blocking drills when things were not going to suit him he would crouch in a perfect threepoint stance then fire off the ball and crash into a defensive tackle one with forty more pounds and the full complement of pads and gear every messina player had seen rake on a particularly bad day throw his body at a running back and take him down with a vicious hit he loved the violence of football and demanded it from every player in thirtyfour years as head coach rake had struck only two players off the field the first had been a famous fistfight in the late sixties between the coach and a hothead who had quit the team and was looking for trouble of which he found plenty with rake the second had been a cheap shot that landed in the face of neely crenshaw it was incomprehensible that he was now a shriveled old man gasping for his last breath i was in the philippines silo said at low volume but his voice was coarse and carried through the clear air i was guardin toilets for the officers hatin every minute of it and i never saw you play in college you didnt miss much neely said i heard later that you were greatthen you got hurt i had some nice games he was the national player of the week when he was a sophomore paul saidthrew for six touchdowns against purdue it was a knee right silo asked yes howd it happen i rolled out into the flat saw an opening tucked the ball and ran didnt see a linebackerneely delivered the narrative as if hed done it a thousand times and preferred not to do it again silo had torn an acl in spring football and survived it he knew something about the knee surgery and all that he asked four of them neely said completely ruptured the ligament busted the kneecap so the helmet got you the linebacker went for the knee asneely was stepping out of bounds paul said they showed it a dozen times on television one of the announcers had the guts to call it a cheap shot it was am what can i say mustve hurt like hell it did he was carried off in an ambulance and they wept in the streets of messina im sure thats true silo said but it doesnt take much to get this town upset rehab didnt work it was what they sadly refer to as a careerending injury neely said therapy made things worse i was toast from the second i tucked the ball and ranshouldve stayed in the pocket like id been coached rake never told you to stay in the pocket its a different game up there silo yeah theyre a bunch of dumbasses they never recruited me i couldve been great probably the first nose tackle to win the heisman no doubt about it paul said everybody knew it at tech neely said all the players kept asking me wheres the great silo mooney why didnt we sign him what a waste paul said youd still be in the nfl probably with the packers silo saidmaking the big buckschicks bangin on my doorthe life didnt rake want you to go to a junior collegeneely asked yeah i was headed there but they wouldnt let me finish school here howd you get in the army i lied and there was no doubt that silo had lied to get in the army and probably lied to get out i need a beer he said you guys want a beer ill pass paul said i need to be heading home soon what about you a beer would be nice neely said you gonna stay here for a while silo asked maybe me tooit just seems like the place to be right now the spartan marathon was an annual torture run created by rake to inaugurate each season it was held the first day of august practice always at noon for maximum heat every varsity hopeful reported to the track in gym shorts and running shoes and when rake blew his whistle the laps began the format was simpleyou ran until you dropped twelve laps were the minimum any player unable to complete twelve laps would get the chance to repeat the marathon the next day and if he failed twice then he was unfit to become a messina spartan any high school football player who could not run three miles had no business putting on the pads the assistant coaches sat in the airconditioned press box and counted laps rake prowled from one end zone to the other watching the runners barking if necessary disqualifying those who moved tooslow speed was not an issue unless a players pace became a walk at which point rake would pull him off the track once a player quit or passed out or was otherwise disqualified he was forced to sit at midfield and bake under the sun until there was no one left standing there were very few rules one of which called for automatic ejection if a runner vomited on the track vomiting was allowed and there was plenty of it but once it was completed somewhere off the track the sick player was expected to rejoin the run of rakes vast repertoire of harsh conditioning methods the marathon was by far the most dreaded over the years it had led some young men in messina to pursue other sports or to leave athletics altogether mention it to a player around town in july and he suddenly had a thick knot in his stomach and a dry mouth by early august most players were running at least five miles a day in anticipation because of the marathon every spartan reported in superb condition it was not unusual for a hefty lineman to lose twenty or thirty pounds over the summer not for his girlfriend and not for his physique the weight was shed to survive the spartan marathon once it was over the eating could start again though weight was difficult to gain when you spent three hours a day on the practice field coach rake didnt like big linemen anyway he preferred the nasty types like silo mooney neelys senior year he completed thirtyone laps almost eight miles and when he fell onto the grass with the dry heaves he could hear rake cursing him from across the field paul ran nine and a half miles that year thirtyeight laps and won the race every spartan remembered two numbersthe one on his jersey and the number of laps he finished in the spartan marathon after the knee injury had abruptly reduced him to the status of being just another student at tech neely was in a bar when a coed from messina spotted him heard the news from home she said what news neely asked not the least bit interested in news from his hometown got a new record in the spartan marathon oh really yeah eightythree laps neely repeated what shed said did the math then said thats almost twentyone miles yep who did it some kid named jaeger only in messina would the gossip include the latest stats from the august workouts randy jaeger was now climbing up the bleachers wearing his green game jersey with the number in white with silver trim tucked tightly into his jeans he was small very thin at the waist no doubt a wide receiver with quick feet and an impressive time in the forty he first recognized paul and as he drew closer he sawneely he stopped three rows down and said neely crenshaw thats me neely said they shook hands paul knew jaeger well because as was established quickly in the conversation randys family owned a shopping center north of town and like everybody else in messina they banked with paul any word on rakejaeger asked settling onto the row behind and leaning forward between them not much hes still hanging on paul said gravely when did you finishneely asked ninetythree and they fired him in ninetytwo my senior yeari was one of the captains there was a heavy pause as the story of rakes termination came and went without commentneely had been drifting through western canada in a postcollege funk that lasted almost five years and had missed the drama over time he had heard some of the details though he had tried to convince himself he didnt care what happened to eddie rake you ran the eightythree lapsneely asked yep in when i was a sophomore still the record yepyou thirtyone my senior yeareightythree is hard to believe i got lucky it was cloudy and cool how about the guy who came in second fortyfive i think doesnt sound like luck to me did you play in college no i weighed onethirty with pads on he was allstate for two years paul said and still holds the record for return yardage his momma just couldnt fatten him up i got a question neely said i ran thirtyone laps and collapsed in pain then rake cussed me like a dog what exactly did he say when you finished with eightythree paul grunted and grinned because hed heard the story jaeger shook his head and smiled typical rake he said when i finished he walked by me and said in a loud voice i thought you could do a hundred of course this was for the benefit of the other players later in the locker room he said very quietly that it was a gutsy performance two of the joggers left the track and walked up a few rows where they sat by themselves and stared at the field they were in their early fifties tanned and fit with expensive running shoes guy on the right is blanchard teague paul said anxious to prove he knew everyoneour optometrist on the left is jon couch a lawyer they played in the late sixties during the streak so they never lost a game jaeger said thats right in fact the team was never scored ontwelve games twelve shutouts those two guys were there awesome jaeger said truly in awe that was before we were born paul said a scoreless season took a minute to digest the optometrist and the lawyer were deep in conversation no doubt replaying their glorious achievements during the streak the paper did a story on rake a few years after he was fired paul said softly it ran all the usual stats but also added that in thirtyfour years he coached seven hundred and fourteen players that was the title of the storyeddie rake and the seven hundred spartans i saw that jaeger said i wonder how many will be at his funeral paul said most of them silos version of a beverage run included the gathering of two cases of beer and two other guys to help drink it three men emerged from his pickup with silo leading the way a box of budweiser on his shoulder one bottle was in his hand oh boy paul said whos the skinny guyneely asked i thinkits hubcap hubcaps not in jail he comes and goes the other one is amos kelso jaeger said he played with me amos was hauling the other case of beer and as the three stomped up the bleachers silo invited orley short and his pal to join them for a drink they did not hesitate he yelled at teague and couch and they too followed them up to row thirty whereneely and paul and randy jaeger were sitting once the introductions were made and the bottles were opened orley asked the group whats the latest on rake just waiting paul said i stopped by this afternoon couch said gravely its just a matter of time couch had an air of lawyerly importance thatneely immediately disliked teague the optometrist then provided a lengthy narrative about the latest advances of rakes cancer it was almost dark the joggers were gone from the track in the shadows a tall gawky man emerged from the clubhouse and slowly made his way to the metal poles supporting the scoreboard thats not rabbit is itneely asked of course it is paul said hell never leave whats his title now he doesnt need one he taught me history teague said and he taught me math couch said rabbit had taught for eleven years before someone discovered hed never finished the ninth grade he was fired in the ensuing scandal but rake intervened and got rabbit reassigned as an assistant athletic director such a title at messina high school meant he did nothing but take orders from rake he drove the team bus cleaned uniforms maintained equipment and most important supplied rake with all the gossip the field lights were mounted on four poles two on each side rabbit flipped a switch the lights on the south end of the visitors side came on ten rows of ten lights each long shadows fell across the field been doing that for a week now paul said rabbit leaves them on all nighthis version of a vigil when rake dies the lights go out rabbit lurched and wobbled back to the clubhouse gone for the night does he still live thereneely asked yephe has a cot in the attic above the weight roomcalls himself a night watchman hes crazy as hell he was a damned good math teacher couch said hes lucky he can still walk paul said and everyone laughed rabbit had become partially crippled during a game in when for reasons neither he nor anyone else would ever grasp he had sprinted from the sideline onto the field into the path of one lightning loyd a fast and rugged running back who later played at auburn but who on that night was playing for greene county and playing quite brilliantly with the score tied late in the third quarter loyd broke free for what appeared to be a long touchdown run both teams were undefeated the game was tense and evidently rabbit snapped under the pressure to the horror and delight of ten thousand messina faithful rabbit flung his bony and brittle body into the arena and somewhere around the thirtyfiveyard line he collided with lightning the collision while near fatal for rabbit who at the time was at least forty years old had little impact on loyda bug on the windshield rabbit was wearing khakis a green messina sweatshirt a green cap that shot skyward and came to rest ten yards away and a pair of pointedtoe cowboy boots the left one of which was jolted free and spun loose while rabbit was airborne people sitting thirty rows up swore they heard rabbits bones break if lightning had continued his sprint the controversy would have been lessened considerably but the poor kid was so shocked that he glanced over his shoulder to see who and what he had just run over and in doing so lost his balance it took fifteen yards for him to complete his fall and when he came to rest somewhere around the twentyyard line the field was covered with yellow flags while the trainers huddled over rabbit and debated whether to call for an ambulance or a minister the officials quickly awarded the touchdown to greene county a decision that rake argued with for a moment then conceded rake was as shocked as anyone and he was also concerned about rabbit who hadnt moved a muscle since hitting the ground it took twenty minutes to gather rabbit up and place him gently on the stretcher and shove him into an ambulance as it drove away ten thousand messina fans stood and applauded with respect the folks from greene county uncertain as to whether they too should applaud or boo just sat quietly and tried to digest what they had seen they had their touchdown but the poor idiot appeared to be dead rake always the master motivator used the delay to incite his troops rabbits hittin harder than you clowns he growled at his defense lets kick some ass and take the game ball to rabbit messina scored three touchdowns in the fourth quarter and won easily rabbit survived too his collarbone was broken and three lower veterbrae were cracked his concussion was not severe and those who knew him well claimed they noticed no additional brain damage needless to say rabbit became a local hero at the annual football banquet thereafter rake awarded a rabbit trophy for the hitoftheyear the lights grew brighter as dusk came to an end their eyes refocused in the semilit darkness of rake field another smaller group of old spartans had materialized at the far end of the bleachers their voices were barely audible silo opened another bottle and drained half of it when was the last time you saw rake blanchard teague askedneely a couple of days after my first surgery neely said and everyone was still he was telling a story that had never been told before in messina i was in the hospital one surgery down three to go it was a cheap shot couch mumbled as ifneely needed to be reassured damned sure was said amos kelso neely could see them huddled in the coffee shops on main street long sad faces low grave voices as they replayed the late hit that instantly ruined the career of their allamerican a nurse told him she had never seen such an outpouring of compassioncards flowers chocolates balloons artwork from entire classes of gradeschoolersall from the small town of messina three hours away other than his parents and the tech coachesneely refused all visitors for eight long days he drowned himself in pity aided mightily by as many painkillers as the doctors would allow rake slipped in one night long after visiting hours were over he tried to cheer me up neely said sipping a beer said knees could be rehabbed i tried to believe him did he mention the championship game silo asked we talked about it there was a long awkward pause as they contemplated that game and all the mysteries around it it was messinas last title and that alone was a source rich enough for years of analysis down at the half roughed up and manhandled by a vastly superior team from east pike the spartans returned to the field at am where thirtyfive thousand fans were waiting rake was absent he didnt appear until late in the fourth quarter the truth about what happened had remained buried for fifteen years and evidently neither neely nor silo nor paul nor hubcap taylor were about to break the silence in the hospital room rake had finally apologized butneely had told no one teague and couch said goodbye and jogged away in the darkness you never came back did you jaeger asked not after i got hurt neely said why not didnt want to hubcap had been working quietly on a pint of something much stronger than beer hed said little and when he spoke his tongue was thick people say you hated rake thats not true and he hated you rake had a problem with the stars paul said we all knew that if you won too many awards set too many records rake got jealousplain and simple he worked us like dogs and wanted every one of us to be great but when guys likeneely got all the attention then rake got envious i dont believe that orley short grunted its true plus he wanted to deliver the prizes to whatever college he happened to like at the moment he wantedneely at state he wanted me in the army silo said lucky you didnt go to prison paul said it aint over yet silo said with a laugh another car rolled to a stop by the gate and its headlights went off no door opened prisons underrated hubcap said and everyone laughed rake had his favorites neely said i wasnt one of them then why are you here asked orley short im not sure same reason youre here i guess duringneelys freshman year at tech he had returned for messinas homecoming game in a halftime ceremony they retired number the standing ovation went on and on and eventually delayed the second half kickoff which cost the spartans five yards and prompted coach rake leading to start yelling that was the only gameneely had watched since he left one year later he was in the hospital when did they put up rakes bronze statue he asked couple of years after they fired him jaeger said the boosters raised ten thousand bucks and had it done they wanted to present it to him before a game but he refused so he never came back well sort of jaeger pointed to a hill in the distance behind the clubhouse hed drive up on karrs hill before every game and park on one of thosegravel roads he and miss lila would sit there looking down listening to buck coffey on the radio too far away to see much but making sure the town knew he was still watching at the end of every halftime the band would face the hill and play the fight song and all ten thousand would wave at rake it was pretty cool said amos kelso rake knew everything that was going on paul said rabbit called him twice a day with the gossip was he a recluseneely asked he kept to himself amos saidfor the first three or four years anyway there were rumors he was moving but then rumors dont mean much here he went to mass every morning but thats a small crowd in messina he got out more in the last few years paul saidstarted playing golf was he bitter the question was pondered by the rest of them yeah he was bitter said jaeger i dont think so paul said he blamed himself rumor has it that theyll bury him next to scotty amos said i heard that too silo said very deep in thought a car door slammed and a figure stepped onto the track a stocky man in a uniform of some variety swaggered around the field and approached the bleachers heres trouble amos mumbled its mal brown silo said softly our illustrious sheriff paul said toneely number thats him neelys number was the last jersey retired number was the first mal brown had played in the midsixties during the streak eighty pounds and thirtyfive years ago he had been a bruising tailback who had once carried the ball fiftyfour times in a game still a messina record a quick marriage ended the college career before it began and a quick divorce sent him to vietnam in time for the tet offensive in neely had heard stories of the great mal brown throughout most of his childhood before a gameneelys freshman year coach rake stopped by for a quick pep talk he recounted in great detail how mal brown had once rushed for two hundred yards in the second half of the conference championship and he did so with a broken ankle rake loved stories of players who refused to leave the field with broken bones and bleeding flesh and all sorts of gruesome injuries years laterneely would hear that mals broken ankle had more than likely been a severe sprain but as the years passed the legend grew at least in rakes memory the sheriff walked along the front of the bleachers and spoke to the others passing the time then he climbed thirty rows and arrived almost gasping atneelys group he spoke to paul then amos silo orley hubcap randyhe knew them all by their first names or nicknames heard you were in town he said toneely as they shook hands its been a long time it has was allneely could say to his recollection he had never met mal brown he wasnt the sheriff whenneely lived in messina neely knew the legend but not the man didnt matterthey were fraternity brothers its dark silo how come you aint stealin cars mal said too early im gonna bust your ass you know that i got lawyers gimme a beerim off duty silo handed over a beer and mal slugged it down just left rakes he said smacking his lips as if he hadnt had liquids in days nothings changedjust waitin for him to go the update was received without comment where you been hidin mal askedneely nowhere dont lie nobodys seen you here in ten years maybe longer my parents retired to florida i had no reason to come back this is where you grew upits home aint that a reason maybe for you maybe my assyou got a lot of friends around hereaint right to run away drink another beer mal paul said silo quickly passed another one down and mal grabbed it after a minute he said you got kids no hows your knee its ruined sorrya long drink what a cheap shot you were clearly out of bounds i shouldve stayed in the pocket neely said shifting his weight wishing he could change the subject how long would the town of messina talk about the cheap shot that ruined his career another long drink then mal said softly man you were the greatest lets talk about something else neely said hed been there for almost three hours and was suddenly anxious to leave though he had no idea where he might be going two hours earlier there had been talk of mona curry cooking dinner but that offer had not been pursued okay what lets talk about rake neely said what was his worst team all bottles rose at once as the group contemplated this mal spoke first he lost four games in miss lila swears he went into solitary confinement for the winterstopped goin to mass refused to be seen in public he put the team on a brutal conditionin program ran em like dogs all summer made em practice three times a day in august but when they kicked off in it was a different teamalmost won state how could rake lose four games in one seasonneely asked mal leaned back and rested on the row behind himtook a swig he was by far the oldest spartan present and since he hadnt missed a game in thirty years he had the floor well first of all the team had absolutely no talent the price of timber shot up in the summer of and all the loggers quit you know how they are then the quarterback broke his arm and there was no backup we played harrisburg that year and never threw a passmakes it tough when theyre sendin all eleven on every play it was a disaster harrisburg beat usneely asked in disbelief yep the only time in the past fortyone yearsand lemme tell you what those dumb sumbitches did theyre leadin late in the game big score somethin like thirtysix to nothinthe worst night in the history of messina football so they figure theyve turned the corner in their sad little rivalry with us and they decide to run up the score with a coupla minutes to go they throw a reverse pass on third and shortanother touchdown theyre real excited you know theyre stickin it to the messina spartans rake kept his cool wrote it down somewhere in blood and went lookin for loggers next year were playin harrisburg here huge crowd angrycrowd we score seven touchdowns in the first half i remember that game paul said i was in the first gradefortyeight to nothing fortyseven mal said proudly we scored four times in the third quarter and rake kept passin he couldnt sub because he had no bench but he kept the ball in the air the finalneely asked ninetyfour to nothinstill a messina recordthe only time ive ever known eddie rake to run up a score the other group on the north end erupted in laughter as someone finished astory no doubt about rake or some longago game silo had become very quiet in the presence of the law and when the moment was right he said well i need to be going call me curry if you hear something about rake i will see yall tomorrow silo said standing stretchingreaching for one last bottle i need a ride hubcap said its that time of the night huh silo mal saidtime for all good thieves to ease out of the gutter imlaying off for a few days silo saidin honor of coach rake how touchinill just send the night shift boys home then since youre closin shop you do that mal silo hubcap and amos kelso lumbered down the bleachers the metal steps rattling as they descended hell be in prison within twelve months mal said as they watched them walk along the track behind the end zone make sure your bank is clean curry dont worry neely had heard enoughhe stood and said ill be running along too i thought you were coming to dinner paul said im not hungry nowhow about tomorrow night mona will be disappointed tell her to save the leftovers good night mal randy im sure ill see you soon the knee was stiff and asneely crept down the steps he tried mightily to do so without a limp without a hint that he was anything less than what they remembered on the track behind the spartan bench he turned too quickly and the knee almost collapsed it buckled then wavered as tiny sharp pains hit in a dozen different spots because it happened so often he knew how to lift it just so and quickly shift all weight to his right leg and to keep walking as if everything was normal wednesday in the window of every shop and store around the messina square there was a large green football schedule as if the customers and the townsfolk needed help in remembering that the spartans played every friday night and on every lamppost in front of the shops and stores there were greenandwhite banners that went up in late august and came down when the season was over neely remembered the banners from the days when he rode his bike along the walkways nothing had changed the large green schedules were the same every yearthe games in bold print outlined by the smiling faces of the seniors along the bottom small ads of all the local sponsors which included every single business in messina no one was left off the schedule as he entered renfrows cafe one step behind paul neely took a deep breath and toldhimself to smile to be politethese folks after all once adored him the thick smell of things frying hit him at the door then the sound of pots rattling in the distance the smells and sounds had not changed from the time his father brought him to renfrows for hot chocolate on saturday mornings where the locals relived and replayed the latest spartan victory during the season each football player could eat once a week at renfrows at no charge a simple and generous gesture that had been sorely tested shortly after the school was integrated would renfrows allow black players the same privilege damned right came the word from eddie rake and the cafe became one of the first in the state to voluntarily integrate itself paul spoke to most of the men huddled over their coffee but he kept moving toward a booth by the window neely nodded and tried to avoid eye contact by the time they slid into their seats the secret was out neely crenshaw was indeed back in town the walls were covered with old football schedules framed newspaper stories pennants autographed jerseys and hundreds of photosteam photos lined in neat chronological order above the counter action shots lifted from the local paper and large blackandwhites of the greatest of spartans neelys was above the cash register a photo of him as a senior posing with the football cocked and ready to fire no helmet no smile all business and attitude and ego long untamed hair three days worth of stubble and peach fuzz eyes looking somewhere in the distance no doubt dreaming of future glory you were so cute back then paul said seems like yesterday then it seems like a dream in the center of the longest wall there was a shrine to eddie rakea large color photo of him standing near the goalposts and under it the record wins losses state titles according to the predawn gossip rake was still clinging to life and the town was still clinging to him the chatter was subduedno laughter no jokes no windy stories of fishing triumphs none of the usual spats over politics a tiny waitress in a greenandwhite outfit brought them coffee and took their orders she knew paul but did not recognize the guy with him is maggie still aroundneely asked nursing home paul said maggie renfrow had been serving scalded coffee and oily eggs for decades she had also dealt relentlessly in all areas of gossip and rumor surrounding the spartan football team because she had given free meals to the players she had managed to do what everyone else in messina tried to dowiggle in a little closer to the boys and their coach a gentleman approached and nodded awkwardly atneely just wanted to say hello he said easing out his right hand good to see you again after all this time you were something neely shook his hand and said thanks the handshake was brief neely broke eye contact the gentleman took the hint and withdrew no one followed him there were quick glances and awkward stares but the others seemed content to brood over the coffee and ignore him after all he had ignored them for the past fifteen years messina owned its heroes and they were expected to enjoy the nostalgia when was the last time you saw screamer paul asked neely snorted and looked out of the window i havent seen her since college not a word one letter years backfancy stationery from some place in hollywood said she was taking the place by storm said shed be a lot more famous than i ever thought about beingpretty nasty stuff i didnt respond she showed up for our tenyear reunion paul saidan actress nothing but blond hair and legs outfits that have never been seen around herea pretty elaborate production namedropping right and left this producer that director a bunch of actors id never heard of i got the impression she was spending more time in bed than in front of the camera thats screamer you should know howd she look tired any credits quite a few and they changed by the hour we compared notes later and no one had seen anything she said shed been in it was all a showtypical screamer except that now shes tessatessa canyon tessa canyon yep sounds like a porn star i think thats where she was headed poor girl poor girlpaul repeated shes a miserable selfabsorbed idiot whose only claim to fame was that she was neely crenshaws girlfriend yes but those legs they both smiled for a long time the waitress brought their pancakes and sausage and refilled their coffees as paul drenched his plate with maple syrup he began talking again two years ago we had a big bankers convention in vegas mona was with me she got bored went to the room i got bored so i walked along the strip late at night i ducked into one of the older casinos and guess who i saw tessa canyon tessa was shuffling booze a cocktail waitress in one of those tight little costumes thats low in the front and high in the rearbleached hair thick makeup twenty or so extra pounds she didnt see me so i watched her for a few minutes she looked older than thirty the odd thing was how she performed when she got near her customers at the tables the smile came on with the purring little voice that says take me upstairsthe glib onelinersthe bumping and rubbingshameless flirting with a bunch of drunks the woman just wants to be loved i tried my best shes a sad case thats why i dumped her she wont come back for the funeral will she maybeif theres a chance shell bump into you then yes shell be here on the other hand she aint lookin too good and with screamer looks are everything her parents are still here yeah a chubby man wearing a john deere cap eased to their table as if he was trespassing just wanted to say helloneely he said almost ready to bow tim nunley down at the ford place he said offering a hand as if it might be ignored neely shook it and smiledused to work on your daddys cars i remember you neely lied but the lie was worth the effort mr nunleys smile doubled in size and he squeezedneelys hand harder i thought you would mr nunley said glancing at his table for vindication good to see you back here you were the greatest thank you neely said releasing his hand and grabbing a fork mr nunley backedaway still waiting to bow then took his coat and left the restaurant the conversations were still muted around the tables as if the wake had already begun paul finished a mouthful and leaned in low four years ago we had a good teamwon the first nine gamesundefeated i was sitting right here eating the same thing im eating now on a friday morning game day and i swear this is true the topic of conversation that morning was the streak not the old streak but a new one these people were ready for a new streak never mind a winning season or a conference title or even a state championship theyre all peanuts this town wants eighty ninety maybe a hundred wins in a row neely looked around quickly then returned to his breakfast ive never understood it he said these are nice folksmechanics truck drivers insurance salesmen builders maybe a lawyer maybe a bankersolid smalltown citizens but not exactly earthshakers i mean nobody here is making a million bucks but theyre entitled to a state championship every year right right i dont get it bragging rightswhat else can they brag about no wonder they worship rake he put the town on the map take a bite paul said a man with a dirty apron approached holding a manila file he introduced himself as maggie renfrows brother now the chef and he opened the file inside was a framed eight by ten color photo ofneely at tech maggie always wanted you to sign this he said it was splendid picture ofneely in action crouching behind the center calling a play ready for the snap sizing up the defense a purple helmet was visible in the right lower corner andneely realized the opponent was am the photo one hed never seen before was taken minutes before he was injured sure he said taking a black marker from the chef he signed his name across the top and for a long moment looked into the eyes of a young fearless quarterback a star biding his time in college while the nfl waited he could hear the tech crowd that day seventyfive thousand strong and desperate for victory proud of their undefeated team thrilled that they for the first time in many years had a bonafide ailamerican at quarterback suddenly he longed for those days nice photo he managed to say handing it back to the chef who took it and immediately hung it on a nail under the larger photo ofneely lets get outta here neely said wiping his mouth he placed some cash on the table and they began a quick exit he nodded smiled politely at the regulars and managed to make an escape without being stopped why are you so nervous around these folks paul asked when they were outside i dont want to talk about football okay i dont want to hear how great i was they drove the quiet streets around the square passing the church whereneely was baptized and the church where paul was married and the handsome splitlevel on tenth street where neely lived from the age of eight until he left for tech his parents had sold it to a certified yankee whod been brought down to manage the paper mill west of town they passed rakes house slowly as if they might hear the latest just by driving down the street the driveway was crowded with cars most with outofstate license plates rakes family and close friends they figured they passed the park where theyd played little league baseball and pop warner football and they remembered stories one that was now a legend in messina was of course about rake neely paul and a handful of their buddies were playing a rowdy game of sandlot football when they noticed a man standing in the distance near the backstop of the baseball field watching them closely when they finished he ventured over and introduced himself as coach eddie rake the boys were speechless you have a nice arm son he said toneely who could say nothing in response i like your feet too all the boys looked atneelys feet is your mother as tall as your father coach rake asked almost neely managed to say good youll make a great spartan quarterback rake smiled at the boysthen walked away neely was eleven years old at the time they stopped at the cemetery the approach of the season caused great concern in messina the year before the team had lost three games a civic disaster that had them grumbling over their biscuits at renfrows and rubber chicken at the rotary lunches and cheap beer at the tonks out in the county and there had been few seniors on that team always a bad sign it was a relief when weak players graduated if rake felt pressure he certainly didnt show it by then hed been coaching the spartans for more than three decades and had seen everything his last state title number thirteen had been in so the locals were suffering through a threeyear drought theyd been through worse they were spoiled and wanted a hundred wins in a row and rake after thirtyfour years didnt care what they wanted the team had little talent and everyone knew it the only star was randy jaeger who played corner and wideout where he caught anything the quarterback could throw near him which was not very much in a town the size of messina the talent came in cycles on the upswing as in with neely silo paul alonzo taylor and four vicious loggers on defense the scores were lopsided rakes greatness however was winning with players who were small and slow he took thin talent and still delivered scores that were lopsided he worked the lean ones harder though and few teams had seen the intensity that rake brought to the field in august after a bad scrimmage on a saturday afternoon rake lashed out at the team and called a sunday morning practice something he rarely did because in years past it had upset the church folkseight oclock sunday morning so that the boys would have time to attend worship if they were able rake was particularly upset over what he perceived to be a lack of conditioning a joke since every messina team ran sprints by the hundreds shorts shoulder pads gym shoes helmets no contact just conditioningit was eightynine degrees by eight oclock with thick humidity and a cloudless sky they stretched and ran a mile around the track just for a warmup every player was soaked with sweat when rake called for a second mile number two on the list of dreaded tortures just behind the spartan marathon was the assault on the bleachers every player knew what it meant and when rake yelled bleachers half the team wanted to quit following randy jaeger their captain the players formed a long reluctant single line and began a slow jog around the track when the line approached the visitors stands jaeger turned through a gate and started up the bleachers twenty rows then along the top rail then down twenty rows to the next sectioneight sections on the other side then back on the track around the end zone to the home side fifty rows up along the top rail fifty rows down up and down up and down up and down for another eight sectionsthen back on the track for another loop after one grueling round the linemen were drifting to the rear and jaeger who could run forever was far in front rake growled along the track whistle hanging around his neck yelling at the stragglers he loved the sound of fifty players stomping up and down the bleachers you guys are not in shape he said just loud enough to be heard slowest bunch ive ever seen he grumbled again barely audible rake was famous for his grumbling which could always be heard after the second round a tackle fell to the grass and began vomiting the heavier players were moving slower and slower scotty reardon was a sophomore specialteams player who weighed in that august at pounds but at the time of his autopsy weighed during the third round of bleachers he collapsed between the third and fourth rows on the home side and never regained consciousness since it was sunday morning and a nocontact session both team trainers were absent at rakes instructions nor was there an ambulance close by the boys would describe later how rake held scottys head in his lap while they waited for an eternity to hear a siren but he was dead in the bleachers and he was certainly dead when he finally arrived at the hospitalheatstroke paul was telling the story as they walked through the winding shaded lanes of the messina cemetery in a newer section on the side of a steep hill the headstones were smaller the rows neater he nodded at one andneely knelt down for a look randall scott reardonborn june died august and theyre going bury him over there neely asked pointing to a bare spot next to scotty thats the rumor paul said this place is always good for a rumor they walked a few steps to a wroughtiron bench under a small elm tree sat and looked at scottys headstone who had the guts to fire himneely asked the wrong kid died scottys family had some money from timber his uncle john reardon was elected superintendent of education in very highly regarded smart as hell smooth politician and the only person with the authority to fire eddie rake fire him he did the town as you might guess was shocked by the news of the death and as the details came out there was some grumbling about rake and his methods lucky he didnt kill all of us an autopsy was done on mondaya clear case of heatstroke no preexisting conditions no defects anywhere a perfectly healthy fifteenyearold leaves home at seventhirty on a sunday morning for a twohour torture session and he doesnt come home for the first time in the history of this town people were asking why exactly do you run kids in a sauna until they puke and the answer was rake had no answers rake said nothing rake stayed at home and tried to ride out the storma lot of people including many of those who played for him thought well rakes finally killed a boy but a lot of the diehards were saying hell that kid wasnt tough enough to be a spartan the town split it got ugly i like this reardon fellow neely said hes tough late monday night he called rake and fired him everything blew up tuesday rake typically couldnt stand the thought of losing in any way so he worked the phones stirred up the boosters no remorse who knows how he felt the funeral was a nightmare as you might guess all those kids bawling somefaintingthe players wearing green game jerseysthe band playing right along here at the graveside ceremony everybody was watching rake who looked quite pitiful rake was a great actor and everybody knew it hed been fired less than twentyfour hours earlier so the funeral had the added drama of his departure quite ashow and nobody missed it wish id been here where were you summer of outwest somewhereprobably vancouver the boosters tried to convene a massive meeting on wednesday in the school gym reardon said not on this campus so they went to the vfw and had an eddie rake revival some of the hotheads threatened to cut off the money boycott the games picket reardons office even start a new school where i guess they would worship rake was rake there oh nohe sent rabbit he was content to stay at home and work the phones he truly believed that he could exert enough pressure to get his job back but reardon wasnt budging he went to the assistants and named snake thomas as the new head coach snake declined reardon fired him donnie malone said no reardon fired him quick upchurch said no reardon fired him i like this guy more and more finally the griffin brothers said they would fill in until someone was found they played for rake in the late seventies i remember themthe pecan orchard thats them great players nice guys and because rake never changed anything they knew the system the plays most of the kids friday night rolled around first game of the season we were playing porterville and the boycott was on problem was nobody wanted to miss the game rakes folks who were probably in the majority couldnt stay away because they wanted the team to get slaughtered the real fans were there for the right reasons the place was packed as always with complicated loyalties yelling in all directions the players were pumped they dedicated the game to scotty and won by four touchdownsa wonderful night sad because of scotty and sad because the rake era was apparently over but winning is everything this bench is hard neely said standing lets walk meanwhile rake hired a lawyer a suit was filed things got ugly reardon held hisground and the town though deeply divided still managed to come together every friday night the team played with more guts than ive ever seen years later one kid i know said it was such a relief playing football for the sheer fun of it and not playing out of fear how beautiful is that we never knew no we didnt they won the first eight gamesundefeatednothing but pride and guts there was talk of a state title there was talk of a new streak there was talk of paying the griffins a bunch of money to start a new dynasty all that crap then they lost of courseits football a bunch of kids start thinking theyre good and they get their butts kicked who did it hermantown no not hermantownthats a basketball school did it right here in front of ten thousand worst game i ever saw no pride no guts just show them the next press clipping forget a streak forget a state title fire the griffins bring back eddie rake things were sort of okay when we were winning but that one loss ripped this town apart for years and when we lost the next week we failed to qualify for the playoffs the griffins quit immediately smart boys those of us who played for rake were caught in the middle everyone asked which side are you on no fence straddling bud you had to declare if you were for rake or against him and you i straddled the fence and got kicked on both sides it turned into class warfare there had always been a very small group of people who were opposed to spending more money on football than on science and math combined we traveled by chartered bus while every academic club carpooled with their parents for years the girls had no softball field while we had not one but two practice fields the latin club qualified for a trip to new york but couldnt afford it the same year the football team took the train to watch the super bowl in new orleans the list is endless rakes firing made these complaints louder the folks who wanted to deemphasize sports saw their opportunity the football bubbas resisted they just wanted rake and another streak those of us who played then went to college and were considered somewhat enlightened got caught in the middle what happened it smoldered and festered for months john reardon stood firm he found some lost soul from oklahoma who wanted to coach and hired him as the successor to eddie rake unfortunately was reelection year for reardon so the whole mess turned into one huge political brawl there was a strong rumor that rake himself would run against reardon if he got elected he would anoint himself coach again and tell the whole world to go to hell there was a rumor that scottys father would spend a million bucks to reelect john reardon and so on the race was ugly before it started so ugly that the rake campalmost couldnt find a candidate who ran dudley bumpus the name sounds promising the name was the best part hes a local real estate swinger whod been a big mouth in the boosters no political experience no educational experience barely finished collegeonly one indictment no convictiona loser who almost won reardon held on by sixty votesthe turnout was the largest in the countys history almost ninety percent it was a war with no prisoners when the winner was announced rake went home locked the door and hid for two years they stopped at a row of headstones paul walked along them looking for someone here he said pointing david lee goffthe first spartan to die in vietnam neely looked at the headstonethere was an inlaid photograph of david lee looking all of sixteen years old posing not in an army uniform or a senior portrait but in his green spartan jersey number born in killed in i knowhis youngest brother paul was saying david lee graduated in may entered boot camp in junearrived in vietnam in october died the day after thanksgiving eighteen years and two months old two years before we were born somethinglike that there was another one who hasnt been found yeta black kid marvin rudd who went missing in action in i remember rake talking about rudd neely said rake loved the kid his parents still come to every game and you wonder what theyre thinking im tired of death neely said lets go neely couldnt remember a bookshop in messina nor a place to get an espresso or buy coffee beans from kenya nats place now provided all three along with magazines cigars cds offcolor greeting cards herbal teas of dubious origin vegetarian sandwiches and soups and a meeting place for drifting poets and folksingers and the few wannabe bohemians in the town it was on the square four doors down from pauls bank in a building that sold feed and fertilizer whenneely was a kid paul had some loans to make soneely explored by himself nat sawyer was the worst punter in the history of spartan football his average yards per kick had set record lows and he fumbled so many snaps that rake would normally just go for it on fourth and eight regardless of where the ball was withneely at quarterback a good punter was not a necessity twice during their senior year nat had somehow managed to miss the ball with his foot entirely creating some of the most watched video footage in the programs history the second miss which was actually two misses on the same punt resulted in a comical ninetyfouryard touchdown run which lasted according to an accurate timing of the video seconds standing in his own end zone and quite nervous about it nat had taken the snap released the ball kicked nothing but air then been slaughtered by two defenders from grove city as the bail was spinning benignly on the ground nearby nat collected himself picked it up and began to run the two defenders who appeared to be stunned gave a confused chase and nat tried an awkward puntonthefly when he missed he picked up the ball again and the race was on the sight of such an ungainly gazelle lumbering down the field in sheer terror froze many of the players from both teams silo mooney later testifed that he was laughing so hard he couldnt block for his punter he swore he heard laughter coming from under the helmets of the grove city players from the video the coaches counted ten missed tackles when nat finally reached the end zone he spiked the ball didnt care about the penalty ripped off his helmet and rushed to the home side so the fans could admire him at close range rake gave him an award for the ugliest touchdown of the year in the tenth grade nat had tried playing safety but he couldnt run and hated to hit in the eleventh he had tried receiver butneely nailed him in the gut on a slant and nat couldnt breathe for five minutes few of rakes players had been cursed with so little talent none of rakes players looked worse in a uniform the window was filled with books and advertised coffee and lunch the door squeaked a bell rattled and for a momentneely was stepping back in time then he got the first whiff of incense and he knew nat ran the place the owner himself hauling a stack of books stepped from between two saggy shelves and with a smile said good morning lookin for something then he froze and the books fell to the floorneely crenshaw he lunged with as much awkwardness as hed used punting a football and the two embraced a clumsy hug in whichneely caught a sharp elbow on his bicep its great to see you nat gushed and for a second his eyes were wet good to see you nat neely said slightly embarrassed fortunately at that moment there was only one other customer youre looking at my earrings arent you nat said taking a step back well yes you have quite a collection each ear was loaded with at least five silver rings first male earrings in messina how about thatand the first ponytailand the first openly gay downtown merchantarent you proud of me nat was flipping his long black hair to show off his ponytail sure natyoure looking good nat was sizing him up from head to toe his eyes flashing as if hed been guzzling espresso for hours hows your knee he asked glancing around as if the injury was a secret gone for good nat sonofabitch hit you late i saw it nat had the authority of someone standing on the sideline that day at tech a long time ago natin another life how about some coffeei got some stuff from guatemala that gives one helluva buzz they wove through shelves and racks to the rear where an impromptu cafe materialized nat walked almost ran behind a cluttered counter and began slinging utensils neely straddled a stool and watched nothing nat did was graceful they say hes got less than twentyfour hours nat said rinsing a small pot rumors are always reliable around here especially about rake no this came from someone inside the house the challenge in messina was not to have the latest rumor but to have the best source wanna cigar i got some smuggled cubans another great buzz no thanks i dont smoke nat was pouring water into a large italianmade machine what kinda work you doing he asked over his shoulder real estate man thats original pays the billspretty cool store you have here nat curry tells me youre doing well im just trying to breathe some culture into this desert paul loaned me thirty thousand bucks to get started can you believe that i had nothing but an idea and eight hundred bucks and of course my mother was willing to sign the note hows she doing great thanks she refuses to agestill teaching the third grade when the coffee was brewing properly nat leaned next to the small sink and stroked his bushy mustache rakes gonna dieneely can you believe thatmessina without eddie rake he started coaching here fortyfour years ago half the people in this county werent born then have you seen him he was in here a lot but when he got sick he went home to die nobodys seen rake in six months neely glanced aroundrake was here rake was my first customer he encouraged me to open this place gave me the standard pep talkhave no fear work harder than the other guy never say diethe usual halftime rahrah when i opened he liked to sneak down here in the mornings for coffee guess he figured he was safe because there wasnt exactly a crowd most of the yokels thought theyd catch aids when they walked in the front door when did you open seven and a half years ago couldnt pay the light bill for the first two years then it slowly came around rumor spread that this was rakes favorite place so the town got curious i think the coffees ready neely said as the machine hissed i never saw rake read a book nat poured two small cups on saucers and placed them on the counter smells potent neely said it ought to require a prescription rake asked me one day what he might like to read i gave him a raymond chandler he came back the next day and asked for another he loved the stuff then i gave him dashiell hammett then he went nuts over elmore leonard i open ateight one of the very few bookstores to do so and once or twice a week rake would come in early wed sit in the corner over there and talk about books never football or politics never gossipjust books he loved the detective stories when we heard the bell ring on the front door he would sneak out the back and go home why nat took a long sip of coffee with the small cup disappearing into the depths of his unruly mustache we didnt talk about it much rake was embarrassed because he got sacked like that he has enormous pride something he taught us but he also felt responsible for scottys death a lot of people blamed him and they always will thats some serious baggage man you like the coffee very strongyou miss him another slow siphow can you not miss rake once youve played for him i see his face every day i hear his voice i can smell him sweating i can feel him hitting me with no pads on i can imitate his growl his grumblinghis bitching i remember his stories his speecheshis lessons i remember all forty plays and all thirtyeight games when i wore the jersey my father died four years ago and i loved him dearly but and this is hard to say he had less influence on me than eddie rake nat paused in midthought just long enough to pour more coffee later when i opened this place and got to know him as something other than a legend when i wasnt worried about getting screamed at for screwing up i grew to adore the old fart eddie rakes not a sweet man but he is human he suffered greatly after scottys death and he had no one to turn to he prayed a lot went to mass every morning i think fiction helped him it was a new world he got lost in books hundreds of them maybe thousandsa quick sipi miss him sitting over there talking about books and authors so he wouldnt have to talk about football the bell on the front door rattled softly in the distance nat shrugged it off and said theyll find us you want a muffin or something no i ate at renfrows everythings the same there same grease same menu same flies same bubbas sitting around bitchin cause the team aint undefeated yepyou go to the games nawwhen youre the only openly gay dude in a town like this you dont enjoy crowds people stare and point and whisper and grab their children and while im used to it id rather avoid the scene and id either go alone which is no fun or id take a date which would stop the game can you imagine me walking in with some cute boy holding hands theyd stone us howd you manage to come out of the closet in this town nat put the coffee down and thrust his hands deep into the pockets of his highly starched and pressed jeans not here man after we graduated i sort of migrated to dc where it didnt take me long to figure out who i am and what i am i didnt sneak out of the closetneely i kicked the damned door down i got a job in a bookstore and learned the business i lived the wild life for five years had a ball but then i got tired of the city frankly i got homesick my dads health was declining and i needed to come home i had a long talk with rake i told him the truth eddie rake was the first person here i confided in what was his reaction he said he didnt know much about gay people but if i knew who i was then to hell with everybody else go live your life son he said some folksll hate you some folksll love youmost folks havent made up their minds its up to you sounds like rake he gave me the courage man then he convinced me to open this place and when i was sure i had made a huge blunder rake started hanging around here and word spreadjust a second dont leave nat loped away toward the front where an elderly lady was waiting he called her by name in a voice that couldnt have been sweeter and soon they were lost in a search for a book neely walked around the counter and pouredhimself another cup of the brew when nat returned he said that was mrs underwood used to run the cleaners i remember a hundred ten years old and she likes erotic westerns go figure you learn all sorts of good stuff when you run a bookshop she figures she can buy from me because i have secrets of my own plus at a hundred and ten she probably doesnt give a damn anymore nat put a massive blueberry muffin on a plate and laid it on the counter dig in he said breaking it in halfneely picked up a small piece you bake this stuffneely asked every morningi buy it frozen bake it in the oven nobody knows the difference not bad you ever see cameron nat stopped chewing and gaveneely a quizzical look why should you be curious about cameron you guys were friendsjust wondering i hope your conscience still bothers you it does good i hope its painful maybesometimes we write letters shes fine living in chicagomarried two little girls again why do you ask i cant ask about one of our classmates there were almost two hundred in our class why is she the first youve asked about please forgive me no i want to know come onneely why ask about cameron neely put a few crumbs of the muffin in his mouth and waited he shrugged and smiled and said okay i think about her do you think about screamer how could i forget you went with the bimbo instant gratification but in the long run it was a bad choice i was young and stupid i admit sure was fun though you were the ailamericanneely you had your pick of any girl in the school you dumped cameron because screamer was hot to trot i hated you for it come on nat really i hated your guts cameron was a close friend from kindergarten before you came to town she knew i was different and she always protected me i tried to protect her but she fell for you and that was a huge mistake screamer decided she wanted the allamerican the skirts got shorter blouses tighter and you were toast my beloved cameron got thrown aside sorry i brought this up yeah man lets talk about something else for a long quiet moment there was nothing to talk about wait till you see her nat said pretty good huh screamer looks like an aging highdollar call girl which she probably is cameron is nothing but class you think shell be here probablymiss lila taught her piano forever neely had nowhere to go but he glanced at his watch anywaygotta run nat thanks for the coffee thanks for coming byneely a real treat they zigzagged through the racks and shelves toward the front of the storeneely stopped at the door look some of us are gathering in the bleachers tonight sort of a vigil i guess he saidbeer and war stories why dont you stop by id like that nat said thanks neely opened the door and started out nat grabbed his arm and said neely i lied i never hated you you should have nobody hated youneely you were our ailamerican those days are over nat no not till rake dies tell cameron id like to see her i have something to say the secretary smiled efficiently and slid a clipboard across the counter neely printed his name the time and the date and put down that he was visiting bing albritton the longtime girls basketball coach the secretary examined the form did not recognize either his face or his name and finally said hes probably in the gym the other lady in the administration office glanced up and she too failed to recognize neely crenshaw and that was fine with him the halls of messina high school werequiet the classroom doors were all closedsame lockers same paint colorsame floors hardened and shiny with layers of waxsame sticky odor of disinfectant near the rest rooms if he stepped into one he knew he would hear the same water dripping smell the same smoke of a forbidden cigarette see the same row of stained urinals probably see the same fight between two punks he kept to the hallways where he passed miss arnetts algebra class and with a quick glance through the narrow window in the door he caught a glimpse of his former teacher certainly fifteen years older sitting on the corner of the same desk teaching the same formulas had it really been fifteen years for a moment he felt eighteen again just a kid who hated algebra and hated english and needed nothing those classrooms had to offer because he would make his fortune on the football field the rush and flurry of fifteen years passing made him dizzy for a second a janitor passed an ancient gentleman whod been cleaning the building since it was built for a split second he seemed to recognizeneely then he looked away and grunted a soft mornin the main entrance of the school opened into a large modern atrium that had been built whenneely was a sophomore the atrium connected the two older buildings that comprised the high school and led to the entrance of the gymnasium the walls were lined with senior class pictures dating back to the s basketball was a secondlevel sport at messina but because of football the town had grown so accustomed to winning that it expected a dynasty from every team in the late seventies rake had proclaimed that the school needed a new gym a bond issue passed by ninety percent and messina had proudly built the finest high school basketball arena in the state its entrance was nothing but a hall of fame the centerpiece was a massive and very expensive trophy case in which rake had carefully arranged his thirteen little monuments thirteen state titles from to behind each was a large team photo with a list of the scores and headlines blown up and mounted in a collage there were signed footballs and retired jerseys including number and there were lots of pictures of rakerake with johnny unitas at some offseason function rake with a governor here and a governor there rake with roman armstead just after a packers game for a few minutesneely was lost in the exhibit though hed seen it many times it was at once a glorious tribute to a brilliant coach and his dedicated players and a sad reminder of what used to be he once heard someone say that the lobby of the gym was the heart and soul of messina it was more of a shrine to eddie rake an altar where his followers could worship other display cases ran along the walls leading to the doors of the gym more signed footballs from less successful yearssmaller trophies from less important teams for the first time and hopefully the lastneely felt a twinge of regret for those messina kids who had trained and succeeded and gone unnoticed because they played a lesser sport football was king and that would never change it brought the glory and paid the bills and that was that a loud bell one that sounded so familiar erupted nearby and joltedneely back to the reality that he was trespassing fifteen years after his time he headed back through the atrium only to be engulfed in the fury and throng of a latemorning class change the halls were alive with students pushing yelling slamming lockers releasing the hormones and testosterone that had been suppressed for the past fifty minutes no one recognizedneely a large muscled player with a very thick neck almost bumped into him he wore a greenandwhite spartan lettermans jacket a status symbol with no equal in messina he had the customary strut of someone who owned the hall which he did if only briefly he commanded respect he expected to be admired the girls smiled at him the other boys gave him room come back in a few years big boy and they will not know your name neely thought your fabulous career will be a footnote all the cute little girls will be mothers the green jacket will still be a source of great personal pride but you wont be able to wear ithigh school stuffkids stuff why was it so important back then neely suddenly felt very old he ducked through the crowd and left the school late in the afternoon he drove slowly along a narrow gravel road that wrapped around karrs hill when the shoulder widened he pulled over and parked below him an eighth of a mile away was the spartan field house and in the distance to his right were the two practice fields where the varsity was hitting in full pads on one while the jv ran drills on the other coaches whistled and barked on rake field rabbit rode a greenandyellow john deere mower back and forth across the pristine grass something he did every day from march until december the cheerleaders were on the track behind the home bench painting signs for the war on friday night and occasionally practicing some new maneuvers in the far end zone the band was assembling itself for a quick rehearsal little had changed different coaches different players different cheerleaders different kids in the band but it was still the spartans at rake field with rabbit on the mower and everybody nervous about friday ifneely came back in ten years and witnessed the scene he knew that the people and the place would look the same another year another team another season it was hard to believe that eddie rake had been reduced to sitting very near whereneely was now sitting and watching the game from so far away that he needed a radio to know what was happening did he cheer for the spartans or did he secretly hope they lost every game just for spite rake had a mean streak and could carry a grudge for years neely had never lost herehis freshman team went undefeated which was of course expected in messina the freshmen played on thursday nights and drew more fans than most varsities the two games he lost as a starter were both in the state finals both on the campus at am his eighth grade team had tied porterville at home and that was as close asneely had come to losing a football game in messina the tie had prompted coach rake to charge into their dressing room and deliver a harsh postgame lecture on the meaning of spartan pride after he terrorized a bunch of thirteenyearolds he replaced their coach the stories kept coming back asneely watched the practice field having no desire to relive them he left a man delivering a fruit basket to the rake home heard the whispers and before long the entire town knew that the coach had drifted away so far that he would never return at dusk the gossip reached the bleachers where small groups of players from different teams in different decades had gathered to wait a few sat alone deep in their own memories of rake and glory that had vanished so long ago paul curry was back in jeans and a sweatshirt and with two large pizzas mona had made and sent so the boys could be boys for the night silo mooney was there with a cooler of beer hubcap was missing which was never a surprise the utley twins ronnie and donnie from out in the county had heard thatneely was back fifteen years earlier they had been identical pound linebackers each of whom could tackle an oak tree when it was dark they watched as rabbit made his trek to the scoreboard and flipped on the lights on the southwest pole rake was still alive though barely long shadows fell across rake field and the former players waited the joggers were gone the place was still laughter rose occasionally from one of the groups scattered throughout the home bleachers as someone told an old football story but for the most part the voices were low rake was unconscious now the end was near nat sawyer found them he had something in a large carrying case you got drugs there nat silo asked nopecigars silo was the first to light up a cuban then nat then paul and finallyneely the utley twins neither drank nor smoked youll never guess what i found nat said a girlfriendsilo said shut up silo nat opened the case and removed a large cassette tape player a boom box great some jazz just what i wanted silo said nat held up a cassette tape and announced this is buck coffey doing the championship game no way paul said yepi listened to it last night first time in years ive never heard it paul said i didnt know they recorded the games silo said lotta things you dont know silo nat said he put the tape in the slot and began fiddling with the dials if its okay with you guys i thought wed just skip the first half evenneely managed a laugh hed thrown four interceptions and fumbled once in the first half the spartans were down to a wonderfully gifted team from east pike the tape began and the slow raspy voice of buck coffey cut through the stillness of the bleachers buck coffey here at halftime folks on the campus ofam in what was supposed to be an evenly matched game between two unbeaten teams not so east pike leads in every category except penalties and turnovers the score is thirtyone to nothing ive been calling messina spartan games for the past twentytwo years and i cannot remember being this far behind at halftime wheres buck nowneely asked he quit when they sacked rake paul said nat turned up the volume slightly and bucks voice carried even farther it acted as a magnet for the other players from the other teams randy jaeger and two of his teammates from came over jon couch the lawyer and blanchard teague the optometrist were back in their jogging shoes with four others from the era of the streak a dozen more moved close the teams are back on the field and well pause for a word from our sponsors i cut out all that crap from the sponsors nat said good said paul youre such a smart boy silo said im looking at the messina sideline and i dont see coach rake in fact none of the coaches are on the field the teams are lining up for the second half kickoff and the spartan coaches are nowhere to be seen this is very strange to say the least where were the coaches someone asked silo shrugged but didnt answer and that was the great question that had been asked and left unanswered for fifteen years in messina it had been obvious that the coaches boycotted the second half but why east pike is kicking to the south end zone heres the kick its short and taken by marcus mabry on the eighteen zigs one way back the other cuts upfield has some room and is tackled at the thirtyyard line where the spartans will attempt to generate some offense for the first time tonight neely crenshaw was just three for fifteen in the first half east pike caught more of hispasses than the spartans did asshole someone said i thought he was on our side always but he liked us better when we were winning just wait nat said still no sign of eddie rake or the other coachesthis is very bizarre spartans break huddle and crenshaw sets his offense curry wide right mabry is the iback east pike has eight men in the box just daring crenshaw to throw the ball heres the snap option right crenshaw fakes the pitch cuts upfield sees some daylight hit hard spins breaks a tackle and hes loose at the forty the fortyfive the fifty and out of bounds at the east pike fortyone a pickup of twentynine yards the best play of the game for the spartan offense maybe theyre coming to life man those guys hit silo said quietly they had five division one signees paul said reliving the nightmare of the first halffour on defense you dont have to remind me neely said this spartan team is finally awake theyre yelling at each other as they huddle and the sideline is really fired up now here they come crenshaw points to his left and curry spreads widemabry in the slot now in motion the snap quick pitch to mabry who scoots around left end for six maybe seven yards and the spartans are really wired now theyre yanking each other off the turf slapping each other on the helmets and of course silo mooney is jawing with at least three of the east pike playersalways a good sign what were you saying silo i was telling them that they were about to get their asses kicked you were down thirtyone points yep paul said its true we heard him after that second play silo started the trashtalking second and threecrenshaw in the shotgunthe snap a quick draw to mabry who hits hard spins turns upfield to the thirty the twenty and out of bounds at the east pike sixteen three plays fiftyfour yards and the spartan offensive line is really moving people off the ball first down spartansin the first half they had only five and only fortysix yards rushing crenshaw is calling his own plays now nothing from the sideline because there are no coaches over there slot left with curry wide mabry in the i chenault in motion option right the fake the pitch to mabry whos hit at the line runs over the linebacker and slams down to the tenyard line clock is ticking tenohfive left in the third quarter messina is ten yards from a touchdown and a thousand miles from a state title first and goal crenshaw drops back to pass a draw to mabry whos hit in the backfield shakes loose scoots wide to the right theres nobody there hes gonna score hes gonna score and marcus mabry dives in for the first messina touchdown touchdown spartans the comeback has begun jon couch said when we scored i remember thinking nice to have a touchdown but theres no way we can come back on these guys east pike was too good nat turned the volume down and said they fumbled the kickoff didnt they donnie yep hindu stripped the ball on about the fifteen we were swarming like hornets it bounced around for about five minutes and finally rolled out of bounds at the twenty ronnie they ran the tailback offtackle right no gain offtackle left no gain third and eleven they dropped back to pass silo sacked the quarterback on the sixyard line donnie unfortunately in doing so he stuffed him into the ground headfirst fifteen yards unsportsmanlike conduct first down east pike silo it was a bad call paul bad call you tried to break his neck silo no dear banker i tried to kill him ronnie we were out of our minds silo was growling like a wounded grizzly bear hindu i swear was crying he wanted to blitz from safety on every play just so he could be sure he hit someone donnie we could have stopped the dallas cowboys blanchard who was calling the defense silo me it was simpleman coverage on the wideouts knock down the tight end eight guys in the box everyone blitzedeveryone hit somebody clean or not didnt matter it wasnt a game anymore it was a war donnie on third and eight higgins that cocky flanker who went to clemson cut across the middle on a slant the pass was high hindu read it perfectly came across like a bullet train and hit him a split second before the ball got there pass interference paul his helmet went twenty feet in the air couch we were forty rows up and it sounded like two cars hitting silo we celebrated wed killed one of emgot a flag for that too ronnie two flags thirty yards we didnt care they werent going to score didnt matter where they put the ball blanchard you guys were convinced they couldnt score silo no team couldve scored on us in that second half when they finally carried higgins off the field on a stretcher i might add the ball was on our thirtyyard line they ran a sweep that lost six yards a draw that lost four then their little quarterback went to the shotgun again and we just mauled him nat their punter dropped one on the threeyard line silo yeah they had a good punter we of course had you nat turned up the volume ninetyseven yards to go for the spartans just under eight minutes left in the third quarter still no sign of eddie rake or any of the spartan coaches i watched crenshaw when east pike had the ball he kept his right hand in a bucket of ice the entire time and he kept his helmet on handoff left side to mabry who doesnt get much both defenses are simply sending everybody which should set up the pass silo not from the threeyard line dumbass paul coffey always wanted to coach pitch right side mabry bobbles the ball then cuts upfield got some room wide and hes out of bounds along the ten couch just curiousneely do you know what you called next neely sure option right i read the option faked to chenault faked the pitch to hubcap cut upfield for eleven yards the offensive line was chopping people down first and ten spartans who break huddle and sprint to the line of scrimmagethis is a different team folks paul i dont know why buck was on the radio nobody was listening the entire town was at the game randy no youre wrong everybody was listening in the second half we were trying to find out what happened to coach rake so all the messina fans had their radios stuck to their heads handoff to chenault who plows straight ahead for three or fourhe basically just lowered his helmet and followed silo mooney who is being doubleteamed silo just two i was insulted the second guy was this little nastyfaced bastard weighed about oneeighty or so thought he was badcame in the game trashtalking hell leave the field in just a minute pitch to mabry wide right again and hes got some room up to the thirty and out of bounds an east pike youngster is shaken up on the field silo thats him blanchard whatd you do silo the play swept right away from us i chopblocked him got him on the groundthen dropped a knee into his stomach squealed like a pig he lasted for three plays never came back paul they couldve flagged us for unnecessary roughness on every play offense or defense neely while they dragged him off the field chenault tells me that their left tackle is not moving too well got something wrong a twisted ankle maybe the guys in pain but wont leave the game so we ran at him five straight times same play six seven yards a pop with marcus low to the ground just looking for someone to run over id hand the ball off and watch the carnage silo turn it up nat first and ten on the east pike thirtyeight the spartans are moving the ball but theyre sure eating up the clock not a single pass so far in the second half six minutes to go curry in motion left the snap option right the pitch to mabry who swings outside to the thirty the twentyfive all the way down to the east pikeeighteen and the spartans are knocking at the door neely after every play mabry sprinted back to the huddle and said gimme the ball bro just gimme the ball so we did paul and afterneely called every play silo would say you fumble it and ill break your neck silo i wasnt kidding either blanchard were you guys aware of the clock neely yeah but it didnt matter we knew we would win mabry has carried the ball twelve times already in the second half for seventyeight yards heres a quick snap right side again not much there the spartans are really hammering away at the left side of the east pike defense mabry just follows durston and vatrano and of course silo mooney is always around the pileup silo i loved buck coffey neely didnt you date his youngest daughter silo i wouldnt call it dating buck damned sure didnt know anything about it second and eight from the sixteen mabry again off the right side for three maybe four and its a dogfight down there in the trenches folks silo its always a dogfight buck thats why they call it the trenches in the semidarkness the fraternity had quietly grown larger other players had eased over or slid down the bleachers close enough to hear the playbyplay third and four curry wide full backfield option right crenshaw keeps is hit falls forward for maybe two he really got nailed by devon bond neely devon bond hit me so many times i felt like a punching bag silo he was the one player i couldnt do anything with id fire off the ball have a perfect shot at him and hed just vanish that or hed hit me a forearm that would rattle my teeth he was one bad dude donnie didnt he make a roster paul steelers for a couple of years then some injuries sent him back to east pike a fourth and two that is beyond huge folksspartans must score here because they have a lot more scoring to do and the clock is really moving now three minutes and forty seconds full house now chenault in motion left long countby crenshaw and they jump east pike jumps offside first and goal spartans on the fiveyard line crenshaw gave it the old head fake and got by with it silo head fake my ass paul it was all in the cadence blanchard i remember their coach going crazy charging the field neely he got a flaghalf the distance silo that guy was psycho and the more we scored the louder he screamed first and goal from the two and a halfoption left here comes the pitch marcus mabry is hit drives and falls into the end zone touchdown spartans touchdown bucks voice carried even farther through the still night rabbit at some point heard it and crept into the shadows down the track to investigate the noise he saw a crowd sitting and halflying haphazardly up in the bleachers he saw bottles of beer smelled the smoke from the cigars in another era he would have taken charge and ordered everyone away from the field but those were rakes boys up there the chosen few they were waiting for the lights to go off if he got closer he could call each one by name and number and he could remember the exact location of their lockers rabbit slipped through the metal braces under the bleachers and hid below the players listening silo neely called for an onside kick and it almost worked the ball bounced around and got touched by every damned player on the field until some guy with the wrong jersey finally found a handle ronnie they ran twice for two yardsthen tried a long pass that hindu broke up three and out except that hindu leveled the receiver out of boundsunnecessary roughnessfirst down donnie it was a horrible call blanchard we went crazy in the stands randy my father almost threw his radio on the field silo we didnt care they werent going to score ronnie they went three and out again couch wasnt the punt return somewhere around here nat first play of the fourth quarter he turned up the volume east pike back to punt on the messina fortyone the snap a low hard kick taken on the bounce by paul curry at the five wide to the right to the ten cuts backhes got a wall a perfect wall to the twenty thirty forty cuts back across midfield picks up a block from marcus mabry to the forty the thirty along the far sideline hes got blockers everywhere to the ten five four two touchdown touchdown spartans a ninetyfiveyardpunt return nat turned the volume down so they could savor one of the greatest moments in spartan football history the punt return had been executed with textbook precision every block and every move choreographed by eddie rake during endless hours of practice when paul curry danced into the end zone he was escorted by six green jerseys just the way theyd been drilled we all meet in the end zone rake had screamed over and over two east pike players were down victims of vicious but legal blindside blocks that rake had taught them in the ninth grade punt returns are perfect for killing people hed said over and over paul lets listen to it again silo once is enoughsame ending after the field was cleared east pike took the following kickoff and began a drive that would consume six minutes for one brief period in the second half they used their superior talent to chew up sixty yards though every inch was contested their seamless execution of the first half was long gone replaced by stutter steps and uncertainty the sky was falling one massive choke was under way and they were powerless to stop it every handoff drew a furious attack from all eleven defenders every short pass ended with the receiver crumpled on the ground there was no time for long passes silo could not be contained on fourth and two from the messina twentyeight east pike foolishly went for the first down the quarterback faked a pitch to the left bootlegged to the right looking for the tight end the tight end however had been mauled at the line by donnie utley whose twin was blitzing like a mad dog ronnie caught the quarterback from behind stripped the ball like hed been taught flung him to the ground and the spartans trailing were in business with five thirtyfive to go in the game theres something wrong withneelys right hand not a single pass attempt in the second half when the defense is on the field he keeps it buried in an ice bucket east pike has it figured outtheyre in man coverage on the wideouts everybody else is packed along the line of scrimmage jaeger it was broken wasnt it paul yes it was broken neely just nodded jaeger howd you break itneely silo a lockerroom incident neely was silent first and ten from the spartan thirtynine curry wide right motion left pitch right side to marcus mabry who gets four maybe five very tough yards devon bond is all over the fieldmust be a linebackers dream not worrying about pass coverage just stalking the football spartans huddle quickly sprint to the line they can hear the clockquick snap dive to chenault right behind silo mooney who is just slaughtering people in the middle of field silo i like thatslaughtering donnie that was putting it mildly frank missed a block on a sweep and silo punched him in the huddle neely he didnt punch him he slapped him the referee started to throw a flag but he wasnt sure if you could be penalized for roughing up your own teammates silo he shouldnt have missed the block third and one at the fortyeight fourtwenty to go in the game spartans are back at the line before east pike is set quick snap neely rolling right a keeper across the fifty to the fortyfive and out of bounds first down and the clock will stop the spartans need two touchdowns theyll have to start using the sidelines silo go for it buck why dont you just call the plays donnie im sure he knew them randy hell everybody knew them they didnt change in over thirty years couch we ran the same plays you guys were running against east pike mabry off tackle again for four yards hit hard by devon bond and the safety armondo butler a real headhunter they have no fear of the pass so theyre really loading up against the run double tight end set chenault in motion right option left pitch to mabry who spins forward keeps chugging somehow picks up three itll be third and three now another big play but theyre all big now clocks countingunder four minutes to playball at the thirtyeight curry sprints from the huddle wide left split backfield neely drops back into the shotgun the snap he rolls right looking looking theres pressure and off he goes to the far side and hes nailed by devon bond a really nasty helmet to helmet collision andneely is slow getting up neely i couldnt see ive never been hit that hard and for thirty seconds or so i couldnt see paul we didnt want to waste a timeout so we yanked him up got him to his feetsorta dragged him back to the huddle silo i slapped him too and that really helped neely i dont remember that paul it was fourth and one neely was in lala land so i called the play what can i say im a genius fourth and one spartans are slow coming to the line crenshaw doesnt feel too well right now doesnt look too steadyhuge playhuge play this could be the ballgame folks east pike has nine men on the linedouble tight ends no wideouts crenshaw finds the center long snap quick pitch to mabry who stops jumps shovels a pass across the middle to heath dorcekwhos wide open to the thirty the twenty hit at the ten stumbles and falls down to the three first and goal spartans paul it was the ugliest pass ever thrown in organized football end over end a dying duck man was it beautiful silo gorgeous dorcek couldnt catch the flu thats whyneely never threw to him nat ive never seen anyone run so slow just a big lumbering buffalo silo he could outrun your ass neely the play took forever and when heath came back to the huddle he had tears in his eyes paul i looked atneely and he said call a play i remember looking at the clockthree forty to go and we had to score twice i said lets do it now not on third down silo said run it up my back only three yards from the promised land folks and here come the spartans hustling to the line quick set quick snap crenshaw on a keeper and he walks into the end zone silo mooney and barry vatrano bulldozed the entire center of the east pike line touchdown spartans touchdown spartans they will not be denied thirtyone to twentyseven unbelievable blanchard i remember you guys huddled together before you kicked off the entire teamalmost got a delay of game there was a long pause finally silo spoke silo we were taking care of businesshad some secrets to protect couch secrets about rake silo yep couch doesnt he show up about now paul we werent watching but at some point after we kicked off word spread down the sideline that rake was back we spotted him at the edge of the end zone just standing there with the other four coaches still wearing their green sweatshirts hands in pockets watching nonchalantly as if they were the grounds crew or something we hated the sight of them nat it was us versus them we didnt care about east pike blanchard ill never forget that sightrake and his assistants at the edge of the field looking like a bunch of whores in church at the time we didnt know why they were over there still dont i guess paul they were told to stay away from our sideline blanchard by whom paul the team blanchard but why nat reached for the volume buck coffeys voice was beginning to crack as the excitement took its toll to compensate for the fading strength and clarity buck was just getting louder when east pike walked to the line on first down buck was practically yelling into his microphone ball on the eighteen clock still at three twentyfive to go east pike has a grand total of three first downs and sixtyone yards of offense in the second half everything theyve tried has been stuffed down their throats by an inspired bunch of spartans a magnificent turnaround the gutsiest performance ive seen in twentytwo years of calling spartan football silo go for it buck handoff right side for one maybe two yardseast pike is not sure what to do right now theyd love to burn some clock but they need to get some first downs three minutes ten seconds and the clockis running messina with all three timeouts left and theyre gonna need them east pike really dragging now slow to the huddle slow with the play from the sidelines play clock down to twelve they break huddle slow to the linefour three two one the snap pitch right to barnaby who scoots around the corner for five maybe sixa big third down now third and three on the twentyfive with the clock moving a car rolled to a stop near the gate it was white with words painted on the doors i guess mals back someone said the sheriff took his time getting out stretchedsurveyed the field and the stands then he lit a cigarette the flicker of the lighter visible thirty rows up on the fortyyard line silo shoulda brought more beer spartans dig inwideouts right and left in the shotgun waddell takes the snap fakes right then throws left ball is caught at the thirtytwo on quick slant by gaddy who is slammed down to the ground by hindu aiken first down eastpike and theyre moving the chains two forty to go and the spartans need somebody on the sideline to start making some decisions theyre playing without coaches down there folks blanchard who was making decisions paul after they got the first downneely and i decided wed better burn a timeout silo i took the defense to the sideline and the whole team gathered around everyone was screaming i get goose bumps thinking about it now neely volume nat before silo starts crying first down at the thirtytwoeast pike breaks huddle in no hurry split backfield wide right the snap waddell back to pass looking right and he connects on a downandout at the thirtyeight the receiver did not go out of bounds and the clock is moving at two twentyeight two twentyseven from the gate mal brown smoked his cigarette and studied the crowd of exspartans sprawled loosely together in the center of the bleachers he could hear the radio and he recognized buck coffeys voice but he could not tell what game they were listening to he had a hunch though he puffed and looked for rabbit somewhere in the shadows east pike at the line with a second and four two minutes fourteen seconds to go in the gamequick pitch left to barnaby and he cannot go hit hard at the line byboth utleys ronnie and donnie blitzing through every gap it seems they hit him first and the entire team piled on the spartans are ina frenzy down there but theyd better be careful there was almost a late hit silo late hit unnecessary roughness half a dozen personal fouls take your pick buck they couldve flagged us on every play ronnie silo was biting people third and four under two minuteseast pike stalling as much as they can as the clock ticks away back at the line all eleven spartans are waiting do you run and get stuffed or do you pass and get sacked thats the choice for east pike they cannot move the ball waddell is back its a screen and the ballis knocked down by donnie utley clock stops fourth and four east pike will have to punt one minute fifty seconds to play and the spartans will get the ball mal was walking slowly around the track with another cigarette they watched him get nearer paul the last punt return worked so we decided to try it again a low punt a line drive that hits on the forty takes a big bounce and then another alonzo taylor scoops it at the thirtyfive and he has nowhere to go flags everywhere could be a clip paul could be hindu drilled a guy dead in the back the worst clip ive ever seen silo i started to break his neck neely i stopped you remember poor guy came to the sideline crying silo poor guy if i saw him now id remind him of that clip and so it comes down to this folks the spartans have the ball on their own nineteen eightyone yards to go with one minute and forty seconds left on the clockdown thirtyone to twentyeight crenshaw has two timeouts and no passing game paul couldnt pass with a broken hand the entire spartan team is huddled together on the sideline and it looks like theyre having a prayer mal was walking up the steps slowly with none of his customary purpose and banter nat stopped the tape and the bleachers were still boys mal said softly coach is gone rabbit materialized from the shadows and loped down the track they watched as he disappeared behind the scoreboard and a few seconds later the bank of lights on the southwest pole went off rake field was dark most of the spartans sitting quietly in the bleachers did not know messina without eddie rake and for the older ones who were very young when he arrived as an unknown and untested twentyeightyearold football coach his influence on the town was so overpowering that it was easy to assume hed always been there after all messina as a town didnt matter before rake it wasnt on the map the vigil was over the lights were off though they had been waiting for his impending death mals message hit them hard each of the spartans withdrew to his own memories for a few moments silo set his beer bottle down and began tapping both temples with his fingers paul curry rested his elbows on his knees and stared at the field at a spot somewhere around the fiftyyard line where his coach would storm and fuss and when a game was tight no one would get near him neely could see rake in the hospital room green messina cap in hand talking softly to his exallamerican concerned about his knee and his futureand trying to apologize nat sawyer bit his lip as his eyes began to moisten eddie rake meant much more to him after his football days thank god it was dark nat thought to himself but he knew there were other tears somewhere across the little valley from the direction of the town came the soft chimes of church bells messina was getting the news that it dreaded most blanchard teague spoke first i really want to finish this game weve been waiting for fifteen years paul we ran floodrightalonzo got about six or seven and made it out of bounds silo woulda scored but vatrano missed a block on a linebacker i told him id castrate him in the locker room if he missed another one paul they had everybody at the line i kept askingneely if he could throw anything even a little jump pass over the middle anything to loosen up their secondary neely i could barely grip the ball paul second down we swept left neely no second down we sent three wide and deep i dropped back to pass then tucked it and ran got sixteen yards but couldnt get out of bounds devon bond hit me again and i thought i was dead couch i remember that but he was slow getting up too neely i wasnt worried about him paul ball was on the forty about a minute to go didnt we sweep again nat to the left almost a first down and alonzo got out of bounds right in front of our bench neely then we tried the option pass again and alonzo threw it away almost got it picked off nat it was picked off but the safety had one foot over the line silo thats when i told you no more passes from alonzo couch what was it like in the huddle silo pretty tense but whenneely said shut up we shut up he kept tellin us we were stickin it down their throats that we were gonna win and as always we believed him nat the ball was on the fifty with fifty seconds to go neely i called a screen pass and it worked beautifully the pass rush was ferocious and i managed to shovel the ball to alonzo with my left hand nat it was beautiful he got hit in the backfield broke away and suddenly he had a wall of blockers silo thats when i got bond caught that sumbitch fightin off one block and not lookin buried my helmet in his left side and they carried him off neely that probably won the game blanchard the place was a madhouse thirtyfive thousand people screaming like idiots but we still heard the hit you put on bond silo it was legal i preferred the ones that were not legal but it was a bad time for a penalty paul alonzo picked up about twenty the clock stopped with the injury so we had some timeneely called three plays neely i didnt want to risk an interception or a fumble and the only way to spread the defense was to send the receivers wide and go from the shotgun on first down i scrambled for about ten nat eleven it was first down at the twentyone with thirty seconds to go neely with bond out of the game i knew i could score i figured two more scrambles and wed be in the end zone in the huddle i told them to make sure they put somebody on the ground silo i told em to kill somebody neely they blitzed all three linebackers and i got nailed at the line we had to burn our last timeout amos did you think about a field goal neely yeah but scobie had a weak legaccurate but weak paul plus he hadnt kicked a field goal all year silo the kicking game was not our strongest suit nat thanks silo i can always count on you the final play of the miracle drive was perhaps the most famous in all of the glorious history of spartan football with no timeouts twenty yards to go eighteen seconds leftneely sent two receivers wide and took the snap in the shotgun he quickly handed off to marcus mabry on a draw marcus took three steps then abruptly stopped and pitched the ball back toneely who sprinted to his right pumping the ball as if he would finally throw it when he turned upfield the offensive line released and sprinted forward looking for someone to level at the ten neely running like a mad man lowered his head and crashed into a linebacker and a safety a collision that would have knocked out a mere mortal he spun away free but dizzy legs still churning got hit again at the five and again at the three where most of the east pike defense managed to corral him the play was almost over as was the game whensilo mooney and barry vatrano slammed into the mass of humanity hanging onneely and the entire pile fell into the end zone neely sprang to his feet still clutching the ball and looked directly at eddie rake twenty feet away motionless and noncommittal neely for a split second i thought about spiking the ball at him but then silo flung me down and everybody jumped on nat the whole team was down therealong with the cheerleaders the trainers and half the bandgot fifteen yards for excessive celebrating couch nobody cared i remember looking at rake and the coaches and they didnt move talk about weird neely i was lying in the end zone getting crushed by my teammates telling myself that wed just done the impossible randy i was twelve years old and i remember all the messina fans were just sitting there stunned exhausted a lot of them crying blanchard the folks from east pike were crying too randy they ran one play didnt theyafter the kickoff paul yeah donnie blitzed and nailed the quarterback the game was over randy all of a sudden every player with a green jersey was sprinting off the fieldno handshakes no postgame huddle just a mad rush to get to the locker room the entire team vanished mal we thought yalld gone crazy we waited for a spell thinkin you had to come back to get the trophy and all paul we werent coming out they sent someone to retrieve us for the ceremony but we kept the door locked couch those poor kids from east pike tried to smile when they got the runnerup trophy but they were still in shock blanchard rake had vanished too somehow they got rabbit to walk out to midfield and accept the championship trophy it was very strange but we were too excited to care mal walked up to silos cooler and pulled out a beer helpyourself there sheriff silo said im off duty he took a long sip and began walking down the stepsfunerals friday boysat noon where herewhere else thursday neely and paul met early thursday morning in the rear of the bookstore where nat brewed another pot of his highly addictive and probably illegal guatemalan coffee nat had business up front near the tiny and semihidden occult section with a sinisterlooking woman who had pale skin and jetblack hair the town witch paul said somewhat proudly as if every town needed a witch and very softly as if she might fling a curse their way the sheriff arrived a few minutes after eight fully uniformed and heavily armed and looking quite lost in the only bookstore in the county and one owned by a homosexual at that had nat not been a former spartan mal wouldve probably had him under surveillance as a suspicious character you boys ready he growled obviously anxious to leave withneely in the front seat and paul in the back they sped away from downtown in a long white ford with bold lettering along the doors announcing that the car was the property of the sheriff on the main highway mal pushed the accelerator and flipped a switch turning on the flashing red and blue lights no sirens though once everything was properly configured he cocked his weight to one side picked up his tall styrofoam cup of coffee and laid a limp wrist over the top of the wheel they were doing a hundred miles an hour i was in vietnam mal announced selecting the topic and giving the impression that he might talk nonstop for the next two hours paul sank a few inches in the rear seat like a real criminal on the way to a court hearing neely watched the traffic certain they were about to be slaughtered in some gruesome twolane pileup i was on a pbr on the bassac river a loud slurp of coffee as the setting was established there were six of us on this stupid little boat about twice the size of a nice bass rig and our job was to patrol up and down the river and make trouble anythang that moved we shot it we were idiots a cow gets too close target practice a nosy rice farmer raises his head up from the ricepaddy wed start firin just to watch him hit the mud our mission each day had no tactical purpose whatsoever so we drank beer smoked pot played cards tried to entice the local girls to go boatin with us im sure this is going somewhere paul said from the rear shut up and listen one day were half asleep its hot were sunbathin nappin like a bunch of turtles on a log when suddenly all hell breaks loose were takin fire from both sides of the riverheavy firean ambush two guys were below im on the deck with three others all of whom get hit immediatelydead shot before they could get their gunsblood flyin through the aireverybody screamin im flat on my stomach unable to move when a fuel barrel gets hit damned thing wasnt supposed to be on deck but what did we care we were invincible because we were eighteen and stupid the thing explodes i manage to dive into the river without gettin burned i swim up beside the boat and grab a piece of camouflage nettin thats hangin over the side i hear my two buddies screamin inside the boat theyre trapped smoke and fire everywhere no way out i stay underwater as long as i can whenever i pop up for air the gooks spray gunfire all around meheavy gunfire they know im in the water holdin my breath this goes on for a long time while the boat burns and drifts with the current the screamin and coughin finally stops down in the cabin everbodys dead but me the gooks are out in the open now walkin along the banks on both sides out for a sunday strollall fun and games im the last guy alive and theyre waitin for me to make a mistake i swim under the boat pop up on the other side take some air bullets everywhere i swim to the rear grab the rudder for a while come up for airhear the gooks laughin as they spray me the river is full of snakes these short little bastards that are deadly poisonous so i figure i got three choicesdrown get shot or wait for the snakes mal placed the coffee in a holder on the dash and lit a cigarette mercifully he cracked his windowneely cracked his as well they were in farmland speeding through rolling hills flying past farm tractors and old pickups so what happened neely asked when it became apparent that mal wanted prompting you know what saved me tell us rakeeddie rake when i was hangin on for my life under that boat i didnt think about my momma or my dad or my girlfriend i thought about rake i could hear him barkin at us at the end of practice when we were runnin sprints i remembered his lockerroom speeches never quit never quit you win because youre tougher mentally than the other guy and youre tougher mentally because your trainin is superior if youre winnin never quit if youre losin never quit if youre hurt never quit a long pull on the cigarette while the two younger men digested the storymeanwhile outside the car civilian drivers swerved onto shoulders and hit brakes to make way for this law enforcement emergency i finally got hit in the leg did you know bullets can get you underwater never really thought about it neely admitted damned right they canleft hamstring i never felt such pain like a hot knife i almost passed out from the pain and i was gaspin for breath rake expected us to play hurt so i told myself rake was watchin rake was up there somewhere on the side of the river watchin to see how tough i was a long cancerous draw on the cigarette a halfhearted effort to blow the smoke out the windowa long pause as mal was lost in the horror of this memory a minute passed obviously you survived paul said anxious to get to the end of it i was lucky the other five got boxed up and shipped home the boat burned and burned and at times i couldnt hang on because the hull was so hot then the batteries exploded sounded like direct mortar hits and she started to sink i could hear the gooks laughin i could also hear rake in the fourth quarter time to suck it up and go men heres where we win or lose gut check gut check i can hear him too neely said all of a sudden the shootin stopped then i heard choppers two of them had seen the smoke and decided to explore they came in low scattered the gooks dropped a rope and i got out when they hauled me in i looked down and saw the boat burnin i saw two of my buddies lying on the deck burnt black i was in shock and finally passed out they told me later that when they asked me my name i said eddie rake neely glanced to his left as mal turned awayhis voice cracked just a littlethen he wiped his eyes no hands on the wheel for a couple of seconds so you came home paul said yeah that was the lucky part i got outta thereyou boys hungry no no evidently mal was he stomped the brake pedal while veering to the right onto a gravel lot in front of an old country store the ford fishtailed as mal brought it to a violent stop best damned biscuits in this part of the state he said as he yanked open his door and stepped out into a cloud of dust they followed him to the rear through a rickety screen door and into someones small and smoky kitchen four tables were packed close together all surrounded by rusticlooking gentlemen devouring ham and biscuits fortunately at least for mal who appeared to be ready to collapse from hunger there were three empty stools at the cluttered counter need some biscuits over here he growled at a tiny old woman hovering over a stove evidently menus were not needed with remarkable speed she served them coffee and biscuits with butter and sorghum molasses mal plunged into the first one a thick brownish concoction of lard and flour that weighed at least a pound neely on his left and paul on his right followed along heard you boys talkin last night up in the bleachers mal said shifting from vietnam to football he took a large bite and began chewing ferociouslyabout the game i was there so was everybody else we figured somethin happened at halftime in the locker room some kind of altercation between you and rakenever heard the real story you know cause you boys never talked about it you could call it an altercation neely said still prepping his first and only biscuit no ones ever talked about it paul said so what happened an altercation got thatrakes dead now so so its been fifteen years i wanna know the story mal said as if he were drilling a murder suspect in the back room of the jail neely put the biscuit on his plate and stared at it then he glanced over at paul who nodded go ahead you can finally tell the story neely sipped his coffee and ignored the food he stared at the counter and drifted away we were down thirtyone to zip just getting the hell beaten out of us he said slowly and very softly i was there mal said chewing without interruption we got to the locker room at halftime and waited for rake we waited and waited knowing that we were about to be eaten alive he finally walked in with the other coaches he was way beyond furious we were terrified he walked straight up to me pure hatred in his eyes i had no idea what to expect he said youmiserable excuse for a football player i said thanks coach as soon as i got the words out he took his left hand and backhanded me across the face it sounded like a wooden bat hitting a baseball paul said he too had lost interest in the food that broke your nose mal said still quite interested in his breakfast yep whatd you do by instinct i swung i didnt know if he planned to hit me again and i wasnt about to wait so i threw a right hook with everything i could put into itcaught him perfectly on the left jaw flush to the face it wasnt a right hook paul said it was a bomb rakes head jerked like hed beenshot and he fell like a bag of cement knocked him out coldcoach upchurch rushed forward yelling cussing like he was going to finish me off neely said i couldnt seethere was blood all over my face silo stepped up and grabbed upchurch by the throat with both hands paul said he lifted him up threw him against the wall said hed kill him right there if he made another move rake was dead on the floor snake thomas and rabbit and one of the trainers were squatting beside him it was chaos for a few secondsthen silo threw upchurch to the floor and told all of them to get out of the locker room thomas said something and silo kicked him in the ass they dragged rake out of the room and we locked the door for some reason i was crying and i couldnt stop neely said mal had stopped eating all three were staring straight ahead at the little lady by the stove we found some ice paul continuedneely said his hand was broken his nose was bleeding like crazy he was delirious silo was screaming at the team it was a pretty wild scene mal slurped down some coffee then tore off a piece of a biscuit which he dragged across his plate as if he might eat it or he might not neely was lying on the floor ice on his nose ice on his hand blood running down his ears we hated rake like no man has ever been hated we wanted to kill somebody and those poor boys from east pike were the nearest targets after a long pauseneely said silo knelt beside me and yelled get your ass up mr ailamerican we gotta score five touchdowns whenneely got up we stormed out of the locker room rabbit poked his head out of a door and the last thing i heard was silo yelling at him keep those sumbitches away from our sideline hindu threw a bloody towel at him neely said still softly late in the fourth quarter neely and silo got the team together by the bench and told us that after the game we were running back to the locker room locking the door and not coming out until the crowd was gone and we did we waited in there for a long time neely said it took an hour just to settle down the door opened behind them as one group of locals left while another trooped in and yall never talked about it mal asked no we agreed to bury it neely said until now i guess rakes dead it doesnt matter anymore why was it such a secret we were afraid thered be trouble paul said we hated rake but he was still rake hed punched a player and not just anybody neelys nose was still bleeding after the game and we were so emotional neely said i think all fifty of us were crying when the game was over wed just pulled off a miracle against impossible oddswith no coachesnothing but sheer guts just a bunch of kids whod survived under enormous pressure we decided it would be our secret silo went around the room looked every player in the eyes and demanded a vow of silence said hed kill anyone who ever told paul said with chuckle mal skillfully poured a pint of molasses over his next target thats a good story i figured as much paul said the odd part is that the coaches never talked about it either rabbit kept his mouth shuttotal silence chomp chomp then we sorta figured it out mal saidknew something bad happened at halftime neely couldnt pass then wordleaked that he was wearing a cast the next week at school figured he hit something figured it mightve been rake lots of rumors over the years which as you know aint hard to find in messina ive never heard anyone talk about it paul said a pull on the coffeeneitherneely nor paul were eating or drinking remember that tugdale kid from out near black rocka year or two behind you boys andy tugdale neely saidhundredandfortypound guard mean as a yard dog thats him we picked him up years ago for beatin his wife had him in jail for a few weeks i played cards with him somethin i always do when we get one of rakes boys in i give em a special cell better food weekend passes the perks of brotherhood paul said somethinlike that youll appreciate it when i arrest your little bankers ass anyway anyway we were talkin one day and i asked tugdale what happened at halftime during the title gameclammed up tight as a tick not a word i said i knew thered been a fight of some sort not a word i waited a few days tried again he finally said that silo had kicked the coaches out of the locker room told em to stay away from the sideline said there had been a rather serious disagreement between rake and neely i asked him whatneely had hit to break his handa walla lockera chalkboardnone of the abovesomebody else bingo but he wouldnt say who thats great police work mal paul said i might just vote for you next time can we leaveneely said i dont like this story they rode in silence for half an hour still flying with all lights on mal appeared to doze occasionally as his ponderous breakfast got digested ill be happy to drive neely said after the car eased onto the gravel shoulder and flung rocks for half a mile cantits illegal mal grunted suddenly wide awake five minutes later he was fading again neely decided conversation might keep him awake did you bust jesseneely asked as he tightened his seat belt nawthe state boys got him mal shifted his weight and reached for a cigarette there was a story to tell so he limbered up they kicked him off the team at miami out of school barely got out with nojail time and before long he was back here poor guy was hooked on the stuff and couldnt shake it his family tried everything rehab lockdownscounselors all that crapbroke em hell it killed his father the trapp family once owned two thousand acres of the best farmland around here now its all gone his poor momma lives in that big house with the roof crumblin anyway paul said helpfully from the rear anyway he started sellin the stuff and of course jesse could not be content as a smalltimer he had some contacts in dade county one thing led to another and before long he had a nice business hadhis own organization with lots of ambition didnt someone get killed paul asked i was gettin to that mal growled at his rearview mirror just trying to help i always wanted a banker in my backseata real whitecollar type and i always wanted to foreclose on the sheriff truce neely said you were getting to the good part mal reshifted his large stomach rubbing the wheel onemore harsh glance into his mirror then the state narcs slowly crept in as they always do they nabbed a flunkie threatened him with thirty years of prison and sodomyconvinced him to flip he set up a drop with narcs hidin in the trees and under the rocks the deal went bad guns were grabbedshots went off a narc took a bullet in the ear and died on the spot the flunkie got hit but survived jesse was nowhere around but it was his people he became a priority and within a year he was standin before his honor receivin his twentyeight years no parole twentyeight years neely repeated yepi was in the courtroom and i actually felt sorry for the scumbag i mean heres a guy who had the tools to play in the nfl size speed mean as hell plus rake had drilled him from the time he was fourteen rake always said that if jesse had gone to am he wouldnt have turned bad rake was in the courtroom too how long has he servedneely asked nine tenyears maybe i aint countinyall hungry we just ate neely said surely you cant be hungry again paul said no but theres this little joint right up here where miss armstrong makes pecan fudgei hate to pass it lets keep going neely said just say no take it one day at a time mal paul offered from the rear the buford detention facility was in flat treeless farmland at the end of a lonely paved road lined with miles of chainlink fencing neely was depressed before any building came into sight mals phone calls had arranged things properly and they were cleared through the front gates and drove deeper into the prison they changed vehicles at a checkpoint swapping the roomy patrol car for the narrow benches of an extended golf cart mal rode up front where he chatted nonstop with the driver a guard wearing as much ammunition and gadgets as the sheriff himself neely and paul shared the back bench facing the rear as they passed more chain link and razor wire they got an eyeful as they puttered past camp a a long dismal cinderblock building with prisoners lounging on the front steps on one side a basketball game was raging all the players were black on the other side an allwhite volleyball game was in progress camps b c and d were just as bleak how could anyone survive in there neely askedhimself at an intersection they turned and were soon up at camp e which looked somewhat newer at camp f they stopped and walked fifty yards to a point where the fencing turned ninety degrees the guard mumbled something into his radio then pointed and said walk down that fence to the white pole hell be out shortly neely and paul began walking along the fence where the grass had been recently cut mal and the guard held back and lost interest behind the building and beside the basketball court was a slab of concrete and scattered across it were all sorts of mismatched barbells and bench presses and stacks of dead weights some very large black and white men were pumping iron in the morning sun their bare chests and backs shining with sweat evidently they lifted weights for hours each day there he is paul saidjust getting up from the bench press on the left thats jesse neely saidmesmerized by a scene that few people ever witnessed a trustee approached and said something to jesse trapp who jerked his head and searched the fence line until he saw the two men he tossed a towel onto a bench and began a slow purposeful spartanlike walk across the slab across the empty basketball court and onto the grass that ran to the fence around camp f from forty yards away he looked huge but as jesse approached the enormity of his chest and neck and arms became awesome they had played with him for one seasonhe was a senior when they were sophomoresand they had seen him naked in the locker room they had seen him fling heavily loaded barbells around the weight room they had seen him set every spartan lifting record he looked twice as big now his neck as thick as an oak stump his shoulders as wide as a door his biceps and triceps were many times the normal size his stomach looked like a cobblestone street he wore a crew cut that made his square head even more symmetrical and when he stopped and looked down at them he smiled hey boys he said still breathing heavily from the last set of reps hello jesse paul said how are youneely said doingwell cant complain good to see yall i dont get many visitors we have bad news jesse paul said i figured rakes deadpassed away last night he lowered his chin until it touched his massive chest from the waist up he seemed to shrink a little as the news hit him my mother wrote me and told me he was sick he said with his eyes closed it was cancer diagnosed about a year ago but the end came pretty fast man oh man i thought rake would live forever i think we all did neely said ten years in prison had taught him to control whatever emotions ventured his way he swallowed hard and opened his eyes thanks

closed a moment passed i loved eddie rake like ive loved nobody else in my life he was in court the day i got sent away i had ruined my life and i was humiliated over that i had wrecked my parents and i was sick about that but what hurt the most was that i had failed in rakes eyes it still hurts yall can bury him without me its your call jesse paul said thanks but ill pass there was a long pause as all three nodded and studied the grass finally paul said i see your mom once a week shes doing well thanks she visits me the third sunday of every month you ought to drive over sometime say hello its pretty lonely in here ill do that jesse you promise i promise and i wish youd think about tomorrow ive already thought about it ill say a prayer for rake you boys can bury him fair enough jesse looked to his right is that mal over there yes we rode with him tell him to kiss my ass ill do that jesse paul saidwith pleasure thanks boys jesse said he turned and walked away at four oclock thursday afternoon the crowd parted at the gate to rake field and the hearse backed itself into position its rear door was opened and eight pallbearers formed two short lines and pulled out the casket none of the eight were former spartans eddie rake had given much thought to his final details and he had decided not to play favorites he selected his pallbearers from among his assistant coaches the procession moved slowly around the track the casket was followed by mrs lila rake her three daughters and their husbands and a handsome collection of grandchildrenthen a priestthen the drum corps from the spartan marching band doing a soft roll as they passed the home stands between the forties on the home sideline there was a large white tent its poles anchored in buckets of sand to protect the sacred bermuda of rake field at the fiftyyard line at the exact spot where he had coached for so long and so well they stopped with his casket it was mounted on an antique irish wake table the property of lilas best friend and quickly surrounded by flowers when the coach was properly arranged the family gathered around the casket for a short prayer then they formed a receiving line the line stretched down the track and through the gate and the cars were bumper to bumper on the road that led to rake field neely passed the house three times before he was brave enough to stopthere was a rental car in the driveway cameron had returned long after dinner he knocked on the door almost as nervous as the first time hed done so then as a fifteenyearold with a new drivers permit his parents car twenty bucks in his pocket the peach fuzz scraped off his face he had arrived to take cameron on their first real date a hundred years ago mrs lane opened the door same as always but this time she did not recognizeneely good evening she said softly she was still beautiful polite refusing to age mrs lane its me neely crenshaw as the words came out she recognized him why yesneely how are you he figured his name had been mud in the house for solong he wasnt sure how hed be received but the lanes were gracious people slightly more educated and affluent than most in messina if they held a grudge and he was certain one was being held they wouldnt show it not the parents anyway im fine he said would you come in she said opening the door it was a halfhearted gesture sure thanks in the foyer he looked around and said still a beautiful home mrs lane thank you could i get you some tea no thanksactually im looking for cameron is she here she is id like to say hello im very sorry about coach rake i know he meant everything to you boys yes maam he was glancing around listening for voices in the back of the house ill find cameron she said and disappeared neely waited and waited and finally turned to the large oval window in the front door and watched the dark street there was a footstep behind him then a familiar voice helloneely cameron said he turned and they stared at each other words failed him for the moment so he shrugged and finally blurted i was just driving by thought id say hello its been a long time it has the gravity of his mistake hit hard she was much prettier than in high school her thick auburn hair was pulled back into a ponytail her dark blue eyes were adorned with chic designer frames she wore a bulky cotton sweater and tight faded jeans that declared that this was a lady who stayed in shape you look great he said as he admired her you too can we talk about what life love footballtheres a good chance well never see each other again and i have something to say she opened the door they walked across the wide porch and sat on the front steps she was careful to leave a large gap between them five minutes passed in silence i saw nat he said he told me youre living in chicago happily married with two little girls true whod you marry jack jack who jack seawright whered he come from i met him in dc i went to work there after college how old are your girls five and three what does jack do bagels bagels yes those round things we didnt have bagels in messina okay you mean like a bagel shopshops more than one a hundred and fortysix so youre doing well his company is worth eight million ouch my little company is worth twelve thousand on a good day you said you had something to say she had shown not the slightest hint of thawing there was no interest in any of the details of his life neely heard faint footsteps on the wooden floor of the foyerno doubt mrs lane was back there trying to listen some things never changed the wind picked up slightly and scattered oak leaves across the brick sidewalk in front of them neely rubbed his hands together and said okay here goes a long time ago i did a very bad thing something ive been ashamed of for many years i was wrong it was stupid mean lousy selfish harmful and the older i get the more i regret it im apologizing cameron and i ask you to forgive me youre forgiven forget about it i cant forget about it and dont be so nice we were just kidsneely sixteen years old it was another lifetime we were in love cameron i adored you from the time we were ten years old and holding hands behind the gym so the other boys wouldnt see me i really dont want to hear this okay but can i get it off my chest and would you try to make itpainful i got over itneely finally maybe i havent oh get a life and grow up while youre at it youre not the football hero anymore there you go thats what i want to hear unload with both barrels did you come here to fightneely no i came to say im sorry youve said it now why dont you leave he bit his tongue and let a few seconds pass then why do you want me to leave because i dont like youneely you shouldnt it took ten years to get you out of my system when i fell in love with jack i was finally able to forget you i hoped i would never see you again do you ever think about me no never maybe once a year in a weak momentjack was watching a football game once the quarterback got hurt and left the game on a stretcher i thought of you then a pleasant thought not unpleasant i think of you all the time a slight crack in the ice as she exhaled and seemed frustratedshe leaned forward and rested both elbows on her knees the door opened behind them and mrs lane shuffled out with a tray thought you might like some hot chocolate she said placing it on the edge of the porch in the large space between them thank you neely said itll keep the chill off mrs lane said cameron you should put on some socks yes mother the door closed and they ignored the hot chocolate neely wanted a long conversation one that covered several issues and many years she once had feelings strong ones and he wanted to confirm them he wanted tears and anger maybe a good fight or two and he wanted to be truly forgiven you were actually watching a football game he said no jack was watching the game i happened to be passing through hes a football fan not really if hed been a fan i wouldnt have married him so you still hate football you could say that i went to hollins an allgirls school so i could avoid football my oldest daughter has started school at a small private academyno football then why are you here now miss lila she taught me piano for twelve years right im certainly not here to honor eddie rake cameron picked up a cup and cradled it with both hands neely did the same when it became apparent he was in no hurry to leave she opened up a little i had a sorority sister at hollins whose brother played for state she was watching a game our sophomore year and i walked into her room there was the great neely crenshaw moving tech up and down the field fans going wildthe announcers giddy over this great young quarterback i thought well good thats what he always wanteda bigtime heroadoring massescoeds chasing him all over campus throwing themselves at himconstant adulation everybodys allamerican thats neely two weeks later i was in the hospital she shrugged i didnt know i wasnt following your great career who told you i was home for christmas break and i had lunch with nat he told me youd never play again its such a stupid sport boys and young men mangle their bodies for life it is indeed so tell meneely what happened to the girls when youre no longer the hero what happens to all those little sluts and groupies they disappear that mustve killed you now were making progress neely thought lets get the venom out there was nothing pleasant about the injury so you became just a regular person like the rest of us i guess but with a lot of baggage being a forgotten hero is not easy and youre still adjusting when youre famous at eighteen you spend the rest of your life fading away you dream of the glory days but you know theyre gone forever i wish id never seen a football i dont believe that id be a regular guy with two good legs and i wouldnt have made the mistake with you oh pleaseneely dont get sappy we were only sixteen another long pause as they sipped from their cups and got ready for the next serve and volleyneely had been planning the encounter for weekscameron had had no idea she would ever see him again still he knew the element of surprise would not help him she would have all the answers youre not saying much he said i have nothing to say come on cameron this is your chance to unload with both barrels why should i youre here trying to force me to dig up bad memories that took years to forget what makes you think i want to go back to high school and get burned again ive dealt with itneely obviously you havent you want to know about screamer hell no shes a cocktail waitress at a low rent casino in vegas fat and ugly thirtytwo and looking fifty all according to paul curry who saw her there apparently she went to hollywood tried to sleep her way to the topgot squeezed out by a million other smalltown homecoming queens trying to sleep their way to the top no surprise paul said she looked tired im certain of that she looked tired in high school does that make you feel better i felt great before you got hereneely i have no interest in you or your homecoming queen come on cameron be honest it must be somewhat satisfying to know that screamer is closing in on skid row while your life is looking pretty good youve won i wasnt competing i dont care you cared back then she placed the cup back on the tray and leaned forward again what do you want me to sayneely shall i state the obvious i loved you madly when i was a young teenage girl thats no surprise because i told you every day and you told me the same we spent every moment together had every class togetherwent everywhere together but you became this great football hero and everybody wanted a piece of youespecially screamer she had the long legs and cute butt and short skirts and big chest and blond hair and somehow she got you in the backseat of her car you decided you wanted more of the same i was a nice girl and i paid a price for it you broke my heart humiliated me in front of everybody i knew and wrecked my life for a long time i couldnt wait to leave this town i still cant believe i did that well you did her voice was edgy and there was a slight crack she clenched her teeth determined to show no emotion he would not make her cry again im so sorryneely slowly got to his feet careful not to put too much weight on his left knee he touched her on the arm and said thanks for giving me the chance to say so dont mention it goodbye he walked down the sidewalk with a slight limp through the gate when he was near his car she called out neely wait because of his highvoltage romance with brandy skimmel akascreamer now also known by a very few as tessa canyon neely knew all the back alleys and deserted streets of messina he circled karrs hill where they paused for a moment to look down at the football field the line of wellwishers still ran along the track and out the front gate the lights on the home side were on the parking lot was full of cars coming and going they say rake would sit up here after they fired him and watch the games they shouldve put him in jail cameronsaid her first and only words since leaving home they parked near a practice field and sneaked through a gate on the visitors side they climbed to the top of the bleachers and sat down still with a gap between them though closer than on her front porch for a long time they watched the scene on the other side of the field the white tent rose like a small pyramid in front of the home stands the casket was barely visible under it a crowd was gathered around enjoying the vigil miss lila and the family had left racks of flowers were accumulating around the tent and up and down the sideline a silent parade of mourners inched along the track patiently waiting for the chance to sign the register see the casket perhaps shed a tear and say farewell to their legend up in the stands behind the line of people rakes boys of all ages were grouped in small packs some talking some laughingmost just staring at the field and the tent and the casket only two people were in the visitors stands unnoticed cameron spoke first very softly who are those people up in the bleachers playersi was up there last night and the night before waiting for rake to die so theyre allcoming home most of usyou came home of coursewere burying our most famous citizen you didnt like rake did you i was not a fan miss lila is a strong woman but she was no match for him he was a dictator on the field and he had trouble turning it off when he got home no i didnt care for eddie rake you hated football i hated you and that made me hate football atta girl it was sillygrown men crying after a lossthe entire town living and dying with each game prayer breakfasts every friday morning as if god cares who wins a high school football game more money spent on the football team than on all other student groups combined worshiping seventeenyearold boys who quickly become convinced they are truly worthy of being worshiped the double standarda football player cheats on a test everybody scrambles to cover it up a nonathlete cheats and he gets suspendedthe stupid little girls who cant wait to give it up to a spartanall for the good of the team messina needs its young virgins to sacrifice everything oh and i almost forgot the pep girls each player gets his own little slave who bakes him cookies on wednesday and puts a spirit sign in his front yard on thursday and polishes his helmet on friday and what do you get on saturday neely a quickie only if you want it its a sad scene thank you for shoving me out of it looking back with the clear hindsight of fifteen years it did indeed seem silly but you came to the games neely said a few of them you have any idea what this town is like on friday night away from the field theres not a soul anywhere phoebe cox and i would sneak over here on the visitors side and watch the games we always wanted messina to lose but it never happened not here we ridiculed the band and the cheerleaders and the pep squad and everything else and we did so because we were not a part of it i couldnt wait to get to college i knew you were up here no you didnt i swear i knew faint laughter drifted across the field as another rake story found its mark among his boys neely could barely make out silo and paul in a group of ten others just under the press box the beer was flowing after you took the plunge in the backseat she said and i was tossed aside we still had two years left in this place there were moments when i would see you in the hall or the library or even in the classroom and our eyes would meet just for a second gone was the cocky sneer the arrogant look of everybodys hero just for a splitsecond you would look at me like a real person and i would know that you still cared i wouldve taken you back in a heartbeat and i wanted you thats hard to believe its true but of course the joy of sex i couldnt help myself congratulations neely you and screamer began your adventures at the age of sixteen look at her now fat and tired did you ever hear the rumor that she was pregnant are you kidding rumors are like mosquitoes in this town the summer before our senior year she tells me shes pregnant what a surprisebasic biology so we drove to atlanta got an abortion drove back to messina i swear i never told a soul rested twentyfour hours then back in the rut close look neely im really tired of your sex life it was my curse for many years eitherchange the subject or im out of here another long awkward pause as they watched the receiving line and thought about what to say nexta breeze blew in their faces and she held her arms close to her chest he fought the desire to reach over and hold her it wouldnt work youve asked nothing about my life these days he said im sorry i stopped thinking about you a long time ago i cant lieneely youre just not a factor anymore you were always blunt blunt is good it saves so much time i sell real estate live alone with a dog date a girl i really dont like date another one with two children and i really miss my exwife what caused the divorce she cracked up she miscarried twice the second one in the fourth month i made the mistake of telling her i once paid for an abortion so she blamed me for losing the babies she was right the real cost of an abortion is much more than the lousy three hundred bucks at the clinic im sorry ten years to the week after screamer and i made our little road trip to atlanta my wife had the second miscarriage a little boy i really want to leave now im sorry they sat on the front steps again the lights were off mr and mrs lane were asleep it was after eleven i think you should go now cameron said after a few minutes youre right you said earlier that you think about me all the time now im curious as to why i had no idea how painful a broken heart can be until my wife packed up and left it was a nightmare for the first time i realized what you had suffered through i realized how cruel i had been youll get over ittakes about ten years thanks he walked down the sidewalk then turned around and walked back how old is jack he asked thirtyseven then statistically he should die first give me a call when hes gone ill be waiting sure you will i swear isnt it comforting to know that someone will always be waiting for you i hadnt thought about it he leaned down and looked her in the eyes can i kiss you on the cheek no theres something magical about the first love cameron something ill miss forever goodbye neely can i say i love you nogoodbye neely friday messina mourned like never before by ten on friday morning the shops and cafes and offices around the square were locked all students were dismissed from school the courthouse was closed the factories on the edges of the town were shut down a free holiday though few felt like celebrating mal brown placed his deputies around the high school where by midmorning the traffic was bumper to bumper on the road to rake field by eleven the home stands were almost full and the explayers the former heroes were gathering and milling around the tent at the fiftyyard line most of them wore their green game jerseys a gift to every senior and most jerseys were stretched tighter around the midsections a fewthe lawyers and doctors and bankerswore sports coats over their game shirts but the green was visible from the bleachers up above the fans looked down at the tent and the field and enjoyed the chance to identify their old heroes those with retired numbers caused the most excitement theres roman armstead number played for the packerstheresneely number the senior class string quartet played under the tent and the pa system lifted its sounds from end zone to end zone the town kept coming there would be no casket eddie rake was already in the ground miss lila and her family arrived without ceremony and spent half an hour hugging former players in front of the tent just before noon the priest appeared and then a choir but the crowd was far from settled when the home bleachers were full they began lining the fence around the track there was no hurry this was a moment messina would cherish and remember rake wanted his boys on the field packed around the small podium near the edge of the tent and he wanted them to wear their jerseys a request that had been quietly spread in his last days a tarp covered the track and several hundred folding chairs had been arranged in a halfmoon around twelvethirty father mccabe gave the signal and the players began packing into their seats miss lila and the family sat in the front rows neely was between paul curry and silo mooney with thirty other members of the team around them two were dead and six had disappeared the rest couldnt make it a bagpipe at the north goalpost began wailing and the crowd became still silo was wiping tears almost immediately and he was not alone as the last melancholy notes drifted across the field the mourners were softened up and ready for some serious emotion father mccabe slowly approached the makeshift podium and adjusted the microphone good afternoon he said in a highpitched voice that broke sharply through the stadium speakers and could be heard half a mile away and welcome to our celebration of the life of eddie rake on behalf of mrs lila rake her three daughters eight grandchildren and the rest of the family i welcome you and say thank you for coming he flipped a page of notes carl edward rake was born seventytwo years ago in gaithersburg maryland fortyeight years ago he married the former lila saunders fortyfour years ago he was hired by the messina school board as the head football coach at the time he was twentyeight had no head coaching experience and always said he got the job because no one else wanted it he coached here for thirtyfour years won over four hundred games thirteen state titles and we know the rest of the numbers more important he touched the lives of all of us coach rake died wednesday night he was buried this morning in a private ceremony family only and at his personal request and with the consent of the reardon family he was laid to rest beside scotty coach rake told me last week that he was dreaming of scotty said he couldnt wait to see him up in heaven to hold him and hug him and tell him he was sorry with perfect timing he paused to allow this to choke up the crowd he opened a bible as he was about to speak there was a commotion near the front gate a loud radio squawked car doors slammed and there were voices people were scrambling around father mccabe paused and looked and this caused everyone else to look too a giant of a man was walking briskly through the gate onto the track it was jesse trapp with a prison guard at each elbow he was wearing perfectly pressed khaki pants and shirt prison issue and the handcuffs had been removed his guards were in uniform and not much smaller the crowd froze when they recognized him as he walked along the sideline his head was high his back stiff a proud man but he also had a look of slight bewilderment where should he sit would he fit would he be welcome as he approached the end of the stands someone in the crowd caught his attention a voice called out and jesse stopped cold it was his mother a tiny woman holding a place along the fence he lunged for her and hugged her tightly over the chainlink as his guards glanced at each other to make sure that yes it was okay for their prisoner to hug his mother from a wrinkled grocery bag mrs trapp pulled out a green jersey number retired in jesse held it and looked down the track at the former players all straining to see him in front of the same ten thousand people who once screamed for him to maim opposing players he quickly unbuttoned his shirt and took it off suddenly he exposed more brilliantly toned and tanned muscles than anyone had ever seen and he seemed to pause so they and he could enjoy the moment father mccabe waited patiently and so did everyone else when he had the jersey arranged just so he pulled it over his head then tugged here and there until it was properly in place it strained over the biceps and was very tight across the chest and around the neck but every other spartan there wouldve killed to fill it so well it was loose at the narrow waist and when he carefully tucked it into his pants the jersey looked as if it might burst open he hugged his mother again someone applaudedthen several people stood clapping welcome home jesse we still love you quickly the bleachers rattled as people rose to their feet a thunderous wave of applause engulfed rake field as the town embraced a fallen hero jesse noddedthen waved awkwardly as he continued his slow walk to the podium the standing ovation grew louder as he shook hands with father mccabe and hugged miss lila he hugged his way through a haphazard aisle of former players and finally found an empty folding chair that seemed to sink under his weight by the time jesse was seated and still tears were dripping from his face father mccabe waited until all was quiet again there would be no rush on thisday no one was watching the clock he adjusted the mike again and said one of coach rakes favorite scripture verses was the twentythird psalm we read it together last monday his favorite lines were yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil thy rod and thy staff they comfort me eddie rake lived his life with no fear his players were taught that those who are timid and frightened have no place among the victors those who take no risks receive no rewards a few months ago coach rake accepted the reality that his death was inevitable he was unafraid of his disease and the suffering that would follow he was unafraid of saying goodbye to those he loved he was unafraid of dying his faith in god was strong and unshakable death is just the beginning he liked to say father mccabe bowed slightly and backed away from the podium on cue an allfemale choir from a black church began humming they wore scarlet and gold robes and after a short warmup launched into a boisterous rendition of amazing grace the music stirred emotions as it always does on such occasionsand memories every spartan player was soon lost in his own images of eddie rake forneely thoughts of rake always began with the slap in the face the broken nose the punch that knocked out his coach and the dramatic comeback for the state title and he always fought himself to move on to get past that painful moment and recapture the good times rare is the coach who can motivate players to spend their lives seeking his approval from the timeneely first put on a uniform in the sixth grade he wanted rakes attention and in the next six years with every pass he threw every drill he ran every play he memorized every weight he lifted every hour he spent sweating every pregame speech he gave every touchdown he scored every game he won every temptation he resisted every honor roll he made he coveted eddie rakes approval he wanted to see rakes face when he won the heisman he dreamed of rakes phone call when tech won the national title and rare is the coach who compounds every failure long after the playing days are over when the doctors toldneely he would never play again he felt as if he had fallen short of rakes ambitions for him when his marriage dissolved he could almost see rakes disapproving scowl as his smalltime real estate career drifted with no clear ambition he knew rake would have a lecture if he got close enough to hear it maybe his death would kill the demon that dogged him but he had his doubts ellen rake young the eldest daughter walked to the podium when the choir was finished and unfolded a sheet of paper like her sisters she had wisely fled messina after high school and returned only when family matters required her fathers shadow was toomammoth for his children to survive in such a small place she was in her midforties a psychiatrist in boston and had the air of someone who was out of place on behalf of our family i thank you for your prayers and support during these last weeks my father died with a great deal of courage and dignity though his last years here were not some of his best he loved this town and its people and he especially loved his players love was not a word any of the players had ever heard their coach use if hed loved them hed had a strange way of showing it my father has written a short note that he asked me to read she adjusted her reading glasses cleared her throat and focused on the sheet of paper this is eddie rake speaking from the grave if you are crying please stop this brought scattered laughter from the crowd which was anxious for a light moment ive never had any use for tears my life is now complete so dont cry for me and dont cry for the memories never look back theres too much left to do im a lucky man who lived a wonderful life i had the good sense to marry lila as soon as i could talk her into it and god blessed us with three beautiful daughters and at last count eight perfect grandchildren this alone is enough for any man but god had many blessings in store for me he led me to football and to messina my home and there i met you my friends and my players though i was emotionally unable to convey my feelings i want my players to know that i cherished every one of them why would any sane person coach high school football for thirtyfour years for me it was easy i loved my players i wish i had been able to say so but it was simply not my nature we accomplished much but i will not dwell on the victories and the championships instead i choose this moment to offer two regrets ellen paused here and cleared her throat again the crowd appeared to hold its collective breath only two regrets in thirtyfour years as i said im a lucky man the first is scotty reardon i never dreamed i would be responsible for the death of one of my players but i accept the blame for his death holding him in my arms as he passed away is something i have wept over every day since i have expressed these feelings to his parents and with time i think they have forgiven me i cling to their forgiveness and take it to my death i am with scotty now and for eternity and as we look down together at this moment we have reconciled our past another pause as ellen took a sip of water the second involves the state title game in at halftime in a fit of rage i physically assaulted a player our quarterback it was a criminalact one that should have had me banned me from the game forever i am sorry for my actions as i watched that team rally against enormous odds i have never felt such pride and such pain that victory was my finest hour please forgive me boys neely glanced around himall heads were low most eyes were closed silo was wiping his face enough of the negativemy love to lila and the girls and the grandkidswell all meet very soon across the river in thepromised land may god be withyou the choir sang just a closer walk with thee and the tears were flowing neely couldnt help but wonder if cameron was keeping her emotions in check he suspected that she was rake had asked three of his former players to deliver eulogies short ones he had demanded in writing from his deathbed the first was given by the honorable mike hilliard now a circuit court judge in a small town a hundred miles away unlike most of the former spartans he wore a suit one with wrinkles and a crooked bow tie he grabbed the podium with both hands and didnt need notes i played on coach rakes first team in he began in a squeaky voice with a thick drawl the year before we had won three games and lost seven which back then was considered a good season because we beat porterville in our final game the coach left town and took his assistants with him and for a while we werent sure we would find anyone to coach us they hired this young guy named eddie rake who wasnt much older than we were the first thing he told us was that we were a bunch of losers that losing is contagiousthat if we thought we could lose with him then we could hit the door fortyone of us signed up for football that year coach rake took us off to an old church camp over in page county for august drills and after four days the squad was down to thirty after a week we were down to twentyfive and some of us were beginning to wonder if wed survive long enough to field a team the practices were beyond brutal the bus for messina left every afternoon and we were free to get on it after two weeks the bus was empty and it stopped running the boys who quitcame home telling horror stories of what was happening at camp rake as it was soon called our parents were alarmed my mother told me later she felt like i was off at war unfortunately ive seen war and i would prefer it over camp rake we broke camp with twentyone players twentyone kids whod never been in such great shape we were small and slow and didnt have a quarterback but we were convinced our first game was at home against fulton a team that had embarrassed us the year before im sure some of you remember it we led twenty to nothing at halftime and rake cussed us because wed made some mistakes hisgenius was simplestick to the basics and work nonstop until you can execute them perfectly lessons i have never forgotten we won the game and we were celebrating in the locker room when rake walked in and told us to shut up evidently our execution had not been perfect he told us to keep our gear on and after the crowd left we came back to this field and practiced until midnight we ran two plays until all eleven guys got everything perfect our girlfriends were waiting our parents were waiting it was nice to win the game but folks were beginning to think coach rake was crazy the players already knew it we won eight games that year lost only two and the legend of eddie rake was born my senior year we lost one gamethen in coach rake had his first undefeated season i was away at college and i couldnt get home every friday though i desperately wanted to when you play for rake you join an exclusive little club and you follow the teams that come behind you for the next thirtytwo years i followed spartan football as closely as possible i was here sitting up there in the bleachers when the great streak began in and i was at south wayne when it ended in along with you i watched the great ones playwally webb roman armstead jesse trapp neely crenshaw on the walls of my cluttered office hang the photos of all thirtyfour of rakes teams he would send me a picture of the team every year often when i should be working ill light my pipe and stand before them and look at the faces of all the young men he coachedskinny white boys in the s with crew cuts and innocent smiles shaggier ones in the s fewer smiles determined looks you can almost see the ominous clouds of war and civil rights in their faces black and white players smiling together in the seventies and eighties much bigger kids with fancier uniforms some were the sons of boys i played with i know that every player looking down from my walls was indelibly touched by eddie rake they ran the same plays heard the same pep talks got the same lecturesendured the same brutal drills in august and every one of us at some time became convinced that we truly hated eddie rake but then we were gone our pictures hang on the walls and we spend the rest of our lives hearing the sound of his voice in the locker room longing for the days when we called him coach most of those faces are here todayslightly older grayer some a bit heavierall sadder as we say goodbye to coach rake and why do we care why are we here why are the stands once again filled and overflowing well i will tell you why few of us will ever do anything that will be recognized and remembered by more than a handful of people we are not great we may be good honest fair hardworking loyal kind generous and very decent or we may be otherwise but we are not considered great greatness comes along so rarely that when we see it we want to touch it eddie rake allowed us players and fans to touch greatness to be a part of it he was a great coach who built a great program and a great tradition and gave us all something great something we will always cherish hopefully most of us will live long happy lives but we will never again be this close to greatness thats why were here whether you loved eddie rake or you didnt you cannot deny his greatness he was the finest man ive ever met my happiest memories are of wearing the green jersey and playing for him on this field i long for those days i can hear his voice feel his wrath smell his sweatsee his pride i will always miss the great eddie rake he pausedthen bowed and abruptly backed away from the microphone as a light almost awkward applause crept through the crowd as soon as he sat down a thickchested black gentleman in a gray suit stood and marched with great dignity to the podium under his jacket was the green jersey he looked up and gazed upon the crowd packed tightly together good afternoon he announced with a voice that needed no microphone im reverend collis suggs of the bethel church of god in christ here in messina collis suggs needed no introduction to anyone who lived within fifty miles of messina eddie rake had appointed him as the first black captain in he played briefly at floridaam before breaking a leg then became a minister he built a large congregation and became involved politically for years it had been said that if eddie rake and collis suggs wanted you elected then you got elected if not then take your name off the ballot thirty years in the pulpit had honed his speaking skills to perfection his diction was perfect his timing and pitch were captivating coach rake was known to sneak into the rear pew of the bethel church on sunday nights just to hear his former noseguard preach i played for coach rake in and most of those in the crowd had seen every game in late july the us supreme court had finally had enough fifteen years afterbrown versusboard of education and most schools in the south were still segregated the court took drastic action and it changed our lives forever one hot summer night we were playing basketball in the gym at section high the colored school when coach thomas walked in said boys were goin to messina high school youre gonna be spartans get on the bus about a dozen of us loaded on the bus and coach thomas drove us across town we were confused and scared we had been told many times that the schools would be integrated but deadlines had come and gone we knew messina high had the finest of everythingbeautiful buildings nice fields a huge gym lots of trophies a football team that had won at that time something like fifty or sixty straight and they had a coach who thought he was vince lombardi yes we were intimidated but we knew we had to be brave we arrived at messina high that night the football team was lifting weights in this huge weight room more weights than i had ever seen in my life about forty guys pumping iron sweating music going as soon as we walked in everything was quiet they looked at us we looked at them eddie rake walked over shook hands with coach thomas and said welcome to your new school he made us all shake handsthen he sat us down on the mats and gave us a little speech he said he didnt care what color we were all his players wore green his playing field was perfectly level hard work won games and he didnt believe in losing i remember sitting there on that rubber mat mesmerized by this man he immediately became my coach eddie rake was many things but he was the greatest motivator ive ever met i wanted to put on the pads and start hitting people right then two weeks later we started twoaday practices in august and i have never hurt so much in my life rake was right skin color didnt matter he treated us all like dogs equally there was a lot of concern about the first day of classes about fights and racial conflict and most schools saw a lot of it not here the principal put coach rake in charge of security and everything went smoothly he put all of his players in green game jerseys same ones were wearing right now and he paired us up a black player with a white player when the buses rolled in we were there to greet them the first thing the black kids saw at messina high was the football team black and white players together everybody wearing green a couple of hotheads wanted some trouble but we convinced them otherwise the first controversy was over the cheerleaders the white girls had been practicing all summer as a squad coach rake went to the principal and said half and half would work just fine and it did still does nextcame the band there wasnt enough money to combine the white band and the black band and have everybody march in messina uniforms some kids would get cut it looked like most of those left on the sideline would be black coach rake went to the boosterclub said he needed twenty thousand dollars for new band uniforms said messina would have the largest high school marching band in the state and we still do there was a lot of resistance to integration many white folks thought it was only temporary once the courts got finished then everything would revert back to the old system of separate but equal im here to tell you separate was never equal there was a lot of speculation on our side of town about whether the white coaches would actually play us black kids and there was a lot of pressure from the white side of town to play white kids only after three weeks of practice with eddie rake we knew the truth our first game that year was against north delta they hit the field allwhitehad about fifteen black guys on the bench i knew some of them knew they could play rake put the best players on the field and we soon realized that north delta did not it was a slaughter at halftime we were leading fortyone to nothing when the second half started the black kids came off the bench for north delta and i have to admit we relaxed a little problem was nobody relaxed with eddie rake if he caught you loafing on the field then you got to stay on the sideline with him word spread that messina was starting their black kids and soon the issue was settled all over the state eddie rake was the first white man who ever yelled at me and made me like it once i realized that he truly did not care about the color of my skinthen i knew i would follow him anywhere he hated injustice because he wasnt from here he brought a different perspective no person had the right to mistreat another and if coach rake got wind of it then a fight was coming for all of his toughness he was terribly sensitive to the suffering of others after i became a minister coach rake would come to our church and work in our outreach programs he opened his home to abandoned and abused children he never made much money as a coach but he was generous when someone needed food or clothing or even tuition he coached youth teams in the summer of course knowing rake he was also looking for the boys who could run he organized fishing rodeos for kids with no fathers typically he never sought recognition for any of this the reverend took a pause and a sip of water the crowd watched every move and waited after they fired coach rake i spent some time with him he was convinced that he had been treated unfairly but as the years went by i think coach accepted his fate i know he grieved over scotty reardon and im so happy that he was laid to rest this morning next to scotty maybe now this town can stop the feuding how ironic that the man who put us on the map the man who did so much to bring so many together was also the man that messina has been fighting over for ten years now lets all bury the hatchet lay down our arms and make peace over eddie rake we are all one in christ and in this wonderful little town we are one in eddie rake god bless our coach god bless you the string quartet played a mournful ballad that went on for ten minutes leave it to rake to have the final word leave it to rake to manipulate his players one last time neely certainly couldnt say anything bad about his coach not at this moment from the grave rake had apologized now he wantedneely to stand before the town accept the apology then add a few warm words of his own his first reaction upon receiving the note from miss lila that a eulogy was requested was to curse and ask why me of all the players rake coached dozens were certainly closer to him thanneely paul suspected it was rakes way of making a final peace withneely and the team whatever the reason there was no proper way to decline a eulogy paul said it simply could not be done neely said hed never done one before had never spoken in front of a large group or a small one either for that matter and furthermore was considering an escape in the middle of the night to avoid the entire matter as he walked slowly among the players his feet were heavy his left knee aching more than usual without a limp he stepped onto the small platform and situated himself behind the podium then he looked at the crowd all staring down at him and he almost fainted between the twentyyard linessixty yards totaland up fifty rows the home side of rake field was nothing but a wall of faces peering down to admire an old hero without a fight he succumbed completely to fear hed been afraid and nervous all morning now he was terrified slowly he unfolded a sheet of paper and took his time trying to read the words hed written and rewritten ignore the crowd he told himself you cannot embarrass yourself these people remember a great quarterback not a coward whose voice is cracking im neely crenshaw he managed to say with some certainty he found a spot on the chainlink fence along the track directly in front of him just over the heads of the players and just under the first row of the bleachers he would direct his comments to that part of the fence and ignore everything else hearing his voice over the public address calmed him a little and i played for coach rake from to he looked at his notes again and remembered a lecture from rake fear is inevitable and it is not always bad harness your fear and use it to your advantage of course to rake that meant sprinting from the locker room onto the field and trying to cripple the first opposing player in sight hardly good advice when eloquent words were needed staring at the fence againneely shrugged and tried to smile and said look im not a judge and im not a minister and im not accustomed to speaking before groups please be patient with me the adoring crowd would allow him anything fumbling with his notes he began to read the last time i saw coach rake was in i was in the hospital a few days after surgery and he sneaked into my room late one night a nurse came in and told him he would have to leave visiting hours were over he explained very clearly that he would leave when he got ready and not one minute before she left in a huff neely glanced up and looked at the playerslots of smiles his voice was solid no cracks he was surviving i had not spoken to coach rake since the championship game now i guess everybody knows why what happened then was a secret that we all buried we didnt forget it because that wouldve been impossible so we just kept it to ourselves that night in the hospital i looked up and there was coach rake standing beside my bed wanting to talk after a few awkward moments we began to gossip he pulled a chair close and we talked for a long time we talked as we had never talked beforeold games old players lots of memories of messina football we had a few laughs he wanted to know about my injury when i told him the doctors were almost certain that i would never play again his eyes watered and he couldnt speak for a long time a promising career was suddenly over and rake asked me what i planned to do i was nineteen years old i had no idea he made me promise that i would finish college a promise that i failed to keep he finally got around to the championship game and he apologized for his actions he made me promise that i would forgive him another promise i failed to keepuntil now at some point without realizing itneelys eyes had drifted away from his notes and away from the chainlink fence hewas looking at the crowd when i could walk again i found that going to class took too much effort i went to college to play football and when that was suddenly over i lost interest in studying after a couple of semesters i dropped out and drifted for a few years trying to forget about messina and eddie rake and all the broken dreams football was a dirty word i allowed the bitterness to fester and grow and i was determined never to come back with time i tried my best to forget about eddie rake a couple of months ago i heard that he was very ill and probably would not survive fourteen years had passed since i last set foot on this field the night coach rake retired my number like all the former players here today i felt the irresistible call to come homeand to come back to this field where we once owned the world regardless of my feelings about coach rake i knew i had to be here when he died i had to say farewell and i had to finally and sincerely accept his apology i should have done it earlier the last few words were strained he gripped the podium and paused as he looked at paul and silo both nodding both saying get on with it once youve played for eddie rake you carry him with you forever you hear his voice you see his face you long for his smile of approvalyou remember his tonguelashings and lectures with each success in life you want rake to know about it you want to say hey coach look at what ive done and you want to thank him for teaching you that success is not an accident and with each failure you want to apologize because he did not teach us to fail he refused to accept failure you want his advice on how to overcome it at times you get tired of carrying coach rake around you want to be able to screw up and not hear him bark you want to slide and maybe cut a corner without hearing his whistle then the voice will tell you to pick yourself up to set a goal work harder than everybody else stick to the basics execute perfectly be confident be brave and never never quit the voice is never far away we will leave here today without the physical presence of our coach but his spirit will live in the hearts and minds and souls of all the young boys he touched all the kids who became men under eddie rake his spirit will move us and motivate us and comfort us for the rest of our lives i guess fifteen years later i think about coach rake more than ever there is a question ive asked myself a thousand times and i know that every player has struggled with it too the question is do i love eddie rake or do i hate him the voice began to crack and fade neely closed his eyes bit his tongue and tried to summon the strength to finish then he wiped his face and said slowly ive answered the question differently every day since the first time he blew his whistle and barked at me coach rake was not easy to love and while youre playing here you really dont like him but after you leave after you venture away from this place after youve been kicked around afew times faced some adversity some failure been knocked down by life you soon realize how important coach rake is and was you always hear his voice urging you to pick yourself up to dobetter and never quit you miss that voice once youre away from coach rake you miss him so much he was straining now either sit down or embarrass yourself he glanced at silo who clenched a fist as if to say finish it and fast ive loved five people in my life he said looking up bravely at the crowd his voice was fading so he gritted his teeth and pushed onmy parents a certain girl whos here today my exwife and eddie rake he struggled for a long painful pausethen said ill sit down now when father mccabe finished the benediction and dismissed the crowd there was little movement the town was not ready to say goodbye to its coach as the players stood and gathered around miss lila and the family the town watched from the stands the choir sang a soft spiritual and a few folks began drifting toward the front gate every player wanted to say something to jesse trapp as if chatting him up might delay his inevitable return to prison after an hour rabbit cranked up the john deere mower and began cutting the south end zone there was after all a game to be played kickoff against hermantown was five hours away when miss lila and the family began moving away from the tent the players followed slowly behind workers quickly disassembled the tent and removed the tarp and folding chairs the home benches were arranged in a straight line the field paint crew a highly experienced squad of boosters began scurrying around already behind schedule they worshiped rake but the field had to be striped and the midfield logo touched up the cheerleaders arrived and began working furiously to hang handpainted banners along the fence around the field they tinkered with a fog machine to enhance the teams dramatic entry through the end zone they looped hundreds of balloons around the goalposts rake was only a legend to them at the moment they had far more serious matters to think about the band could be heard in the distance on one of the practice fields tuning up practicing maneuvers football was in the air friday night was rapidly approaching at the front gate the players shook hands and hugged and made the usual promises to get together more often some took quick photos of the remnants of old teams more hugs more promises more long sad looks at the field where they once played under the great eddie rake finally they left the team met at silos cabin a few miles out of town it was an old hunting lodge deep in the woods on the edge of a small lake silo had put some money into itthere was a pool three decks on different levels for serious lounging and a new pier that ran fifty feet into the water where it stopped at a small boathouse two of his employees no doubt master car thieves were grilling steaks on a lower deck nat sawyer brought a box of smuggled cigars two kegs of beer were on ice they drifted to the boathouse where silo neely and paul were sitting in folding lawn chairs swapping insults telling jokes chatting away about everything but football the kegs were hit hard the jokes became raunchier the laughter much louder the steaks were served around six the initial plan was to watch the spartans play that night but not a word was said about leaving the cabin by kickoff most were unable to drive silo was drunk and headed for a very bad hangover neely had one beerthen switched to soft drinks he was tired of messina and all the memories it was time to leave the town and return to the real world when he began saying goodbye they begged him to stay silo almost cried as he hugged him neely promised he would return in one year to that very cabin where they would celebrate the first anniversary of rakes death he drove paul home and left him in his driveway are you serious about coming back next year paul asked sure ill be here is that a promise yes you dont keep promises ill keep this one he drove past the lanes and did not see the rental car cameron was probably home by now a million miles from messina she might think of him once or twice in the coming days but the thoughts would not linger he drove past the home where hed lived for ten years past the park where hed played youth baseball and football the streets were empty because everyone was at rake field at the cemetery he waited until another aging exspartan finished his meditation in the dark when the figure finally stood and walked awayneely crept through the stillness he squatted low next to scotty reardons headstone and touched the fresh dirt of rakes grave he said a prayer had a tear and spent a long moment saying goodbye he drove around the empty square then through the back streets until he found the gravel trail he parked on karrs hill and for an hour sat on the hood watching and listening to the game in the distance late in the third quarter he called it quits the past was finally gone now it left with rake neely was tired of the memories and broken dreams give it up he told himself youll never be the hero again those days are gone now driving away he vowed to return more often messina was the only hometown he knew the best years of his life were there hed come back and watch the spartans on friday night sit with paul and mona and all their children party with silo and hubcap eat at renfrows drink coffee with nat sawyer and when the name of eddie rake was mentioned he would smile and maybe laugh and tell a story of his ownone with a happy ending high school allamerican neely crenshaw was probably the best quarterback ever to play for the legendary messina spartans fifteen years have gone by since those glory days andneely has come home to messina to bury coach eddie rake the man who molded the spartans into an unbeatable football dynasty now as coach rakes boys sit in the bleachers waiting for the dimming field lights to signal his passing they replay the old games relive the old glories and try to decide once and for all whether they love eddie rakeor hate him for neely crenshaw a man who must finally forgive his coachand himselfbefore he can get on with his life the stakes are especially high john grisham played at times quarterback for the chargers of southaven high school southaven mississippi he was not an ailamerican
