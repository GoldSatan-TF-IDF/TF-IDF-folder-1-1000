h winick my publicist and my literary agent and both my very dear friends tuesday october th maggie tried to open her eyes but the effort was too great her headhurt so much where was she what had happened she raised herhand but it was stopped inches above her body unable to move anyfarther instinctively she pushed at the overhead barrier but it did notmove what was it it felt soft like satin and it was cold she slid her fingers to the side and down the surface changed now it felt ruffled aquilt was she in somekind of bed she pushed out her other hand to the side and recoiled as thatpalm immediately encountered the same chill ruffles they were onboth sides of this narrow enclosure what was tugging at her ring when she moved her left hand sheran her thumb over her ring finger felt it touch string or cord butwhy then memory came rushing back her eyes opened and stared in terror into absolute darkness frantically her mind raced as she tried to piece together what hadhappened she had heard him in time to whirl around just as something crashed down on her head she remembered him bending over her whispering maggiethinkof the bell ringers after that she remembered nothing still disoriented and terrified she struggled to understand thensuddenly it came flooding back the bell ringers victorians had beenso afraid of being buried alive that it became a tradition to tie astring to their fingers before interment a string threaded through ahole in the casket stretching to the surface of the burial plot a stringwith a bell attached to it for seven days a guard would patrol the grave and listen for thesound of the bell ringing the signal that the interred wasnt deadafter all but maggie knew that no guard was listening for her she wastruly alone she tried to scream but no sound came frantically shetugged at the string straining listening hoping to hear above her afaint pealing sound but there was only silence darkness and silence she had to keep calm she had to focus how had she gotten hereshe couldnt let panic overwhelm her but how how then she remembered the funeral museum shed gone backthere alone then shed taken up the search the search that nualahad begun then hed come and oh god she was buried alive she pounded her fists on the lidof the casket but even inside the thick satin muffled the sound finally she screamed screamed until she was hoarse until she couldntscream anymore and still she was alone the bell she yanked on the string again and again surelyit was sending out sounds she couldnt hear them but someonewould they must overhead a mound of fresh raw earth shimmered in the light ofthe full moon the only movement came from the bronze bellattached to a pipe emerging from the mound the bell moved backand forth in an arrythmic dance of death round about it all wassilent its clapper had been removed friday september th i hate cocktail parties maggie thought wryly wondering why she always felt like an alien when she attended one actually im being too harsh she thought the truth is i hate cocktail parties where the only person i know is my supposed date and he abandons me the minute we come in the door she looked around the large room then sighed when liam moore payne had invited her to this reunion of the moore clan she should have guessed he would be more interested in visiting with his cousinsbythedozens than worrying about her liam an occasional but normally thoughtful date when he was in town from boston was tonight displaying a boundless faith in her ability to fend for herself well she reasoned it was a large gathering surely she could find someone to talk to it was what liam had told her about the moores that had been the factor that made her decide to accompany him to this affair she remembered as she sipped from her glass of white wine and maneuvered her way through the crowded grill room of the four seasons restaurant on manhattan s east fiftysecond street the familys founding fatheror at least the founder of the familys original wealthhad been the late squire desmond moore at one time a fixture of newport society the occasion of tonights partyreunion was to celebrate the great mans one hundred fifteenth birthday for conveniences sake it had been decided to have the gathering in new york rather than newport going into amusing detail about many members of the clan liam had explained that over one hundred descendants direct and collateral as well as some favored exinlaws would be present he had regaled her with anecdotes about the fifteenyearold immigrant from dingle who had considered himself to be not one of the huddled masses yearning to be free but rather one of the impoverished masses yearning to be rich legend claimed that as his ship passed the statue of liberty squire had announced to his fellow steerageclass passengers in no time atall ill be wealthy enough to buy the old girl should the government ever decide to sell her of course liam had delivered his forebears declaration in a wonderfully broad irish brogue the moores certainly did come in all sizes and shapes maggie reflected as she looked about the room she watched two octogenarians in animated conversation and narrowed her eyes mentally framing them through the lens of the camera she now wished she had brought the snow white hair of the man the coquettish smile on the womans face the pleasure they were obviously taking in each others companyit would have made a wonderful picture the four seasons will never be the same after the moores are finished with it liam said as he appeared suddenly beside her having a good time he asked but then without waiting for an answer introduced her to yet another cousin earl bateman who maggie was amused to note studied her with obvious and unhurried interest she judged the newcomer to be like liam in his late thirties he was half a head shorter than his cousin which made him just under six feet she decided there was something of a scholarly bent reflected in his lean face and thoughtful expression although his pale blue eyes had a vaguely disconcerting cast to them sandy haired with a sallow complexion he did not have liams rugged good looks liams eyes were more green than blue his dark hair attractively flecked with gray she waited while he continued to look her over then after a long moment with a raised eyebrow she asked will i pass inspection he looked embarrassed im sorry im not good at remembering names and i was trying to place you you are one of the clan arent you no i have irish roots going back three or four generations but im no relation to this clan im afraid it doesnt look as though you need any more cousins anyhow you couldnt be more right about that too bad though most of them arent nearly so attractive as you your wonderful blue eyes ivory skin and small bones make you a celt the nearblack hair places you among the black irish segment of the family those members who owe some of their genetic makeup to the brief but significant visit from survivors of the defeat of the spanish armada liam earl oh for the love of god i guess im glad i came after all forgetting maggie both men turned to enthusiastically greet the floridfaced man who came up behind them maggie shrugged so much for that she thought mentally retreating into a corner then she remembered an article she had recently read that urged people who felt isolated in social situations to look for someone else who seemed to be even more desperate and start a conversation chuckling to herself she decided to give that tactic a try then if she ended up still talking to herself she would slip away and go home at that moment the prospect of her pleasant apartment on fiftysixth street near the east river was very attractive she knew she should have stayed in tonight shed only been back a few days from a photo shoot in milan and longed for a quiet evening with her feet up she glanced around there didnt seem to be a single squire moore descendant or inlaw who wasnt fighting to be heard countdown to exit she decided then she heard a voice nearbya melodic familiar voice one that spurred sudden pleasant memories she spun around the voice belonged to a woman who was ascending the short staircase to the restaurants balcony area and had stopped to call to someone below her maggie stared then gasped was she crazy could it possibly be nuala it had been so long ago yet she sounded just like the woman who once had been her stepmother from the time she was five until she was ten after the divorce her father had forbidden maggie to even mention nualas name maggie noticed liam passing on his way to hail another relative and grabbed his arm liam that woman on the stairs do you know her he squinted oh thats nuala she was married to my uncle i mean i guess shes my aunt but she was his second wife so i never thought of her that way shes a bit of a character but a lot of fun why maggie did not wait to answer but began to thread her way through the clusters of moores by the time she reached the stairs the woman she sought was chatting with a group of people on the balcony level maggie started up the stairs but near the top paused to study her when nuala had left so abruptly maggie had prayed that she would write she never did though and maggie had found her silence especially painful she had come to feel so close to her during the five years the marriage had lasted her own mother had died in an automobile accident when she was an infant it was only after her fathers death that maggie learned from a family friend that her father had destroyed all the letters and returned the gifts that nuala had sent to her maggie stared now at the tiny figure with lively blue eyes and soft honeyblond hair she could see the fine skein of wrinkles that detracted not a bit from her lovely complexion and as she stared the memories flooded her heart childhood memories perhaps her happiest nuala who always took her part in arguments protesting to maggies father owen for the love of heaven shes just a child stop correcting her every minute nuala who was always saying owen all the kids her age wear jeans and tee shirts owen so what if she used up three rolls of film she loves to take pictures and shes good owen shes not just playing in mud cant you see shes trying to make something out of the clay for heavens sake recognize your daughters creativity even if you dont like my paintings nualaalways so pretty always such fun always so patient with maggies questions it had been from nuala that maggie had learned to love and understand art typically nuala was dressed tonight in a pale blue satin cocktail suit and matching high heels maggies memories of her were always pastel tinted nuala had been in her late forties when she married dad maggie thought trying to calculate her age now she made it through five years with him she left twentytwo years ago it was a shock to realize that nuala must now be in her midseventies she certainly didnt look it their eyes met nuala frowned then looked puzzled nuala had told her that her name was actually finnuala afterthe legendary celt finn maccool who brought about the downfallof a giant maggie remembered how as a little girl she had delighted in trying to pronounce finnuala finnuala she said now her voice tentative a look of total astonishment crossed the older womans face then she emitted a whoop of delight that stopped the buzz of conversations around them and maggie found herself once again enfolded in loving arms nuala was wearing the faint scent that all these years had lingered in maggies memory when she was eighteen she had discovered the scent was joy how appropriate for tonight maggie thought let me look at you nuala exclaimed releasing her and stepping back but still holding maggies arms with both hands as though afraid she would get away her eyes searched maggies face i never thought id see you again oh maggie how is that dreadful man your father he died three years ago oh im sorry darling but he was totally impossible to the end im sure never too easy maggie admitted darling i was married to him remember i know what he was like always sanctimonious dour sour petulant crabby well no use going on about it the poor man is dead may he rest in peace but he was so oldfashioned and so stiff why he could have posed for a medieval stainedglass window aware suddenly that others were openly listening nuala slid her arm around maggies waist and announced this is my child i didnt give birth to her of course but thats totally unimportant maggie realized that nuala was also blinking back tears anxious both to talk and to escape the crush of the crowded restaurant they slipped out together maggie could not find liam to say goodbye but was fairly sure she would not be missed arm in arm maggie and nuala walked up park avenue through the deepening september twilight turned west at fiftysixth street and settled in at il tinello over chianti and delicate strips of fried zucchini they caught up on each others lives for maggie it was simple boarding school i was shipped there after you left then carnegiemellon and finally a masters in visual arts from nyu im making a good living now as a photographer thats wonderful i always thought it would be either that or sculpting maggie smiled youve got a good memory i love to sculpt but i do it only as a hobby being a photographer is a lot more practical and in all honesty i guess im pretty good ive got some excellent clients now what about you nuala no lets finish with you the older woman interrupted you live in new york youve got a job you like youve stuck to developing what is a natural talent youre just as pretty as i knew youd be you were thirtytwo your last birthday what about a love interest or significant other or whatever you young people call it these days maggie felt the familiar wrench as she said flatly i was married for three years his name was paul and he graduated from the air force academy he had just been selected for the nasa program when he was killed on a training flight that was five years ago its a shock i guess i may never get over anyway its still hard to talk about him oh maggie there was a world of understanding in nualas voice maggie remembered that her stepmother had been a widow when she married her father shaking her head nuala murmured why do things like that have to happen then her tone brightened shall we order over dinner they caught up on twentytwo years after the divorce from maggies father nuala had moved to new york then visited newport where she met timothy mooresomeone she actually had dated when she was still a teenagerand married him my third and last husband she said and absolutely wonderful tim died last year and do i ever miss him he wasnt one of the wealthy moores but i have a sweet house in a wonderful section of newport and an adequate income and of course im still dabbling at painting so im all right but maggie saw a brief flicker of uncertainty cross nualas face and realized in that moment that without the brisk cheerful expression nuala looked every day of her age really all right nuala she asked quietly you seem worried oh yes im fine its just well you see i turned seventyfive last month years ago someone told me that when you get into your sixties you start to say goodbye to your friends or they say goodbye to you but that when you hit your seventies it happens all the time believe me its true ive lost a number of good friends lately and each loss hurts a little more than the last its getting to be a bit lonely in newport but theres a wonderful residencei hate the word nursing homeand im thinking of going to live there soon the kind of apartment i want there has just become available then as the waiter poured espresso she said urgently maggie come visit me please its only a threehour drive from new york id love to maggie responded you mean it absolutely now that ive found you im not going to let you get away again besides its always been in the back of my mind to go to newport i understand its a photographers paradise as a matter of fact she was about to tell nuala that as of next week she had cleared her calendar to allow time to take a muchneeded vacation when she heard someone say i thought id find you here startled maggie looked up standing over them were liam and his cousin earl bateman you ran out on me liam said reprovingly earl bent down to kiss nuala youre in hot water for spiriting away his date how do you two know each other its a long story nuala smiled earl lives in newport too she explained to maggie he teaches anthropology at hutchinson college in providence i was right about the scholarly look maggie thought liam pulled a chair from a nearby table and sat down youve got to let us have an afterdinner drink with you he smiled at earl and dont worry about earl hes strange but hes harmless his branch of the family has been in the funeral business for more than a hundred years they bury people he digs them up hes a ghoul he even makes money talking about it maggie raised her eyebrows as the others laughed i lecture on funeral customs through the ages earl bateman explained with a slight smile some may find it macabre but i love it friday september th he strode briskly along the cliff walk his hair blown by the stiff ocean breeze that had sprung up during the late afternoon the sun had been wonderfully warm at the height of the day but now its slanting rays were ineffectual against the cool wind it seemed to him that the shift in the air reflected the changing quality of his own mood till now he had been successful in his plan of action but with nualas dinner party only two hours away a premonition was coming over him nuala had become suspicious and would confide in her stepdaughter everything could start to unravel the tourists had not yet abandoned newport in fact there was an abundance of them postseason daytrippers anxious to stalk the mansions managed by the preservation society to gape at the relics of a bygone age before most of them were closed until next spring deep in thought he paused as he came to the breakers that most marvelously ostentatious jewel that american palace that breathtaking example of what money and imagination and driv ing ambition could achieve built in the early s for cornelius vanderbilt ii and his wife alice it was enjoyed only briefly by vanderbilt himself paralyzed by a stroke in he died in lingering for a moment longer in front of the breakers he smiled it was vanderbilts story that had given him the idea but now he had to act quickly picking up his pace he passed salve regina university formerly known as ochre court a hundredroom extravagance that stood splendid against the skyline its limestone walls and mansard roof beautifully preserved five minutes later he came upon it latham manor the magnificent edifice that had been a worthy more tasteful competitor to the vulgarity of the breakers originally the proud property of the eccentric latham family it had fallen into disrepair in the lifetime of the last latham rescued from ruin and restored to reflect much of its earlier grandeur it was now the residence of wealthy retirees living out their last years in opulence he stopped feasting his eyes on latham manors majestic white marble exterior he reached into the deep pocket of his windbreaker and pulled out a cellular phone he dialed quickly then smiled slightly as the voice he had hoped to hear answered it meant one thing less he had to worry about later he said two words not tonight then when a calm noncommittal voice asked after a slight pause im not sure yet i have to take care of something else his voice was sharp he did not permit questions about his decisions of course sorry breaking the connection without further comment he turned and began to walk swiftly it was time to get ready for nualas dinner party nuala moore hummed as she sliced tomatoes on the cutting board of her cheerfully untidy kitchen her movements quick and confident the late afternoon sun was about to set and a stiff breeze was rattling the window over the sink she could already feel a slight chill seeping through the poorly insulated back wall even so she knew her kitchen was warm and inviting with its redandwhite colonial paper worn redbrick linoleum and pine shelves and cabinets when she finished slicing the tomatoes she reached for the onions a tomatoandonion salad marinated in oil and vinegar and generously sprinkled with oregano was a perfect accompaniment to a roast leg of lamb her fingers were crossed that maggie still loved lamb when she was little it had been one of her favorites maybe i should have asked her nuala thought but i want to surprise her at least she knew maggie wasnt a vegetarianshe had ordered veal the night they were together in manhattan the potatoes were already bouncing in the big pot when they had finished boiling she would drain them but not mash them until the last minute a tray of biscuits was ready to pop in the oven the green beans and carrots were all prepared ready to be steamed minutes before she seated her guests nuala peered into the dining room doublechecking the table was set she had done that first thing this morning maggie would sit opposite her in the other host chair a symbolic gesture she knew cohostesses this evening like mother and daughter she leaned against the door frame for a moment reflecting it would be wonderful to have someone with whom she could at last share this terrible worry she would wait a day or two then she would say maggie i have to talk with you about something important youre right i am worried about something maybe im crazy or just an old suspicious fool but it would be so good to lay her suspicions before maggie even when she was little she had had a clear analytical mind finnuala she would begin when she wanted to share a confidence her way of letting me know that this was going to be a very serious discussion nuala remembered i should have waited until tomorrow night to have this party she thought i should have given maggie a chance to at least catch her breath oh well typical of mei always act first and think afterwards but she had wanted to show maggie off to her friends after talking about her so much and also when she asked them to dinner she had thought that maggie was arriving a day earlier but maggie had phoned yesterday to say there was a problem with one of the jobs that it was going to take a day more than expected to complete the art director is a nervous nelly and is agonizing over the shots she had explained so i cant start up until around noon tomorrow but i still should be there by four or fourthirty at four maggie had phoned nuala i tried to call a couple of times earlier but your line was busy im just now finishing up and heading out to my car no difference as long as youre on your way i just hope i arrive before your guests so ill have time to change oh it doesnt matter just drive carefully and ill ply them with cocktails till you get here its a deal im on my way thinking about the conversation nuala smiled it would have been awful if maggie had been delayed yet another day by now she should be around bridgeport she thought shell probably get caught in some commuter traffic but at least shes on her way dear god maggies on her way to me since there was nothing more she could do for the moment nuala decided to sit down and watch the early evening news that would still leave her time for a nice hot relaxing bath before people started to arrive she was about to leave the kitchen when there was a rap at the back door before she could look through the window to see who it was the handle turned for the moment she was startled but as the door opened and her visitor stepped in she smiled warmly hello there she said good to see you but youre not due for a couple of hours so you cant stay long i dont plan to stay long her visitor said quietly after his mother moved to florida selling the house that had been old squires wedding present to liams grandmother liam moore payne had bought a condominium on willow street he used it regularly during the summer but even after his sailboat was put into storage at the end of the season he frequently would come down from boston on weekends to escape the hectic world of international finance the condo a spacious fourroom unit with high ceilings and a terrace overlooking narragansett bay was furnished with the choice contents of the family home when she had moved his mother had said these things dont work in florida and anyhow i never cared for any of it you take them youre like your father you love this heavy old stuff as liam stepped from the shower and reached for a bath towel he thought of his father was he really so much like him he wondered upon arriving home after a day of trading on the evermercurial market his father always had gone straight to the bar in the study and prepared himself a very dry very cold martini he would sip it slowly then visibly relaxed he would go upstairs to bathe and dress for the evening liam toweled vigorously half smiling at the thought that he and his father were very much alike although they differed on the details his fathers almost ritualistic soaks would have driven liam crazy he preferred a bracing shower also he preferred his martini after he had bathed not before ten minutes later liam stood at the bar in his study carefully pouring finlandia vodka into a chilled and icefilled silver goblet and stirring then straining the drink into a delicate stemmed glass he drizzled a drop or two of olive juice over the surface hesitated and with an appreciative sigh took the first sip amen he said aloud it was ten of eight he was due at nualas in ten minutes and while it would take at least nine minutes to drive there he wasnt worried about being precisely on time anyone who knew nuala was aware that her cocktail hour was apt to last at least until nine and sometimes later liam decided to allow himself a little downtime he sank onto the handsome couch covered in dark brown moroccan leather and carefully placed his feet on an antique coffee table that was shaped to resemble a stack of ancient ledgers he closed his eyes it had been a long and stressful week but the weekend promised to be interesting maggies face floated into his mind it was a remarkable coincidence that she happened to have a tie to newport a very strong tie as it turned out he had been astonished when he had learned of her connection to nuala he remembered how upset he had been when he realized that maggie had left the party at the four seasons without telling him angry at himself for so thoroughly neglecting her he had been anxious to find her and straighten out the situation when his inquiries revealed that maggie had been seen leaving with nuala before dinner he had had a hunch that they might be at il tinello for a young woman maggie was pretty much set in her ways maggie he pictured her for a moment her beautiful face the intelligence and energy that she radiated liam sipped the last of the martini and with a sigh hoisted himself out of his comfortable spot time to go he thought he checked his appearance at the foyer mirror noting that the redandblue hermès tie his mother had sent for his birthday went well enough with his navy blazer although a traditional stripe might be better with a shrug he decided not to worry about it it really was time to go he picked up his key ring and locking the door behind him set off for nualas dinner party earl bateman was stretched out on the couch a glass of wine in his hand the book hed just finished on the table beside him he knew it was time to change for nualas dinner party but he was enjoying a sense of leisure using the moment to contemplate the events of the past week before coming down from providence he had finished grading the papers turned in by his anthropology class and was pleased to note that all but a few of the students had performed at the a or b level it would be an interestingand perhaps challengingsemester with them he decided and now he could look forward to newport weekends mercifully free of the crowds jamming restaurants and traffic tieups so typical of the summer season earl lived in the guest wing of the family home squire hall the house squire moore had built for his youngest daughter on the occasion of her marriage to gordon bateman the ghoul as squire called him because the batemans had been funeral directors for four generations of all the residences he had presented his seven children it was by far the smallest a reflection of the fact that he had been opposed to the marriage nothing personal but squire had a horror of dying and even forbade the word death to be mentioned in his presence to take into the family bosom the man who undoubtedly would attend to the rituals surrounding his own demise was a continual reminder of the forbidden word gordon batemans reaction had been to convince his wife to name their home squire hall a mocking tribute to his fatherinlaw and a subtle reminder that none of his other children had thought to so honor him earl had always believed that his own given name was another jab at squire since the old man had always tried to convey the impression that hed been named for generations of moores who in the county of dingle had had the courtesy title of squire a squire in dingle tugged his forelock in homage to an earl after earl finally convinced his father that he had no inten tion of becoming the next bateman funeral director his parents sold the mortuary to a private corporation that retained the family name and hired a manager to run it his parents now spent nine months of the year in south carolina near his married sisters and had urged earl to take over the entire house during those months an offer he declined the wing was arranged to his liking with his books and artifacts locked away in glassfronted cabinets against the possibility of careless dusting he also had a sweeping view of the atlantic earl found the sea infinitely calming calm that was perhaps the word he valued most at the noisy new york reunion of squire moores descendants as much as possible he had stayed on the sidelines where he could simply observe the lot of them he tried not to be too judgmental but he did not join in their can you top this tales his cousins all seemed to be given to bragging about how well they were doing and like liam they all loved to regale each other with farfetched stories about their eccentricand occasionally ruthlessancestor earl also knew how gleefully some of them seized on his fathers background as a fourthgeneration funeral director at the reunion he had overheard two of them belittling him and making snide jokes about undertakers and their profession a pox on the lot of them he thought now as he swung his feet to the floor and sat up it was ten of eight time to get a move on he wasnt looking forward to going to nualas dinner party tonight but on the other hand maggie holloway would be there she was extremely attractive yes her presence would ensure that the evening would not be dull dr william lane director of the latham manor residence looked at his watch for the third time in five minutes he and his wife were due at nuala moores place at eight oclock it was ten of eight now a large balding man in his fifties dr lane had a soothing bedside manner with his patientsan attitude of forbearance that did not extend to his thirtynineyearold wife odile he called for gods sake get a move on right with you her voice breathy and musical floated down the stairs of their home a structure that once had been the carriage house of latham manor a moment later she rushed into the living room still fastening an earring i was reading to mrs patterson she said you know how it is william shes not used to the residence yet and she resents the fact that her son sold her house out from under her shell settle in lane said dismissively everyone else seems to have managed to end up being quite happy here i know but it sometimes takes a while i still say a little tlc while a new guest is adjusting is important odile walked to the mirror over the carved marble fireplace how do i look she smiled at her wideeyed blondhaired reflection you look lovely you always do lane said shortly what do you know about this stepdaughter of nualas nuala told me all about her when she visited greta shipley last monday her name is maggie and nuala was married to her father years ago shes going to stay for two weeks nuala seems very happy about it dont you think thats sweet that they met each other again without answering dr lane opened the front door then stood aside youre in a great mood odile thought as she walked past him and down the steps to the car for a moment she paused and looked at latham manor its marble façade glistening in the moonlight hesitantly she suggested i meant to tell you that when i looked in on mrs hammond she was a bit out of breath and rather pale i wonder if you should check her before we go were late already dr lane replied impatiently as he opened the car door if im needed i can be back in ten minutes but i can assure you that mrs hammond will be all right tonight malcolm norton was not looking forward to the evening a silverhaired man with an erect military posture he made an imposing appearance it was an appearance however that concealed a troubled mind nualas call three days ago asking him to come to dinner tonight and meet her stepdaughter had been a shocknot the invitation to dinner itself but the unexpected news that nuala had a stepdaughter a lawyer with a general practice working alone norton had seen his client list reduced drastically in the past few years partly through attritionhe had become almost expert at handling estates of the deceasedbut also due he was certain to the arrival of several young aggressive lawyers in the area nuala moore was one of his few remaining clients and he thought he knew her affairs inside out never once had she mentioned this stepdaughter for some time malcolm norton had been quietly urging nuala to sell her home and become a resident of latham manor until recently she had shown signs of agreeing that it would be a good move she admitted that since her husband tim had died the house was lonely and it was beginning to cost more and more in repairs i know it needs a new roof that the heating system is antiquated and anyone who bought it would want to put in central airconditioning she had told him do you think i could get two hundred thousand for it he had reacted carefully responding nuala the real estate market here falls apart after labor day maybe next summer wed get that much but i want to see you settled if youre ready to move to latham now ill take the house off your hands for that price and do some basic fixing up ill get my money back eventually and you wont have any more expenditures on it with tims insurance money and the house sale you could have the best accommodation at latham maybe even turn one room of a suite into a studio for yourself id like that ill put in my application nuala had said at the time then she had kissed his cheek youve been a good friend malcolm ill draw up the papers youre making a good decision what malcolm had not told nuala was something a friend in washington had passed along a proposed change in environmental protection legislation was sure to go through which meant that some property now protected by the wetlands preservation act would be freed from development restrictions the entire right end of nualas property would be included in that change drain the pond cut down a few trees and the view of the ocean would be spectacular malcolm reasoned moneyed people wanted that view they would pay plenty for the prop erty would probably even tear down the old house and build one three times the size facing the ocean by his calculations the property alone would be worth a million dollars if it all went as planned he should turn over an eighthundredthousanddollar profit within the next year or two then he would be able to get on with his life with the profit he would make from the sale of the property he would have enough cash to settle with his wife janice retire and move to florida with barbara how his life had changed since barbara started working for him as a legal secretary seven years younger than he she was a very pretty widow of fiftysix her children were grown and scattered so she had taken the job in his office just to keep busy it wasnt long however before the mutual attraction between them was palpable she had all the warmth janice had never offered him but she wasnt the kind who would get involved in an office affairthat much she had made clear if he wanted her he would have to come to her as a single man and all it would take to make that happen was money he told himself then well are you ready malcolm looked up his wife of thirtyfive years was standing before him her arms folded if you are he said he had been late getting home and had gone directly to his bedroom this was the first time he had seen janice since this morning what kind of day did you have he asked politely what kind of day do i always have she snapped keeping books in a nursing home but at least one of us is bringing home a regular paycheck at pm neil stephens managing director of carson amp parker investment corporation stood up and stretched he was the only one left in the office at world trade center except for the cleaning crew whom he could hear vacuuming somewhere down the hall as the firms senior executive he had a large corner office that afforded him a sweeping view of manhattan a view which unfortunately he had little time to savor that had been the case today especially the market had been extremely volatile the last few days and some of the stocks on the c ampp highly recommended list had reported disappointing earnings the stocks were all solid most of them blue chips and a dip in price now wasnt really a problem what was a problem was that too many smaller investors then became anxious to sell so it was up to him and his staff to convince them to be patient well enough for today neil thought its time to get out of here he looked around for his jacket and spotted it on one of the chairs in the conversation area a grouping of comfortable furniture that gave the room what the interior designer had called a clientfriendly atmosphere grimacing as he saw how wrinkled his jacket had become he shook it and thrust his arms into the sleeves neil was a big man who at thirtyseven managed to keep his body muscle from sliding into fat by a program of disciplined exercise including racquetball sessions two nights a week the results of his efforts were apparent and he was a compellingly attractive man with penetrating brown eyes that bespoke intelligence and an easy smile that inspired confidence and in fact that confidence was well placed for as his associates and friends knew neil stephens missed very little he smoothed down the sleeves of his jacket remembering that his assistant trish had hung it up this morning but pointedly ignored it when he had once again tossed it down after lunch the other assistants get mad at me if i wait on you too much she had told him besides i do enough picking up after my husband how much can a woman take neil smiled at the memory but then the smile faded as he realized that he had forgotten to call maggie to get her phone number in newport just this morning he had decided to go to portsmouth next weekend for his mothers birthday that would put him just minutes away from newport maggie had told him she would be staying there for a couple of weeks with her stepmother he had thought they would get together there he and maggie had been dating casually since early spring when they met in a bagel shop on second avenue around the corner from their east fiftysixth street apartment buildings they had begun chatting there whenever their paths crossed they then bumped into each other one evening at the movies they sat together and later walked over to nearys pub for dinner initially neil liked the fact that maggie apparently took the dates as casually as he did there was no indication on her part that she viewed the two of them as anything more than friends with a shared interest in movies she seemed as wrapped up in her job as he was in his however after six months of these occasional dates the fact that maggie continued to act uninterested in him as anything other than a pleasant film and dinner companion was beginning to annoy neil without realizing it was happening he had found himself becoming more and more intent on seeing her on learning all he could about her he knew that she had been widowed five years ago something that she mentioned matteroffactly her tone suggesting that emotionally she had put that behind her but now he had started wondering whether she had a serious boyfriend wondering and being worried about it after puzzling for a minute neil decided to see if maybe maggie had left her newport number on her answering machine back at his desk he listened to her recorded message hi this is maggie holloway thanks for calling im out of town until october th the machine clicked off obviously she wasnt interested in getting messages great he thought glumly as he replaced the receiver and walked over to the window manhattan stretched before him ablaze with lights he looked at the east river bridges and remembered that when he had told maggie his office was on the fortysecond floor of the world trade center she had told him about the first time she had gone for a cocktail at windows on the world atop the center it was just becoming dusk the lights of the bridges went on and then all the building and streetlights started glowing it was like watching a highborn victorian lady put on her jewelrynecklace bracelets rings even a tiara the vivid image had stayed with neil he had another image of maggie as well but this one troubled him three weeks ago on saturday he had dropped in to cinema i to see the thirtyyearold french classic a man and awoman the theater wasnt crowded and halfway through the film he had noticed that maggie was sitting alone a few rows ahead of him four seats over he had been about to join her when he realized that she was crying silent tears coursed down her cheeks and she held her hand to her mouth to prevent sobs as she watched the story of a young widow who could not accept her husbands death he had hurried out while the credits rolled not wanting her to see him thinking that she would be embarrassed to be caught so emotionally vulnerable later that evening he had been in nearys having dinner with friends when she came in she had stopped by his table to say hello then had joined a group at the big corner table there had been nothing in her face or manner to indicate that earlier she had been watching a film and identifying with a heartbroken young widow damn neil thought shes gone for at least two weeks and i have no way to reach her i dont even have the faintest idea of her stepmothers name except for that uptight art director it had been a good week maggie reflected as she turned off route in newport both photo shoots this week had turned out exceptionally well especially the one for vogue but after the meticulous attention she had to give to noting how the camera was capturing every fold of the astronomically priced gowns she was photographing it was a distinct joy to put on jeans and a plaid shirt in fact with the exception of a blue silk print blouse and matching long skirt she planned to wear tonight for nualas dinner party everything she had brought to wear on this vacation was quite casual were going to have such fun she thought two uninter rupted weeks in newport nuala and i really will have a chance to catch up with each other she smiled at the prospect it had been a surprise when liam called to say that he would be at nualas tonight as well although she should have realized he spent a fair amount of time in newport its an easy drive from boston he had pointed out i go there fairly regularly for weekends especially offseason i didnt know that she had said theres a lot you dont know about me maggie maybe if you werent out of town so much and maybe if you didnt live in boston and use your new york apartment so little maggie smiled again liam is fun she thought even though he does take himself too seriously much of the time stopping at a red light she glanced down and rechecked her directions nuala lived just off the fabled ocean drive on garrison avenue i even have a view of the ocean from the third floor she had explained wait till you see it and my studio she had called three times this week to be sure there were no changes of plan you are coming maggie you wont disappoint of course not she had assured her still maggie had wondered if it was only her imagination or was there something in nualas voice an uneasiness that perhaps she had detected in her face the night they had dinner in manhattan at the time she had rationalized that nualas husband had died only last year and she was starting to lose her friends as well one of the nonjoys of living long enough to get old naturally a sense of mortality has to be setting in she reasoned she had seen the same look on the faces of nursing home residents she had photographed for life magazine last year one woman had said wistfully sometimes it bothers me a lot that theres no one left who remembers me when i was young maggie shivered then realized the temperature in the car had dropped rapidly turning off the airconditioning she opened the window a few inches and sniffed the tangy scent of the sea that permeated the air when youve been raised in the midwest she thought you cant ever get enough of the ocean checking her watch she realized it was ten of eight she would barely have time to freshen up and change before the other guests began to arrive at least she had phoned nuala to let her know she was getting off to a late start she had told her she should be arriving just about now she turned onto garrison avenue and saw the ocean in front of her she slowed the car then stopped in front of a charming clapboard house with weathered shingles and a wraparound porch this had to be nualas home she thought but it seemed so dark there were no outside lights turned on at all and she could detect only a faint light coming from the front windows she pulled into the driveway got out and without bothering to open the trunk for her suitcase ran up the steps expectantly she rang the bell from inside she could hear the faint sound of chimes as she waited she sniffed the windows facing the street were open and she thought she detected a harsh burning smell coming from inside she pressed the doorbell again and again the chimes reverberated through the house there was still no answer no sound of footsteps something has to be wrong she thought anxiously where was nuala maggie walked over to the nearest window and crouched down straining to see past the lacy fringe on the partly drawn shade into the darkness inside then her mouth went dry the little she could see of the shadowy room suggested it was in wild disorder the contents of a drawer were strewn on the hooked carpet and the drawer itself was leaning haphazardly against the ottoman the fireplace was opposite the windows and flanked by cabinets all of them were open what faint light there was came from a pair of sconces over the mantel as her eyes adjusted to the dim light maggie was able to pick out a single highheeled shoe turned on its side in front of the fireplace what was that she squinted and leaned forward then realized she was seeing a small stockinged foot extending from behind a love seat near where the shoe had fallen she lunged back to the door and twisted the handle but it was locked blindly she rushed to the car grabbed the car phone and punched in then she stopped remembering her phone was attached to a new york area code this was rhode island nualas number began with a area code with trembling fingers she punched in when the call was answered she managed to say im at garrison avenue in newport i cant get in i can see someone lying on the floor i think its nuala im babbling she told herself stop it but as the calm unhurried questions came from the dispatcher with absolute certainty maggies mind was shouting three words nuala is dead newport chief of police chet brower stood aside as the police photographer snapped pictures of the crime scene aside from the wrenching fact that someone in his jurisdiction had been savagely murderednuala moore had suffered multiple blows to her headthere was something about the entire picture that bothered him there had been no reported incidents of housebreaking in this area for several months that kind of thing started when many houses were closed for the winter and so became favorite targets for looters looking for television sets and such amazing how many people still didnt have an alarm system brower thought amazing too how many people were careless about locking their doors the chief had been in the first squad car to answer the call when they had arrived at the house and the young woman who identified herself as mrs moores stepdaughter pointed to the front window he had looked in and seen just what she had reported before forcing the front door he and detective jim haggerty had gone to the back of the house careful to barely touch the doorknob to avoid smudging existing fingerprints he had found the door unlocked and they had gone in a flame was still flickering under a pot now burned black the acrid smell of charred potatoes overwhelmed the other more pleasant scent roasting lamb his mind had registered automatically he had turned off the stoves burners before going through the dining room into the living room he hadnt realized that the stepdaughter had followed them until they reached the body and he heard her moan oh nuala finnuala she had said as she sank to her knees she reached out her hand toward the body but he grabbed it dont touch her at that moment the front doorbell chimed and he remembered noticing that the table in the dining room was set for company approaching sirens announced that more squad cars were on the scene and in the next few minutes the officers had managed to get the stepdaughter and other arriving guests into a neighbors house everyone was told not to leave until the chief had a chance to talk to them chief brower looked up eddie sousa a rookie cop was beside him some of the folks waiting to talk to you are getting kind of restless browers lifelong habit of frowning whether in deep thought or annoyance furrowed the skin of his forehead the cause this time was annoyance tell them ill be over in ten minutes he said testily before leaving he walked through the house once more the place was a mess even the thirdfloor studio had been ransacked art supplies were thrown on the floor as though hastily examined and discarded drawers and cabinets had been emptied not too many intruders who had just committed murder would have taken the time for so thorough a search he reasoned also it would seem obvious from the overall appearance of the house that no money had been spent on it in a long time so what was there to steal he wondered the three secondfloor bedrooms had been subjected to the same search one of them was tidy except for the open closet door and yankedout dresser drawers the bedding had been turned back and it was obvious the linen was fresh it was browers guess that this room had been prepared for the stepdaughter the contents of the largest bedroom were scattered everywhere a pink leather jewelry chest the same kind he once gave his wife for christmas was open what was obviously costume jewelry was scattered on the surface of the maple lowboy brower made a note to ask nuala moores friends about any valuable jewelry she might have had he spent a long moment studying the bedroom of the deceased in its disarray whoever did this wasnt a vicious common thief or a drugaddicted burglar he decided he had been looking for something or she had been looking for something he amended nuala moore had apparently realized her life was in danger from the look of things his guess was that she had been running in an attempt to escape when she was struck down from behind anyone could have done thatman or woman it didnt require great strength and there was something else brower noticed moore had obviously been preparing dinner which suggested she was in the kitchen when the intruder arrived she had tried to escape her attacker by running through the dining room which meant the intruder must have been blocking the kitchen door he or she probably came in that way and since there was no sign of forced entry the door must have been unlocked unless of course mrs moore had let the intruder in herself brower made a note to check later whether the lock was the kind that stayed open once it was released but now he was ready to talk to the dinner guests he left detective haggerty to wait for the coroner no thank you maggie said as she pressed her index fingers to her temples she vaguely realized that she hadnt eaten since noon ten hours ago but the thought of food made her throat close not even a cup of tea maggie she looked up the kind solicitous face of irma woods nualas nextdoor neighbor hovered over her it was easier to nod assent than to continue to refuse the offer and to her surprise the mug warmed her chilled fingers and the nearscalding tea felt good going down they were in the family room of the woodses home a house much bigger than nualas family pictures were scattered on tabletops as well as on the mantelchildren and grandchildren she supposed the woodses appeared to be contemporaries of nuala despite all the stress and confusion maggie thought she had the others straight the ones who were to have been the dinner guests there was dr william lane the director of latham manor which she gathered was a senior citizens residence a large balding man somewhere in his fifties dr lane had a soothing quality about him as he expressed his condolences he had tried to give her a mild sedative but maggie had refused she found that even the mildest of sedatives could make her sleepy for days maggie observed that whenever dr lanes very pretty wife odile said anything her hands began to move nuala came to visit her friend greta shipley at the home almost every day she had explained her fingers gesturing in a comehither movement as though inviting someone to come closer then she shook her head and clasped her fingers together as though in prayer greta will be heartbroken heartbroken she repeated decisively odile had already made the same remark several times and maggie found herself wishing she wouldnt say it again but this time odile amended it with an additional remark and everyone in her art class will miss her so much the guests who attended it were having so much fun oh dear i didnt even think of that until this moment that would be like nuala maggie thought to share her talent with others a vivid memory of nuala giving her her own palette for her sixth birthday flooded her mind and im going to teach you how to paint lovely pictures nuala had said only it didnt happen that way because i was never any good maggie thought it wasnt until she put clay in my hands that art became real to me malcolm norton who had introduced himself to maggie as nualas lawyer was standing at the fireplace he was a handsome man but it seemed to her that he was striking a pose there was something superficialalmost artificialabout him she thought somehow his expression of grief and his statement i was her friend and confidant as well as her lawyer suggested that he felt he was the one who deserved sympathy but then why should anyone think im the one to receive condolences she asked herself they all know that ive only just met nuala again after over twenty years nortons wife janice spent most of the time talking quietly to the doctor an athletic type she might have been attractive except for the downward lines at the corners of her mouth that gave her a harsh even bitter expression thinking about that maggie wondered at the way her mind was dealing with the shock of nualas death on the one hand she hurt so much on the other she was observing these people as though through a cameras eye liam and his cousin earl sat near each other in matching fireside chairs when liam came in he had put his arm around her and said maggie how horrible for you but then he seemed to understand that she needed physical and mental space to absorb this by herself and he did not take the place next to her on the love seat love seat maggie thought it was behind the love seat that they had found nualas body earl bateman leaned forward his hands clasped in front of him as though in deep thought maggie had met him only on the night of the moore reunion but she remembered that he was an anthropologist who lectured on funeral customs had nuala indicated to anyone what kind of funeral she would want maggie wondered maybe malcolm norton the lawyer would know the sound of the doorbell made everyone look up the police chief maggie had followed into nualas house now came into the room im sorry to have detained you he said several of my men will take your individual statements so we will have you out of here as soon as possible first though i have some questions i want to ask you as a group mr and mrs woods i wish youd stay too the chiefs questions were general things like was mrs moore in the habit of leaving her back door unlocked the woodses told him that she always left it unlocked that she even joked about forever mislaying the key to the front door but she knew she could always sneak in the back he asked if she had seemed troubled recently unanimously they reported that nuala had been happy and excited and looking forward to maggies visit maggie felt tears sting the back of her eyes and then the realization came but she was troubled it was only when chief brower said now if youll just bear with us a few minutes more while my men ask you each a few questions i promise you well have you home soon that irma woods timidly interrupted there is just one thing that maybe we ought to explain yesterday nuala came over she had handwritten a new will and wanted us to witness her signature she also had us call mr martin a notary public so that he could make it official she seemed a bit upset because she said that she knew mr norton might be disappointed that she was canceling the sale of her house to him irma woods looked at maggie nualas will asks that you visit or phone her friend greta shipley at latham manor as often as you can possibly manage it except for a few charitable bequests she left her house and everything else she owned to you monday september th it was obvious that maggie holloway was not satisfied with the theory that an intruder had murdered nuala he had seen that at the funeral parlor now at the requiem mass he watched with narrowed eyes when she shook her head in disbelief as the priest spoke about the random violence that today claims so many innocent lives maggie was much too smart too observant she could easily become a threat but as they filed out of st marys church he comforted himself with the thought that undoubtedly she would now go back to new york and put nualas house up for sale and we know whos going to step in there with an offer before she leaves he thought he was glad to note that greta shipley had been accompanied by a nurse when she arrived at the mass and then had had to leave almost immediately afterwards maggie would probably pay her a courtesy call at the residence before she took off he stirred restlessly at least the mass was nearly over the soloist was singing here i am lord and the casket was being wheeled slowly down the aisle he didnt really want to go to the cemetery now although he knew there was no way out of it later he would go there later and alone as with the others his special gift would be a private memorial to her he filed out of the church with the thirty or so others who accompanied nuala to her final resting place it was the cemetery in which many of newport s more prominent longtime catholic residents were buried nualas grave was beside that of her last husband the legend on the marble would soon be complete next to timothy james moores name and birth and death dates her name and birth date were already inscribed soon fridays date would be added rest in peace was already there he forced himself to look solemn as the final prayers were read rather too rapidly he thought on the other hand it was obvious that the dark clouds above were about to release a heavy torrent of rain when the service ended irma woods invited everyone back to her house for refreshments he reasoned that it would be awkward to refuse and besides it would be a good time to learn exactly when maggie holloway planned to leave go away maggie he thought youll only get in trouble here an hour later as the guests mingled and chatted drinks and sandwiches in their hands he was stunned to hear irma woods tell maggie that the cleaning service had completed straightening the house and removing the mess created by the police when they had dusted for fingerprints so the house is ready for you maggie mrs woods told her but are you sure you wont be nervous there you know youre welcome to continue staying here trying to seem casual he moved closer straining to hear his back was turned toward them as maggie said no i wont be nervous in nualas home id intended to stay two weeks and so i shall ill use the time to sort out everything and of course to visit greta shipley at latham manor as nuala requested he stiffened as she added mrs woods youve been so kind i cant thank you enough theres just one thing when nuala came to see you friday morning with that handwritten will didnt you question her i mean werent you surprised that she was so anxious to have it witnessed and notarized so intent on having it done at once it seemed to him that an eternity passed before mrs woods answered her response measured well yes i did wonder at first i just thought it was impulsive nuala had been very lonely since tim died and was absolutely ecstatic that shed found you but since her death ive been thinking that there was more to it than that it was almost as if nuala knew something terrible might happen to her he drifted toward the fireplace joining a group gathered there he responded to their remarks but his mind was racing maggie would be visiting greta shipley how much did greta know how much did she suspect something had to be done it could not be risked greta obviously she was not well everyone had seen her helped out of church today everyone would believe that the shock of her friends death had contributed to a fatal heart attack unexpected of course but not really a surprise sorry greta he thought when she was still a relatively young age sixtyeight greta shipley had been invited to a reception at the newly renovated latham house just rechristened the latham manor residence the new home for retirees was open and was accepting applications she liked everything she saw there the houses magnificent first floor included the grand salon and marble and crystal dining room where the enormous banquet table she remembered from her youth had been replaced by smaller tables the handsome library with its deep leather chairs and cheerful fireplace was inviting and the smaller salon which would serve as a television room suggested shared evenings of companionable viewing greta also approved of the regulations the social hour would begin at pm in the grand salon followed by dinner at six she was pleased that guests would be required to dress for the evening as though they were dining in a country club greta had been raised by a stern grandmother who could wither with a glance the luckless individual garbed in inappropriate attire any residents not up to dressing appropriately would be served in their own quarters there also was a section set aside for longterm nursing care should that be required the admission fee was steep of course it began at two hundred thousand dollars for a large private room and bath and climbed to five hundred thousand for a twobedroom suite of which there were four in the mansion and while the resident got full and exclusive use of the apartment during his or her lifetime at the time of death ownership reverted to the residence which would make the rooms available for sale to the next applicant guests would also pay a maintenance fee of two thousand dollars a month which of course was partially covered by social security payments guests were invited to furnish their own quarters but only with staff approval of what they chose to bring the model studios and apartments were exquisitely comfortable and impeccably tasteful recently widowed and nervous about living alone greta had gladly sold her home on ochre point moved to latham manor and felt she had made a good decision as one of the first occupants she had a select studio large with a living area alcove it accommodated all her most treasured furnishings and best of all when she closed her door it was with the secure sense of not being alone in the night there always was a guard on the premises a nurse on duty and a bell to summon help if necessary greta enjoyed the companionship of most of the other residents and easily avoided the ones who got on her nerves she also kept up her long friendship with nuala moore they often went out to lunch together and at gretas request nuala agreed to give art classes twice a week at the residence after timothy moore died greta had begun a campaign to get nuala to move to the residence when nuala demurred saying she would be fine alone and insisting further that she couldnt do without her art studio greta urged her to at least put in her application so that when one of the twobedroom suites became available she would be in a position to change her mind nuala had finally agreed admitting that her lawyer was encouraging her to do the same thing but now that would never happen greta thought sadly as she sat in her easy chair the virtually untouched dinner tray in front of her she was still upset that she had experienced that weak spell at nualas funeral earlier in the day she had been feeling perfectly fine until this morning perhaps if she had taken time to eat a proper breakfast it wouldnt have happened she reasoned she simply could not allow herself to become ill now especially now she wanted to keep as active as possible being busy was the only way to work out grief life had taught her that she also knew it wasnt going to be easy for she would miss nualas cheerful presence very much it was reassuring to know that nualas stepdaughter maggie holloway would be visiting her at the funeral parlor yesterday before the service maggie had introduced herself and said mrs shipley i hope youre going to let me spend time with you i know you were nualas closest friend i want to make you my friend too there was a tap at the door greta liked the fact that unless they had reason to suspect a problem the staff was instructed to enter a guests room only when invited nurse markey however didnt seem to understand just because the door isnt locked doesnt mean that she is free to barge in at any time some appeared to like the intrusive nurses greta did not predictably before greta could respond to the knock nurse markey strode in a professional smile wreathing her strong features how are we doing tonight mrs shipley she asked loudly as she came over and perched on the hassock her face uncomfortably close to gretas im quite fine thank you miss markey i hope you are the solicitous we always irritated greta she had mentioned that fact several times but this woman clearly did not intend to change anything so why bother greta asked herself suddenly she realized that her heartbeat was beginning to accelerate i hear we had a weak spell in church greta put her hand on her chest as though by that act she could stop the wild pounding mrs shipley whats the matter are you all right greta felt her wrist being seized as suddenly as it had begun the pounding slackened she managed to say just give me a moment ill be fine i just felt a little breathless thats all i want you to lean back and close your eyes im going to call dr lane nurse markeys face was barely inches from hers now instinctively greta turned away ten minutes later propped up on pillows in bed greta tried to reassure the doctor that the little spell she had had was completely past but later as she drifted off to sleep with the help of a mild sedative she could not escape the chilling memory of how just two weeks ago constance rhinelander who had been here so briefly had died of heart failure so unexpectedly first constance she thought then nuala grandmothers housekeeper used to say that deaths come in threes please dont let me be the third she thought as she drifted off no it had not been a nightmare it really had happened the full reality of events of the past few days settled firmly in maggies mind as she stood in nualas kitchen in the house that now incredibly was hers at three oclock liam had helped carry her bags here from the woodses guest room he had left them at the top of the stairs do you know which bedroom youre going to use he had asked no maggie you look ready to collapse are you sure you want to stay here i dont think its such a hot idea yes she had replied after a thoughtful pause i do want to stay now as she put the kettle on maggie reflected with gratitude that one of liams nicest qualities was that he didnt argue instead of objecting further he had said simply then ill leave you alone but i do hope youll rest for a while dont start unpacking or trying to sort out nualas things certainly not tonight ill call you tomorrow at the door he had put an arm around her and given her a friendly hug then he was gone feeling suddenly exhausted moving as though it was an effort to put one foot in front of the other maggie had locked the front and back doors then climbed the stairs glancing through the bedrooms she saw immediately that the one nuala had meant her to have was the second largest it was simply furnished a maple double bed a dresser with mirror a night table and rocking chairand there were no personal effects around the dresser top held only an oldfashioned enamel toiletry set comb brush mirror buttonhook and nail file after dragging her bags into that room maggie had peeled off her skirt and sweater slipped into her favorite robe and climbed under the covers now after a nearly threehour nap and aided by a cup of tea she was finally beginning to feel clearheaded she even sensed that she was over the shock of nualas death the sadness though thats another story she thought that wont go away she realized suddenly that for the first time in four days she was hungry she opened the refrigerator and saw that it had been stocked eggs milk juice a small roasted chicken a loaf of bread and a container of homemade chicken soup obviously mrs woods she thought she settled on making herself a chicken sandwich slicing and skinning the chicken and using only a trace of mayonnaise she had just gotten comfortable at the table when she was startled by a rap at the back door she spun around and was on her feet even as the handle turned her body tense poised to react she gasped with relief as earl batemans face appeared in the oval window that comprised most of the top half of the door chief brower theorized that nuala had been surprised by an intruder in this kitchen an intruder who had come in the back door that thought and the mental image it conjured up ran through her mind as she quickly crossed the room part of her worried if she was doing the right thing to even open the door but now more annoyed than worried for her safety she unlocked it and let him in the absentminded professor look that she associated with bateman was more in evidence at that moment than at any time in the last three days maggie forgive me he said im heading back to providence until friday and as i got in the car it occurred to me that you might not have locked this door i know that nuala was in the habit of leaving it unlocked i spoke to liam and he mentioned that he had left you here earlier and thought you were going to go to bed i didnt mean to intrude i thought id just drive by and check and slip the lock myself if it wasnt set im sorry but from the front of the house there was no sign that you were still up you could have phoned im one of those holdouts who doesnt have a phone in the car sorry i never was much good at playing the boy scout and ive interrupted your dinner its okay it was just a sandwich would you like something no thanks im on my way maggie knowing how nuala felt about you i think i have a sense of how special your relationship with her was yes it was special if i may give you one bit of advice its to heed the words of the great researcher durkheim on the subject of death he wrote sorrow like joy becomes exalted and amplified when leaping from mind to mind what are you trying to tell me maggie asked quietly im distressing you and thats the last thing i want to do what i mean is that i suspect you have the habit of hugging grief to yourself its easier if you are more open at a time like this i guess what im attempting to say is that id like to be your friend he opened the door ill be back friday afternoon double lock the door please he was gone maggie snapped the lock and sank into a chair the kitchen was suddenly frighteningly still and she realized she was trembling how could earl bateman have thought she would be grateful to him for appearing unannounced and surreptitiously trying the lock she rose and with quick silent steps ran through the dining room into the dark front room and knelt at the window to look out under the fringe of the shade she saw bateman walking down the path to the street at his car he opened the door then turned and stood for a long moment staring back at the house maggie had the feeling that even though she was surely hidden by the dark interior of the house earl bateman knew or at least sensed that she was watching him the torchlight at the end of the driveway shone a pool of light near him and as she watched bateman stepped into the light and gave a broad wave of his hand a farewell gesture clearly directed at her he cant see me she thought but he knows im here tuesday october st when the phone rang at am robert stephens reached with his left hand to answer it while his right maintained a firm hold on his coffee cup his good morning was a trifle curt his wife of fortythree years noted with amusement dolores stephens knew that her husband did not appreciate early morning phone calls anything that can be said at eight can wait until nine was his axiom usually these calls were from one of the seniorcitizen clients whose taxes he handled he and dolores had come to portsmouth three years ago looking to retire but robert decided to keep his hand in as he put it by taking on a few selected clients within six months he had all he could handle the hint of annoyance disappeared quickly from his voice as he said neil how are you neil dolores exclaimed her tone immediately apprehensive oh i hope hes not going to say he cant make it this weekend she murmured her husband waved her into silence the weather great couldnt be better im not taking the boat out of the water yet you can get up thursday wonderful your mother will be delighted shes grabbing the receiver you know how impatient she is fine ill call the club for a two oclock teeoff dolores got on the line and heard the amused voice of her only child arent you impatient this morning he said i know its just that it will be so good to see you im so glad youre able to come and you will stay till sunday wont you neil of course looking forward to it okay gotta run tell dad his good morning sounded more like go to hell he still hasnt finished that first cup of coffee huh you got it bye dear the parents of neil stephens looked at each other dolores sighed the one thing i miss about leaving new york is having neil just drop by anytime she said her husband got up went over to the stove and refilled his cup did neil say i sounded grouchy when i answered something like that robert stephens smiled reluctantly well i know im not all sunshine early in the morning but just now i was afraid the call was from laura arlington shes all upset keeps calling me dolores waited she made some serious investments that havent worked out and she thinks now that shes getting a big runaround is she right i think she is it was one of those supposedly hot tips the broker persuaded her to invest in a small hightech company that was supposed to be bought out by microsoft she bought one hundred thousand shares of stock at five dollars a share convinced shed end up with a big profit five hundred thousand dollars whats it worth now the stock was just suspended from trading as of yesterday if you could sell it youd get eighty cents a share laura cant afford to lose that kind of money i wish to god shed talked to me before she got into that one isnt she thinking of going into the latham manor residence yes and that was the money that was going to pay for it it was just about all she had her children wanted her to get settled there but this broker convinced her that with this investment shed not only be able to live at latham but have money to leave her kids as well was what he did illegal i dont think so unfortunately unethical perhaps but probably not illegal anyway im going to talk it over with neil thats why im especially glad hes coming up robert stephens walked to the large window that overlooked narragansett bay like his son he was a broad athleticlooking man at sixtyeight his oncesandy hair was now white the water in the bay was quiet almost as still as a lake the grass behind the house sloping down to the water was starting to lose its velvety green the maples were already displaying clusters of orange copper and burgundy leaves beautiful peaceful he said shaking his head hard to believe that six miles from here a woman was murdered in her own home he turned and looked at his wife effortlessly pretty her silver hair knotted at the top of her head her features still delicate and soft dolores he said his tone suddenly stern when im out i want you to keep the alarm system on at all times fine she agreed amiably in fact she had not wanted her husband to realize just how deeply that murder had shaken her or that when she had read the papers graphic account she had checked both her front and back doors and as usual found them unlocked dr william lane was not especially pleased by maggie holloways request for an appointment already irritated by his wifes aimless nonstop chatter over the lunch table and behind in completing the everincreasing load of forms the government required of him as director of latham manor he found the thought of another lost halfhour galling he regretted now having agreed to it he couldnt imagine what she needed to talk to him about particularly since nuala moore had never signed the final papers committing her to move to the residence she had completed all the forms for entrance had taken her physical and when she started to seem hesitant he had taken it upon himself to have the second bedroom of the available suite stripped of the carpeting and furniture to show her how easily it would accommodate her easels and art supplies and cabinets but then she called and simply said she had decided to keep her house instead he wondered why she had changed her mind so suddenly she had seemed the perfect candidate surely it wasnt because she fantasized that the stepdaughter would come live with her and wanted to have a place for her to stay ridiculous lane muttered to himself how likely was it that an attractive young woman with a successful career would come rushing up to newport to play house with a woman she hadnt seen in years lane figured that now that she had been left the place maggie holloway would take a good look at all the work and expense involved to fix it up and would decide to sell it but in the meantime she was coming here to take up his time time that he needed to spend getting that suite put back in order to make it suitable for viewing the management of prestige residence corporation had made it clear that they would not tolerate empty living space still an uneasy thought would not go away was there anyother reason nuala had backed out of the arrangement and if there was had she confided it to her stepdaughter what could it be he wondered maybe it was all to the good that she was coming to see him after all he looked up from his work as the door to his office opened odile wandered in as usual without knocking a habit that drove him crazy and one that she unfortunately shared with nurse zelda markey in fact he would have to do something about that mrs shipley had complained about nurse markeys habit of opening doors without waiting to be invited as he expected odile ignored his look of annoyance and began speaking william i dont think mrs shipley is that well as you saw she had a little episode after the funeral mass yesterday and a dizzy spell last evening i wonder if she shouldnt go into the nursing section for a few days of observation i intend to keep a close eye on mrs shipley dr lane said brusquely try to remember my dear that in our family im the one with the medical degree you never finished nursing school he knew it was a stupid thing to say and regretted it immediately knowing what was coming next oh william thats so unfair she cried nursing is a vocation and i realized it wasnt for me perhaps it would have been better for youand othersif you had made the same choice her lip quivered and i think you should keep in mind that it was only because of me that prestige residences considered you for this job they stared at each other in silence for a moment then as usual odile became contrite oh william that was unkind of me i know how devoted you are to all our guests its just that i want to help you and i worry that another episode could ruin you she came over to the desk and leaned over him she reached for his hand lifting it to her face moving it so that it caressed her cheek and chin lane sighed she was a lightweighta ninny his grandmother would have snappedbut she was pretty he had felt himself most fortunate eighteen years ago to have convinced an attractiveyoungera woman to marry him plus she did care about him and he knew her frequent sugarywarm visits to the residents delighted most of them she might seem cloying at times but she was nonetheless sincere and that counted for a lot a few residents like greta shipley found her vacuous and irritating which to lane only proved mrs shipleys intelligence but there was no question that here at latham manor odile was an asset to him lane knew what was expected of him with virtually no show of the resignation he felt he stood up put his arms around his wife and murmured what would i do without you it was a relief when his secretary buzzed him on the intercom miss holloway is here she announced youd better go odile lane whispered forestalling her inevitable suggestion that she stay and be part of the meeting for once she didnt argue but slipped out the unmarked door of his suite that led to the main corridor the night before blaming the threehour nap she had taken earlier maggie had been still wide awake at midnight giving up on going to sleep anytime soon she had gone downstairs again and in the small study found books several of them fully illustrated on the cottages of newport carrying them up to bed she had propped pillows behind her back and read for nearly two hours as a result when she was admitted to latham manor by a uniformed maid who then called dr lane to announce her arrival she was able to take in her surroundings with some degree of knowledge the mansion had been built by ernest latham in as a deliberate rebuke to what he considered the vulgar ostentation of the vanderbilt mansion the breakers the layout for the two houses was almost the same but the latham house had livable proportions the entrance hall was still overwhelmingly large but was in fact only a third of the size of the breakers great hall of entry satinwoodrather than caen limestonecovered the walls and the staircase of richly carved mahogany carpeted in cardinal red stood in place of the marble staircase the breakers boasted the doors on the left were closed but maggie knew the dining room would be there to the right what originally must have been the music room looked most inviting with comfortable chairs and matching hassocks all richly upholstered in moss green and floral patterns the magnificent louis quinze mantel was even more breathtak ing in reality than it had appeared in the pictures she had seen the ornately carved space above the fireplace stretched to the ceiling filled with grecian figures tiny angels and pineapples and grapes except for the smooth center where a rembrandtschool oil painting had been hung it really is beautiful she thought mentally comparing it with the unspeakably squalid condition of a nursing home interior she had surreptitiously photographed for newsmaker magazine she realized suddenly that the maid had spoken to her oh im sorry she apologized i was just trying to take it all in the maid was an attractive young woman with dark eyes and olive skin it is lovely isnt it she said even working here is a pleasure ill take you to dr lane now his office was the largest in a suite of offices along the back of the house a mahogany door separated the area from the rest of the first floor as maggie followed the maid down the carpeted corridor she glanced through an open office door and noticed a familiar facejanice norton the wife of nualas lawyer sat behind a desk i didnt know she worked here maggie thought but then i really dont know much at all about any of these people do i their eyes met and maggie could not help feeling uncomfortable she had not missed the bitter disappointment on malcolm nortons face when mrs woods revealed that nuala had canceled the sale of her house but he had been cordial at the wake and funeral yesterday and had suggested that he would like to have a chat with her about her plans for the house she paused just long enough to greet mrs norton then followed the maid down the corridor to the corner office the maid knocked waited and at the invitation to enter opened the door for maggie and stepped back closing it once maggie was inside dr lane stood up and came around his desk to greet her his smile was cordial but it seemed to maggie that his eyes were appraising her professionally his greeting confirmed that impression ms holloway or maggie if i may im glad to see that you look a bit more rested yesterday was a very difficult day for you i know im sure it was difficult for everyone who loved nuala maggie said quietly but im really concerned about mrs shipley how is she this morning she had another weak spell last evening but i looked in on her just a while ago and she seems quite fit shes looking forward to your visit when i spoke to her this morning she particularly asked if i would drive her out to the cemetery do you think thats a good idea lane indicated the leather chair in front of his desk sit down please he returned to his own chair i wish shed wait a few days but when mrs shipley makes up her mind to do something well nothing changes it i do think that both of her little spells yesterday were caused by her deep emotion over nualas death the two of them were really very close theyd gotten into the habit of going up to mrs shipleys studio after nualas art class and they would gossip and have a glass or two of wine i told them they were like a pair of schoolgirls frankly though it probably was good for both of them and i know mrs shipley will miss those visits he smiled reminiscing nuala once told me that if she were hit over the head and then asked her age when she came to shed say twentytwo and mean it inside she said she really was twentytwo then as he realized what he had said he looked shocked im so sorry how careless of me hit over the head maggie thought but feeling sorry for the mans acute embarrassment she said please dont apologize youre right in spirit nuala never was older than twentytwo she hesitated then decided to plunge in doctor theres one thing i must ask you did nuala ever confide to you that something was troubling her i mean did she have a physical problem she may have mentioned he shook his head no not physical i think nuala was having a great deal of difficulty with what she perceived to be giving up her independence i really think that if she had lived she eventually would have made up her mind to come here she was always concerned about the relatively high cost of the large apartment with the extra bedroom but as she said she had to have a studio where she could both work and close the door when she was finished he paused nuala told me that she knew she was a bit untidy by nature but that her studio was always the scene of organized chaos then you believe that canceling the sale of her house and the hasty will she left were simply a lastminute panic attack of sorts yes i do he stood up ill ask angela to bring you up to mrs shipley and if you do go to the cemetery observe her carefully please if she seems in any way distraught return immediately after all the families of our guests have entrusted their lives to our care and we take that responsibility very seriously malcolm norton sat in his office on thames street staring at his appointment calendar for the remainder of the day it was now entirely empty thanks to the cancellation of his two oclock appointment it wouldnt have been much of a casejust a young housewife suing her neighbor over a nasty dog bite but the dog had a previous complaint against itanother neighbor had fought off an attack with a broomso it was a foregone conclusion that the insurance company would be anxious to settle particularly since the gate had been carelessly left open and the dog allowed to run loose the trouble was it was too easy a case the woman had phoned to say the insurance company had settled to her satisfaction meaning im out three or four thousand dollars norton thought glumly he still could not get over the sickening realization that less than twentyfour hours before she died nuala moore had secretly canceled the sale of her house to him now he was stuck with the twohundredthousanddollar mortgage he had raised on his own house it had been hell getting janice to agree to cosign for the mortgage finally he had told her about the impending change in the wetlands act and about the profits he hoped to reap in reselling nuala moores property look he had said trying to reason with her youre tired of working in the nursing home god knows i hear that every day its an absolutely legitimate sale the house needs everything done to it the worst possible scenario is that the new wetlands legislation doesnt go through which wont happen in that case we take a renovating mortgage on nualas place fix it up and sell it for threefifty a second mortgage she had said sarcastically my my youre quite the entrepreneur so i quit my job and what will you do with your newfound wealth after the change in the wetlands act goes through it was of course a question he was not prepared to answer not until after the sales had been completed and that of course was not going to happen now not unless things changed he could still hear janices furious words after they got home friday night so now we have a twohundredthousanddollar mortgage and the expense we went through to get it you march yourself right down to the bank and pay it off i dont intend to lose my home youre not going to lose it he had said pleading for time to work everything out i already told maggie holloway that i wanted to see her she knows its about the house do you think shell want to stay in a place where her stepmother was murdered ms holloway will get out of newport as fast as possible and im going to point out that over the years ive been a big help to nuala and tim moore without charging them my usual fee by next week shell have agreed to sell the house she had to agree to sell the house he told himself morosely it was his only way out of this mess the intercom buzzed he picked it up yes barbara he said his voice formal he was careful never to let an intimate quality intrude into their exchanges when she was in the outer office he could never be certain that someone else had not come in from her tone of voice today it was obvious to him that she was alone malcolm may i talk to you for a few minutes was all she said but immediately he sensed that something was wrong a moment later she was sitting opposite him her hands folded in her lap her lovely hazel eyes averted malcolm i dont know how to say this so id better just plunge in i cant stay here i feel rotten about myself these days she hesitated then added even loving you as much as i do i cant get away from the fact that youre married to someone else youve seen me with janice you know our relationship but shes still your wife its better this way believe me im going to visit my daughter in vail for a couple of months then when i come back ill find a different job barbara you cant just walk out like this he pleaded suddenly panicked she smiled sadly not this minute i wouldnt do that im giving you a weeks notice by that time janice and i will be separated i promise you please stay i cant let you go not after all ive done to keep you he thought desperately after maggie picked up greta shipley they made a stop at the florists to buy flowers as they were driving to the cemetery greta reminisced to maggie about her friendship with nuala her parents rented a cottage here for several years when we both were about sixteen she was such a pretty girl and so much fun she and i were inseparable during that time and she had many admirers why tim moore was always hanging around her then her father was transferred to london and she moved there and went to school there as well later i heard she was married eventually we just lost track of each other something i always regretted maggie steered the car through the quiet streets that led to st marys cemetery in newport how did you happen to get together again she asked it was just twentyone years ago my phone rang one day someone asked to speak to the former greta carlyle i knew the voice was familiar but for the moment couldnt place it i responded that i was greta carlyle shipley and nuala whooped good for you gret you landed carter shipley it seemed to maggie that she was hearing nualas voice coming from everyones lips she heard it when mrs woods talked about the will when doctor lane reminisced about her feeling of being twentytwo and now in mrs shipleys memories about the same kind of warm reunion maggie herself had experienced less than two weeks ago despite the warmth in the car maggie shivered thoughts of nuala always came back to the same question was the kitchen door unlocked allowing an intruder to come in or did nuala unlock the door herself to let someone she knewsomeone she trustedenter her home sanctuary maggie thought our homes ought to offer us sanctuary had nuala pleaded for her life how long did she feel the blows that rained on her head chief brower had said that he thought whoever had killed nuala had been looking for something and from the look of things might not have found it and so we picked up immediately where we left off went right back to being best friends greta continued nuala told me shed been widowed young and then remarried and that the second marriage had been a terrible mistake except for you she was so soured on marriage that she said hell would freeze over before shed try it again but by then tim was a widower and they started going out one morning she phoned and said gret want to go iceskating hell just froze over she and tim were engaged i dont think i ever saw her happier they arrived at the gate of the cemetery a carved limestone angel with outstretched arms greeted them the grave is to the left and up the hill mrs shipley said but of course you know that you were here yesterday yesterday maggie thought had it really been only yesterday they parked at the top of the hill and with maggies hand tucked firmly under greta shipleys arm they walked along the path that led to nualas grave already the ground had been smoothed over and resodded the thick green grass gave the plot an air of soothing timelessness the only sound was the rustle of the wind through the fallcolored leaves of a nearby maple mrs shipley managed a smile as she placed flowers on the grave nuala loved that big tree she said when her time came she wanted plenty of shade so that her complexion wouldnt be ruined by too much sun they laughed softly as they turned to go then greta hesitated would i be imposing terribly if i asked you to stop for just a moment at the graves of some of my other friends i saved a few flowers for them too two are here in st marys the others are in trinity this road goes directly there the cemeteries are side by side and the north gate between them is always open during the day it didnt take long to make the five other stops the headstone on the last grave was inscribed constance van sickle rhinelander maggie noted that the date of death was only two weeks ago was she a close friend maggie asked not nearly as close as nuala but she lived in latham manor and i had gotten to know her very well she paused its sudden its all so sudden she said then turned to maggie and smiled id better get back im afraid im a bit tired its so hard to lose so many people you care about i know maggie put her arm around the older woman and realized just how frail she seemed on the twentyminute drive back to the residence greta shipley dozed off when they reached latham manor she opened her eyes and said apologetically i used to have so much energy all my family did my grandmother was still going strong at ninety im beginning to think im being waited on too much as maggie escorted her inside greta said hesitantly maggie i hope youll come to see me again before you leave when are you going back to new york maggie surprised herself by answering firmly i was planning to stay two weeks and thats exactly what im going to do ill call you before the weekend and well make a date it was not until she got back to nualas house and put the kettle on that she realized something was troubling her there was a kind of unease about greta shipley and about their visit to the cemeteries something wasnt right but what was it liam moore paynes office overlooked boston common since leaving his former brokerage house and opening his own investment firm he had been overwhelmingly busy the prestigious clients he had brought with him demanded and received his meticulous personal attention earning him their complete confidence he had not wanted to phone maggie too early but when he did call at am he was disappointed not to reach her after that he had his secretary try her every hour but it was nearly four oclock when he finally heard the welcome news that ms holloway was on the phone maggie at last he began then stopped is that a kettle i hear whistling yes hold on a minute liam i was just fixing a cup of tea when she picked up the receiver again he said i was afraid you might have made up your mind to go home i wouldnt blame you for being nervous in that house im careful about locking up maggie told him then added almost without pause liam im glad you called ive got to ask you something yesterday after you brought my bags here did you have a discussion with earl about me liams eyebrows raised as a matter of fact i didnt what makes you think i did she told him about earls sudden appearance at the kitchen door you mean he was just going to check the lock without even letting you know youre kidding no im not and i dont mind saying that he really frightened me i was shaky enough as it was about being alone here and then to have him just show up that way plus he started quoting something about sorrow like joy leaping from mind to mind it was weird thats one of his favorite quotes i dont think ive ever heard him give a lecture when he hasnt included it it always gives me the creeps too liam paused then sighed maggie earl is my cousin and im fond of him but he is somewhat odd and theres no question that hes obsessed with the subject of death do you want me to speak to him about that little visit to you no i dont think so but im going to have a locksmith put dead bolts on the doors im selfish enough to hope that means youll be staying in newport for a while at least the two weeks i had initially planned ill be down on friday will you have dinner with me id like that maggie get that locksmith in today will you first thing in the morning all right ill call you tomorrow liam replaced the receiver slowly how much should he tell maggie about earl he wondered he didnt want to overdo warning her but still clearly it was something he would have to think over at quarter of five janice norton locked the desk in her office at latham manor residence out of habit she tugged at the handle of each one of the drawers and confirmed that they were indeed secured it was a safeguard that william lane would have been wise to adopt she thought sarcastically lanes assistant eileen burns worked only until two each day and after that janice doubled as both bookkeeper and assistant she smiled to herself reflecting that her unquestioned access to lanes office had been extremely useful over the years just now when shed copied the information she wanted from two more files shed had a sense that she should hold off call it a premonition she shrugged well shed done it and the copies were in her briefcase and the originals where they belonged in lanes desk it was ridiculous to get jumpy about it now her eyes narrowed with secret satisfaction as she thought of the undisguisable shock on her husbands face when irma woods had told them about nuala moores lastminute will what pleasure she had had since then berating him about repaying the mortgage on their own house she knew of course that he wouldnt do any such thing malcolm was destined to wander forever through a field of broken dreams it had taken her far too long to figure out that one but working at latham had been an eyeopener some of the guests there may not have had fancy backgrounds but they had been born sucking on the proverbial silver spoon they had never known a days worry about money others were like malcolm blue bloods with lineage they could trace back past the mayflower to the aristocracy even to the crowned heads of europe passionately proud that they were the greatgreatnephews or whatever nine times removed of the prince regent of some idiotic duchy however the bluebloods at latham differed from malcolm in one very important way they hadnt rested on their genealogical charts they had gone out and made their own fortunes or married them but not malcolm she thought oh no not handsome debonair courtly sowellbred malcolm at her wedding she had been the envy of her girlfriendsexcept for anne everett on that day in the yacht club powder room she had overheard anne refer to malcolm disparagingly as the ultimate ken doll it was a remark that had burned into her mind because even then on what was supposed to be the happiest day of her life dressed as she was like a princess in billowing yards of satin she had realized it was true to put it another way she hadmarried the frog and then spent thirtyplus years trying to give reality the lie what a waste years of giving intimate dinners for clients and potential clients only to see them take their lucrative accounts to other attorneys leaving malcolm with token bones to pick over now even most of those were gone and then the ultimate insult despite the way she had stuck by him all these years knowing she would have done better to strike out on her own yet clinging stubbornly to what little dignity she had left she had realized that he was mooning over his secretary and planning to get rid of her if only hed been the man i thought i married janice mused as she pushed back the chair and stood flexing her stiff shoulders even better if only hed been the man he thinks he is then i really would have had a prince she smoothed the sides of her skirt taking a modicum of pleasure from the feel of her slim waistline and narrow hips in the early days malcolm had compared her to a thoroughbred slender with long neck lean legs and shapely ankles a beautiful thoroughbred he had added she had been beautiful when she was young well look what that had gotten her she thought ruefully at least her body was still in excellent shape and not because of regular visits to spas and pleasant days at the golf course with her wellheeled friends no she had spent her adult life working and working hardfirst as a real estate agent then for the last five years as bookkeeper in this place she remembered how as a real estate agent she used to salivate over properties that went for a song because people needed ready cash how many times she had thought if only i had the money well now she had it now she could call the shots and malcolm didnt even have a clue not ever to have to set foot in this place again she thought exultantly never mind the stark carpet and brocaded draperies even in the office area it might be pretty but it was still a nursing homegods waiting roomand at fiftyfour she was hurtling rapidly toward the age when she would be a candidate for admittance herself well she would get out of here long before that ever happened the phone rang before she picked up the receiver janice glanced around the room checking lest someone might have tiptoed in behind her back janice norton she said sternly holding the receiver close to her mouth it was the call she had hoped to receive he didnt bother with a greeting well for once dear malcolm got something straight he said that wetlands act amendment absolutely will go through that property will be worth a fortune she laughed then isnt it time to make a counteroffer to maggie holloway after liams call maggie sat at the kitchen table sipping tea and nibbling on some cookies she had found in the cupboard the box was almost full and looked as though it had been opened recently she wondered if only a few nights ago nuala had been sitting here sipping tea eating cookies planning her menu for the dinner party she had found a shopping list next to the telephone leg of lamb green beans carrots apples grapes new potatoes biscuit mix and then there was a scribbled typical nuala note to herself forgetting something look around store and nuala obviously forgot to bring the list its funny maggie thought but in an odd and certainly unexpected way being here in nualas house is giving her back to me i feel almost as though ive lived here with her all these years earlier she had glanced through a photograph album she found in the living room and realized that the pictures of nuala with timothy moore began the year after nuala and her father divorced she also found a smaller album filled with pictures of herself taken during the five years nuala had been part of her life on the back pages were taped all the notes she had written to nuala in those years the unmounted picture at the very end was of nuala and her father and herself on their wedding day she had been beaming with joy to have a mother the expression on nualas face had been just as happy the smile on her fathers lips however was reserved questioning just like him he wouldnt let her inside his heart maggie thought ive always heard he was crazy about my mother but she was dead and wonderful nuala was there he was the big loser when she finally left because she couldnt stand his carping and i was the loser too she reflected as she put the cup and saucer in the dishwasher the simple act brought back another memory that of her fathers annoyed voice nuala why is it so impossible to transfer dishes directly from the table to the dishwasher without first piling them in the sink for a while nuala had cheerfully laughed about being genetically messy but later she would say dear god owen this is the first time ive done that in three days and sometimes shed burst into tears and id run after her andput my arms around her maggie thought sadly it was fourthirty the window over the sink framed the handsome oak tree that stood to the side of the house it should be trimmed maggie thought in a bad storm those dead branches could break and land on the house she dried her hands and turned away but why worry about that she wasnt going to stay here she would sort out everything and earmark usable clothes and furniture for charity if she started now she could be done by the time she had to leave of course she would keep a few mementos for herself but most things she would just get rid of she supposed that after the will was probated she would sell the house as is but she preferred that it be as empty as possible she didnt want strangers going through nualas home and perhaps making sarcastic comments she began in nualas studio three hours later grimy from the dust of cabinets and countertops that had been cluttered and jammed with stiffened paint brushes driedup tubes of oils paint rags and small easels maggie had an impressive number of tagged trash bags lined up in a corner of the room and even though she had only made a start just that much clearing up changed the appearance of the room for the better loyally she reminded herself that police chief brower had told her this space had been thoroughly ransacked it was obvious that the cleaning service had not bothered to do more than shove as many items as possible back into the cabinets and the spillover had been left on the countertops the result was a sense of chaos that maggie found disconcerting but the room itself was quite impressive the floortoceiling windows that seemed to be the only major alteration made in the house must let in wonderful northern light maggie thought when nuala had urged her to bring her sculpting materials with her she had promised that she would find the long refectory table a perfect work area even though she was sure she wouldnt use them to please nuala she had brought along a fiftypound tub of wet clay several armatures the frameworks on which the figures would be constructed and her modeling tools maggie paused for a minute wondering on that table she could make a portrait head of nuala there were plenty of recent pictures of her around to use as models as though i need them maggie thought it seemed to her that nualas face would be forever imprinted in her mind except for visiting greta and clearing out the house she had no real plans as long as i know im staying until a week from sunday it would be nice to have a project she told herself and what better subject than nuala the visit to latham manor and the time she had spent with greta shipley had served to convince her that the uneasiness she thought she had perceived in nuala was simply the result of her concern over the effects of radically changing her life by selling the house and moving to the residence there doesnt seem to have been anything else weighing on her she thought at least not that i can see she sighed i guess theres no way i can be sure but if it was a random breakin wasnt it risky to kill nuala then take time to search the house whoever was here could smell the food cooking and see that the table was set for company it would make sense that the killer would be terrified that someone might arrive while he was ransacking the house she told herself unless that someone already knew dinner was scheduled for eight oclock and that i wouldnt be arriving until nearly that time a window of opportunity she reasoned there certainly had been one for a person who knew the plans for the evening perhaps was even part of them nuala wasnt killed by a random thief maggie said aloud mentally she reviewed the people who had been expected at the dinner what did she know about any of them nothing really except for liam he was the only one she really knew it was only because of him that she had run into nuala again and for that she always would be grateful im also glad he felt the way i did about his cousin earl she thought his showing up here really gave me the creeps the next time she and liam talked she wanted to ask him about malcolm and janice norton even in that quick moment this morning when she had greeted janice at latham manor she could detect something amiss in the womans expression it looked like anger because of the canceled sale maggie wondered but surely there were plenty of other houses like this one available in newport it couldnt be that maggie walked over to the trestle table and sat down she looked at her folded hands and realized they were itching for the feel of clay whenever she was trying to think something through she found working in clay helped her to find the answer or at least come to some kind of conclusion something had bothered her today something she had noticed subconsciously it had registered mentally but had not made an impression at the moment what could it have been she asked herself moment by moment she retraced her day from the time she got up to the cursory inspection of the downstairs floor at latham manor and her appointment with dr lane to the drive with greta shipley to the cemeteries the cemeteries maggie sat up that was it she thought that last grave they went to of the rhinelander woman who died two weeks agoi noticed something but what try as she might she could not conceive of what had troubled her there in the morning ill go back to the cemeteries and look around she decided ill take my camera and if i dont see exactly what it is ill take pictures maybe whatever it is thats nagging at me will show up when i develop them it had been a long day she decided to bathe scramble an egg then go to bed and read more of the books about newport on the way downstairs she realized that the phone in nualas bedroom was ringing she hurried to answer it but was rewarded by a decisive click at the other end whoever it was probably didnt hear me she thought but it doesnt matter there was no one with whom she wanted to talk right now the closet door in the bedroom was open and the light from the hallway revealed the blue cocktail suit nuala had worn to the reunion party at the four seasons it was haphazardly draped over a hanger as though carelessly put away the suit was expensive a sense that it might be damaged if left that way made maggie go over to the closet to rehang it properly in the course of straightening the fabric she thought she heard a soft thud as though something had dropped on the floor she looked down into the cluttered array of boots and shoes in the closet bottom and decided that if something had fallen it would just have to wait she closed the closet door and left the room headed for her bath the solitude she enjoyed on many evenings in her new york apartment was not appealing in this house with flimsy locks and dark corners in this house where a murder had been committedperhaps by someone whom nuala had counted as a friend earl bateman had not intended to drive to newport on tuesday evening it was while preparing for a lecture he would be delivering the following friday that he realized that for illustrative purposes he needed some of the slides he kept in the museum on the grounds of the bateman funeral home the home of his greatgreatgrandfather the narrow victorian house and the acre it stood on had been separated from the main house and property ten years earlier technically the museum was private and not open to the public it could only be visited by written request and earl personally escorted the few visitors through it in response to the derisive humor heaped on him by his cousins whenever they discussed death valleyas they called his little museumhis icy and knowingly humorless retort was that historically people of all cultures and breeding attached great importance to the rituals surrounding death over the years he had gathered an impressive array of materials all having to do with death slides and films recorded funeral dirges greek epic poems paintings and prints such as the apotheosis picture of lincoln being received into heaven scale reproductions of the taj mahal and the pyramids native mausoleums of brasstrimmed hardwood indian funeral pyres presentday caskets replicas of drums conch shells umbrellas and swords statues of riderless horses with reversed stirrups and examples of mourning attire throughout the ages mourning attire was the subject of the lecture he was to deliver to members of a reading group that had just finished discussing an assortment of books on death rituals for the occasion he wanted to show them slides of the costumes in the museum visuals always help make for a lively lecture he decided as he drove along route over the newport bridge until last year the final slide used when he lectured on attire was an excerpt from the amy vanderbilts etiquette guide in which she instructed that patentleather shoes were never appropriate at a funeral accompanying the text he had placed pictures of patentleather shoes from childrens mary janes to ladies pumps and mens bowed evening slippers all he felt to whimsical effect but now he had thought of a new twist for ending the lecture i wonder what generations in the future will say of us when they see illustrations of widows in red miniskirts and family mourners in jeans and leather jackets will they perhaps read social and cultural custom of deep significance into these costumes as we ourselves try to read it into the clothing of the past and if so wouldnt you like to have an opportunity to eavesdrop on their discussions he liked that it would lessen the uneasy reaction he always received when he discussed the fact that the beerawan community dressed the widow or widower in rags because of their belief that the soul of the dead person begins wandering immediately after cessation of breath and might reflect hostility to the living even to those people the deceased had loved presumably the rags reflect grief and appropriately deep mourning at the museum that thought had stayed with him as he collected the slides he wanted he sensed a tension between the dead nuala and the living maggie there was hostility to maggie she must be warned he knew nualas phone number from memory and in the dim light of his museum office he dialed it he had just started to hang up when he heard maggies breathless greeting even so he replaced the receiver she might think the warning odd and he didnt want her to think he was crazy i am not crazy he said aloud then he laughed im not even odd wednesday october nd neil stephens was normally able to give his total undivided attention to the shifting tides of the stock market his clients both corporate and private swore by the accuracy of his predictions and his strong eye in discerning trends but in the five days since he had been unable to reach maggie he had found himself distracted when he needed to be attentive and as a result needlessly sharp with his assistant trish finally allowing her irritation to show she put him in his place by raising her hand in a gesture that clearly said stop and saying theres only one reason for a guy like you to be so grouchy youre finally interested in someone and she isnt buying it well i guess i should say welcome to the real world but the fact is i am sorry and so ill try to be patient with your unnecessary carping after a feeble and unanswered who runs this place anyhow neil retreated to his own office and renewed his memory search for the name of maggies stepmother the frustration from a nagging sense that something was wrong made him uncharacteristically impatient with two of his longtime clients lawrence and frances van hilleary who visited his office that morning wearing a chanel suit that neil recognized as one of her favorites frances sat elegantly straight on the edge of a leather club chair in the clientfriendly conversation area and told him of a hot tip on an oilwell stock they had received at a dinner party her eyes sparkled as she gave him the details the company is based in texas she explained enthusiastically but ever since china opened to the west theyve been sending top engineers there china neil thought dismayed but leaned back trying to give the appearance of listening with courteous attention while first frances and then lawrence talked excitedly of coming political stability in china of pollution concerns there of oil gushers waiting to be tapped and of course of fortunes to be made doing rapid mental calculations neil realized with dismay that they were talking about investing roughly three quarters of their available assets heres the prospectus lawrence van hilleary concluded pushing it at him neil took the glossy folder and found the contents to be exactly what he had expected at the bottom of the page in print almost too small to read were cautionary words to the effect that only those with at least half a million dollars in assets excluding their residences would be allowed to participate he cleared his throat okay frances and lawrence you pay me for my advice you are two of the most generous people ive ever dealt with youve already given away a tremendous amount of money to your children and grandchildren and charities in the family limited partnership real estate trust generationskipping trusts and charitable iras i firmly believe that what you have left for yourselves should not be wasted on this kind of piein thesky investment its much too high risk and id venture to say that there is more oil dripping from the car in your garage than youll ever see spurting from one of these socalled gushers i couldnt with any conscience handle a transaction like this and i beg you not to waste your money on it there was a moment of silence broken by frances who turned to her husband and said dear remind me to get the car checked lawrence van hilleary shook his head then sighed with resignation thanks neil theres no fool like an old fool i guess there was a soft knock and trish came in carrying a tray with coffee is he still trying to sell you that edsel stock mr van hilleary no he just cut me off at the pass when i was about to buy it trish that coffee smells good after discussing a few items in their investment portfolio the subject changed to a decision the van hillearys were pondering were both seventyeight lawrence said glancing fondly at his wife i know we look pretty good but theres no question that we cant do things we used to do even a few years ago none of the kids live in the area the house in greenwich is expensive to maintain and to top it off our old housekeeper has just retired were seriously considering looking for a retirement community somewhere in new england wed still go down to florida in the winter but it might be nice to get rid of all the responsibilities of a house and grounds where in new england neil asked perhaps the cape or maybe newport wed like to stay near the water in that case i might be able to do some scouting for you over the weekend briefly he told them how several of the women whose income tax his father handled had moved to latham manor residence in newport and were very happy there when they got up to go frances van hilleary kissed neils cheek no oil for the lamps of china i promise and let us know what you find out about the place in newport of course tomorrow neil thought tomorrow ill be in newport and maybe ill bump into maggie fat chance said a niggling voice in the back of his mind then the brainstorm hit him one night when they had had dinner at nearys jimmy neary and maggie had talked about her pending visit to newport she told jimmy her stepmothers name and he said something about it being one of the grandest of old celtic names jimmy would remember surely he told himself a much happier neil settled down to finish up the days business tonight he would have dinner at nearys he decided then go home and pack tomorrow he would head north at eight oclock that evening as neil was contentedly finishing sautéed scallops and mashed potatoes jimmy neary joined him mentally keeping his fingers crossed neil asked whether jimmy could remember the name of maggies stepmother ahhah jimmy said give me a minute its a grand name lets see jimmys cherubic face puckered in concentration nieve siobhan maeve cloissa no none of those itsitsby god ive got it finnuala it means the fair one in gaelic and maggie said the old girls known as nuala at least thats a start i could kiss you jimmy neil said fervently a look of alarm crossed jimmys face dont you dare he said maggie had not expected to sleep well but wrapped as she was in the soft eiderdown quilt her head burrowed in the goosedown pillows she did not wake up until the phone rang at ninethirty in the master bedroom feeling clearheaded and refreshed for the first time in several days she hurried to answer it even taking note of the bright sunbeams that spilled into the room around the edges of the window shades it was greta shipley calling almost apologetically she began maggie i wanted to thank you for yesterday it meant so much to me and please dont agree to this unless its something you really want to do but you mentioned that you wanted to collect the art supplies nuala left here and well you see were allowed to invite a guest for dinner on a rotating basis i thought that if you dont have any plans you might consider joining me this evening i dont have any plans at all and id enjoy it very much maggie said sincerely then a sudden thought flashed through her mind a kind of mental picture the cemetery mrs rhinelanders grave or was it something had caught her attention there yesterday but what shed have to go back she thought it had been at mrs rhinelanders grave but if she were wrong she would have to revisit all the other ones they had gone to mrs shipley she said while im up here im going to be taking some pictures around newport for a project im working on it may sound macabre but st marys and trinity have such a tranquil oldworld feeling about them theyre perfect for my purposes i know that some of the graves we left flowers on yesterday had beautiful vistas behind them id like to go back there can you tell me which ones we visited she hoped the hastily assembled excuse didnt sound too lame but i am working on a project she thought greta shipley however did not seem to find maggies request peculiar oh they are beautifully situated arent they she agreed certainly i can tell you where we went have you got a pen and paper handy right here nuala had left a small writing pad and a pen next to the phone three minutes later maggie had jotted down not only the names but specific directions to each plot she knew she could locate the grave sites now if she only knew what it was she hoped to find after hanging up maggie got out of bed stretched and decided on a quick shower to complete the wakeup process a warm bath at night to put you to sleep she thought a cool shower to wake you up im glad i wasnt born four hundred years ago she thought of the line she had read in a book about queen elizabeth i the queen takes a bath once a month whether she needs it or no the showerhead obviously an addition to the beautiful clawfooted tub provided a spray that was needle sharp and thoroughly satisfying wrapped in a chenille robe her stilldamp hair in a towel turban maggie went downstairs and fixed herself a light breakfast which she carried back to her room to enjoy as she dressed ruefully she realized that the casual clothes she had packed for the vacation with nuala would not get her through her twoweek stay here this afternoon she would have to find a boutique or whatever and get herself an extra skirt or two and a couple of blouses or sweaters she knew that dress at latham manor was a bit on the formal side plus she had agreed to have dinner with liam on friday night and that probably meant dressing up whenever she and liam had been out to dinner in new york he invariably chose fairly pricey restaurants raising the shade she opened the front window and felt the warm gentle breeze that confirmed that after yesterdays chilly dampness newport was experiencing pictureperfect early fall weather there would be no need for a heavy jacket today she decided a white tee shirt jeans a pullover blue sweater and sneakers were what she picked to wear when she was dressed maggie stood for a moment in front of the mirror that hung over the bureau studying herself her eyes no longer held traces of the tears she had wept for nuala they were clear again blue sapphire blue thats how paul had described her eyes the night they met it seemed a lifetime ago she had been a bridesmaid at kay koehlers wedding he had been a groomsman the rehearsal dinner was at the chevy chase country club in maryland near washington he had sat next to her we talked to each other all night maggie thought remembering then after the wedding we danced practically every dance when he put his arms around me i felt as though i had suddenly come home they were both only twentythree at the time he was attending the air force academy she just finishing the masters program at nyu everyone said what a handsome couple we were maggie reminisced a study in contrasts paul was so fair with straight blond hair and iceblue eyes the nordic look he said he had inherited from his finnish grandmother me the darkhaired celt for five years after his death she had kept her hair the way paul liked it finally last year she had chopped off three inches now it barely skimmed the collar line but as a bonus the shorter length emphasized the bouncing natural curl it also required a lot less fussing and for maggie that was paramount paul also had liked the fact that she wore only mascara and almostnatural lipstick now at least for festive occasions she had a more sophisticated supply of makeup why am i thinking about all this now maggie asked herself as she prepared to leave for the morning it was almost as though she were telling nuala all about this she realized these were all the things that had happened in the years since they had seen each other things she wanted to talk about with her nuala was widowed young she would have understood now with a final silent prayer that nuala would use her influence with her favorite saints so that maggie might understand just why she was being compelled to go to the cemeteries she picked up her breakfast tray and carried it back downstairs to the kitchen three minutes later after checking the contents of her shoulder bag double locking the door and getting her nikon and camera equipment out of the car trunk she was on her way to the cemeteries mrs eleanor robinson chandler arrived at latham manor residence promptly at tenthirty the appointed time for her meeting with dr william lane lane received his aristocratic guest with the charm and cour tesy that made him the perfect director and attending physician for the residence he knew mrs chandlers history by heart the family name was well known throughout rhode island mrs chandlers grandmother had been one of newport s social grandes dames during the citys social zenith in the s she would make an excellent addition to the residence and very possibly attract future guests from among her friends her financial records while impressive were a shade disappointing it was obvious that she had managed to give away a great deal of her money to her large family seventysix years old she had clearly done her share to help populate the earth four children fourteen grandchildren seven greatgrandchildren and no doubt more to come however given her name and background she might well be persuaded to take the top apartment that had been intended for nuala moore he decided it was clear that she was used to the best mrs chandler was dressed in a beige knit suit and lowheeled pumps a single strand of matched pearls small pearl earrings a gold wedding band and a narrow gold watch were her only jewelry but each item was superb her classic features framed by pure white hair were set in a gracious reserved expression lane understood full well that he was the one being interviewed you do understand that this is only a preliminary meeting mrs chandler was saying i am not at all sure that im prepared to enter any residence however attractive i will say that from what ive seen so far the restoration of this old place is in excellent taste approbation from sir hubert is praise indeed lane thought sarcastically he smiled appreciatively however thank you he said if odile were here she would be gushing that coming from mrs chandler such praise meant so much to them and on and on my eldest daughter lives in santa fe and very much wants me to make my home there mrs chandler continued but you dont want to go there do you lane thought and suddenly he felt much better of course having lived in this area so many years its a little hard to make such a complete change i would think he said sympathetically so many of our guests visit their families for a week or two then are very glad to come back to the quiet and comfort of latham manor yes im sure mrs chandlers tone was noncommittal i understand you have several units available as a matter of fact one of our most desirable units just became available who most recently occupied it mrs constance van sickle rhinelander oh of course connie had been quite ill i understand im afraid so lane did not mention nuala moore he would explain away the room that he had emptied for her art studio by saying that the suite was being totally redecorated they went up in the elevator to the third floor for long minutes mrs chandler stood on the terrace overlooking the ocean this is lovely she conceded however i believe this unit is five hundred thousand dollars thats correct well i dont intend to spend that much now that ive seen this one i would like to see your other available units shes going to try to bargain me down dr lane thought and had to resist the urge to tell her that such a ploy was of absolutely no use the cardinal rule of all prestige residences was absolutely no discounts otherwise fury resulted because the word of special deals always got around to those who hadnt gotten them mrs chandler rejected out of hand the smallest the mediumsize and then the largest single bedroom apartments none of these will do im afraid were wasting each others time they were on the second floor dr lane turned to see odile walking toward them arm in arm with mrs pritchard who was recovering from foot surgery she smiled at them but to lanes relief did not stop even odile occasionally knew when not to barge in he thought nurse markey was seated at the secondfloor desk she looked up at them with a bright professional smile lane was itching to get to her this morning mrs shipley had told him she intended to have a dead bolt put on her door to insure privacy that woman regards a closed door as a challenge she had snapped they passed mrs shipleys studio apartment a maid had just finished cleaning it and the wide door was open mrs chandler glanced in and stopped oh this is lovely she said sincerely as she absorbed the large alcove seating area with the renaissance fireplace step in dr lane urged i know mrs shipley wont mind shes at the hairdressers just this far i feel like an intruder mrs chandler took in the bedroom section and the magnificent ocean views on three sides of the unit i think this is preferable to the largest suite she told him how much is a unit like this three hundred and fifty thousand dollars now that i would pay is there another like it available for that price of course not at the moment he said then added but why dont you fill out an application he smiled at her wed very much like to have you as a guest someday douglas hansen smiled ingratiatingly across the table at cora gebhart a peppery septuagenarian who was clearly enjoying the scallops over braised endive she had ordered for lunch she was a talker he thought not like some of the others that hed had to shower with attention before he could elicit any information from them mrs gebhart was opening up to him like a sunflower to the sun and he knew that by the time the espresso was served he would have a good chance of winning her confidence everyones favorite nephew one of these women had called him and it was just the way he wanted to be perceived the fondly solicitous thirtyyearold who extended to them all the little courtesies they hadnt enjoyed for years intimate gossipy luncheons at a restaurant that was either upscale gourmet like this one bouchards or a place like the chart house where great views could be enjoyed over excellent lobster the lunches were followed up with a box of candy for the ones who ordered sweet desserts flowers for those who confided stories of their longago courtships and even an arminarm stroll on ocean drive for a more recent widow who wistfully confided how she and her late husband used to take long walks every day he knew just how to do it hansen had great respect for the fact that all of these women were intelligent and some of them were even shrewd the stock offerings he touted to them were the kind that even a moderate investor would have to admit had possibilities in fact one of them had actually worked out which in a way had been disastrous for him but in the end turned out to be a plus because now in order to cap his pitch he would suggest that a wouldbe client call mrs alberta downing in providence that she could confirm hansens expertise mrs downing invested one hundred thousand dollars and made a threehundredthousanddollar profit in one week he was able to tell prospective clients it was an honest claim the fact that the stock had been artificially inflated at the last minute and that mrs downing had ordered him to sell going against his own advice had seemed like a disaster at the time they had had to raise the money to pay her her profits but now at least they had a genuine blueblood reference cora gebhart daintily finished the last of her meal excellent she announced as she sipped at the chardonnay in her glass hansen had wanted to order a full bottle but she had informed him adamantly that one glass at luncheon was her limit douglas laid his knife on the plate and carefully placed the fork beside it with prongs turned down european style cora gebhart sighed thats the way my husband always left the silver on his plate were you educated in europe as well i spent my junior year at the sorbonne hansen responded with studied nonchalance how delightful mrs gebhart exclaimed and immediately slipped into flawless french which douglas desperately tried to follow after a few moments he held up his hand smiling i can read and write french fluently but it has been eleven years since i was there and im afraid im a bit rusty en anglais sil vousplaît they laughed together but hansens antenna went up had mrs gebhart been testing him he wondered she had commented on his handsome tweed jacket and his overall distinguished appearance saying it was unusual in a time when so many young men her grandson included looked as though they had just returned from a camping trip was she telling him in a subtle way that she could see right through him that she could sense that he wasnt really a graduate of williams and the wharton school of business as he claimed he knew that his lean blond aristocratic appearance was impressive it had gotten him entrylevel jobs with both merrill lynch and salomon brothers but he hadnt lasted six months at either place mrs gebharts next words reassured him however i think ive been too conservative she complained ive tied up too much of my money in trusts so my grandchildren can buy more faded jeans because of that i dont have a lot left for myself ive thought about moving into one of the retirement residences i even recently toured latham manor with that in mind but i would have to move into one of the smaller units and im just used to more space she paused then looked hansen squarely in the face im thinking favorably about putting three hundred thousand dollars in the stock you recommended he tried not to let his emotions register on his face but it was a struggle the amount she mentioned was considerably more than he had hoped for my accountant is opposed to it of course but im beginning to think hes a fuddyduddy do you know him his name is robert stephens he lives in portsmouth hansen did know the name robert stephens took care of the taxes for mrs arlington and she had lost a bundle investing in a hightech company he had recommended but i pay him to do my taxes not to run my life mrs gebhart continued so without discussing it with him im going to cash in my bonds and let you make me a killing too now that the decision is made maybe i will have that second glass of wine as the midafternoon sun bathed the restaurant in golden warmth they toasted each other maggie spent almost two hours at st marys and trinity cemeteries funerals were taking place in some of the areas she wanted to photograph so in each case she waited until the mourners had departed before taking out her camera the beautiful warm day ran counter to her chilling quest but she persevered revisiting all the graves she had been to with greta shipley and taking pictures from every angle her initial hunch had been that she had detected something odd at mrs rhinelanders grave which had been the last they had visited for that reason she reversed the order she and mrs shipley had followed yesterday starting with the rhinelander plot and ending at nualas grave it was at this final stop that a young girl of about eight or nine appeared and stayed nearby watching her intently when maggie finished shooting a roll of film she turned to the little girl hi im maggie she said whats your name marianne what do you want to take pictures here for well im a photographer and i do some special projects and this is one im working on do you want to take a picture of my grandfathers grave its right over there she pointed off to the left where maggie could see several women standing by a tall headstone no i dont think so im actually done for the day but thank you and im sorry about your grandfather todays his third anniversary he got married again when he was eightytwo mom says that woman wore him out maggie tried not to smile that happens sometimes i guess my dad said that after fifty years with grandma at least he had some fun for two years the lady he was married to has a new boyfriend now dad says hes probably got only a couple years left maggie laughed i think your dad must be fun he is okay i gotta go moms waving to me see you it was a conversation nuala would have enjoyed maggie reflected what am i looking for she asked herself as she stared down at the grave the flowers greta shipley had left were starting to wilt but otherwise this plot looked exactly like the others even so she shot one more roll of film just to be safe the afternoon passed quickly consulting the map on the passenger seat maggie drove into the center of newport because as a professional photographer she always preferred to do her own developing it was with real reluctance she dropped off her rolls of film at a drugstore but realistically there was no other way she hadnt brought any of her darkroom equipment with her it would have been just too complicated for so brief a trip after securing a promise that her pictures would be ready the next day she had a burger and a coke at the brick alley pub then found a boutique on thames street where she was able to find two cowlnecked sweatersone white one blacktwo long skirts and a creamcolored tapered jacket with matching slacks used in combination with what she had these additions to her wardrobe would take care of anything that might come up in newport for the next ten days and besides she really liked them newport is special she thought as she drove along ocean drive back to nualas house my house she amended still surprised at the realization malcolm norton had had an agreement with nuala to buy the house that maggie knew he said he wanted to talk with me she reflected of course it has to be about the house do i want to sell it she asked herself last night id have said probably but now at this moment with that glorious ocean and this lovely quaint town on this special island im not so sure no if i had to make up my mind right now she thought i wouldnt sell it at fourthirty nurse zelda markey was relieved from duty and reported as directed to the office of dr william lane she knew she was going to be called on the carpet and she knew why greta shipley had complained about her well nurse markey was ready for dr lane look at him she thought contemptuously as he frowned across the desk at her i bet he cant tell the difference between measles and chicken pox or palpitations and congestive heart failure he was frowning but the telltale beads of perspiration on his forehead told nurse markey exactly how uncomfortable he was with this session she decided to make it easier for him because she was well aware that the best defense was always a good offense doctor she began i know exactly what youre going to say mrs shipley has complained that i walk in on her without knocking the fact is mrs shipley is doing a great deal of sleeping much more than she did even a few weeks ago and ive been a little concerned its probably just the emotional response to the death of her friends but i assure you that i open that door without invitation only when there is no response to repeated knocking she saw the flicker of uncertainty in lanes eyes before he spoke then i would suggest miss markey that if mrs shipley does not respond after a reasonable period you open the door slightly and call in to her the fact is shes becoming quite agitated about this and i want to head it off before it becomes a real problem but dr lane if i had not been in her room two nights ago when she had that spell something terrible might have happened the spell passed quickly and it turned out to be nothing i do appreciate your concern but i cant have these complaints do we understand each other miss markey of course doctor is mrs shipley planning to be at dinner this evening oh yes shell not only be there but shes having a guest miss holloway the stepdaughter of mrs moore mrs lane was told about that she said that miss holloway is going to collect mrs moores art supplies while she is here i see thank you miss markey as soon as she had left lane picked up the phone to call his wife at home when she answered he snapped why didnt you tell me maggie holloway would be having dinner here tonight what difference could that possibly make odile asked in a puzzled tone the difference is lane closed his lips and took a deep breath certain things were better left unsaid i want to know about any guests who are at dinner he said for one thing i want to be there to greet them i know that dear i arranged for us to dine in the residence tonight mrs shipley declined rather ungraciously when i suggested that she and her guest join us at our table but at least youll be able to chat with maggie holloway at the social hour all right he paused as though there was more he wanted to say but had changed his mind ill be home in ten minutes well you had better be if you want to freshen up odiles trilling laugh set lanes teeth on edge after all darling she continued if the rules insist that the guests be dressed for dinner i think the director and his wife should at least set a good example dont you earl bateman kept a tiny apartment on the hutchinson campus he found the small liberal arts college situated in a quiet section of providence an ideal spot from which to do research for his lectures overshadowed by the other institutions of higher learning in the area hutchinson nonetheless had excellent standards and earls class in anthropology was considered a major attraction there anthropology the science that deals with the origins physical and cultural development racial characteristics and social customs and beliefs of mankind earl began any new term by having his students memorize those words as he was fond of repeating the difference between many of his colleagues and himself was that he felt true knowledge of any people or culture began with the study of their rituals of death it was a subject that never failed to fascinate him or his listeners as demonstrated by the fact that he was increasingly in demand as a speaker in fact several national speakers bureaus had written to offer him substantial fees to be the luncheon or dinner speaker at events as far as a year and a half away he found their correspondence most gratifying from what we understand professor you really make even the subject of death very entertaining was typical of the letters he received regularly he also found their response rewarding his fee for such engagements was now three thousand dollars plus expenses and there were more offers than he could accept on wednesdays earls last class was at pm which today gave him the rest of the afternoon to polish his speech for a womens club and to answer his mail one letter he had received recently intrigued him to the point that he could not get it off his mind a cable station had written to ask whether he felt he had sufficient material to do a series of halfhour illustrated television programs on the cultural aspects of death the remuneration would not be significant perhaps but they had pointed out that similar exposure had proven beneficial to a number of their other hosts sufficient material earl thought sarcastically as he propped his feet on the coffee table of course i have sufficient material death masks for example he thought ive never spoken on that topic the egyptians and romans had them the florentines began to make them in the late fourteenth century few people realize that a death mask exists of george washington his calm and even noble face in permanent repose with no hint of his illfitting wooden teeth that in life marred his appearance the trick was always to inject an element of human interest so that the people discussed were not perceived as objects of macabre interest but as sympathetic fellow humans the subject of tonights lecture had led earl to thinking of many other possibilities for lectures tonight of course he would talk about mourning attire through the ages but his research had made him realize that etiquette books were a rich source of other material some amy vanderbilt dictums he included were her halfcenturyago advice on muffling the clapper on the doorbell for the protection of the bereaved and avoiding the use of words such as died death or killed in notes of sympathy the clapper the victorians had a horror of being buried alive and wanted a bell hung over the grave with a string or wire threaded through an air vent into the coffin so that the person inside could ring in case he or she wasnt really dead but he wouldnt couldnt touch that subject again earl knew he had or could find enough material for any number of programs he was about to become famous he mused he earl the family joke would show them allthose sprawling raucous cousins those misbegotten descendants of a crazed avaricious thief who had cheated and schemed his way to wealth he felt his heart begin to pound dont think about them he warned himself concentrate on the lecture and on developing subjects for the cable program there was another topic he had been pondering one that he knew would be extremely well received but first he would have a drink just one he promised himself as he prepared a very dry martini in his combination kitchendinette as he took the first sip he reflected on the fact that often before death someone close to the soontobedeceased experienced a premonition a kind of uneasiness or warning of what was to come when he sat down again he removed his glasses rubbed his eyes and leaned his head back on the convertible couch that also served as his bed someone close like me he said aloud im not really that close to maggie holloway but i sense that she isnt close to anyone maybe thats why im the one who has been given the premonition i know that maggie is going to die very soon just as i was sure last week that nuala had only hours to live three hours later to the enthusiastic applause of the audience he began his lecture with a beaming and somewhat incongruous smile we dont want to talk about it but were all going to die occasionally the date is deferred weve all heard of people who were clinically dead then returned to life but other times the gods have spoken and the biblical prophecy ashes to ashes dustto dust is fulfilled he paused while the audience hung on his words maggies face filled his mindthat cloud of dark hair surrounding the small exquisite features dominated by those beautiful painfilled blue eyes at least he consoled himself soon she wont experience any more pain angela the softspoken maid who had admitted her yesterday showed maggie the supply closet where nualas art materials were kept typical of nuala she thought affectionately they had been piled on the shelves haphazardly but with angelas help it didnt take long to get them into boxes and with the assistance of a kitchen helper stowed in maggies car mrs shipley is waiting for you in her apartment the maid told her ill take you to her now thank you the young woman hesitated for a moment looking around the large activity room when mrs moore had her classes here everyone had such a good time it didnt matter that most of them couldnt draw a straight line just a couple of weeks ago she began by asking everyone to remember a slogan from world war ii the kind that were on posters hanging everywhere even mrs shipley joined in despite the fact that she had been so upset earlier that day why was she upset mrs rhinelander died that monday they were good friends anyhow i was helping to pass out materials and they came up with different slogans like keep em flying which mrs moore sketcheda flag flying behind an airplaneand everyone copied it and then someone suggested dont talk chum chew topps gum that was a slogan maggie exclaimed yes everybody laughed but as mrs moore explained it was meant as a serious warning to people who worked in defense industries not to say anything that a spy might overhear it was such a lively session angela smiled reminiscently it was the last class mrs moore taught we all miss her well id better take you up to mrs shipley she said greta shipleys warm smile when she saw maggie did not disguise the fact that there was a grayish pallor under her eyes and around her lips maggie noticed too that when she stood up she had to rest her hand on the arm of the chair for support she seemed tired and distinctly weaker than she had just yesterday maggie how lovely you look and how kind of you to come on such short notice mrs shipley said but we have a very pleasant group at the table and i do think youll enjoy them i thought wed have an aperitif here before we join the others that would be nice maggie agreed i hope you like sherry im afraid thats all i have i do like sherry unbidden angela went to the sideboard poured the amber liquid from a decanter into antique crystal glasses and served them both then she quietly left the room that girl is a treasure mrs shipley said so many little courtesies that would never occur to most of the others not that theyre not well trained she added quickly but angela is special did you collect nualas art supplies yes i did maggie told her angela helped me and she was telling me about one of nualas classes that she sat in on the one where you all drew posters greta shipley smiled nuala was positively wicked when she and i came up here after the class she took my drawing which of course was pretty badand added her own touches to it you must see it its in that second drawer she said pointing to the table next to the sofa maggie opened the drawer indicated and removed the heavy sheet of sketching paper looking at it she felt a sudden chill mrs shipleys original sketch vaguely resembled one defense worker with a hard hat talking to another on a train or bus behind them a longfaced figure in a black cape and hat was obviously eavesdropping nuala had drawn what was clearly her face and greta shipleys over those of the defense workers the image of a nurse with narrowed eyes and an outsized ear floated above the spy does this represent anyone here maggie asked mrs shipley laughed oh yes that dreadful sneak nurse markey although that day i thought it was just a joke all her snooping around but now im not so sure why is that maggie asked quickly i dont know she said maybe im just getting to be a bit fanciful old ladies do that sometimes you know now i think we really should go downstairs maggie found the grand salon to be a wonderfully attractive room rich in both design and furnishings the air was filled with the buzzing of wellbred voices that emanated from handsome senior citizens who were seated about the room from what maggie could see they ranged in age from late sixties to late eighties although greta whispered that an attractive woman in a black velvet suit with a ramrod straight back and lively eyes had just turned ninetyfour thats letitia bainbridge she whispered people told her she was crazy to pay four hundred thousand dollars for an apartment when she came here six years ago but she said that with the genes in her family the money would be well spent and of course time has proven her right shell be at our table and youll enjoy her i promise youll notice that the staff serves the guests without asking what they want mrs shipley continued most guests are allowed by the doctor to have a glass of wine or a cocktail those who arent are served perrier or a soft drink a lot of careful planning created this place maggie thought i can see why nuala thought seriously of living here she remembered that dr lane had said he was sure nuala would have reinstated her application if she had lived glancing around maggie noticed that dr lane and his wife were approaching odile lane was wearing an aqua silk shirt and matching long skirt an outfit maggie had seen in the bou tique where she herself had shopped on the other occasions when she had seen mrs lane the night nuala died and at the funeralshe hadnt really focused on her now she realized that odile was actually a beautiful woman then she acknowledged to herself that even though he was balding and somewhat portly dr lane was attractive as well his demeanor was both welcoming and courtly when he reached her he took maggies hand and raised it to his lips stopping just before they touched it in the european fashion what a great pleasure he said his tone resonating with sincerity and may i say that even in one day you look considerably more rested youre obviously a very strong young woman oh darling must you always be so clinical odile lane interrupted maggie its a pleasure what do you think of all this she waved her hand in an allencompassing gesture obviously indicating the elegant room i think that compared to some of the nursing homes ive photographed its heaven why did you choose to photograph nursing homes dr lane asked it was an assignment for a magazine if you ever wanted to do a shoot herethat is the expression isnt itim sure it could be arranged he offered ill certainly keep that in mind maggie replied when we learned you were coming we so hoped to have you sit at our table odile lane said and then sighed but mrs shipley wasnt having any of it she said she wanted you with her friends at her usual table she wagged her finger at greta shipley naughty naughty she trilled maggie saw mrs shipleys lips tighten maggie she said abruptly i want you to meet some of my other friends a few minutes later soft chimes announced that dinner was being served greta shipley took maggies arm as they walked down the corridor to the dining room and maggie couldnt help but notice a distinct quiver in her movement mrs shipley are you sure you dont feel ill maggie asked no not a bit its just that its such a pleasure to have you here i can see why nuala was so happy and excited when you came back into her life again there were ten tables in the dining room each with place settings for eight people oh tonight theyre using the limoges china and the white linen mrs shipley said with satisfaction some of the other settings are a little too elaborate for my taste another beautiful room maggie thought from what she had read of this mansion the original banquet table for this room had seated sixty people when the house was renovated and refurbished the draperies were copied from the ones in the state dining room of the white house mrs shipley told her as they took their seats now maggie you must meet your dinner companions maggie was seated at greta shipleys right the woman next to her was letitia bainbridge who opened the conversation by saying youre so pretty i understand from greta that youre not married is there anyone special in your life no maggie said with a smile as the familiar ache stabbed at her excellent mrs bainbridge said decisively i have a grandson id like to introduce to you when he was a teenager i used to think he was a bit dim long hair and a guitar all that dear god but now at thirtyfive hes everything anyone could hope for hes president of his own company doing something important with computers letitia the matchmaker one of the others said laughing ive met the grandson forget it greta shipley whispered to maggie then in a normal tone introduced her to the others three women and two men i managed to snare the buckleys and the crenshaws for our table she said one problem in any of these places is that they tend to become a pavilion of women so that getting any male conversation becomes a struggle it proved to be an interesting lively group at the table and maggie kept asking herself why nuala had changed her mind so abruptly about living here surely she wouldnt have done it because she thought i needed the house she reasoned she knew dad left me a little money and i can take care of myself then why letitia bainbridge was particularly amusing as she told stories of newport when she was young there was so much anglomania then she said sighing all the mothers were anxious to marry their daughters off to english nobility poor consuelo vanderbilther mother threatened to commit suicide if she didnt marry the duke of marlborough she finally did and stuck it out for twenty years then she divorced him and married a french intellectual jacques balsan and was finally happy and there was that dreadful squire moore everyone knew he came from nothing but to hear him talk he was a direct descendant of brian boru but he did have a bit of charm and at least the pretense of a title so of course he married well and i suppose there isnt much difference between impoverished nobility marrying an american heiress and an impoverished mayflower descendant marrying a selfmade millionaire the difference is that squires god was money and hed do anything to accumulate it and unfortunately that characteristic has shown up in a number of his descendants it was over dessert that anna pritchard who was recovering from a hip operation joked greta when i was walking with mrs lane this morning guess who i saw eleanor chandler she was with dr lane of course i know she didnt recognize me so i didnt say anything to her but she was admiring your apartment the maid had just cleaned it and the door was open eleanor chandler letitia bainbridge mused she went to school with my daughter a rather forceful person if im not mistaken is she thinking of coming here i dont know mrs pritchard said but i cant imagine any other reason shed be looking around greta youd better change your locks if eleanor wants your apartment shed think nothing of having you dispossessed let her try greta shipley said with a hearty laugh when maggie left mrs shipley insisted on walking her to the door i wish you wouldnt maggie urged i know youre rather tired never mind ill have my meals sent up tomorrow and give myself a lazy day then im going to call you tomorrow and id better find you doing just that maggie kissed the soft almost translucent cheek of the older woman till tomorrow she said thursday october rd in the six days since nuala moore had been found murdered in her home chief of police chet browers initial instinct had become a certainty at least in his own mind no random thief had committed that crime of that he was now sure it had to be someone who knew mrs moore probably someone she trusted but who and what was the motive he asked himself it was browers habit to think through such questions out loud with detective jim haggerty on thursday morning he called haggerty into his office to review the situation mrs moore may have left her door unlocked and in that case anyone could have walked in on the other hand she might very well have opened it for someone she knew either way there was no sign of forced entry jim haggerty had worked with brower for fifteen years he knew he was being used as a sounding board so while he had his own opinions he would wait to share them he had never forgotten overhearing a neighbor describe him once saying jim may look more like a grocery clerk than a cop but he thinks like a cop he knew that the remark was meant as a compliment of sorts he also knew that it wasnt totally unjustifiedhis mild bespectacled appearance was not exactly a hollywood casting directors image of supercop but that disparity sometimes worked to his advantage his benign demeanor tended to make people more comfortable around him so they relaxed and talked freely lets proceed on the premise that it was someone she knew brower continued his brow creased with thought that opens the suspect list to nearly everyone in newport mrs moore was well liked and active in the community her latest project was to give art lessons at that latham manor place haggerty knew that his boss did not approve of latham manor or of places like it he was bothered by the idea of senior citizens investing that much nonrefundable money in a kind of gamble that they would live long enough to make the investment worthwhile his own opinion was that since browers motherinlaw had been living with him for almost twenty years now the chief was just plain envious of anyone whose parent could afford to live out her declining years in a luxurious residence instead of her childs guest bedroom but i think we can eliminate most of newport by considering the fact that whoever killed mrs moore and then ransacked her house could hardly help seeing the preparations shed been making for a dinner party brower mused the table was set haggerty began then quickly closed his lips he had interrupted his boss browers frown deepened i was getting to that so that means that whoever was in the house wasnt worried that somebody might arrive on the scene any minute which means that it is a good chance the killer will turn out to be one of the dinner guests we talked to in the neighbors house friday night or less likely someone who knew when the guests were expected he paused its time to take a serious look at all of them wipe the slate clean forget what we know about them start from scratch he leaned back what do you think jim haggerty proceeded carefully chief i had a hunch you might be thinking along those lines and you know how i like to pass the time of day with people so i did a little looking in that direction already and i think ive turned up a few things that might be interesting brower eyed him speculatively go on well im sure you saw the expression on the face of that pompous windbag malcolm norton when mrs woods told us about the will change and the canceled sale i saw it what id call shock and dismay heavily tinged with anger you know its common knowledge that nortons law practice is down to dog bites and the kind of divorces that involve splitting the pickup truck and the secondhand car so it interested me to find out where hed get the kind of money hed need to buy mrs moores house i also unearthed a little gossip about him and his secretary a woman named barbara hoffman interesting so where did he get the money brower asked by mortgaging his own house which is probably his biggest asset maybe his only asset even talked his wife into cosigning does she know he has a girlfriend from what i gather that woman misses nothing then why would she jeopardize their one mutual asset thats what id like to know i talked to someone at hopkins realtorsand got their opinion on the transaction frankly they were surprised that norton was willing to pay two hundred thousand for the moore place according to them the house needs a total overhaul does nortons girlfriend have money no everything i could find out indicated that barbara hoffmans a nice woman a widow who raised and educated her kids alone and who has a modest bank balance haggerty forestalled the next question my wifes cousin is a teller at the bank hoffman deposits fifty dollars in her savings account twice a month the question then is why did norton want that house is there oil on the property if there is he cant touch it the section of the property on the water side is designated wetland the buildable part of the lot is small which restricts even enlarging the house much and unless youre on the top floor you dont have a view i think id better have a talk with norton brower said id suggest having a talk with his wife too chief everything i learned indicates shes too shrewd to be talked into mortgaging her house without a very good reason and it would have to be one that will benefit her okay its as good a place as any to start brower stood up by the way i dont know if youve seen the background check we did on maggie holloway it would appear shes clean her father apparently left her a little money and she seems to be very successful as a photographer bringing down fairly big bucks so theres no money motive on her part that i can see and theres no question that shes telling the truth about what time she left new york the doorman at her apartment building verified it id like to have a chat with her haggerty offered mrs moores phone bill shows that she talked to maggie holloway a halfdozen times in the week before the murder maybe something moore told her about the people she was inviting to the dinner would come out something that might give us a lead he paused then added but chief you know the thing thats driving me nuts is not having any idea what nuala moores murderer was looking for when he or she ransacked that house ill bet my bottom dollar thats the key to this crime maggie awoke early but waited until eleven before she phoned greta shipley she had been deeply concerned about how frail greta had seemed last evening and hoped that she had gotten a good nights sleep there was no answer in the room maybe mrs shipley is feeling much better and went downstairs she told herself the telephone rang fifteen minutes later it was dr lane maggie i have very sad news he said mrs shipley had asked not to be disturbed this morning but an hour ago nurse markey thought it best to check on her anyway sometime last night she died peacefully in her sleep maggie sat for a long time after the phone call numb with sadness but also angry at herself for not being more insistent that mrs shipley get a medical opinionan outside medical opinionto determine what was wrong dr lane said that all indicators pointed to heart failure clearly she had not felt well all evening first nuala now greta shipley two women best friends now both dead in one week maggie thought she had been so excited so happy to have nuala back in her life and now this maggie thought of the time when nuala had first given her a jar of wet clay although she was only six nuala recognized the fact that if maggie had any particular artistic talent it was not as a painter youre no rembrandt nuala had said laughing but just seeing you play with that crazy plastic clay i have a hunch she had propped up a picture of maggies miniature poodle porgie in front of her try to copy him she had instructed that had been the beginning ever since maggie had enjoyed a love affair with sculpting early on however she had realized that as satisfying as it was artistically for her it could only be a hobby fortunately she also had an interest in photographyin which she proved to be genuinely talentedand so she had made that her career but her passion for sculpting had never left her i still remember how wonderful it felt to put my hands in that clay maggie thought as dryeyed she climbed the stairs to the third floor i was clumsy with it but i recognized something was happening that with clay there was a connection from my brain to my fingers now with the news of greta shipleys death something that still hadnt really sunk in maggie knew she had to get her hands into wet clay it would be therapeutic and it would also give her a chance to think to try to work out what she should do next she began work on a bust of nuala but soon realized that it was greta shipleys face that now filled her mind she had looked so pale last night maggie remembered she rested her hand on the chair when she got up and then took my arm when we walked from the grand salon in to dinner i could feel how weak she was today she had intended to stay in bed she wouldnt admit it but she was feeling ill and the day we went to the cemeteries she talked about feeling as if she was being waited on too much as if she had no energy thats the way it happened to dad maggie remembered his friends told her that pleading fatigue he had skipped a sched uled dinner with them and had gone to bed early he never woke up heart failure exactly what dr lane said happened to greta empty she thought i feel so empty it was no use trying to work now she felt no inspiration even the clay was failing her dear god she thought another funeral greta shipley had never had children so probably there would be mostly friends in attendance funeral the word jogged her memory she thought of the pictures she had taken at the cemeteries certainly they would be developed by now she should pick them up and study them but study them for what she shook her head she didnt have the answer yet but she was sure there was one she had left the rolls of film at a drugstore on thames street as she parked the car she reflected how only yesterday just down the block she had bought an outfit to wear to last nights dinner with greta how less than a week ago she had driven up to newport so excited about her visit with nuala now both women were dead was there some connection she asked herself the thick packet of prints was waiting for her at the photography counter at the back of the drugstore the clerk raised his eyes when he looked at the bill you did want all of these enlarged ms holloway yes thats right she resisted the urge to open the packet immediately when she got home she would go right upstairs to the studio and study the photos carefully when she arrived at the house however she found a latemodel bmw backing out of her driveway the driver a man who appeared to be about thirty hastily pulled out to make room for her he then parked on the street got out of his car and was already walking up the driveway as maggie opened her car door what does he want she wondered he was well dressed good looking in an upscale sort of way so she felt no sense of insecurity still his aggressive presence bothered her miss holloway he said i hope i didnt startle you im douglas hansen i wanted to reach you but your phone number isnt listed so since i had an appointment in newport today i thought id swing by and leave you a note its on the door he reached in his pocket and handed her his card douglas hansen investment advisor the address was in providence one of my clients told me about mrs moores passing i didnt really know her but id met her on several occasions i wanted to tell you how sorry i was but also to ask you if youre planning to sell this house thank you mr hansen but i havent made any decision maggie said quietly the reason i wanted to speak to you directly is that before you list the place with a realtor if indeed you do decide to sell i have a client who would be interested in acquiring it through me her daughter is planning a divorce and wants to have a place to move to when she breaks the news to her husband i know theres a lot of work to be done here but the mother can afford that her name is one you would recognize probably not i dont know many newport people maggie said then lets say that many people would recognize the name thats why they have asked me to act as intermediary discretion is very important how do you even know that the house is mine to sell maggie asked hansen smiled miss holloway newport is a small town mrs moore had many friends some of them are my clients hes expecting me to ask him in to discuss this whole thing maggie thought but im not going to do it instead she said noncommittally as i told you i have made no decision as yet but thank you for your interest ill keep your card she turned and started walking toward the house let me add that my client is willing to pay two hundred and fifty thousand dollars i believe that that amount is significantly higher than the offer mrs moore was prepared to accept you seem to know a great deal mr hansen maggie said newport must be a very small town thank you again i will call if i decide to sell again she turned toward the house just one more thing miss holloway i have to ask you not to mention this offer to anyone too many people would guess the identity of my client and it could become a significant problem for her daughter you neednt worry im not in the habit of discussing my business with anyone goodbye mr hansen this time she moved briskly up the walk but obviously he was intent on slowing her down thats quite a stack of photographs he said indicating the package under her arm as she looked back once more i understand youre a commercial photographer this area must be a wonderland for you this time maggie did not answer but with a dismissive nod she turned and crossed the porch to the door the note hansen had mentioned had been wedged in next to the door handle maggie took it without reading it then slipped the key into the lock when she looked out the living room window she saw douglas hansen driving away suddenly she felt terribly foolish am i starting to jump at my own shadow she asked herself that man must have thought i was a fool the way i scurried in here and i certainly cant ignore his offer if i do decide to sell thats fifty thousand dollars more than malcolm norton offered nuala no wonder he looked so upset when mrs woods told us about the willhe knew he was getting a bargain maggie went directly upstairs to the study and opened the envelope containing the photographs it didnt help her state of mind that the first one her eye fell on was of nualas grave and on it the now fading flowers greta shipley had left lying at the base of the tombstone as neil stephens turned his car in to the driveway that led to his parents home he took in the trees that lined the property their leaves now ablaze with the gold and amber the burgundy and cardinal red colors of fall coming to a stop he admired as well the fall plantings around the house his fathers new hobby was gardening and each season he displayed a new array of flowers before neil could get out of the car his mother had flung open the side door of the house and rushed out as he stepped out she hugged him then reached up to smooth his hair a familiar gesture he remembered from childhood oh neil its so good to see you she exclaimed his father appeared behind her his smile an indication of his pleasure at seeing his son although his greeting was somewhat less effusive youre running late pal we tee up in half an hour your mother has a sandwich ready i forgot my clubs neil said then relented when he saw his fathers horrified expression sorry dad that was a joke and not funny i had to talk harry scott into switching starting times with us if we want to play eighteen holes weve got to be there by two were having dinner at the club he clasped neils shoulder glad youre here son it was not until they were on the back nine of the golf course that his father opened the subject he had mentioned on the phone one of the old girls whose income tax i handle is on the verge of a nervous breakdown he said some young fellow in providence talked her into investing in some flybynight stock and now shes lost the money that was supposed to take care of her later she had hoped to move into that fancy retirement residence i told you about neil eyed his shot and selected a club from the bag the caddie was holding carefully he tapped the ball swung then nodded with satisfaction as it rose in the air soaring over the pond and landing on the green of the next hole youre better than you used to be his father said approvingly but youll notice i went farther on the green using an iron they talked as they walked to the next hole dad what you just told me about that woman is something i hear all the time neil said just the other day a couple whose investments ive been handling for ten years came in all fired up and wanting to pour most of their retirement income into one of the craziest harebrained schemes ive ever come across fortunately i was able to dissuade them apparently this woman didnt consult with anyone right certainly not with me and the stock was on one of the exchanges or was it over the counter it was listed and it had a brief fast runup and then dropped like a stone and now it isnt worth the paper it was written on thats about it youve heard the expression theres a sucker born every minute for some reason that goes double in the market otherwise fairly bright people go brain dead when someone gives them a hot tip in this instance i think there was some kind of extraordinary pressure applied anyhow i wish youd talk to her her name is laura arlington maybe you can go over the rest of her portfolio with her and see what she can do to enhance her remaining income i told her about you and she said shed like to talk to you id be glad to dad i just hope its not too late at sixthirty dressed for dinner they sat on the back porch sipping cocktails and looking out at narragansett bay you look great mom neil said with affection your mothers always been a pretty woman and all the tender loving care shes received from me over the last fortythree years has only enhanced her beauty his father said noticing the bemused expression on their faces he added what are you two smiling at you know full well ive also waited on you hand and foot dear dolores stephens replied neil are you still seeing that girl you brought up here in august his father asked who was that neil wondered momentarily oh gina no as a matter of fact im not it seemed the right time to ask about maggie there is someone ive been seeing whos visiting her stepmother in newport for a couple of weeks her name is maggie holloway unfortunately she left new york before i got her phone number here whats the stepmothers name his mother asked i dont know her last name but her first name is unusual finnuala its celtic i believe that sounds familiar dolores stephens said slowly searching her memory does it to you robert i dont think so no thats a new one on me he told her isnt it funny i feel as though ive heard that name recently dolores mused oh well maybe it will come to me the phone rang dolores got up to answer it now no long conversations robert stephens warned his wife weve got to leave in ten minutes the call however was for him its laura arlington dolores stephens said as she handed the portable phone to her husband she sounds terribly upset robert stephens listened for a minute before speaking his voice consoling laura youre going to get yourself sick over this my son neil is in town ive spoken to him about you and he will go over everything with you in the morning now promise me youll calm yourself down earl batemans last class before the weekend had been at pm that afternoon he had stayed in his campus apartment for several hours grading papers then just as he was about to leave for newport the phone rang it was his cousin liam calling from boston he was surprised to hear from liam they had never had much in common whats this all about he asked himself he responded to liams hearty attempts at general conversation with monosyllabic answers it was on the tip of his tongue to tell him about the cable series but he knew it would only become yet another family joke maybe he should invite liam over for a drink and leave the latest threethousanddollar check from the speakers bureau where he couldnt miss seeing it good idea he decided but then he felt anger build as liam gradually got to the point of the call the gist of which was that if earl was going to newport for the weekend he shouldnt just drop in on maggie holloway his visit the other day had upset her why earl spat out the word his irritation growing look earl you think you can analyze people well ive known maggie for a year shes a terrific girlin fact i hope i can soon make her realize just how special she is to me but i promise you shes not the kind whos going to cry on someones shoulder shes contained shes not one of your prehistoric cretins mutilating herself because shes unhappy i lecture about tribal customs not prehistoric cretins earl said stiffly and i stopped in to see her because of genuine concern that she like nuala might carelessly leave the door unlocked liams voice became soothing earl im not saying this right what im trying to tell you is that maggie isnt fey the way poor old nuala was it isnt necessary to warn her especially when it comes out more like a threat look why dont we have a drink over the weekend fine hed shove the check under liams nose come over to my place tomorrow night around six earl said not good im having dinner with maggie how about saturday all right i guess see you then so hes interested in maggie holloway after all earl thought as he hung up the phone one would never have guessed it from the way he left her by herself at the four seasons party but that was typical of liam the gladhander he reasoned he did know one thing for certain though if hed been seeing maggie for a year he would have paid much more attention to her once again a strange feeling came over him a premonition that something was about to go wrong that maggie holloway was in danger the same sensation hed had last week regarding nuala the first time earl had had such a premonition was when he was sixteen he had been in the hospital at the time recovering from an appendix operation his best friend ted stopped in to see him on his way to an afternoon of sailing something had made earl want to ask ted not to go out on the boat but that would have sounded stupid he remembered how all afternoon he had felt as though he were waiting for an ax to fall they found teds boat two days later adrift there were a number of theories as to what had gone wrong but there were never any answers earl of course never talked about the incident nor about his failure to give his friend a warning and now earl didnt ever let himself think about the other times the presentiment had come five minutes later he set off on the thirtysixmile drive to newport at fourthirty he stopped at a small store in town to pick up some groceries and it was there that he heard about the death of greta shipley before she went to live in latham manor she used to do her shopping here the stores elderly owner ernest winter said regretfully a real nice lady my mother and father were friends of hers earl said had she been ill from what i hear she wasnt feeling well the last couple of weeks two of her closest friends died recently one at latham manor and then mrs moore was murdered i guess that really got to her that can happen you know funny i should remember it but i recall years ago mrs shipley told me that there was a saying death comes in threes looks like she was right kind of gives you the chills though earl picked up his packages another interesting lecture topic he thought is it possible that there is a psychological basis for thatexpression as there is for so many others her close friends were gonedid something in greta shipleys spirit cry out to them wait imcoming too that made two new topics he had come up with just today for his lecture series earlier he had come across a newspaper item about a new supermarket about to open in england where the bereaved could select all the necessary trappings for a funeral casket lining clothing for the deceased flowers guest book even the grave site if necessaryand thereby eliminate the middleman the funeral director its a good thing the family got out of the business when they did earl decided as he said goodbye to mr winter on the other hand the new owners of the bateman funeral home had handled mrs rhinelanders funeral nualas funeral and would undoubtedly handle greta shipleys funeral too it was only appropriate since his father had taken care of her husbands final arrangements business is booming he thought ruefully as they followed john the maître d into the yacht club dining room robert stephens stopped and turned to his wife look dolores theres cora gebhart lets go by her table and say hello last time we talked im afraid i was a little harsh with her she was going on about cashing in some bonds for one of those crazy venture schemes and i got so irritated i didnt even ask her what it was just told her to forget it ever the diplomat neil thought as he dutifully trailed in his parents footsteps as they crossed the restaurant although he also noted that his father did not signal their detour to the maître d who was blithely heading for a window table unaware that he had lost the stephens family cora i owe you an apology robert stephens began expansively but first i dont think youve ever met my son neil hello robert dolores how are you cora gebhart looked up at neil her lively eyes warm and interested your father brags about you all the time youre the head of the new york office of carson amp parker i understand well its a pleasure to meet you yes i am and thank you its nice to meet you too im glad to hear my father brags about me most of my life hes been secondguessing me i can understand that hes always secondguessing me too but robert you dont owe me an apology i asked for your opinion and you gave it well thats fine id hate to hear that another one of my clients lost her shirt investing in highrisk flings dont worry about this one cora gebhart responded robert poor john is waiting with the menus at our table neils mother urged as they threaded their way through the room neil wondered whether his father had missed the tone mrs gebhart used when she said not to worry about her dollars to donuts she didnt take his advice neil thought they had finished their meal and were lingering over coffee when the scotts stopped by their table to say hello neil you owe harry a word of thanks robert stephens said by way of introduction he switched teeoff times with us today didnt matter harry scott responded lynn was in boston for the day so we planned on a late dinner anyway his wife stocky and pleasant faced asked dolores do you remember meeting greta shipley at a luncheon here for the preservation society it was three or four years ago i think she sat at our table yes i liked her very much why she died last night in her sleep apparently im so sorry what upsets me lynn scott continued contritely is that id heard that she had lost two close friends recently and id been meaning to call her one of the friends was that poor woman who was murdered in her home last friday you must have read about that her stepdaughter from new york discovered the body stepdaughter from new york neil exclaimed excitedly his mother interrupted him thats where i read that name it was in the newspaper finnuala neil she was the woman who was murdered when they got back home robert stephens showed neil the neatly bound newspapers in the garage waiting for recycling it was in saturdays paper the th his father told him im sure its in that pile the reason i didnt remember the name right away was that in the article they called her nuala moore his mother said it was only somewhere toward the end of the article that her complete first name was mentioned two minutes later with increasing dismay neil was reading the account of nuala moores death as he did his mind kept replaying the happiness in maggies eyes when she told him about finding her stepmother again and the plans she had made to visit her she gave me the five happiest years of my childhood she had said maggie maggie neil thought where was she now had she gone back to new york he quickly called her apartment but her phone message was unchangedshe would be gone until the th the address of nuala moores home was in the newspaper account of the murder but when he called information he was told that the phone there was unlisted damn he exclaimed as he snapped the receiver back on the cradle neil his mother said softly its quarter of eleven if this young woman is still in newport whether at that house or somewhere else its no time to go looking for her drive over there in the morning and if you dont find her there then try the police station theres a criminal investigation taking place and since she discovered the body the police will certainly know where to reach her listen to your mother son his father said now youve had a long day i suggest you pack it in i guess so thanks both of you neil kissed his mother touched his fathers arm and walked dejectedly into the hallway that led to the bedrooms dolores stephens waited until her son was out of earshot then quietly said to her husband i have a feeling neil has finally met a girl he really cares about even a painstaking examination of each of the enlarged photographs did not reveal to maggie anything on those graves that should have troubled her subconscious so greatly they all looked the same showed the same things headstones with varying degrees of plantings around them grass still velvety green in this early fall season except nualas which had sod that showed some patchy spots sod for some reason that word struck a note with her mrs rhinelanders grave must have been freshly sodded as well she had died only two weeks earlier once more maggie studied all the photographs of constance rhinelanders grave using a magnifying glass to pore over every inch of them the only thing that attracted her attention was a small hole showing in the plantings around the headstone it looked as though a rock or something might have been removed from there whoever had taken it had not bothered to smooth over the earth she looked again at the best closeups she had of the tombstone at nualas grave the sod there was smooth to the point where the plantings began but in one of the shots she thought she could detect somethinga stonejust behind the flowers greta shipley had left yesterday was whatever it was there simply because the earth had been carelessly sifted for clods and stones after the interment or was it perhaps a cemetery marker of some sort there was an odd glint she studied the pictures of the other four graves but could see nothing on any of them that should have attracted her attention finally she laid the prints down on a corner of the refectory table and reached for an armature and the pot of wet clay using recent pictures of nuala shed found around the house maggie began to sculpt for the next several hours her fingers became one with clay and knife as she began to shape nualas small lovely face suggesting the wide round eyes and full eyelashes she insinuated the signs of age in the lines around the eyes and around the mouth and neck and in the shoulders that curved forward she could tell that when she was done she would have succeeded in catching those traits she had so loved in nualas face the indomitable and merry spirit behind a face that on someone else might have been merely pretty like odile lane she thought and then winced at the memory of how the woman had wagged her finger at greta shipley barely twentyfour hours ago naughty naughty she had said as she cleaned up maggie thought about the people she had dined with last evening how distressed they must be she thought it was obvious how much they enjoyed greta and now she is gone so suddenly maggie looked at her watch as she went downstairs nine oclock not really too late to phone mrs bainbridge she decided letitia bainbridge answered on the first ring oh maggie were all heartsick greta hadnt been feeling well for a few weeks but till then she was perfectly fine i knew she was on blood pressure and heart medicine but shed been on them for years and never had any problems i came to like her so much in such a short time maggie said sincerely i can imagine how all of you must feel do you know what the arrangements are yes bateman funeral is handling them i guess well all end up there the requiem is saturday morning at eleven at trinity episcopal church and interment is at trinity cemetery greta had left instructions that the only viewing was to be at batemans between nine and tenthirty ill be there maggie promised did she have any family some cousins i gather theyre coming i know that she left her securities and the contents of her apartment to them so they certainly should show that much respect for her letitia bainbridge paused then added maggie do you know what has haunted me practically the last thing i said to greta last night was that if eleanor chandler had been seen eyeing her apartment then she should change her locks but she was amused by the remark maggie protested please you mustnt let that upset you oh thats not what upsets me its the fact that id bet anything no matter who else may be on the list eleanor chandler gets that place now im specializing in late dinners maggie thought as she put on the kettle scrambled some eggs and dropped bread into the toasterand not particularly exciting ones she added at least tomorrow night i can count on liam to buy me a good meal it would be good to see him she reflected he was always fun in an outrageous kind of way she wondered if he had talked to earl bateman about his unexpected visit monday night she hoped so not wanting to spend any more time in the kitchen she prepared a tray and carried it into the living room even though nuala had met her death in this room less than a week ago maggie had come to realize that for nuala this had been a happy warm room the back and sides of the fireplace were blackened with soot the bellows and tongs on the hearth showed signs of frequent use maggie could imagine having roaring fires here on cold new england evenings the bookcases were overflowing with books interesting titles all of them many familiar others she would love to explore she had already gone through the photo albumsthe dozens of snapshots of nuala with tim moore showed two people who obviously enjoyed each others company larger framed pictures of tim and nualaboating with friends picnicking at formal dinners on vacationswere scattered on the walls the deep old club chair with the hassock probably had been his maggie decided she remembered that whether engrossed in a book chatting or watching television nuala had always liked to curl up kittenlike on the couch propped in a corner between the back and armrest no wonder the prospect of moving to latham manor had proven daunting maggie thought it would be quite a wrench for nuala to leave this home where obviously she had been happy for so many years but clearly she had considered moving there that first evening when they had had dinner after they met at the moore reunion nuala had mentioned that the kind of apartment she wanted in the residence home had just become available what apartment was it maggie wondered they had never discussed that maggie realized suddenly that her hands were trembling she carefully replaced the teacup on the saucer could the apartmentthat had become available to nuala possibly be the one that hadbelonged to greta shipleys friend constance rhinelander all he asked for was a little quiet but dr william lane knew he was not going to be granted that wish odile was as wound up as a top about to spin he lay in bed with his eyes closed wishing to god that at least she would turn off the damn light but instead she sat at her dressing table brushing her hair as a torrent of words poured from her lips these days are so trying arent they everyone just loved greta shipley and she was one of our charter members you know thats two of our sweetest ladies in as many weeks of course mrs rhinelander was eightythree but shed been doing so welland then all of a sudden you could see her start to fail thats the way it happens at a certain age isnt it closure the body just closes down odile did not seem to notice that her husband did not respond it didnt matter she continued anyway of course nurse markey was concerned about that little spell mrs shipley had monday night this morning she told me she spoke to you about it again yesterday i examined mrs shipley right after she had that spell dr lane said wearily there was no reason for alarm nurse markey brought up that episode only because she was trying to justify the fact that shed been barging into mrs shipleys apartment without knocking well of course youre the doctor dear dr lanes eyes flew open with sudden realization odile i dont want you discussing my patients with nurse markey he said sharply ignoring the tone of his voice odile continued that new medical examiner is quite young isnt she what was her name lara horgan i didnt know that dr johnson had retired he retired as of the first that was tuesday i wonder why anyone would choose to be a medical examiner especially such an attractive young woman but she does seem to know her business i doubt if shed have been appointed if she didnt know her business he responded tartly she stopped in with the police only because she was in the neighborhood and wanted to see our layout she asked very competent questions about mrs shipleys medical history now odile if you dont mind i really must get some sleep oh darling im sorry i know how tired you are and how upsetting this day has been odile put down the brush and took off her robe ever the glamour girl william lane thought as he watched his wifes preparations for bed in eighteen years of marriage he had never seen her wear a nightgown that wasnt frilly at one time she had charmed him no longer thoughnot for years she got into bed and at last the light went out but now william lane was no longer sleepy as usual odile had managed to say something that would gnaw at him that young medical examiner was a different cut from good old dr johnson he had always approved death certificates with a casual wave of his pen be careful lane warned himself in the future youve got to be more careful friday october th when maggie first awoke on friday morning she squinted at the clock and saw that it was only six she knew she probably had had enough sleep but she wasnt yet willing to get up so she closed her eyes again about half an hour later she fell into an uneasy sleep in which vague troublesome dreams came and went then faded altogether when she woke up again at seventhirty she arose feeling groggy and headachy and decided that a brisk afterbreakfast walk along ocean drive would probably help clear her head i need that she thought especially since ive got to go to the cemeteries again this morning and tomorrow youll be at trinity cemetery for mrs shipleys funeral an interior voice reminded her for the first time maggie realized that mrs bainbridge had said that greta shipley was being buried there not that that made a difference she would have gone to both cemeteries today no matter what after spending so much time going over those photographs last night she was anxious to see what was causing the odd glint she detected on nualas grave she showered dressed in jeans and a sweater and had a quick juice and coffee before she went out maggie was immediately glad she had made the decision to take the walk the early fall day was magnificent the sun was brilliant as it rose in the sky though there was a cool ocean breeze that made her thankful she had reached for her jacket there was also the glorious sound of the crashing waves and the unique wonderful scent of salt and sea life that filled the air i could fall in love with this place she thought nuala spent her summers here when she was a girl how she must have missed this when she moved away from it after a mile maggie turned and retraced her steps looking up she realized that only a glimpse of the third floor of nualas housemy house she thoughtshowed from the road there are too many trees around it she told herself they should come down or at least be trimmed and i wonder why the end of the property that would afford a dropdead view of the ocean has never been built on could there be restrictions against building there the question nagged at her as she finished her walk i really should look into that she thought from what nuala told me tim moore bought this property at least fifty years ago havent there been any changes in building restrictions since then she wondered back at the house she paused only long enough to have another quick cup of coffee before she left promptly at nine she wanted to get the cemetery visits over with at quarter past nine neil stephens stopped his car in front of the mailbox with the name moore painted on it he got out walked up the path and onto the porch and rang the bell there was no answer feeling like a voyeur he went over to the window the shade was only half drawn and he had a clear view into what seemed to be the living room not knowing what he was looking for other than for some tangible sign that maggie holloway might be there he walked around to the back and peered through the window in the kitchen door he could see a coffeepot on the stove and next to the sink a cup and saucer and juice glass were upturned suggesting that they had been rinsed and left to dry but had they been there for days or only minutes finally he decided he had nothing to lose by ringing a neighbors bell and inquiring whether anyone had seen maggie he received no response at the first two houses he tried at the third house the doorbell was answered by an attractive couple who appeared to be in their midsixties as he quickly told them why he was there he realized he had lucked out the couple who introduced themselves as irma and john woods told him of nuala moores death and funeral and of maggies presence in the house we were supposed to visit our daughter last saturday but didnt go until after nualas funeral mrs woods explained just got back late last night i know maggie is here i havent spoken to her since we got back but i saw her go for a walk this morning and i saw her drive past about fifteen minutes ago john woods volunteered they invited him in for coffee and told him about the night of the murder what a sweet girl maggie is irma woods sighed i could tell how heartbroken she was about losing nuala but she isnt one to carry on the hurt was all in her eyes maggie neil thought i wish i could have been here for you the woodses had no idea where maggie might have gone this morning or how long she would be out ill leave her a note to call me neil decided theres nothing else i can do but then he had an inspiration when he drove away five minutes later he had left a note for maggie on the door and he also had her phone number tucked securely in his pocket remembering the curious questions asked by the child who had wanted to know why she was taking pictures at nualas grave maggie stopped at a florists and bought an assortment of fall flowers to place on the graves she intended to inspect as before once she passed the entrance to st marys the welcoming statue of the angel and the meticulously kept plots seemed to impart a sense of peace and immortality veering to the left she drove up the winding incline that led to nualas grave as she stepped from the car she sensed that a workman weeding the gravel path nearby was watching her she had heard of people being mugged in cemeteries but the thought passed quickly there were other workmen in the area as well but given the fact there was someone so close by she was glad she had thought to pick up the flowers she would rather not seem to be examining the grave squatting down next to the plot she selected a half dozen of the flowers and laid them one by one at the base of the tombstone the flowers greta shipley had placed there on tuesday had been removed and maggie quickly consulted the snapshot she was holding to see exactly where she had detected the glint of some metallike object it was fortunate she had brought the picture she realized because the object she was looking for had sunk more deeply into the moist earth and easily could have been missed but it was there she looked swiftly to the side and realized she had the workmans undivided attention kneeling forward she bowed her head and crossed herself then let her folded hands drop to the ground still in the posture of prayer her fingers touching the sod she dug around the object and freed it she waited for a moment when she glanced around again the workman had his back turned to her with one motion she yanked the object up and hastily concealed it between her joined palms as she did this she heard a muffled ringing sound a bell she thought why in gods name would anyone bury a bell on nualas grave certain that the workman had heard the sound as well she got up and walked quickly back to her car she laid the bell down on top of the remaining flowers not wanting to stay another minute under the scrutiny of the watchful maintenance worker she drove slowly in the direction of the second grave she wanted to visit she parked in the nearby culdesac then looked around there was no one nearby opening the car window she carefully picked up the bell and held it outside after brushing off the loose earth that clung to it she turned it around in her hand examining it her fingers holding the clapper to keep it from pealing the bell was about three inches high and surprisingly heavy not unlike an oldfashioned miniature school bell except for the decorative garland of flowers bordering the base the clapper was heavy too she noticed when allowed to hang freely it no doubt could make quite a sound maggie closed the car window held the bell near the floor of the car and swung it a melancholy but nevertheless clear ringing sound resounded through the car a stone for danny fisher she thought that was the title of one of the books that had been in her fathers library she remembered that as a child she had asked him what the title meant and he had explained that it was a tradition in the jewish faith that anyone stopping by the grave of a friend or relative would place a stone there as a sign of the visit could this bell signify something like that maggie wondered feeling vaguely as though she were doing something amiss in taking the bell she slid it out of sight under the seat of the car then she selected another halfdozen flowers and with the appropriate photograph in hand went to revisit the grave of another of greta shipleys friends her last stop was at mrs rhinelanders grave it had been the photograph of this grave that most clearly seemed to show a gap in the sod near the base of the tombstone as maggie arranged the remaining flowers on the damp grass her fingers sought and found the indented area maggie needed to think and she was not ready to go back to the house where there might be interruptions instead she drove into the center of town and found a luncheonette where she ordered a toasted blueberry muffin and coffee i was hungry she admitted to herself as the crusty muffin and strong coffee helped to dissipate the allencompassing uneasiness she had experienced in the cemeteries another memory of nuala flashed into her mind when maggie was ten porgie her roguish miniature poodle had jumped on nuala as she lay dozing on the couch she had let out a shriek and when maggie went running in nuala had laughed and said sorry honey i dont know why im so jumpy someone must be walking on my grave then because maggie had been at an age when she wanted to know everything nuala had had to explain that the expression was an old irish saying meaning that someone was walking over the spot where you would someday be buried there had to be a simple explanation for what she had found today maggie reasoned of the six burial plots she had visited four including nualas had bells at the base of the tombstone each exactly like the others in weight and size it appeared as well that one had been removed from the ground near mrs rhinelanders tombstone so that meant only one of greta shipleys friends had not received this odd tributeif indeed that was what it was as she drained the last of the coffee and shook her head refusing the waitresss smiling offer of a refill a name popped into maggies mind mrs bainbridge like greta shipley she had been at latham manor since it opened she must have known all those women too maggie realized back in her car maggie called letitia bainbridge on the cellular phone she was in her apartment come right over she told maggie id love to see you ive been a bit blue this morning im on my way maggie replied when she replaced the phone in its cradle she reached under the seat for the bell she had taken from nualas grave then she put it in her shoulder bag she shuddered involuntarily as she pulled away from the curb the metal had felt cold and clammy to her touch it had been one of the longest weeks of malcolm nortons life the shock of having nuala moore cancel the sale of her house followed by barbaras announcement that she was going to visit for an extended period with her daughter in vail had left him numbed and frightened he had to get his hands on that house telling janice about the impending change in the wetlands act had been a terrible mistake he should have taken a chance and forged her name on the mortgage papers he was that desperate which was why when barbara put through the call from chief brower on this friday morning malcolm felt perspiration spring out on his forehead it took him a few moments to compose himself enough to be satisfied that his tone of voice would radiate good cheer good morning chief how are you he said trying to put a smile in his voice chet brower clearly was not in the mood for chitchat im fine id like to drop over and talk with you for a few minutes today what about malcolm thought momentarily panicked but said in a hearty voice that would be great but i warn you i already bought my tickets to the policemens ball even in his own ears his stab at humor fell flat when are you free brower snapped norton had no intention of telling brower exactly how free he was i had a closing at eleven thats been postponed till one so i do have an opening ill see you at eleven well after hearing the dismissive click malcolm stared nervously at the receiver he held in his hand finally he set it down there was a gentle tap on the door and barbara poked her head in the office malcolm is there anything wrong what could be wrong he just wants to talk to me the only thing i can imagine is that it has to do with last friday night oh of course the murder the usual procedure is for the police to keep asking close friends if they might have remembered anything that didnt seem important at the time and of course you and janice did go to mrs moores for the dinner party you and janice malcolm frowned was that reference intended to remind him that he still had taken no action to legally separate from janice no unlike his wife barbara didnt play word games filled with hidden meanings her soninlaw was an assistant district attorney in new york she had probably heard him talk about his cases malcolm reasoned and of course television and movies were filled with details of police procedure she started to close the door again barbara he said his voice pleading just give me a little more time dont leave me now her only answer was to close the door with a firm click brower arrived promptly at eleven he sat bolt upright in the armchair opposite nortons desk and got right to the point mr norton you were due at nuala moores home at eight oclock the night of the murder yes my wife and i arrived at perhaps ten after eight from what i understand you had just arrived on the scene as you know we were instructed to wait in the home of nualas neighbors the woodses what time did you leave your office that evening brower asked nortons eyebrows raised he thought for a moment at the usual time no actually a bit later about quarter of six i had a closing outside the office and brought the file back here and checked on messages did you go directly home from here not quite barbara mrs hoffman my secretary had been out that day with a cold the day before she had taken home a file i needed to study over the weekend so i stopped at her house to pick it up how long did that take norton thought for a moment she lives in middletown there was tourist traffic so id say about twenty minutes each way so you were home around sixthirty actually it was probably a bit after that closer to seven i should think in fact he had gotten home at sevenfifteen he remembered the time distinctly silently malcolm cursed himself janice had told him that his face could have been read like an open book when irma woods had delivered the news about nualas will you looked as if you wanted to kill someone she had said a smirk on her face you cant even plan to cheat someone without something going wrong so this morning he quickly had prepared answers to questions that he anticipated brower would ask about his reaction to the canceled sale he would not let his emotions show again and he was glad he had thought the situation through thoroughly because in fact the officer asked a number of questions probing for details of the proposed sale must have been a bit of a letdown brower mused but on the other hand every realtor in town has a house like nuala moores just begging to be bought meaning why did i want this one norton thought sometimes people can really want a house just because it grabs them it says buy me im yours the chief continued norton waited you and mrs norton must have really fallen in love with it brower conjectured word is you mortgaged your own house to pay for it now brower was leaning back his eyes half closed his fingers locked together anybody who wants a house that badly would hate to know that a relative of sorts was about to arrive on the scene and maybe mess things up only one way to prevent that stop the relative or at least find a way to keep the relative from influencing the owner of the house brower stood up its been a pleasure talking to you mr norton he said now before i go do you mind if i have a word with your secretary mrs hoffman barbara hoffman did not enjoy dissembling she had stayed home last friday pleading a cold but actually what she had wanted was a quiet day to think things through to placate her conscience she had brought home a stack of files from the office which she intended to clean up she wanted them to be in good order if she decided to tell malcolm she was leaving oddly enough he had inadvertently helped her to make her decision he almost never came to her house but then unexpectedly he had dropped by on friday evening to see how she was feeling he of course did not realize that her neighbor dora holt had stopped in when barbara had opened the door he had bent to kiss her then at her negative look had stepped back oh mr norton she had said quickly i have that file on the moore closing that you wanted to pick up she had introduced him to dora holt and then made a show of going through the files and picking out one to hand him but she hadnt missed the knowing smirk and the lively curiosity in the eyes of the other woman and that was the moment when she knew the situation was intolerable now as she sat facing chief brower barbara hoffman felt sneaky and very uncomfortable telling him the lame story about why her employer had come to her home then mr norton only stayed a moment she relaxed a bit at least here she could be entirely truthful yes he took the file and left immediately what file was it mrs hoffman another lie she had to tell i im actually it was the file on the moore closing she cringed inwardly at the stammered apology in her voice just one more thing what time did mr norton get to your house a little after six i believe she replied honestly brower got up and nodded at the intercom on her desk would you tell mr norton that id like another moment with him please when chief brower returned to the lawyers office he didnt waste words mr norton i understand the file you picked up from mrs hoffman last friday evening was one concerning mrs moores closing when exactly was the closing scheduled on monday morning at eleven norton told him i wanted to be sure everything was in order you were the purchaser but mrs moore didnt have a separate lawyer representing her isnt that rather unusual not really but actually it was her idea nuala felt it was absolutely unnecessary to involve another attorney i was paying a fair price and was handing the money over to her in the form of a certified check she also had the right to stay there until the first of the year if she desired chief brower stared silently at malcolm norton for a few moments finally he stood to leave just one more thing mr norton he said the drive from mrs hoffmans house to your home shouldnt have taken more than twenty minutes that would have gotten you home by a few minutes past sixthirty yet you say it was nearly seven did you go anywhere else no perhaps i was mistaken about the time i arrived home why is he asking all these questions norton wondered whatdoes he suspect when neil stephens got back to portsmouth his mother knew immediately from the look on his face that he had not been successful in locating the young woman from new york you only had a piece of toast earlier she reminded him let me fix you breakfast after all she added i dont get much chance to fuss over you anymore neil sank into a chair at the kitchen table i should think fussing over dad is a fulltime job it is but i like it where is dad in his office cora gebhart the lady whose table we stopped at last night called and asked if she could come over and talk to him i see neil said distractedly jiggling the cutlery his mother had set in front of him dolores stopped her preparations and turned and looked at him when you start fiddling like that it means youre worried she said i am if i had called maggie as i intended last friday i would have had her phone number i would have called and i would have found out what happened and i would have been here to help her he paused mom you just dont know how hungry she was to spend this time with her stepmother youd never guess if you met her but maggies had a pretty bad time of it over waffles and bacon he told her all he knew about maggie what he didnt tell her was how angry he was at himself for not knowing more she really does sound lovely dolores stephens said im anxious to meet her but listen youve got to stop driving yourself crazy she is staying in newport and youve left her a note and you have the phone number youll surely reach her or hear from her today so just relax i know its just that i have this rotten feeling that there have been times when she needed me and i wasnt there for her afraid of getting involved right neil put his fork down thats not fair isnt it you know neil a lot of the smart successful young men of your generation who didnt marry in their twenties decided they could play the field indefinitely and some of them willthey really dont want to get involved but some of them also never seem to know when to grow up i just wonder if this concern on your part doesnt reflect a sudden realization that you care a lot about maggie holloway something you wouldnt admit to yourself earlier because you didnt want to get involved neil stared at his mother for a long moment and i thought dad was tough dolores stephens folded her arms and smiled my grandmother had a saying the husband is the head of the family the wife is the neck she paused and the neck turns the head seeing neils startled expression she laughed trust me i dont agree with that particular piece of downhome wisdom i think of a husband and wife as equals not game players but sometimes as in our case what seems to be is not necessarily what is your fathers fussing and complaining is his way of showing concern ive known that since our first date speak of the devil neil said as through the window he spotted his father walking down the path from his office his mother glanced out uhoh hes bringing cora in she looks upset in a very few minutes after his father and cora gebhart joined them at the kitchen table neil understood why she was upset on wednesday she had sold her bonds through the broker who had been so persistent in trying to get her to invest in a venture stock he had recommended and she had given the transaction a goahead i couldnt sleep last night she said i mean after what robert said at the club about not wanting another one of his ladies to lose her shirt i had the awful feeling he was talking about me and i sensed suddenly that id made a terrible mistake did you call this broker and cancel the buy neil asked yes that may be the one intelligent thing i did or tried to dohe said it was too late her voice trailed off and her lip trembled and he hasnt been in his office since then what is this stock neil asked ive got the information his father said neil read the prospectus and the fact sheet it was even worse than he expected he phoned his office and directed trish to put him through to one of the senior traders yesterday you bought fifty thousand shares at nine he told mrs gebhart well find out whats happening to it today tersely he appraised his trading associate of the situation then he turned again to mrs gebhart its at seven now im putting in a sell order she nodded her assent neil stayed on the line keep me posted he ordered when he hung up he said there was a rumor a few days ago that the company whose stock you purchased was being bought by johnson amp johnson but unfortunately im positive its just that a rumor intended to inflate the value of the stock artificially im terribly sorry mrs gebhart at least we should be able to save most of your capital my associate will call us back as soon as he makes a trade what makes me furious robert stephens growled is that this is the same broker who got laura arlington to invest in a flybynight company and caused her to lose her savings he seemed so nice cora gebhart said and he was so knowledgeable about my bonds explaining how even though they were taxfree the return didnt justify all that money being tied up in them and some were even losing buying power because of inflation the statement caught neils attention you must have told him about your bonds if he was so knowledgeable he said sharply but i didnt when he phoned to ask me to lunch i explained i had no interest in discussing investments but then he talked about the kind of clients he hadlike mrs downing he told me that she had had bonds similar to the ones many older people hold and that he made a fortune for her then he talked about exactly the bonds i hold who is this mrs downing neil asked oh everybody knows her shes a pillar of the providence old guard i did call her and she simply raved about douglas hansen i see even so id like to run a check on him neil said he sounds to me like just the kind of guy our business doesnt need the phone rang maggie neil thought let it be maggie instead it was his associate at the investment house neil listened then turned to cora gebhart he got you out at seven count yourself lucky theres a rumor just starting to circulate that johnson amp johnson is going to issue a statement saying it has absolutely no interest in taking over that company whether the rumor is true or not its enough to send the companys stock into a tailspin when cora gebhart left robert stephens looked at his son affectionately thank god you were here neil cora has a good head and a big heart but shes too trusting it would have been a damn shame to have her wiped out by one mistake as it is this may mean that shell have to give up the idea of moving into latham manor she had her eye on a particular apartment there but maybe shell still be able to take a smaller one latham manor neil said im glad you mentioned it i need to ask you about that place what on earth do you want to know about latham manor his mother asked neil told them about the van hillearys his clients who were looking for a retirement base i told them id investigate that place for them id almost forgotten i should have made an appointment to see it were not teeing up until one robert stephens said and latham isnt that far from the club why dont you call over and see if you can make an appointment now or at least pick up some literature about it for your clients never put off till tomorrow what you can do today neil said with a grin unless of course i can get hold of maggie first she must be home by now after six unanswered rings he replaced the receiver shes still out he said glumly okay wheres the phone book ill call latham manor lets get it out of the way dr william lane could not have been more pleasant youre calling at a very good time he said we have one of our best suites availablea twobedroom unit with a terrace its one of four such apartments and the other three are occupied by charming couples come right over dr lara horgan the new medical examiner for the state of rhode island had not been able to figure out what was making her uneasy but then it had been a busy week for her department extraordinary deaths had included two suicides three drownings and a felony murder the death of the woman at the latham manor residence on the other hand was to all appearances purely routine still something about it was bothering her the medical history of the deceased woman greta shipley had been perfectly straightforward her longtime doctor had retired but his associate verified that mrs shipley had a tenyear history of hypertension and had suffered at least one silent heart attack dr william lane the director and attending physician at latham manor seemed competent the staff had experience and the facilities were firstrate the fact that mrs shipley had had a weak spell at the funeral mass of her friend the murder victim nuala moore and a second spell only verified the tension she must have been under dr horgan had seen a number of instances where an elderly spouse expired hours or even minutes after the death of the husband or wife someone horrified by the circumstances of a dear friends death might easily experience that same fatal stress as state medical examiner dr horgan was familiar as well with the circumstances surrounding the death of nuala moore and she was aware how upsetting they might be to someone as close to the victim as mrs shipley had been multiple vicious blows to the back of mrs moores head had proven fatal grains of sand mixed in with blood and hair suggested that the perpetrator had found the weapon probably a rock somewhere on the beach and had entered the house carrying it it also suggested that the perpetrator had known the resident of the house was small and frail perhaps even actually knew mrs moore thats what it is she told herself the niggling feeling that nuala moores death is somehow tied in with the one at latham manor is whats sending alarm signals to me she decided to call the newport police and ask if they had turned up any leads as yet the newspapers from earlier in the week were stacked on her desk she found a brief item on the obituary page detailing mrs shipleys background her community activities her membership in the dar her late husbands position as board chairman of a successful company it listed her survivors as three cousins residing in new york city washington dc and denver no one nearby watching out for her dr horgan thought as she put the paper down and turned to the mountain of work on her desk then a final thought teased her nurse markey she was the one who had found mrs shipleys body at latham manor there was something about that woman she didnt like a kind of sly knowitall quality maybe chief brower should talk to her again as part of his research for his lecture series earl bateman had begun to take rubbings from old tombstones he had made them the subject of one of his talks today minimal information is recorded on gravestones he would explain only birth and death dates really but in other centuries wonderful histories could be read from headstones some are poignant while some are rather remarkable as in the case of the sea captain buried with his five wives none of whom i might add lived more than seven years once married at that point he was usually rewarded by a ripple of laughter other markers he would explain are awesome in the majesty and history they convey he would then cite the chapel in westminster abbey where queen elizabeth i was entombed only a few feet from the cousin she had ordered beheaded mary queen of scots one interesting note he would add in ketchakan alaska in the nineteenth century tombstone cemetery the burial ground there reserved a special section for the soiled doves as they called the young women who resided in bordellos on this friday morning earl was preparing a synopsis of the lectures he proposed to deliver in the potential cable television series when he came to the subject of tombstone rubbings he was reminded that he had intended to look for other interesting ones then realizing it was a beautiful day perfect for such an activity he decided to visit the oldest sections of st marys and trinity cemeteries he was driving down the road that led to the cemeteries when he saw a black volvo station wagon come out through the open gates and turn the other way maggie holloway had the same make and color car he thought could she possibly have been here visiting nualas grave instead of going to the old section he drove to the left and circled up the hill pete brown a cemetery worker he had come to know from his various meanderings among the old tombstones was weeding a gravel path in the vicinity of nualas grave earl stopped the car and opened the window pretty quiet around here pete he offered it was an old joke they shared sure is professor i thought i saw mrs moores stepdaughters car was she visiting the grave he was sure that everyone knew the details of nualas death there werent that many murders in newport nice looking lady skinny dark hair young that would be maggie yep and she must know half of our guests pete said then laughed one of the fellows was saying that he saw her go from one plot to another and drop off flowers all the guys noticed her shes a doll now isnt that interesting earl thought take care pete he said then waved as he drove off slowly knowing that the allseeing eyes of pete brown were on him he continued on to the oldest section of trinity and began wandering among the seventeenthcentury headstones there letitia bainbridges studio apartment at latham manor was a large corner room with a magnificent ocean view proudly she pointed out the oversized dressing room and bath being a charter member here has its perks she said briskly i remember how greta and i decided to sign up right away at that presentation reception trudy nichols hemmed and hawed and then never forgave me for picking off this unit she ended up paying another hundred and fifty thousand for one of the largest apartments and the poor darling only lived two years the crenshaws have it now they were at our table the other night i remember them theyre very nice nichols maggie thought gertrude nichols hers was one of the graves that has the bell mrs bainbridge sighed its always hard when one of us goes but especially hard when its someone from our table and i just know that eleanor chandler will get gretas place when my daughter sarah took me to my family doctor yesterday she told me the word is out that eleanor is moving in here arent you feeling well maggie asked oh im fine but at my age anything can happen i told sarah that dr lane could check my blood pressure just fine but sarah wanted me to be seen by dr evans they sat down opposite each other on slipper chairs that were placed by the windows mrs bainbridge reached over and plucked a framed snapshot from among the many on a nearby table she showed it to maggie my crowd she said proudly three sons three daughters seventeen grandchildren four greatgrandchildren and three on the way she smiled with great satisfaction and the nice part is that so many of them are still in new england never a week goes by that somebody in the family isnt around maggie consciously stored that piece of information something to consider later she thought then she noticed a picture that had been taken in the grand salon here at latham manor mrs bainbridge was in the center of a group of eight she picked it up special occasion she asked my ninetieth birthday four years ago letitia bainbridge leaned forward and indicated the women at either end of the group thats constance rhinelander on the left she just died a couple of weeks ago and of course you knew greta shes on the right mrs shipley didnt have close family did she maggie asked no neither did constance but we were family for each other it was time to ask about the bells maggie decided she looked around for inspiration as to how to bring up the subject the room had obviously been furnished with mrs bainbridges personal belongings the ornately carved fourposter bed the antique english piecrust table the bombay chest the delicately toned persian carpet all spoke of generational history then she saw it a silver bell on the fireplace mantel she got up and crossed over to it oh isnt this lovely she picked it up letitia bainbridge smiled my mother used it to summon her maid mother was a late sleeper and hattie patiently sat in attendance outside the door each morning until the bell summoned her my granddaughters find that a hoot as they put it but the bell gives me many warm memories a lot of us old girls grew up in that milieu it was the opening maggie wanted she sat down again and reached into her purse mrs bainbridge i found this bell on nualas grave i was curious as to who left it there is there a custom here of putting a bell on the grave of a friend letitia bainbridge looked astonished i never heard of such a thing you mean someone deliberately left that object there apparently yes but how bizarre she turned away with a sinking heart maggie realized that for some reason the bell had upset mrs bainbridge she decided not to say anything about the fact that she had found bells on other graves as well clearly this did not represent a tribute that old friends gave to each other she dropped the bell back in her shoulder bag ill bet i know what happened she improvised there was a little girl in the cemetery the other day she came over to talk to me while i arranged flowers around nualas headstone it was after she left that i found the bell happily letitia bainbridge reached the conclusion maggie wanted oh i think that must be it she said i mean surely no adult would think of leaving a bell on a grave then she frowned what is it im trying to remember oh dear something just came into my mind and now its gone thats old age i guess there was a knock at the door and mrs bainbridge commented that will be the lunch tray she raised her voice come in please it was angela the young maid whom maggie had met on her earlier visits she greeted her then got up i really must run along maggie said mrs bainbridge rose im so glad you stopped in maggie will i see you tomorrow maggie knew what she meant yes of course ill be at the funeral parlor and at mrs shipleys requiem when she went downstairs she was glad to see that the foyer was empty everyone must be in the dining room she thought as she opened the front door she reached in her pocketbook for her car keys and inadvertently hit the bell a muffled ringing sound made her grab the clapper to silence it ask not for whom the bell tolls maggie thought as she walked down the steps of latham manor dr lane neil stephens and his father concluded their tour of latham manor at the entrance to the dining room neil took in the hum of conversation the animated faces of the welldressed seniors the overall ambiance of the beautiful room whitegloved waiters were serving and the aroma of freshly baked bread was enticing lane picked up a menu and handed it to neil today the main course is a choice of dover sole with white asparagus or chicken salad he explained the dessert choices are frozen yogurt or sorbet with homebaked cookies he smiled i might add that this is a typical menu our chef is not only cordon bleu but also a dietary specialist very impressive neil said nodding appreciatively neil we tee up in thirty minutes robert stephens reminded his son dont you think youve seen enough more important dr lane said gently do you feel that you might recommend the available suite to your clients without meaning to pressure them i can tell you that it wont last long couples especially are attracted to the large units im going to speak to my clients on monday when i get back to new york neil said the place is most impressive ill certainly send them the prospectus and recommend that they come up and look over everything for themselves wonderful dr lane said heartily as robert stephens pointedly held up his watch turned and began to walk down the corridor to the front door neil and dr lane followed we like having couples here dr lane continued many of the guests are widows but that doesnt mean they dont enjoy having men around in fact weve had several romances develop between single guests robert stephens slowed and fell into step with them if you dont settle down soon neil maybe you should put in your application this place may be your best chance neil grinned just dont ever let my father move in he told the doctor dont worry about me this place is too rich for my blood robert stephens declared but that reminds me doctor do you remember receiving an application from a mrs cora gebhart dr lane frowned that name is familiar oh yes shes in what we call the pending file she visited here about a year ago filled out an application but did not want it activated its our practice to phone someone like that once or twice a year to see whether theyre nearer to a decision the last time i spoke to mrs gebhart i had the impression that she was seriously considering joining us she was the elder stephens said shortly all right neil lets be on our way neil tried calling maggie once more from the car phone but he still got no answer even though it was a beautiful day and he played excellent golf neil found the afternoon unconscionably long he could not shake the ominous feeling that something was wrong on her way home maggie decided to pick up groceries she drove to a small market she had noticed near the wharf there she gathered the makings of green salad and pasta pomodoro ive had my fill of scrambled eggs and chicken soup she thought then she saw a sign for freshly prepared new england clam chowder the clerk was a weatheredfaced man in his sixties new here he asked affably when she gave him her order maggie smiled how can you tell easy when the missus makes her clam chowder everyone buys at least a quart in that case youd better give me a second pint got a head on your shoulders i like that in young people he said as she drove away maggie smiled to herself and another reason for keeping the house in newport she thought was that with so many senior citizens around she would be considered a youngster for quite a while to come and besides i cant just sort out nualas things take the best offer for the house and walk away she told herself even if nuala was killed by a stranger there are too many unanswered questions the bells for instance who would put them on those graves maybe one of the oldguard friends does it on her own and never dreamt anyone would notice them she acknowledged for all i know she thought there may be bells on half the graves in newport on the other hand one of them is missing did whoever it was change his or her mind about leaving it pulling into the driveway at nualas house she carried the groceries around to the kitchen door and let herself in dropping the packages on the table she turned and quickly locked the door thats something else she thought i meant to call in a locksmith liam would ask about that tonight he had been so concerned about earl showing up unexpectedly one of nualas favorite expressions ran through maggies head as she searched for a phone book better late than never maggie remembered how nuala had said it one sunday morning when she came running out to the car where maggie and her father were already waiting maggie hated to think about her fathers response so typical of him and better still never late particularly when the rest of the congregation manages to show up on time she found the phone book in a deep kitchen drawer and smiled at the sight of the clutter beneath it xeroxed recipes halfburned candles rusty scissors paper clips small change id hate to try to find anything in this house maggie thought theres such a jumble then she felt her throat close whoeverransacked this house was looking for something and chances are hedidnt find it an interior voice whispered to her after she left a message on the machine of the first locksmith she called she finished putting away the groceries and fixed herself a cup of the clam chowder which at first taste made her glad she had bought more than shed intended then she went up to the studio restlessly her fingers reached into the pot of wet clay she wanted to go back to the bust she had started of nuala but knew she could not it was greta shipley whose face demanded to be capturednot really so much the face as the eyes knowing candid and watchful she was glad she had brought several armatures with her maggie stayed at the worktable for an hour until the clay had taken on an approach to the likeness of the woman she had known so briefly finally the surging disquietude had passed and she could wash her hands and start the job she knew she would find hardest the task of sorting out nualas paintings she had to decide which to keep and which to offer to a dealer knowing that a majority of them probably would end up in a scrap heap cut out from their framesframes some people would value more than the art they had once enhanced at three oclock she started going through the works that had not yet been framed in the storage closet off the studio she found dozens of nualas sketches watercolors and oils a dizzying array that maggie soon realized she could not hope to analyze without professional assistance the sketches for the most part were only fair and only a few of the oils were interestingbut some of the watercolors were extraordinary like nuala she thought they were warm and joyous and filled with unexpected depths she especially loved a winter scene in which a tree its branches laden and bent with snow was sheltering an incongruous ring of flowering plants including snapdragons and roses violets and lilies orchids and chrysanthemums maggie became so engrossed in the task that it was after fivethirty when she hurried downstairs just in time to catch the phone that she thought she heard ringing it was liam hey this is my third attempt to get you i was afraid i was being stood up he said relief in his voice do you realize that my only other offer tonight was my cousin earl maggie laughed im sorry i didnt hear the phone i was in the studio i guess nuala didnt believe in extension telephones ill buy you one for christmas pick you up in about an hour fine that should give me just enough time for a soak in the tub maggie thought as she hung up it was obvious the evening air was turning cool the house felt drafty and in an odd and uncomfortable way it seemed to her she could still feel the chill of the damp earth she had touched at the graves when the water was rushing into the tub she thought she heard the phone again and quickly turned off the taps no sound of ringing came from nualas room however either i didnt hear anything or i missed another call she decided feeling relaxed after her bath she dressed carefully in the new white evening sweater and calflength black skirt she had purchased earlier in the week then decided that a little care with her makeup was in order its fun to dress up for liam she thought he makes me feel good about myself at quarter of seven she was waiting in the living room when the bell rang liam stood on the doorstep a dozen longstemmed red roses in one hand a folded sheet of paper in the other the warmth in his eyes and the light kiss that for a moment lingered on her lips gave maggie a sudden lift of the heart you look spectacular he told her ill have to change the plans for the evening obviously mcdonalds wont do maggie laughed oh dear and i was so looking forward to a big mac she quickly read the note he had brought in where was this she asked on your front door madame oh of course i came in through the kitchen earlier she refolded the piece of paper so neil is in portsmouth she thought and wants to get together isnt that nice she hated to admit to herself how disappointed she had been when he hadnt called last week before she left and then she reminded herself of how she had chalked it up as another indication of his indifference toward her anything important liam asked casually no a friend whos up for the weekend wants me to call maybe ill give him a ring tomorrow and maybe i wont she thought i wonder how he found me she went back upstairs for her handbag and as she picked it up she felt the extra weight of the bell should she show it to liam she wondered no not tonight she decided i dont want to talk about death and graves not now she took the bell out of her purse even though it had been there for hours it still felt cold and clammy to her touch causing her to shiver i dont want this to be the first thing i see when i get in later she thought as she opened the closet door and put it on the shelf pushing it back until it was completely out of sight liam had made a reservation in the commodores room of the black pearl a toney restaurant with a sweeping view of narragansett bay my condo isnt far from here he explained but i miss the big house i was raised in one of these days im going to bite the bullet and buy one of the old places and renovate it his voice became serious by then ill have settled down and with any luck will have a beautiful wife whos an awardwinning photographer stop it liam maggie protested as nuala would have said you sound half daft but im not he said quietly maggie please start looking at me with different eyes wont you ever since last week you havent been out of my mind for a minute all ive been able to think about is that if you had walked in on whatever hophead attacked nuala the same thing could have happened to you im a big strong guy and i want to take care of you i know that such sentiments are out of fashion but i cant help it its who i am and its how i feel he paused and now thats entirely enough of that is the wine okay maggie stared at him and smiled glad that he had not asked for a further response from her its fine but liam i have to ask you something do you really think a stranger on drugs attacked nuala liam appeared astonished at her question if not who else he asked but whoever did it must have seen that guests were expected and yet still took time to ransack the house maggie whoever did it was probably desperate to get a fix and searched the place for money or jewelry the newspaper account said nualas wedding ring was taken off her finger so robbery must have been the motive yes the ring was taken maggie acknowledged i happen to know she had very little jewelry liam said she wouldnt let uncle tim give her an engagement ring she said that two of them in one lifetime was enough and besides both of them had been stolen when she lived in new york i remember her telling my mother after that happened that she never wanted to own anything except costume jewelry you know more than i do maggie said so except for whatever cash was around her killer didnt get much did he at least that gives me some satisfaction liam said his voice grim he smiled breaking the dark mood that had settled over them now tell me about your week i hope newport is beginning to get under your skin or better yet let me continue to give you my life history he told her how as a child he had counted the weeks in boarding school until it was time to go to newport for the summer about his decision to become a stockbroker like his father about leaving his position at randolph and marshall and starting his own investment firm its pretty flattering that some giltedged clients elected to come with me he said its always scary to go out on your own but their vote of trust led me to believe id made the right decision and i had by the time the crème brulée had arrived maggie was fully relaxed ive learned more about you tonight than i knew from a dozen other dinners she told him maybe im a little different on my home territory he said and maybe i just want you to see what a terrific guy i am he raised an eyebrow im also trying to let you know what a substantial guy i am just so you know in these parts im considered quite a catch stop that kind of talk right now maggie said trying to sound firm but unable to suppress a slight smile okay your turn now tell me about your week maggie was reluctant to really go into things she did not want to destroy the almost festive mood of the evening it was impossible to talk about the week and not to speak of greta shipley but she put the emphasis on how much she had enjoyed her in the time she had spent with her and then she told him about her blossoming friendship with letitia bainbridge i knew mrs shipley and she was a very special lady liam said and as for mrs bainbridge well shes great he enthused a real legend around here has she filled you in on all the goingson in newport s heyday a little get her going sometime on her mothers stories about mamie fish she really knew how to shake up the old crew theres a great story about a dinner party she threw when one of her guests asked to bring prince del drago from corsica with him of course mamie was delighted to give permission so you can imagine her horror when the prince turned out to be a monkey in full evening dress they laughed together mrs bainbridge is probably one of the very few left whose parents took part in the famous s parties liam said whats nice is that mrs bainbridge has so many protective family members nearby maggie said just yesterday after she heard that mrs shipley died her daughter came over to take her to the doctor for a checkup because she knew shed be upset that daughter would be sarah liam said then he smiled did mrs bainbridge happen to tell you about the stunt my idiot cousin earl pulled that sent sarah into orbit no its priceless earl lectures about funeral customs youve heard that havent you i swear the guy is batty when everybody else is off playing golf or sailing his idea of a good time is to spend hours in cemeteries taking tombstone rubbings in cemeteries maggie exclaimed yes but thats only a small part of it what im getting to is the time he lectured on funeral practices to a group at latham manor of all places mrs bainbridge wasnt feeling well but sarah had been visiting her and attended the lecture earl included in his little talk the story about the victorian bell ringers it seems that wealthy victorians were so afraid of being buried alive that they had a hole built into the top of their caskets for an air vent reaching up to the surface of the ground a string was tied to the finger of the presumed deceased run through the air vent and attached to a bell on top of the grave then someone was paid to keep watch for a week in case the person in the casket did in fact regain consciousness and try ringing the bell dear god maggie gasped no but heres the best part now the part about earl believe it or not he has a sort of museum up here near the funeral home thats filled with all kinds of funeral symbols and paraphernalia and he got the brainstorm to have a dozen replicas of a victorian cemetery bell cast to use to illustrate the lecture without telling them what they were the jerk passed them out to twelve of these ladies all in their sixties and seventies and eighties and tied the string attached to them onto their ring fingers then he told them to hold the bell in their other hand wiggle their fingers and pretend they were in a casket and trying to communicate with the grave watcher how appalling maggie said one of the old girls actually fainted mrs bainbridges daughter collected earls bells and was so irate she practically threw him and his bells off the premises liam paused then in a more somber voice added the worrisome part is that i think earl relishes telling that story himself neil had tried to phone maggie several times first from the locker room of the club and again as soon as he got home either shes been out all day or shes in and out or shes not answering the phone he thought but even if she was in and out she surely would have seen his note neil accompanied his parents to a neighbors home for cocktails where he tried maggie again at seven he then elected to take his own car to dinner so that if he did reach her later it might be possible to stop by her house for a drink there were six people at the table in the dinner party at canfield house but even though the lobster newburg was superb and his dinner companion vicky the daughter of his parents friends was a very attractive banking executive from boston neil was wildly restless knowing it would be rude to skip the afterdinner drink in the bar he agonized through the chitchat and when everyone finally stood up to go at tenthirty neil managed to refuse gracefully vickys invitation to join her and her friends for tennis on sunday morning finally with a sigh of relief he was in his own car he checked the time it was quarter of eleven if maggie was home and had gone to bed early he didnt want to disturb her he justified his decision to drive by her house by telling himself that he simply wanted to see if her car was in the driveway just to be sure she was still in newport his initial excitement at seeing that her car was indeed there was tempered when he realized that another car was parked in front of her place a jaguar with massachusetts plates neil drove by at a snails pace and was rewarded by seeing the front door open he caught a glimpse of a tall man standing next to maggie then feeling like a voyeur he accelerated and turned the corner at ocean drive heading back to portsmouth his stomach churning with regret and jealousy saturday october th the requiem for greta shipley at trinity church was wellattended as she sat and listened to the familiar prayers maggie realized that all the people who had been invited to nualas dinner party were in attendance dr lane and his wife odile sat with a number of the guests from the residence including everyone who had been at mrs shipleys table on wednesday evening with the exception of mrs bainbridge malcolm norton and his wife janice were there he had a hangdog look maggie thought when he passed her on the way in he stopped to say he had been trying to reach her and would like to meet with her after the funeral earl bateman had come over to speak to her before the service began after all this when you think about newport im very much afraid that your memories of the place will be of funerals and cemeteries he said his eyes owlish behind lightly tinted roundframe sunglasses he hadnt waited for an answer but had walked past her to take an empty place in the first pew liam arrived halfway through the service and sat down next to her sorry he murmured in her ear damn alarm didnt go off he took her hand but after an instant she withdrew it she knew that she was the object of many sidelong glances and did not want to have rumors swirling about her and liam but she admitted to herself her sense of isolation was relieved when his firm shoulder brushed against hers when she had filed past the casket at the funeral home maggie had studied for an instant the tranquil lovely face of the woman she had known so briefly yet liked so much the thought had crossed her mind that greta shipley and nuala and all their other good friends were probably having a joyous reunion that thought had brought with it the nagging question of the victorian bells when she passed the three people who had been introduced as mrs shipleys cousins their faces were fixed in appropriately serious expressions but she detected there none of the honest raw pain that she saw in the eyes and countenances of mrs shipleys close friends from latham manor ive got to find out when and how each of those women whosegraves i visited died and how many of them had close relatives maggie thought information that she had recognized as pertinent during her visit to mrs bainbridge for the next two hours she felt as if she were operating on some kind of remote controlobserving recording but not feeling i am a camera was her own reaction to herself as liam at her side she walked away from greta shipleys grave after the interment she felt a hand on her arm a handsome woman with silver hair and remarkably straight carriage stopped her ms holloway she said im sarah bainbridge cushing i want to thank you for visiting mother yesterday she so appreciated it sarah this was the daughter who had tangled with earl about his lecture on victorian bells maggie reflected she wanted to have a chance to talk privately to her in the next breath sarah cushing provided the opportunity i dont know how long youre staying in newport but tomorrow morning im taking mother out for brunch and id be delighted if you could join us maggie agreed readily youre staying at nualas house arent you ill pick you up at eleven oclock if thats all right with a nod sarah cushing turned and dropped back to rejoin the group she had been with lets have a quiet lunch liam suggested im sure youre not up to any more postfuneral gettogethers no im not but i really do want to get back to the house i simply have to go through nualas clothes and sort them out dinner tonight then maggie shook her head thanks but im going to stay at the sortandpack job till i drop well i have to see you before i go back to boston tomorrow night liam protested maggie knew he wasnt going to allow her to say no okay call me she said well figure something out he left her at her car she was turning the key in the ignition when a rap at the window startled her it was malcolm norton we need to talk he said urgently maggie decided to bite the bullet and not waste his time or hers mr norton if its about buying nualas house i can only tell you this i have absolutely no plans of selling it at this time and im afraid that absolutely unsolicited i have already received a substantially higher offer than yours murmuring im sorry she slid the selector into drive she found it almost painful to see the horrified shock in the mans expression neil stephens and his father teed up at seven oclock and were back in the clubhouse by noon this time neil heard the phone being picked up after the second ring when he recognized maggies voice he let out a sigh of relief sounding disjointed even to himself he told her how he had phoned her after she left on friday how he had gone to jimmy neary to try to get nualas name so he could contact her here how he had learned of nualas death and was so terribly sorry maggie i have to see you today he finished he sensed her hesitation then listened as she told him she had to stay in and finish clearing out her stepmothers personal effects no matter how busy you are you still have to eat dinner he pleaded maggie if you wont let me take you out im going to arrive on your doorstep with mealsonwheels then he thought about the man with the jaguar unless somebody else is already doing that he added at her response a smile broke out on his face seven oclock terrific i found a great place for lobster i gather you reached this maggie of yours robert stephens said dryly when neil joined him at the door of the clubhouse yes i did were going out to dinner tonight well then well be happy for you to bring her along with us you know were having your mothers birthday dinner at the club tonight her birthday isnt until tomorrow neil protested thanks for telling me youre the one who asked that we have the celebration this evening you said you wanted to get started home by midafternoon tomorrow neil stood with his hand to his mouth as though in deep thought then he silently shook his head robert stephens smiled a lot of people consider your mother and me good company you are good company neil protested feebly im sure maggie will enjoy being with you of course she will now lets get home another client of mine laura arlington is coming over at two i want you to go over whats left of her stock portfolio and see if you can recommend any way to upgrade her income thanks to that sleazy broker shes really in bad shape i dont want to risk telling maggie over the phone about the change in plans neil thought shed probably bow out ill show up at her doorstep and plead my case two hours later neil sat with mrs arlington in his fathers office she is in bad shape he thought she had once owned bluechip stocks that paid good dividends but had sold them all to buy into another of those crazy venture offerings ten days ago mrs arlington had been persuaded to buy one hundred thousand shares of some piece of trash at five dollars a share the next morning the stock went to five and a quarter but by that afternoon it had begun to plunge now it was valued below a dollar so five hundred thousand dollars in stock is reduced to about eighty thousand assuming theres even a buyer neil thought glancing with pity across the desk at the ashenfaced woman whose entwined hands and slumping shoulders betrayed her agitation shes only mothers age he thought sixtysix yet right now she looks twenty years older its pretty awful isnt it mrs arlington asked im afraid so neil said you see that was the money i was going to use when one of the larger apartments in latham manor became available but ive always felt guilty about the idea of using so much money selfishly i have three children and when douglas hansen was so persuasive and mrs downing told me how much money she had made in less than a week with his help i thought well if i double that money ill have an inheritance for the children as well as being able to live in latham manor she tried to blink back tears then not only did i lose my money last week but the very next day i got a call that one of the big apartments was available the one that nuala moore had been scheduled to take nuala moore neil said quickly yes the woman who was murdered last week mrs arlington held a handkerchief to the tears that she could no longer hold back now i dont have the apartment and the children not only dont get an inheritance but one of them may be stuck with having to take me in she shook her head ive known this for over a week but seeing the confirmation of the stock purchase in writing this morning just about did me in she dabbed at her eyes oh well laura arlington stood up and attempted a smile youre just as nice a young man as your father keeps telling all of us you are so you think i should just leave whats left of my portfolio alone absolutely neil said im sorry this happened mrs arlington well think of all the people in this world who dont have half a million dollars to piss away as my grandson would put it her eyes widened i cannot believe i said that forgive me then a hint of a smile appeared on her lips but you know something i feel a lot better for saying it your mother and father wanted me to stop in and visit but i think id better run along do thank them for me please when she left neil went back to the house his parents were in the sunroom wheres laura his mother asked anxiously i knew she wouldnt want to visit now robert stephens commented everything that has changed for her is just beginning to sink in shes a classy lady neil said heatedly id like to strangle that jerk douglas hansen but i swear that first thing monday morning im going to dig up every last little bit of dirt i can get to pin on him and if theres any way i can file a complaint with the sec trust me ill do it good robert stephens said enthusiastically you sound more and more like your father every day dolores stephens said dryly later as neil watched the rest of the yankeesred sox game he found himself annoyed by the feeling that he had missed something in laura arlingtons portfolio there was something wrong there other than a misguided investment but what he wondered detective jim haggerty had known and liked greta shipley nearly all his life from the time he was a little boy delivering newspapers to her door he could never remember a single time when she hadnt been gracious and friendly to him she also paid promptly and tipped generously when he collected on saturday mornings she wasnt like some of the tightwads in the other swanky houses he thought who ran up bills then paid for six weeks of papers and added on a tencent tip he particularly remembered one snowy day when mrs shipley had insisted he come in and get warm and had dried his gloves and knit cap on the radiator while he drank the cocoa she made for him earlier that morning when he had attended the service at trinity church he was sure that many in the congregation shared the thought that he couldnt get out of his mind greta shipleys death had been hastened by the shocking murder of her close friend nuala moore if someone has a heart attack when a crime is taking place the perpetrator can sometimes be tried for murder haggerty thoughtbut how about when a friend dies in her sleep a few days later at the service for mrs shipley he was surprised to see nuala moores stepdaughter maggie holloway sitting with liam payne liam always had an eye for pretty women haggerty mused and lord knows enough of them had had an eye for him over the years he was one of newport s most eligible bachelors he had also spotted earl bateman in church now there is a guy who may be educated enough to be a professor but who still isnt playing with a full deck of cards haggerty had thought that museum of his is like something out of the addams family it gave haggerty the shivers earl should have stayed in the family business he thought every shirt on his back had been paid for by someones next of kin haggerty had slipped away before the recessional but not before he deduced that maggie holloway must have gotten very close to mrs shipley to have taken the time to come to her funeral service the thought occurred to him that maybe if she had visited mrs shipley at latham manor she might have learned something from her that could be helpful in understanding why nuala moore had canceled the sale of her house to malcolm norton norton was the guy jim haggerty believed knew something he wasnt telling and it was that thinking that brought him unannounced to garrison avenue at three oclock that afternoon when the bell rang maggie was in nualas bedroom where she was separating carefully folded clothing into piles good usable clothing for goodwill older wellworn outfits for the ragbag fairly expensive dressy outfits for the hospital thrift shop she was keeping for herself the blue outfit nuala had worn that night at the four seasons as well as one of her painting smocks memory lane she thought in the crammed closets she had come across several cardigans and tweed jacketstim moores clothing she was sure sentimentally kept by nuala nuala and i were always on the same wavelength she mused thinking of the box in her walkin closet in the apartment it held the dress she had worn the night she met paul as well as one of his flight suits and their matching jogging outfits as she sorted maggies mind worked ceaselessly on an explanation for the presence of the bells at the graves it had to be earl who had placed them there she reasoned was it his idea of a sly joke on women from the residence because of the uproar that had followed his handing out the bells during his lecture at latham manor it was an explanation that made sense he probably knew all of these women after all most of the residents of latham manor were originally from newport or at least had spent the spring and summer months there maggie held up a robe decided it had seen its day and put it in the ragbag but nuala didnt live in latham she reminded herself did he put a bell on her grave as a tribute of friendship he seemed to have honestly liked her one of the graves did not have a bell though why she wondered i have the names of all those women maggie thought tomorrow im going to go back to the cemetery and copy the date they died from their tombstones there must have been an obituary in the newspaper for each of them i want to see what those say the sound of the doorbell was an unwelcome interruption who would just drop in she wondered as she headed downstairs then she found herself praying it was not another unexpected visit from earl bateman she didnt know if she could handle that this afternoon it took a moment to realize that the man at the door was one of the newport police officers who had responded originally to her call the night of nualas murder he introduced himself as detective jim haggerty once inside the house he settled in the club chair with the air of a man who had nothing to do except exchange pleasantries for the day maggie sat facing him balanced on the edge of the couch if he had any appreciation of body language he would see that she hoped to keep this interview as brief as possible he began by answering a question she had not asked im afraid were still in the dark as far as having a real suspect in mind but this crime isnt going to go unpunished i can promise you that he said maggie waited haggerty tugged on his glasses till they rested on the end of his nose he crossed his legs and massaged his ankle old skiing injury he explained now it lets me know if the wind is shifting itll be raining by tomorrow night you didnt come to talk about the weather maggie thought ms holloway youve been here a little over a week and im glad most of our visitors dont experience the kind of shock that greeted you and then today i saw you in church at the funeral for mrs shipley i guess you got friendly with her since coming here yes i did actually it was a request nuala made in her will but it was something i did with pleasure wonderful woman mrs shipley knew her all my life a shame she didnt have a family she liked kids do you think she was happy at latham manor yes i do i had dinner there with her the night she died and she clearly enjoyed her friends did she tell you why her best friend your stepmother changed her mind at the last minute about moving there i dont think anyone knows that maggie said dr lane was confident that nuala would change it yet again and decide to take the apartment no one can be sure of her state of mind i guess i was hoping that mrs moore might have explained to mrs shipley her reason for canceling her reservation from what i understand mrs shipley was real pleased that her old friend was going to be under the same roof maggie thought of the caricature nuala had sketched on the poster showing nurse markey eavesdropping was that still in greta shipleys apartment she wondered i dont know if this had any bearing she said carefully but i believe that both nuala and mrs shipley were very careful of what they said when one of the nurses was around she had a way of barging in without notice haggerty stopped kneading his ankle which nurse he asked his tone a shade quicker nurse markey haggerty got up to go any decisions made about the house ms holloway well of course the will still has to be probated but im absolutely not putting it on the market at this time in fact i may very well never put it up for sale newport is lovely and it would make a nice retreat from manhattan does malcolm norton know that as of this morning he does in fact i told him not only do i not want to sell but i have received a substantially better offer for the property haggertys eyebrows raised now this is a lovely old house so i hope you understand im not being denigrating when i say that this place must have buried treasure hidden in it i hope you find it if theres anything to be found here i intend to unearth it maggie said im not going to have any peace until someone pays for what happened to a woman i loved very much as haggerty got up to go maggie impulsively asked do you know if its possible to look up some information at the newspaper office this afternoon or is it closed on saturday i think youll have to wait till monday i happen to know that because we always have visitors wanting to look through the old society pages they get a kick out of reading about the fancy parties maggie smiled without comment as haggerty drove away he made a mental note to chat with the clerk in the newspaper office on monday and find out exactly what information ms holloway was searching for in their morgue maggie went back up to nualas room she was determined to get through the contents of the closets and dressers before she quit today this is the room i should use for sorting she thought as she dragged cartons full of things into the small third bedroom nuala had always enjoyed having things scattered around that reminded her of special moments as maggie discarded seashells from the dresser tops stuffed animals from the window seat a stack of restaurant menus from the nightstand and inexpensive souvenirs from everywhere the inherent beauty of the rock maple furniture became apparent id move the bed to that wall its a better place for it she decided and get rid of that old chaise and id keep all of nualas paintings that she had framed and hung theyre the part of her that ill never lose or give up at six oclock she was going through the final item of clothing in the larger closet a pale gold raincoat that had fallen to the floor she remembered that when she had rehung nualas blue cocktail suit the other day the raincoat had been hanging precariously behind it as with the other garments she ran her hand into the pockets to be sure nothing was in them the leftside pocket of the raincoat was empty but when her fingertips explored the right pocket they touched grit maggie closed her fingers over the substance and removed her hand long shadows filled the room as she walked over to the dresser and turned on the light a wad of dry dirt crumbled beneath her fingers surely nuala didnt put dirt in her pocket maggie thought surely she didnt garden in this coat its practically new as a matter of fact maggie told herself i think they had this same coat in the boutique where i shopped the other day uncertainly she laid the coat across the bed instinct made her decide that she wouldnt brush the rest of the dirt from the pocket now there was just one task left before this room would be cleared out completely the shoes and boots and slippers that covered the floor of the larger closet had to be sorted through and categorized most would no doubt be discarded but some might be worth giving to goodwill no more for tonight though she decided thats tomorrows job it was time for the hot soak she had come to look forward to at this time of the day and then she would get dressed for her dinner with neil something she hadnt thought about much during the day but which she now realized she was looking forward to janice and malcolm norton had driven together to the funeral service and interment of greta shipley both of them had known shipley all their lives although they had never been more than acquaintances when janice had looked around the congregation during the eulogy she was made freshly and bitterly aware of the financial gap that existed between her and so many of the people there she saw regina carrs mother off to one side regina was now regina carr wayne she had been janices roommate at dana hall and they both had gone to vassar now wes wayne was the chief stockholder and ceo of cratus pharmaceuticals and you could be sure that regina was not an accountant in an oldfolks home arlene randel greenes mother was weeping softly arlene was another dana hall girl from newport bob greene an unknown screenwriter when arlene married him was now a powerful hollywood producer she was probably off on a cruise somewhere at this very moment janice thought a frown of envy creasing her face and there were others mothers of her friends and acquaintances they had all come to say goodbye to their dear friend greta shipley later as janice accompanied them as they walked from the grave site she listened with sour envy as they outdid each other chronicling the busy social lives of the girls and their grandchildren she felt an emotion somewhat akin to loathing as she watched malcolm rush ahead to catch up with maggie holloway my handsome husband she thought bitterly if only i hadnt wasted all that time trying to turn him into something he never could be and he had seemed to have it all the good looks the impeccable background the excellent schoolsroxbury latin williams columbia laweven a membership in mensa where a genius iq was the admittance requirement but in the end none of it had mattered for all his credentials malcolm norton was a loser then to top it all she thought he was planning to leave me for another woman and he had no intention of sharing with me any of the killing he expected to make off the sale of that house her angry ruminations were interrupted when she realized that regina s mother was talking about nuala moores death newport isnt what it used to be she said and to think the house was ransacked i wonder what whoever it was could have been looking for arlene greenes mother said i hear that nuala moore changed her will the day before she died maybe someone who was being cut out of the old will was searching for the new one janice nortons hand flew to her mouth to stifle a gasp had someone suspected nuala might be planning to write a new will then killed her to prevent it if nuala had died before she actually wrote the new will the sale of her house to malcolm would have been completed she thought there was a signed agreement in place and malcolm as executor of her estate would have managed to complete the purchase besides janice reasoned no one who didnt know about the impending change in the wetlands act would have been interested in the property was malcolm desperate enough to kill nuala just to get his hands on that house she asked herself wondering suddenly if her husband had still more secrets he was trying to keep from her at the end of the walkway goodbyes were exchanged and people scattered ahead of her janice saw malcolm walking slowly to their car as she neared him she saw the anguish on his face and knew maggie holloway must have told him she would not sell him the house they did not speak as they got in the car malcolm stared ahead for a few moments then he turned toward her ill pay off the mortgage on our house he said quietly his voice a monotone holloway wont sell now and she says she has a substantially higher offer anyway which means if she does change her mind it wont do me any good us any good janice corrected automatically then bit her lip she did not want to antagonize him not now if he ever found out that she had had a hand in the counteroffer that was made on nualas house he might well be angry enough to kill her she thought with rising uneasiness her nephew doug had made the offer of course but if malcolm found that out he would surely know that she had put him up to it had maggie holloway told him anything that might implicate her she wondered as though reading her mind her husband turned toward her surely you havent talked to anyone have you janice he asked quietly a bit of a headache he had said when they reached home his tone remote but cordial then he had gone upstairs to his room it had been years since they had shared a bedroom he did not come downstairs again until nearly seven oclock janice had been watching the evening news and looked up as he stopped at the door of the family room im going out he said good night janice she stared unseeingly at the television screen listening carefully for the sound of the front door closing behind him hes up to something she thought but what is it she allowed him plenty of time to leave then turned off the tv and collected her purse and car keys she had told malcolm earlier that she was going out to dinner they had grown so distant of late that he didnt ask her whom she was meeting any more than she bothered to inquire about his plans not that she would have told him if he had asked janice thought grimly as she headed for providence there at a small outoftheway restaurant her nephew would be waiting and there over steaks and scotch he would pass her an envelope containing cash her share for supplying him with a detailed account of cora gebharts financial situation as doug had happily told her this one was a real bonanza aunt janice keep em coming as maggie was dressing for her date with neil stephens she realized there was a strongerthanusual hint of dampness in the seascented breeze that came in through the bedroom window ringlets and waves she thought with resignation she would just fluff her hair with her fingers after she had brushed it she decided on a night like this it was inevitable that the natural curl would assert itself she thought about neil as she continued getting ready over these past months she had found herself more and more looking forward to his calls and too disappointed when they didnt come but it was very obvious that to neil she was an occasional date and nothing more hed certainly made that clear even so she really had expected him to call before she left for newport and now she was determined to place no special significance on this evening she knew that grown childrenand especially single menwhen visiting their parents frequently looked for excuses to get away and then there was liam maggie thought briefly she didnt quite know what to make of his sudden show of interest oh well she shrugged all tarted up she thought wryly after she applied eye shadow and mascara and blush then carefully made up her lips in a soft coral shade looking through the outfits she had to choose from she picked the one she had intended to wear to nualas dinner party a vivid blue silk print blouse and matching long skirt a narrow gold chain and earrings were her only jewelry except for the ovalshaped sapphire ring that had belonged to her mother when she passed nualas bedroom on the way downstairs maggie entered for a moment and turned on the lamp on the nightstand as she looked around she decided definitely to make this her room she would move into it tomorrow after she returned from the brunch with mrs bainbridge and her daughter i can shove the furniture around by myself she decided and the only things i havent cleaned out are the shoes and whatever is on the closet floor and it wont take long to finish with that walking through the living room she noticed that the roses liam had brought needed a change of water she refilled the vase at the kitchen sink reached into the clutter drawer for scissors cut the stems and rearranged the roses before taking them back to the living room then she walked around the room fussing with little things like straightening the ottoman in front of the club chair removing some of the profusion of small framed pictures on the mantel and tabletops leaving only a few of the most flattering ones of nuala and her husband plumping the pillows on the couch in a few minutes the room took on a more tranquil less busy feeling maggie studied the space and mentally rearranged the furniture knowing that the love seat behind which nualas body had been hunched would have to go the very sight of it haunted her im nesting she told herself more than ive ever done anyplace since that silly little apartment paul and i had in texas she was at once surprised and pleased with herself the front doorbell rang at ten of seven neil was early realizing how ambivalent she felt about the evening ahead of her she waited a long minute before answering the ring when she opened the door she was careful to keep her voice and smile friendly but impersonal neil how nice to see you neil did not answer but stood looking down at her studying her face unsmiling his eyes troubled maggie opened the door wider as my father used to ask cat got your tongue come in for heavens sake he stepped inside and waited as she closed the door then he followed her into the living room you look lovely maggie he said finally as they stood facing each other she raised her eyebrows surprised no of course not but i was sick when i heard what happened to your stepmother i know how much you were looking forward to being with her yes i was maggie agreed now where are we going for dinner fumbling with his words he asked if shed mind having dinner with his parents to celebrate his mothers birthday why dont we just try doing this some other time maggie asked curtly im sure your folks dont need a perfect stranger horning in on a family party theyre looking forward to meeting you maggie dont back out neil pleaded theyll know its because of them that you didnt come maggie sighed i guess i have to eat she let neil do the talking as they drove to the restaurant answering his questions as directly and succinctly as possible she noted with some amusement however that he was being especially attentive and charming and it took all of her determination to maintain her aloofness she had intended to continue treating neil with distinct reserve throughout the evening but the warmth of his parents greeting and their obviously sincere distress over what had happened to nuala made it impossible not to loosen up my dear you didnt know a soul up here dolores stephens said how awful for you to go through all that alone actually i do know one person fairly wellthe man who took me to the party at the four seasons where i met nuala again maggie looked over at neil maybe you know him neil liam payne hes in the investment business too he has his own firm in boston but comes to new york regularly liam payne neil said thoughtfully yes i do know him slightly hes a good investment guy too good for his former bosses at randolph and marshall if i remember correctly he took some of their best clients with him when he went out on his own maggie could not resist a feeling of satisfaction at seeing the frown on neils face let him wonder if liam is important to me she thought hes already made it plain how unimportant i am to him nevertheless over a relaxing meal that included lobster and chardonnay she found herself thoroughly enjoying neils parents and was flattered to learn that dolores stephens was familiar with her fashion photography when i read the newspaper about your stepmothers death mrs stephens said and then when neil spoke about maggie i didnt connect you with your work then this afternoon when i was reading vogue i saw your name under the armani spread a thousand years agobefore i was marriedi worked in a small advertising agency and we had the givenchy account that was before givenchy became famous i used to have to go to all the shoots then you know all about maggie began and soon found herself telling war stories about temperamental designers and difficult models ending with the last job that she had done before coming to newport they agreed there was nothing worse for a photographer than a nervous and indecisive art director as she opened up more maggie found herself telling them about her inclination to keep the house its too soon to be sure so the best thing is to do nothing for a while i guess but in a way living in the house this week makes me understand why nuala was so reluctant to give it up at neils inquiry she told them about nuala canceling her reservation at latham manor it was even for the large unit she had particularly wanted she explained and i understand that they go quickly neil and i were over there today robert stephens said hes scouting it for one of his clients it sounds to me as though the apartment your stepmother didnt take is the one thats being offered right now neil commented and its the same one that laura arlington wanted his father noted seems to me there is a real scramble for those places someone else wanted it maggie asked quickly did she change her mind no she got talked into investing the bulk of her money in a flybynight stock and unfortunately lost it all neil said the conversation drifted to many other subjects with neils mother gradually drawing her out about her childhood while neil and his father got into a discussion about how neil might follow through in looking into the bad investment mrs arlington had made maggie found herself telling dolores stephens that her birth mother had died in an accident when she was an infant and how happy she had been the five years nuala and she had lived together finally realizing that tears were close she said no more nostalgia and no more wine im getting mushy when neil drove maggie home he walked her to the door and took the key from her hand ill only stay a minute he said opening the door i just want to see something which way is the kitchen back through the dining room bewildered maggie followed him he went immediately to the door and examined the lock from what i read the police think that the intruder either found this door unlocked or your stepmother opened it for someone she knew thats right i offer a third possibility that lock is so loose anyone could open it with a credit card he said and then proceeded to demonstrate the fact i have a call in to a locksmith maggie said i guess ill hear from him monday not good enough my dad is a wunderkind around the house and i grew up as his unwilling little helper i or maybe both of us will be back tomorrow to install a dead bolt and check all the windows no if youd like or is that okay maggie thought feeling a surge of irritation just this is the way it is im going out to brunch she told him brunch is usually over by two neil said lets figure on that time or if you want you can tell me where youll hide a key no ill be here neil picked up one of the kitchen chairs and wedged it under the doorknob at least this would make noise if anyone tried to get in he said then he looked around the room before turning to her maggie i dont want to alarm you but from everything ive heard the consensus of opinion is that whoever murdered your stepmother was looking for something and no one knows what it was or if he got it assuming it was a he maggie said but youre right thats exactly what the police think i dont like the idea of you being here alone he said as they walked to the front door im honestly not nervous neil ive been taking care of myself for a long time and if you were nervous youd never admit it to me right she looked up at him taking in his grave questioning face thats right she said simply he sighed as he turned and opened the door i enjoyed tonight very much maggie see you tomorrow later as maggie tossed about in bed she found she could take no satisfaction in having wounded neil and it was obvious she had tit for tat she tried to tell herself but knowing she had evened the score didnt make her feel any better game playing in relationships was not one of her favorite pastimes her last thoughts as she finally began to doze off were disjointed seemingly irrelevant emerging totally from her subconscions nuala had applied for an apartment at latham manor then died shortly after withdrawing the application the stephenses friend laura arlington had applied for the same apartment then lost all her money was that apartment jinxed and if so why sunday october th at his wifes urging dr william lane had begun the practice of joining the residents and their guests at latham manors sunday brunch as odile had pointed out the residence functioned as a kind of family and visitors invited to partake of the brunch were potential future residents who might thus come to view latham in a very favorable light i dont mean we have to spend hours there darling she fluttered but youre such a caring person and if people know that their mothers or aunts or whoever are in such good hands then when the time comes for them to make a change they might want to join us as well lane had thought a thousand times that if odile were not so emptyheaded he might suspect that she was being sarcastic but the truth was since they had started the formal sunday brunches which also had been her suggestion and then begun attending them the number of people filling out forms indicating possible future interest had increased sharply but when he and odile entered the grand salon that sunday morning dr lane was anything but pleased to see maggie holloway with mrs bainbridges daughter sarah cushing odile had spotted them as well maggie holloway does seem to make friends quickly she murmured to him together they made their way across the room pausing to chat with residents to greet familiar visitors and to be introduced to others maggie had not seen them approaching when they spoke to her she smiled apologetically you must think im like the manwho came to dinner she said mrs cushing asked me to join her and mrs bainbridge for brunch but mrs bainbridge was feeling a little tired this morning so she thought it best if we didnt go out you are always welcome dr lane said gallantly and then turned to sarah should i look in on your mother no sarah said decisively shell be along in a moment doctor is it true that eleanor chandler has decided to become a resident here as a matter of fact it is he said when she heard of mrs shipleys demise she phoned to request that apartment she wants her decorator to redo it so she probably wont actually move in for several months and i think thats better odile lane volunteered earnestly this way mrs shipleys friends will have a period of adjustment dont you think sarah cushing ignored the question the only reason i asked about mrs chandler is that i want to make it absolutely clear that she is not to be put at my mothers table she is an impossible woman i suggest you seat her with any hardofhearing guests you may have they mercifully would miss some of her overbearing opinions dr lane smiled nervously i will make a special note of the seating arrangements mrs cushing he said as a matter of fact an inquiry was made yesterday about the large twobedroom apartment on behalf of the van hillearys from connecticut the gentleman is going to recommend that they come to see it perhaps if it works out your mother would want to consider having them at the table the gentleman hes talking about neil maggie thought mrs cushing raised an eyebrow of course id want to meet them first but mother does enjoy having men around mother certainly does mrs bainbridge said dryly they all turned as she joined them sorry to be late maggie seems as though it takes longer and longer to do less and less these days do i understand that greta shipleys apartment is already sold yes it is dr lane said smoothly mrs shipleys relatives will be here this afternoon to remove her personal effects and arrange for her furniture to be shipped out now if youll excuse us odile and i should visit with some of the other guests when they were out of earshot letitia bainbridge said sarah when i close my eyes make sure that nobody goes near my apartment until the first of the next month the maintenance fee is supposed to guarantee that much seems to me that around here youre not allowed to get cold before theyve replaced you soft chimes signaled that brunch was being served as soon as they were seated maggie noticed that everybody at their table had shifted places and wondered if that was customary after a death sarah cushing was the right person for this group today she thought like her mother she was a good storyteller as maggie nibbled on eggs benedict and sipped her coffee she listened appreciatively to sarah cushings skillful management of the conversation directing it so that everyone was involved and cheerful during the second round of coffee however the talk turned to greta shipley rachel crenshaw who with her husband was sitting opposite maggie said i still cant get used to it we know were all going to die and when someone moves to the longterm care area you know its usually only a matter of time but greta and constanceit was just so sudden and last year alice and jeanette went the same way mrs bainbridge said and then sighed alice and jeanette maggie thought those names were on two of the graves i visited with mrs shipley they both had bells embedded next to the tombstones the woman whose grave didnt have a bell was named winifred pierson trying to sound casual maggie said mrs shipley had a close friend winifred pierson was she a guest here as well no winifred lived in her own home greta used to visit her regularly mrs crenshaw said maggie felt her mouth go dry she knew immediately what she had to do and the full realization came with such force that she almost stood up from the table with the shock of it she had to visit greta shipleys grave and see if a bell had been placed there when goodbyes were said most of the latham residents began drifting into the library where a violinist was scheduled to perform for the sunday afternoon entertainment sarah cushing stayed to visit with her mother and maggie headed for the front door then on sudden impulse she turned and went up the stairs to greta shipleys apartment let the cousins be there she prayed fervently the door of the apartment was open and she saw the familiar signs of packing and sorting which was being done by the three relatives she had seen at the funeral knowing there was no simple way to make the request she offered brief condolences and plunged in to tell them what she wanted when i was visiting mrs shipley on wednesday she showed me a sketch my stepmother and she had made its right in that drawer maggie pointed to the table by the couch it was one of the last things nuala did and if youre thinking of discarding it it would mean a lot to me to have it absolutely go right ahead take it they chorused amiably we havent gotten to anything except the bureau so far one of them added maggie opened the drawer expectantly it was empty the sketch to which nuala had added her own face greta shipleys face and the image of nurse markey eavesdropping was gone it isnt here she said then perhaps greta either moved it or disposed of it said a cousin who bore a striking resemblance to mrs shipley dr lane told us that after anyone passes away the apartment is immediately locked until the family comes in and removes personal items but do tell us what the sketch looks like in case we come across it maggie described it gave them her phone number thanked them and left somebody took that sketch she thought as she left the room but why stepping into the hall she almost ran into nurse markey oh excuse me the nurse said i just want to see if i can give mrs shipleys relatives a hand have a nice day miss holloway it was noon when earl bateman arrived at st marys cemetery he circled the winding roads slowly ever anxious to get a look at the kinds of people who were spending a part of their sunday visiting a loved one not too many out so far today he noted a few oldsters a middleaged couple a large family probably showing up for an anniversary after which they would have brunch at the restaurant down the road the typical sunday crew he then drove through to the old section of trinity cemetery where he parked and got out after a quick glance around he began to scrutinize the tombstones for interesting inscriptions it had been several years since he took rubbings here and he knew he might well have missed some he prided himself that his awareness of subtleties had heightened considerably since then yes he thought tombstones definitely would be a subject to outline for the cable series he would start with a reference from gone with the wind which said that three infant boys all named gerald ohara jr were buried in the family plot on tara oh the hopes and dreams we see sculptedon stone fading ignored no longer read but still leaving a messageof lasting love think of itthree little sons thats the way he would begin that lecture of course he would move quickly from tragic to upbeat by telling about one of the stones he had seen in a cape cod cemetery actually advertising the fact that the business operation that had been run by the deceased was being carried on by his son it even gave the new address earl frowned as he looked about him even though it was a warm and pleasant october day and even though he thoroughly enjoyed his profitable hobby he was upset and angry as they had arranged last night liam had come to his house for drinks and then they had gone out to dinner together even though he had left his threethousanddollar check right next to the vodka bottle on the bar where it couldnt possibly be missed liam had pointedly ignored it instead he had empha sized yet again that earl ought to go golfing instead of haunting cemeteries haunting indeed earl thought his face darkening i could show him what haunting is all about he said to himself and he was damned if he would let liam warn him away from maggie holloway again it simply was none of his business liam had asked if he had seen her and when he told liam that since monday night he had seen maggie only at the cemetery and of course at mrs shipleys funeral liam had said earl you and your cemeteries im getting worried about you youre becoming obsessive he didnt believe me when i tried to explain my premonitions earl muttered aloud he never takes me seriously he stopped suddenly and looked about there was no one dont think about it anymore he warned himself at least not now he walked along the paths of the oldest section of the cemetery where some of the barely discernible carvings on the small headstones bore dates from the s he squatted by one that had almost fallen over squinting to read the faint lettering his eyes brightened as he made out the inscription betrothed to roger samuels but gathered to the lord and the dates earl opened his kit to take a rubbing of the stone another angle to discuss in one of his lectures on tombstones would be the tender age at which so many young people were struck down in the old days there had been no penicillin to treat the pneumoniathat resulted when winter cold made its insidious way into chests andlungs he knelt down enjoying the feel of the soft earth that sent its cool dampness through his old trousers to his skin as he began his careful effort to transfer the stones poignant sentiment onto thin almost translucent parchment he found himself thinking of the young girl who lay beneath him her body sheltered by the ageless ground she had just passed her sixteenth birthday he calculated had she been pretty yes very pretty he decided she had had a cloud of dark curls and sapphire blue eyes and she had been small boned maggie holloways face floated before him at onethirty as he was driving back toward the entrance of the cemetery earl passed a vehicle with new york plates parked at the curb it looks familiar he thought then realized that it was maggie holloways volvo wagon what was she doing here again today he wondered greta shipleys grave was nearby but certainly maggie wasnt so close to greta that she would feel the need to visit the grave again only a day after the funeral slowing his car he looked about when he spotted maggie in the distance walking toward him he put his foot on the accelerator he didnt want her to see him clearly something was going on he had to think about this he did make one decision since he did not have classes tomorrow he would stay an extra day in newport and whether liam liked it or not tomorrow he was going to visit maggie holloway maggie walked quickly away from greta shipleys grave her hands jammed in the pockets of her jacket her eyes not seeing the path she was following in every fiber of her being she felt chilled and shaken she had found it buried so deeply that had she not run her hand over every inch of the area at the base of the tombstone she might have missed it a bell exactly like the one she had taken from nualas grave like the bells on the other womens graves like the bells that welltodo victorians had placed on their graves in case they were buried while still alive who had come back here since the funeral and put that object on mrs shipleys grave she wondered and why liam had told her that his cousin earl had had twelve of these bells cast to use to illustrate his lectures he had also indicated that earl apparently relished the fact that he had frightened the women at latham manor by handing the bells out during his talk there was this earls idea of a bizarre joke maggie wondered putting these bells on the graves of latham manor residents its possible she decided as she reached her car it could be his warped and demented way of taking some small revenge for having been criticized publicly by mrs bainbridges daughter according to liam sarah had gathered the bells thrust them at earl and then had practically ordered him out of the residence revenge was a logical if appalling explanation im glad i took the one from nualas grave maggie thought i feel like going back and collecting the others tooespecially the one from mrs shipleys plot but she decided against it at least for the time being she wanted to be certain that they were in fact nothing more than earls childish and sickening act of revenge i will come back later she decided besides ive got to get home neil said he would be there at two as she drove down her street she noticed that two cars were parked in front of her house pulling into the driveway she saw that neil and his father were sitting on the porch steps a tool kit between them mr stephens waved aside her apologies youre not late its only one minute of two unless my son is mistaken which is a distinct possibility he said wed be here at two apparently i make a lot of mistakes neil said looking directly at maggie she ignored the remark refusing to rise to the bait its awfully nice of both of you to come she said sincerely unlocking the door she led them in robert stephens examined the front door as he closed it needs weather stripping he observed pretty soon that sea air will get mighty cold with a stiff wind behind it now id like to start at that back door neil told me about and then well check all the window locks and see which ones need replacing i have some spares with me and ill come back if you need more neil stood beside maggie keenly aware of his nearness she stepped away as he said humor him maggie my grandfather built an atomicbomb shelter after world war ii when i was growing up my friends and i used it as a hangout by then people realized those shelters would be as useless in a nuclear attack as a parasol in a tornado my father has something of his fathers anticipate the worst mentality he always anticipates the unthinkable absolutely true robert stephens agreed and in this house i would say the unthinkable took place ten days ago maggie saw neil wince and said hastily im very grateful youre here if you want to do anything we wont be in your way robert stephens told her as they went into the kitchen and he opened his tool kit spreading it out on the table i think you should stay with us neil urged we might want to ask you about something he added dont disappear maggie looking at him dressed as he was in a tan shirt chinos and sneakers maggie found herself wishing she were holding her camera she realized there was an aspect to neil she had never seen in the city he doesnt have that dont invade my territory air about him today she thought he looks as though he actually might care about other peoples feelings even my feelings his forehead was creased with a look of worried concern and his dark brown eyes had the same questioning look maggie had observed last night then as his father began working at the old door lock neil said in a low voice maggie i can tell something is bothering you i wish to god youd let me in on it neil give me the big screwdriver his father ordered maggie settled in an old bentwood chair ill watch maybe i can learn something useful for nearly an hour father and son worked going from room to room examining windows tightening some locks noting others for replacement in the studio robert stephens asked to examine the clay sculptures on the refectory table when maggie showed him the one she was beginning of greta shipley he said i hear she wasnt well at the end last time i saw her she was pretty sprightly even feisty is this nuala neil asked pointing to the other bust theres a lot of work to do on it but yes that was nuala i guess my fingers saw something i didnt realize she always had such a merry look but it isnt there for me now when they were on the way downstairs robert stephens pointed to nualas room i hope youre planning to move in there he said its twice the size of the guest rooms as a matter of fact i am maggie admitted mr stephens stood at the door that bed should be opposite the windows not where it is now maggie felt helpless im planning to put it there who was going to help you i thought id just start yanking im stronger than i look youre kidding you dont mean you were going to try to shove this rock maple around yourself come on neil well start with the bed where do you want the dresser moved maggie neil paused only long enough to say dont take it personally hes like this with everyone everyone i care about his father corrected in less than ten minutes the furniture had been rearranged as she watched maggie planned the way she would redecorate the room the old wallpaper needed replacing she decided and then the floor would have to be refinished and then she would get area rugs to replace the faded green carpet nesting again she thought okay thats it robert stephens announced maggie and neil followed him down the stairs as he said im on my way some folks coming over for a drink later neil youll be up next weekend absolutely neil said im taking friday off again maggie ill be back with the other locks but ill call you first robert stephens said as he headed out the door he was in his car before maggie could even thank him hes wonderful she said as she watched his car disappear incredible as it may seem i think so too neil said smiling some people of course find him overwhelming he paused for a moment were you at your stepmothers grave this morning maggie no i wasnt what makes you think that because the knees of your slacks are stained with dirt im sure you werent gardening in that outfit maggie realized that with neil and his father here she had shaken off or at least suspended the profound uneasiness caused by finding the bell on greta shipleys grave neils question quickly brought back the old concern but she couldnt talk about it now not to neil not to anyone really she decided not until she had found some way to determine whether earl bateman was responsible for the placement of the bells seeing the change in her face neil confronted her maggie what the hell is the matter he asked his voice low and intense youre mad at me and i dont know why except that i didnt phone you in time to get this number before you left ill kick myself for that for the rest of my life if i had known what had happened id have been here for you would you maggie shook her head looking away neil im trying to work a lot of things through things that dont make sense and may be the product of my overactive imagination but theyre things ive got to work through myself can we leave it at that for now i assume i have no choice neil said look ive got to be on my way i have to get ready for a board meeting in the morning but ill call you tomorrow and ill be here thursday afternoon youre staying until next sunday yes maggie replied adding to herself and maybe by then ill have some answers to my questions about earl bateman and about these bells and her thoughts were interrupted as unbidden latham manor residence jumped into her mind neil last night you said that you and your father were at latham manor yesterday you were looking at a twobedroom suite for your clients werent you yes why nuala almost took that suite and didnt you say that another woman would have taken it but couldnt because she lost her money in a bad investment thats right and he stung another client of dads who was on lathams waiting listcora gebhart and thats something else i intend to take care of this week im going to investigate the snake who roped both of them into making those investments and if i can find anything at all to hang on doug hansen ill turn him in to the sec maggie what are you driving at doug hansen maggie exclaimed yes why do you know him not really but let me know what you find out about him she said remembering that she had told hansen she would not discuss his offer its just that ive heard of him well dont invest money with him neil said grimly okay ive got to go he bent down and kissed her cheek lock the door behind me she didnt hear his footsteps on the porch stairs until the decisive click of the deadbolt lock signaled that the house was secure she watched him drive away the front windows faced east and late afternoon shadows were already filtering through the leaffilled branches of the trees the house felt suddenly quiet and empty maggie looked down at her creamcolored slacks and pondered the streaks of dirt neil had questioned ill change and go up to the studio for a while she decided then tomorrow morning ill clean out the closet floor and move my things into nualas room there were so many questions maggie wished she could ask nuala refining her features in the clay would be a way of communicating with her and maybe ill be able to think through my fingers what we cant talk about together she thought and she could ask questions that needed to be answered like nuala was there some reason you were afraid to live in latham manor monday october th malcolm norton opened his office on monday morning at the usual time ninethirty he passed through the reception area where barbara hoffmans desk faced the door the desk however was now cleared of all barbaras personal belongings the framed pictures of her three children and their families the narrow vase in which she had kept seasonal flowers or a sprig of leaves the orderly pile of current workall of these were missing norton shivered slightly the reception area was clinical and cold once more janices idea of interior decorating he thought grimly cold sterile like her and like me he added bitterly as he crossed into his office no clients no appointmentsthe day loomed long and quiet before him the thought occurred to him that he had two hundred thousand dollars in the bank why not just withdraw it and disappear he asked himself if barbara would join him he would do just that in an instant let janice have the mortgaged house in a good market it was worth nearly twice the amount of the mortgage equitable distribution he thought remembering the bank statement he had found in his wifes briefcase but barbara was gone the reality of it was just beginning to sink in he had known the minute chief brower left the other day that she would leave browers questioning of both of them had terrified her she had felt his hostility and it had been the deciding thing for hershe had to leave how much did brower know norton wondered he sat at his desk his hands folded everything had been so well planned if the buy agreement with nuala had gone into effect he would have given her the twenty thousand he had gotten by cashing in his retirement money they wouldnt have closed on the sale for ninety days which would have given him time to sign a settlement with janice then float a demand loan to cover the purchase if only maggie holloway hadnt come into the picture he thought bitterly if only nuala hadnt made a new will if only he hadnt had to let janice in on the change in the wetlands preservation laws if only malcolm had driven past barbaras house this morning it had the closed look that houses get when the summer residents lock up for the winter shades were drawn on every window a smattering of unswept leaves had blown onto the porch and the walk barbara must have left for colorado on saturday she had not called him she just left malcolm norton sat in his dark still office contemplating his next move he knew what he was going to do the only question now was when to do it on monday morning lara horgan asked an assistant in the coroners office to run a check on zelda markey the nurse employed at the latham manor residence in newport who had found mrs greta shipleys body the initial report was in by late morning it showed she had a good work record no professional complaints ever had been filed against her she was a lifelong resident of rhode island during her twenty years of practice she had worked at three hospitals and four nursing homes all within the state she had been at latham manor since it opened except for lathem shed done a lot of moving around dr horgan thought follow up with the personnel people at the places where shes worked she instructed the assistant theres something about that lady that bothers me she then phoned the newport police and asked to speak to chief brower in the short time since she was appointed coroner they had come to like and respect each other she asked brower about the investigation of the nuala moore murder he told her they had no specific leads but were following up on a couple of things and trying to approach the crime from all the logical angles as they were speaking detective jim haggerty stuck his head in the chiefs office hold on lara brower said haggerty was doing a little followup on nuala moores stepdaughter he has an expression on his face that tells me hes onto something maybe haggerty said maybe not he took out his note book at this morning nuala moores stepdaughter maggie holloway went into the morgue at the newport sentinel and requested to see the obituaries of five women since all five were longtime newport residents extensive features had been written on each of them ms holloway took the computer printouts and left i have a copy of them here brower repeated haggertys report to lara horgan then added ms holloway arrived here ten days ago for the first time its pretty certain she couldnt have known any of these women except greta shipley well study those obits to see if we can figure out what might have made them so interesting to her ill get back to you chief do me a favor dr horgan asked fax copies of them to me too okay janice norton observed with a note of cynicism that life in latham manor did manage to survive the momentary upheaval caused by a recent death spurred on by her nephews lavish praise for the assist she had provided in relieving cora gebhart of her financial assets janice was anxious to dip once more into dr lanes applicant file which he kept in his desk she had to be careful never to be caught going through his desk to avoid being found out she scheduled her furtive visits at times when she was sure he was out of the residence late monday afternoon was one of those times the lanes were driving to boston for some sort of medical affair a cocktail party and dinner janice knew that the rest of the office staff would take advantage of his absence and would be scurrying out at five oclock on the dot that would be the ideal time to take the entire file to her own office and to study it carefully lanes in a really sunny mood she thought as he popped his head into her office at threethirty to announce he was leaving soon she understood the reason for his upbeat manner as he told her that someone had been by over the weekend to look at the big apartment for some clients and then had recommended it to them the van hillearys had called to say they would be coming up next sunday from what i understand theyre very substantial people who would use the residence as their base in the northeast dr lane said with obvious satisfaction we could wish for more guests like that meaning much less service for all that money janice thought it sounds unlikely that theyll be much good to doug and me if they like this place then they already have an apartment available to them but even if they were just going on the waiting list there is too much risk in ripping off a couple with major assets she reasoned inevitably they were surrounded by financial advisers who kept a hawkeye watch on investments even her charming nephew would have a tough time softening them up well i hope you and odile enjoy the evening doctor janice said as she turned briskly back to the computer he would have been suspicious if she had stepped out of character by making small talk the rest of the afternoon crawled by for her she knew it wasnt just the anticipation of getting at the files that made the day drag it was also the faint nagging suspicion that someone had gone through her briefcase ridiculous she told herself who could have done it malcolm doesnt come near my room never mind his turning into a snooper then a thought came that brought a smile to her face im getting paranoid because thats exactly what im doing to dr lane she reasoned besides malcolm doesnt have enough brains to spy on me on the other hand she did have a hunch he was up to something from now on she resolved to keep her personal bank statements and her copies of the files away from any place where he would have a chance to happen on them neils two early meetings on monday morning kept him out of his office until eleven oclock when he finally arrived there he immediately called maggie but got no answer he then called the van hillearys and briefly gave them his impression of latham manor concluding with a recommendation that they visit there so they could judge the place for themselves his next call was to the private investigator who worked on confidential assignments for carson amp parker requesting a dossier on douglas hansen dig deep he instructed i know theres got to be something there this guy is a worldclass sleaze he then called maggie again and was relieved when she picked up she sounded breathless when she answered i just got in she told him neil was sure he could hear agitation and anxiety in her voice maggie is anything wrong he asked no not at all her denial was almost a whisper as though she were afraid of being overheard is someone with you he asked his concern growing no im alone i just got here it wasnt like maggie to repeat herself but neil realized that once again she was not going to let him in on whatever was bothering her he wanted to bombard her with questions like where have you been and have you come up with any answers to the things you said were bothering you and can i help but he didnt he knew better instead he said simply maggie im here just remember that if you want to talk to someone ill remember and youll do nothing about it he thought okay ill call you tomorrow he replaced the receiver and sat for long minutes before punching in the number of his parents home his father answered neil got straight to the point dad have you got those locks for maggies windows just picked them up good do me a favor and phone over there and tell her you want to put them in this afternoon i think something has come up that is making her nervous ill take care of it it was a mixed comfort neil thought wryly that maggie might be more willing to confide in his father than in himself but at least his father would be on the alert to pick up any hint of problems trish came into his office the moment he was off the phone in her hand she held a stack of messages as she placed them on his desk she pointed to the one on top i see your new client asked you to sell stock she doesnt own she said severely what are you talking about neil demanded nothing much just the clearinghouse has notified us that they have no record of cora gebhart owning the fifty thousand shares of stock you sold for her on friday maggie hung up at the end of her call from neil and went to the stove automatically she filled the kettle she wanted the feeling of hot tea warming her she needed something that would help her separate the jarring reality of the obituaries from the disturbing even crazy thoughts that were shooting through her head she did a quick mental review of what she had learned so far last week when she had taken greta shipley to the cemetery they had left flowers at nualas grave and the graves of five other women someone had placed a bell on three of those graves as well as on nualas she had found them there herself there was an impression as if a bell had been sunk into the earth near mrs rhinelanders tombstone but for some reason that bell was missing greta shipley had died in her sleep two days later and barely twentyfour hours after she was buried a bell had been placed on her grave as well maggie laid the printouts of the obituaries on the table and read quickly through them again they confirmed what had occurred to her yesterday winifred pierson the one woman in that group whose grave showed no evidence of a bell had a large caring family she had died with her personal physician in attendance with the exception of nuala who had been murdered in her own home the other women had died in their sleep meaning maggie thought that no one was in attendance at the time of death they had all been under the ongoing care of dr william lane director of latham manor dr lane maggie thought of how quickly sarah cushing had rushed her mother to an outside doctor was it because she knew or maybe subconsciously suspected that dr lane was not a skillful practitioner or perhaps too skillful a practitioner a nagging inner voice queried remember nuala was murdered dont think that way she warned herself but no matter how one looked at it she thought latham manor had been a jinx for a lot of people two of mr stephens clients had lost their money while they were waiting to get into the place and five women all latham residentswho werent that elderly or that sick had died in their sleep there what had made nuala change her mind about selling her house and going to live there she wondered again and what made douglas hansen who had sold stocks to the women who lost their money show up here wanting to buy this house maggie shook her head there has to be a connection she told herself but what is it the kettle was whistling as maggie got up to make the tea the phone rang it was neils father he said maggie ive got those locks im on my way over if you have to go out tell me where i can find a key no ill be here twenty minutes later he was at the door after a good to see you maggie he said ill start upstairs while he changed the locks she worked in the kitchen straightening drawers tossing out the odds and ends she found in most of them the sound of his footsteps overhead was reassuring she used the time while she worked to once more think through all that she knew putting together all the pieces of the puzzle she had so far she came to a decision she had absolutely no right to voice any suspicions about dr lane as yet but there was no reason not to talk about douglas hansen she decided robert stephens came back to the kitchen okay youre all set no charge but can you spare a cup of coffee instant is fine im easy to please he settled in a chair and maggie knew he was studying her neil sent him she thought he could tell i was upset mr stephens she began you dont know very much about douglas hansen do you enough to know that hes wrecked the lives of some very nice women maggie but have i ever met him no why do you ask because both the ladies you know who lost their money thanks to him had been planning to go into latham manor which meant they could afford a sizable outlay of money my stepmother also had planned to live there but she changed her mind at the last minute last week hansen showed up here and offered me fifty thousand dollars more for this house than nuala almost sold it for and from what ive learned thats much more than its worth my point is i wonder how he happened to contact the women you know who invested with him and i wonder what made him show up on this doorstep theres got to be more than just coincidence at play here earl bateman drove past maggies house twice on the third trip he saw that the car with the rhode island plates was gone maggies station wagon however was still in the driveway he slowed to a halt and reached for the framed picture he had brought with him he was fairly sure that if he had phoned and said he would like to see her maggie would have turned him down but now she wouldnt have a choice she would have to invite him in he rang the doorbell twice before she opened the door it was obvious that she was surprised to see him surprised and nervous he thought he quickly held up the package a present for you he said enthusiastically a marvelous picture of nuala that was taken at the four seasons party i framed it for you how nice of you maggie said trying to smile a look of uncertainty on her face then she reached out her hand earl pulled the package back withholding it arent you going to ask me in he asked his tone light and joking of course she stood aside and let him pass but to his annoyance she swung the door wide open and left it that way id close that if i were you he said i dont know if youve been out today but theres a stiff breeze he again saw her uncertainty and smiled grimly and no matter what my dear cousin has told you i dont bite he said finally handing her the package he walked ahead of her into the living room and sat in the big club chair i can see tim ensconced here with his books and newspapers and nuala fussing around him what a pair of lovebirds they were they invited me over to dinner occasionally and i was always glad to come nuala wasnt much of a housekeeper but she was an excellent cook and tim told me that often when they were alone and watching tv late at night shed curl up in this chair with him she was such a petite lady he looked around i can see youre already putting your stamp on this place he said i approve theres a much calmer feeling does that love seat spook you ill do some refurnishing maggie said her tone still wary bateman watched her as she opened the package and congratulated himself on thinking of the photograph just seeing the way her face lit up confirmed how smart he had been to think of it oh its a wonderful picture of nuala maggie said enthusiastically she looked so pretty that evening thank you i really am glad to have this her smile was now genuine im sorry liam and i are in it as well bateman said maybe you can have us airbrushed out i wouldnt do that maggie answered quickly and thank you for taking the time to bring it yourself youre most welcome he said as he leaned further back into the deep chair hes not going to go she thought in dismay his scrutiny made her uncomfortable she felt as though she were under a spotlight batemans eyes too large behind his roundframed glasses were fixed on her with an unwavering stare despite his apparent effort at nonchalance he seemed almost to be at attention his body rigid i couldnt imagine him curling up anywhere or even being comfortable in his own skin she reflected hes like a wire stretched too far ready to snap she thought nuala was such a petite lady wasnt much of a housekeeper excellent cook how often had earl bateman been here maggie wondered how well did he know this house maybe he knew the reason nuala had decided not to become a resident of latham manor she decided about to voice the question until another thought hit her or maybe he suspected the reasonand killed her she jumped involuntarily when the telephone rang excusing herself she went to the kitchen to answer it police chief brower was calling ms holloway i was wondering if i could stop in and see you late this afternoon he said of course has something come up i mean about nuala oh nothing special i just wanted to talk with you and i may bring someone with me is that all right ill phone before i come of course she said then suspecting that earl bateman might be trying to overhear what she was saying she raised her voice slightly chief im just visiting with earl bateman he brought over a wonderful picture of nuala ill see you in a while when she went back into the living room she saw that the ottoman in front of earls chair had been pushed aside indicating that he had stood up he did eavesdrop she thought good with a smile she said that was chief brower something you already know she added silently hes coming over this afternoon i told him you were visiting batemans nod was solemn a good police chief respects people not like security police in some cultures you know what happens when a king dies during the mourning period the police seize control of the government sometimes they even murder the kings family in fact in some societies that was a regular occurrence i could give you so many examples you know i lecture on funeral customs maggie sat down oddly fascinated by the man she sensed something different about earl batemans expression which had become one of almost religious absorption from a living example of the awkward absentminded professor he was transformed entirely into a silvervoiced messianic other even the way he was sitting was different the rigid schoolboy posture had been replaced by the comfortable stance of a man who was secure and at ease he was leaning slightly toward her his left elbow on the arm of the chair his head slightly tilted he was no longer staring at her his eyes were fixed instead somewhere just to her left maggie felt her mouth go dry unconsciously she had sat on the love seat and now she realized he was looking just beyond her focused on the place where nualas body had been hunched did you know i lecture on funeral customs he asked again and she realized with a start that she had not answered his question oh yes she said quickly remember you told me that the first night we met id really like to talk to you about it bateman said earnestly you see a cable company is very interested in having me do a television series provided i am able to offer a range of subjects for at least thirteen thirtyminute programs thats not a problem ive got more than enough material for the programs but id like to include some visuals maggie waited earl clasped his hands now his voice became coaxing the response to this kind of offer shouldnt be delayed i need to act on it soon youre a very successful photographer visuals are what you understand it would be such a favor if youd let me take you to see my museum today its downtown right next to the funeral parlor my family used to own you know where that is of course would you just spend an hour with me ill show you the exhibits and explain them and maybe you could help me decide which ones to suggest to the producers he paused please maggie he has to have overheard me maggie thought he knows chief brower is coming here and he knows i told him who was visiting me liam had told her about earls victorian bell replicas hes supposed to have twelve of them suppose theyre on exhibit she thought and suppose there are only six of them now if so then it would be reasonable to believe that he put the others on the graves id be glad to go she said after a moment but chief brower is coming to see me this afternoon just in case he gets here early ill leave a note on the door saying that im with you at the museum and that ill be back by four earl smiled thats very wise maggie that should give us plenty of time at two oclock chief chet brower summoned detective jim haggerty to his office but learned that haggerty had left just a few minutes earlier saying that he would be back shortly when he came in he was carrying papers identical to the ones brower had been hunched over at his deskcopies of the obituaries maggie holloway had looked up at the newportsentinel haggerty knew that as requested another set had been faxed to lara horgan at the coroners office in providence what did you see jim brower demanded haggerty slumped into a seat probably the same thing you did chief five of the six deceased women lived at that fancy retirement home right none of those five had close relatives brower looked at him benignly very good they all died in their sleep uhhuh and dr william lane the director of latham manor was in attendance in each instance meaning he signed the death certificates brower smiled approvingly you catch on real fast also haggerty continued what the articles dont say is that when you die at latham manor the studio or apartment you had purchased to live in reverts to the management which means it can be sold again pronto brower frowned i didnt think of that angle he admitted i just spoke to the coroner lara picked up on all of this too shes running a check on dr william lane she already was investigating the background of a nurse there zelda markey she wants to come with me to talk to maggie holloway this afternoon haggerty looked pensive i knew mrs shipley the woman who died at latham last week i liked her a lot it occurred to me that her next of kin were still in town i asked around and theyve been staying at the harborside inn so i just popped over there brower waited haggerty wore his most noncommittal expression which brower knew meant he had stumbled onto something i extended my sympathy and talked to them a bit turned out that yesterday who should be at latham manor but maggie holloway why was she there brower snapped she was a guest at brunch of old mrs bainbridge and her daughter but afterward she did go up and speak to mrs shipleys relatives when they were packing up her effects he sighed ms holloway had an odd request she said her step mother nuala moore who taught an art class at latham had helped mrs shipley make a sketch and she asked if they minded if she took it funny thing though it wasnt there maybe mrs shipley tore it up not likely anyhow later a couple of the residents stopped in to talk to mrs shipleys relatives while they were doing the packing and they asked them about the sketch one of the old girls said she had seen it it was supposed to be a world war ii poster that showed a spy eavesdropping on two defense workers why would ms holloway want that because nuala moore had put her own face and greta shipleys face over those of the defense workers and in place of the spy guess who shed sketched brower looked at haggerty his eyes narrowed nurse markey the detective said with satisfaction and one more thing chief the rule at latham manor is that when a death occurs as soon as the body is removed the room or apartment is locked until the family has had a chance to come to take possession of valuables in other words nobody had any business being in there and taking that sketch he paused kind of makes you wonder doesnt it neil canceled a lunch date he had made and instead had a sandwich and coffee at his desk he had instructed trish to fend off all but the most urgent calls as he worked feverishly to clear his calendar for the next few days at three oclock just as trish came back with a fresh batch of papers he phoned his father dad im coming up tonight he said ive been trying to get that hansen guy on the phone but they keep telling me hes out so im going to come up there and track him down myself theres a lot more going on with that guy than just giving lousy advice to old women thats what maggie said and im sure shes onto something maggie she seems to think theres some kind of connection between hansen and the women who put in applications to latham manor ive been talking to laura arlington and cora gebhart it turns out hansen called them out of the blue why didnt they just hang up on him most people dont get involved over the phone with stock peddlers they dont know apparently using alberta downings name gave him credibility he urged them to call her for a reference but thenand this is where it gets interestinghe talked about how some people have investments that are losing buying power because of inflation and he just happened to give as examples the very stocks and bonds that cora gebhart and laura arlington owned yes neil said i remember mrs gebhart saying something of the sort i need to talk to this mrs downing somethings definitely not right here and by the way i expected youd call me as soon as you saw maggie he added knowing that now he sounded annoyed ive been worried about her was she okay i planned to call you as soon as i finished checking out her take on hansen robert stephens answered i thought perhaps that was more important than filing a report with you he added acerbically neil rolled his eyes sorry he said and thanks for going over to see her you must know i went immediately i happen to like that young lady very much one more thing hansen dropped in on maggie last week and made an offer on her house ive been talking to real estate agents to get their opinions of its value maggie had speculated that his offer was too high given the condition of the house and shes right so while youre at it try to figure out what game hes playing with her neil remembered maggies startled reaction when he mentioned hansens name and how when he had asked if she knew him her answer had been evasive but i was right about one thing she did open up to dad he thought when i get to newport im going straight to her house and im not leaving until she tells me just what it is ive done wrong when he got off the phone he looked over at trish and the papers in her hand youll have to take care of those im out of here oh my my trish said her tone teasing but affectionate so her name is maggie and youre worried sick about her what a learning experience for you then she frowned wait a minute neil you really are worried arent you you bet i am then what are you waiting for get moving im very proud of my museum earl explained as he held the door for maggie to get out of her car she had declined his offer to drive with him and was aware that he had been annoyed at the refusal as she had followed his gray oldsmobile into town and past the bateman funeral home she realized why she hadnt noticed the museum it fronted on a side street to the rear of the large property and had its own parking lot behind it the lot was empty now except for one other vehicle parked in the corner a shiny black hearse earl pointed to it as they walked toward the museum thats thirty years old he said proudly my father was going to trade it in when i was starting college but i talked him into letting me have it i keep it in the garage here and only pull it out in the summer thats when i invite visitors to the museum although just for a couple of hours on weekends it kind of sets the tone for the place dont you think i guess so maggie said uncertainly in these last ten days ive seen enough hearses for a lifetime she thought she turned to study the threestory victorian house with its wide porch and gingerbread trim like the bateman funeral home it was painted glistening white with black shutters black crepe streamers draped around the front door fluttered in the breeze the house was built in by my greatgreatgrandfather earl explained it was our first funeral parlor and back then the family lived on the top floor my grandfather built the present establishment and my father expanded it this house was used by a caretaker for a while when we sold the business ten years ago we separated the house and an acre of the property and i took it over completely i opened the museum shortly after that although id been putting it together for years earl put his hand on maggies elbow youre in for a treat now remember i want you to look at everything with an eye toward what i should suggest for visuals i dont mean just for the individual lectures but maybe something as well for an opening and closing signature for the series they were on the porch located on the broad railing and helping to offset somewhat the overall funerary gloom were several planters filled with violets and mountain pinks bateman lifted the edge of the nearest planter and withdrew a key see how i trust you maggie im showing you my secret hiding place this is an oldfashioned lock and the key is much too heavy to bother carrying around pausing at the door he pointed to the crepe in our society it used to be the custom to drape the door like this to signify that this was a house of mourning my god how he enjoys this maggie thought shivering slightly she realized her hands were damp and shoved them in the pockets of her jeans the irrational thought went through her head that she had no business entering a house of grief dressed in a plaid shirt and jeans the key turned with a grating sound and earl bateman pushed the door open and then stood back now what do you think of that he asked proudly as maggie moved slowly past him a lifesized figure of a man in black livery stood at attention in the foyer as though ready to receive guests in emily posts first etiquette book published in she wrote that when a death occurred the butler in his day clothes should be on duty at the door until a footman in black livery could replace him earl flicked something maggie could not see from the sleeve of the mannequin you see he said earnestly the downstairs rooms show our grief culture in this century i thought the liveried figure would be interesting to people as they came in how many people today even wealthy people would have a footman in black livery stationed at the door when someone in the family dies maggies thoughts abruptly leaped back to that painful day when she was ten years old and nuala told her she was going away you see maggie she had explained for a long time after my first husband died i carried dark glasses with me i cried so easily that i was embarrassed when i felt it coming on id reach in my pocket and grab the glasses and id think time to put on the grief equipment again i hoped your father and i could love each other that way ive tried hard but it just cant be and for the rest of my life whenever i think of the years im going to miss with you ill have to reach for my grief equipment remembering that day always brought tears to maggies eyes i wish i had some grief equipment right now she thought as she brushed the moisture off her cheek oh maggie youre touched earl said his tone reverent how understanding of you now on this floor as i told you i have rooms that exhibit twentiethcentury death rituals he pushed aside a heavy curtain in this room ive staged emily posts version of a very small funeral see maggie looked in the figure of a young woman dressed in a pale green silk robe was laid out on a brocaded sofa long auburn ringlets spilled around a narrow satin pillow her hands were folded over silk replicas of lilies of the valley isnt that charming doesnt she look just like shes sleeping earl whispered and look he pointed to a discreet silver lectern near the entrance today this would be where visitors sign the guest book what i did instead was to copy a page from the original emily post book about the care of the bereaved let me read it to you its really quite fascinating his voice echoed through the tooquiet room the ones in sorrow should be urged if possible to sit in a sunny room and where there is an open fire if they feel unequal to going to the table a very little food should be taken to them on a tray a cup of tea or coffee or bouillon a little thin toast a poached egg milk if they like it hot or milk toast cold milk is bad for one who is already overchilled the cook may suggest something that appeals usually to their taste he stopped isnt that something how many people today no matter how much money they have have a cook who is worried about what appeals to their taste right but i think this would make a wonderful individual visual dont you the signatures for the opening and closing though have to have a broader scope he took her arm i know you dont have a lot of time but please come on upstairs with me ive got some great replicas of archaic separation rites from ancient times banquet tables for example it would seem that diverse people inherently understood that death must include a banquet or feast at the end of the ceremony because extended grief is debilitating to the individual and to the community ive got typical examples set up then theres my burial section he continued enthusiastically as they ascended the stairs have i mentioned a custom of the sudan people who suffocated their leader when he was becoming old or feeble you see the principle was that the leader embodied the vitality of the nation and must never die or the nation would die with him so when the leader was clearly losing his power he was secretly put to death then walled up in a mud hut the custom then was to believe that he had not died but rather had vanished he laughed they were on the second floor in this first room ive created a replica of a mud hut now just between us ive already gotten started on an outdoor museum where the burial area can be even more realistic its about ten miles from here so far ive had some excavation done basically just some bulldozing im designing the entire project myself but when its completed it really will be quite wonderful in one area ill have a miniature replica of a pyramid with a section of it transparent so that people can see how the ancient egyptians entombed their pharaohs with their gold and priceless jewels to accompany them into the hereafter hes babbling maggie thought a leaden sense of unease settling over her hes crazy her mind was racing as he propelled her from room to room each of them containing what resembled an elaborately structured stage setting earl was holding her hand now pulling her along as he darted about to show everything explain everything they were almost at the end of the long hallway and maggie realized that she still had not seen anything resembling the bells she had found on the graves what do you have on the third floor she asked thats not ready for exhibits yet he replied absently i use it for storage then he stopped abruptly and turned to her his eyes intense they were at the end of the hallway in front of a heavy door oh maggie this is one of my best exhibits earl turned the handle and with a dramatic flourish threw open the door i combined two rooms to get the effect i wanted here this depicts an aristocrats funeral in ancient rome he pulled her inside let me explain first they built a bier then they put the couch on it on top of that were placed two mattresses maybe this would make a good opening shot for the series of course right now the torches just have red light bulbs but we could really have them flaming the old man who made this bier for me was a real craftsman he copied it exactly from the picture i gave him look at the fruit and flowers he carved into the wood feel it he grasped her hand and ran it along the bier and this mannequin is a treasure hes dressed just like a dead aristocrat would be dressed i found that fancy raiment in a costume shop what a show these funerals must have been think of it heralds musicians flaming torches abruptly he stopped and frowned i do get carried away on this subject maggie forgive me no im fascinated she said trying to sound calm hoping he would not notice the dampness of the hand he was at last relinquishing oh good well theres just one more room right here my coffin room he opened the last door quite a spread here too wouldnt you say maggie stood back she did not want to go in that room only ten days ago she had been the one to choose a casket for nuala actually earl i should be heading back she said oh id like to have explained these maybe youll come back by the end of the week ill have the newest one in its shaped like a loaf of bread it was designed for the corpse of a baker the custom in some african cultures is to bury the deceased in a coffin that symbolizes the way that persons life has been spent i included that story in one of the lectures i gave to a womens club right here in newport maggie realized that he might have given her the opening she had been seeking do you lecture in newport very often not anymore earl closed the door of the coffin room slowly as though he were reluctant to leave it youve heard it said that a prophet is without honor in his own country no doubt first they expect to get you without even an honorarium then they insult you was he talking about the reaction to his lecture at latham manor maggie wondered the closed doors of the rooms shut out most of the light and the hall was filled with shadows but even so she could see that his face was turning crimson surely no one insulted you she asked her voice controlled caring once he said darkly it upset me terribly she didnt dare tell him that liam had been the one to tell her about the incident with the bells oh wait a minute she said slowly when i visited mrs shipley at latham manor didnt i hear that something unpleasant had happened to you when you were kind enough to speak there something involving mrs bainbridges daughter thats exactly what i mean earl replied sharply she upset me so much that i stopped giving one of my most effective lectures as they walked down the stairs to the first floor past the mannequin of the liveried footman and out onto the porch where maggie realized the daylight felt unexpectedly strong after the dim interior of the museum bateman told of that evening at latham manor and described handing out the replicas of the victorian bells i had them cast specially he said his voice ominous with anger twelve of them maybe it wasnt smart to have let those people hold them but that was no reason for treating me the way that woman did maggie spoke carefully im sure other people dont react that way it was very upsetting to all of us zelda was furious zelda maggie asked nurse markey she knows my research and had heard me speak a number of times i was there because of her she had told the activities chairperson at latham how well i lecture nurse markey maggie thought his eyes narrowed became cautious she could see he was studying her i dont like to talk about this it upsets me but i would think that would be a fascinating lecture maggie persisted and maybe those bells would be a good visual for an opening or closing shot no forget it theyre all in a box up in the storeroom and thats where theyll stay he replaced the key under the planter now dont tell anyone its here maggie no i wont but if youd like to come back yourself and maybe take some pictures of the exhibits that you think i should submit to the cable people that would be fine you know where to find the key he walked her to her car i have to get back to providence he said will you think about the visuals and see if you can come up with some suggestions can i call you in a day or so of course she replied as with relief she slid into the drivers seat and thank you she added knowing that she had absolutely no intention of using the key or of ever coming back to this place if she could help it see you soon i hope say hello to chief brower for me she turned the key in the ignition goodbye earl it was very interesting my cemetery exhibit will be interesting too oh that reminds me i better put the hearse back in the garage cemetery hearse funny how the mind works isnt it he said as he walked away as maggie drove out onto the street she could see in the rearview mirror that earl was sitting in the hearse holding a phone his head was turned in her direction she could feel his eyes wide and luminous watching her intently until at last she was beyond his range of vision shortly before five dr william lane arrived at the ritzcarlton hotel in boston where a cocktail party and dinner for a retiring surgeon were being held his wife odile had driven up earlier to go shopping and to keep an appointment with her favorite hairdresser as usual when they had that kind of schedule she had taken a room for the afternoon at the hotel as he drove through providence lanes earlier good mood gradually dissipated the satisfaction he had felt after hearing from the van hillearys had dissolved and in its place there resounded in his mind a warning not unlike the beeping caused by a failing battery in a smoke detector something was wrong but he wasnt clear as yet just what it was the mental alarm had started just as he was leaving the residence when sarah bainbridge cushing called to say she was on her way in to visit her mother again she had informed him that letitia bainbridge had phoned shortly after lunch to say that she wasnt feeling well and that she had become terribly nervous because nurse markey was darting in and out of her room without knocking he had warned markey about that very thing after greta shipley complained last week what was she up to dr lane fumed well he wouldnt warn her again no he would call prestige and tell them to get rid of her by the time he arrived at the ritz lane was thoroughly on edge when he got up to his wifes room the sight of odile in a frilly robe just beginning to put on her makeup annoyed him intensely surely she cant have been shopping all this time he thought with growing irritation hi darling she said with a smile looking up girlishly as he closed the door and crossed to her how do you like my hair i let magda try something a little different not too many trailing tendrils i hope she shook her head playfully true odile had beautiful frosted blond hair but lane was tired of being trapped into admiring it it looks all right he said irritation apparent in his voice only all right she asked her eyes wide her eyelids fluttering look odile i have a headache i shouldnt have to remind you that ive had a rough few weeks at the residence i know you have dear look why dont you lie down for a while while i finish painting the lily that was another coy trick of odiles that drove him wild the use of paint the lily when most people said gild the lily instead she loved it when someone tried to correct her when they did she was only too happy to point out that the line was often misquoted that shakespeare actually had written to gild refined gold to paint the lily the wouldbe intellectual lane thought his teeth on edge he glanced at his watch look odile that party starts in ten minutes dont you think youd better get a move on oh william nobody gets to a cocktail party the minute it starts she said again using her littlegirl voice why are you so cross with me i know youre terribly worried about something but please share it with me ill try to help ive helped you before havent i she looked to be on the verge of tears of course you have dr lane said relenting now his voice softer then he paid her the compliment he knew would appease her youre a beautiful woman odile he tried to sound affectionate even before you paint the lily youre beautiful you could walk into that party right now and outshine every woman there then as she began to smile he added but youre right i am worried mrs bainbridge wasnt feeling well this afternoon and id be a lot more comfortable if i were around just in case there were to be an emergency so oh she sighed knowing what was coming but how disappointing i was looking forward to seeing everybody here tonight and to spending time with them i love our guests but we do seem to give our whole lives to them it was the reaction he had hoped to receive im not going to let you be disappointed he said firmly you stay and enjoy yourself in fact keep the room overnight and come back tomorrow i dont want you driving home at night unless im following you if youre sure im sure ill just make an appearance at the party now and head back you can say hello for me to anyone who asks the warning beep in his head had become a keening siren he wanted to bolt but he paused to kiss her goodbye she took his face between her hands oh darling i hope nothing happens to mrs bainbridge at least not for a long while she is very old of course and cant be expected to live forever but shes such a dear if you suspect anything is seriously wrong please call her own doctor in immediately i wouldnt want you to have to sign yet another death certificate for one of our ladies so soon after the last one remember all the trouble at the last residence he took her hands from his face and held them he wanted to strangle her when maggie got back to the house she stood for long minutes on the porch breathing in deeply inhaling the fresh clean salt scent of the ocean it seemed to her that after the museum visit the smell of death was in her nostrils earl bateman enjoyed death she thought feeling a shiver of repulsion run up her spine he enjoyed talking about it recreating it liam had told her that earl had relished describing how frightened the latham residents had been when he had made them handle the bells she could certainly understand their fright although earls version of the incident was that it had upset him so much he had packed away the bells in the thirdfloor storeroom maybe it was a little bit of both she thought he might have enjoyed terrifying them but he certainly had been furious when he was sent packing she thought he had seemed so anxious to show her everything in that strange museum so why hadnt he offered to show the bells to her as well she wondered surely it couldnt have been just because of painful memories over what had happened to him at latham manor so was it because he had hidden them on the graves of women from the residencewomen who might have been in the audience the night of that lecture another thought struck her had nuala attended that lecture maggie realized that she was hugging her arms tight against her body and practically shivering as she turned to go in the house she took the note she had left for chief brower off the door once inside the first thing she saw was the framed picture earl had brought her she picked it up oh nuala she said aloud finnuala she studied the photo for a minute it would be possible to crop it to show nuala alone and she could have it enlarged when she had started the sculpture of nuala she had collected the most recent pictures she could find of her around the house none were as recent as this though it would be a wonderful help in the final stages of creating the bust she would take it upstairs now she decided chief brower had said he would stop by this afternoon but it was already a little after five she decided to go ahead and do a little work on the sculpture but on the way up to the studio maggie remembered that chief brower had said he would phone before he came she wouldnt hear the phone in the studio i know maggie thought as she passed the bedroom this would be a good time to clean out the rest of nualas things from the closet floor ill just take the picture to the studio and come back in the studio she took the photograph out of the frame and carefully tacked it to the bulletin board by the refectory table then she switched on the spotlight and examined the picture closely the photographer must have told them to smile she thought smiling had come naturally to nuala if theres anything wrong with this picture its that it isnt enough of a closeup to show what i saw in her eyes that night at dinner standing next to nuala earl bateman looked uncomfortable ill at ease his smile definitely forced still she thought there was nothing about him that suggested the frightening obsessiveness she had witnessed this afternoon she remembered liam saying once that a crazy streak ran in the family she had taken his remark as a joke at the time but now she wasnt so sure liam probably never took a bad photograph in his life she thought as she continued to study the picture theres a strong family resemblance between the cousins mostly the facial structure but what looks peculiar on earl looks good on liam i was so lucky liam brought me to that party and so lucky i spotted nuala she mused as she turned away and started down the stairs she remembered how it almost hadnt happened how she had decided to go home because liam was so preoccupied racing from one group of cousins to the next she had definitely felt neglected that evening hes certainly changed his tune since i arrived up here though she thought how much should i tell chief brower when he comes she asked herself even if earl bateman put those bells on the graves theres nothing inherently illegal about that but why would he lie about the bells being in the storeroom she went into the bedroom and opened the closet door the only two items that remained hanging there were the blue cocktail suit nuala had worn that night at the four seasons and the pale gold raincoat that she had rehung in the closet when neil and his father moved the bed every inch of the closet floor however was covered with shoes and slippers and boots mostly in disarray maggie sat on the floor and began the job of sorting them out some of the shoes were quite worn and those she tossed behind her to discard but others like the pair she thought she remembered nuala wearing at the party were both new and fairly expensive true nuala wasnt a neatnik but surely she never would have tossed new shoes around like that maggie decided then she caught her breath she knew the bureau drawers had been ransacked by the intruder who killed nuala but had he even taken the time to rummage through her shoes the telephone rang and she jumped chief brower she thought and realized she would not be at all sorry to see him instead of brower however it was detective jim haggerty calling to say that the chief would like to postpone the meeting until first thing in the morning lara horgan the state medical examiner wants to come with him and they both are out on emergencies right now thats all right maggie said ill be here in the morning then remembering that she had felt comfortable with detective haggerty when he had stopped by to see her she decided to ask him about earl bateman detective haggerty she said this afternoon earl bateman invited me to see his museum she chose her words carefully its such an unusual hobby ive been there haggerty said quite a place i guess its not really an unusual hobby for earl though when you consider hes from a fourthgeneration funeral family his father was mighty disappointed he didnt go into the business but you could say that in his own way he has he chuckled i guess so again maggie spoke slowly measuring what she was about to say i know his lectures are very successful but i gather that there was one unfortunate incident at latham manor do you know about that cant say as i do but if i were the age of those folks i wouldnt want to hear about funerals would you no i wouldnt ive never gone to one of his lectures myself haggerty continued then lowered his voice im not one to gossip but folks around here thought that museum idea was crazy but heck the batemans could buy and sell most of the moores earl may not look it or sound it but hes got serious money in his own right came to him from his fathers side i see the moore clan call him cousin weirdo but i say most of its because theyre jealous maggie thought of earl as she had seen him today staring past her at the spot where nualas body had been lying frenetically charged as he dragged her from exhibit to exhibit sitting in the hearse his eyes staring intently after her or maybe its because they know him too well she said thanks for calling detective haggerty she hung up grateful that she had made the decision not to talk about the bells she was sure haggerty would have laughingly ascribed their ghoulish appearance on the graves to another eccentricity of a rich man maggie went back to the job of sorting out the shoes this time she decided that the simplest thing to do was to bundle most of them in garbage bags worn shoes in a small narrow size certainly wouldnt be much use to anyone else the furlined boots however were worth saving the left one was lying on its side the right one standing she picked up the left one and put it beside her then reached for the other as maggie lifted it she heard a single muffled clang coming from the interior of the boot oh god no even before she forced herself to put her hand down into the furry interior she knew what she would find her fingers closed over cool metal and as she withdrew the object she was certain that she had found the thing nualas killer had been seeking the missing bell nuala took this from mrs rhinelanders grave she thought her mind working with a steadiness independent of her shaking hands she stared at it it was the exact twin of the bell she had taken from nualas grave streaks of dry dirt clung to the rim other tiny particles of soft earth crumbled loose on her fingers maggie remembered that there had been dirt in the pocket of the gold raincoat and she recalled that when she rehung the cocktail suit the other day she had had the impression of something falling nuala was wearing her raincoat when she took this bell off mrs rhinelanders grave she thought it must have frightened her she left it in her pocket for a reason did she find it the day she changed her will maggie wondered the day before she died did it in some way validate suspicions nuala was beginning to have about the residence earl claimed that the bells he had cast were in the storeroom of the museum if the twelve he had were still there someone else might have been placing others on the graves she reasoned maggie knew that earl had gone back to providence and that the key to the museum was under the planter on the porch even if she told the police about the bells they would have no legal right to go into the museum and look for the twelve earl said were there assuming they took her seriously which they probably wouldnt but he did invite me to let myself into the museum at any time to try to come up with visuals for his cable programs maggie thought ill take my camera with me that will give me an excuse for being there if anyone happens to see me but i dont want anyone to see me she told herself ill wait until its dark then ill drive over there theres only one way to find out for sure ill look in the storeroom for the box with the bells im sure i wont find more than six of them and if thats all i find ill know hes a liar ill take pictures so i can compare them with the bells on the graves and the two i have then tomorrow when chief brower comes ill give him the roll of film she decided and ill tell him that i think earl bateman has found a way to take revenge on the residents of latham manor and hes doing it with the help of nurse zelda markey revenge maggie froze with the realization of what she was considering yes placing the bells on the graves of women who had been party to his humiliation would be a form of revenge but would that have been enough for earl or could he possibly somehow have been involved with their deaths as well and that nurse zelda markeyclearly she was tied to earl somehow could she be his accomplice although it was well past his normal dinnertime chief brower was still at the station it had been a hectic and senselessly tragic afternoon involving two terrible incidents a carful of teenagers out for a joyride had plowed into an elderly couple and they were now in critical condition then an angry husband had violated a restraining order and shot his wife from whom he was separated at least we know the wife will make it brower told haggerty and thank god shes got three kids haggerty nodded whereve you been brower asked sourly lara horgans waiting to hear what time maggie holloway can see us tomorrow morning she told me shell be home all morning haggerty said but wait a minute before you call dr horgan i want to tell you first about a little visit i paid to sarah cushing her mother mrs bainbridge lives at latham manor when i was a kid i was in a boy scout troop with sarah cushings son got to know her real well nice lady very impressive very smart brower knew there was no use rushing haggerty when he got into one of these accounts besides he looked especially pleased with himself to speed things along the chief asked the expected question so what made you go see her something maggie holloway said when i phoned her for you she mentioned earl bateman i tell you chief that young lady has a real nose for trouble anyhow we nattered a little like youre doing right now brower thought and i got the distinct impression that ms holloway is very nervous about bateman maybe even afraid of him of bateman hes harmless brower snapped now thats exactly what i would have thought but maybe maggie holloway has a sharp eye when it comes to detecting what makes people tick she is a photographer you know anyhow she mentioned a little problem that bateman had at latham manor a little incident that took place not all that long ago and i called one of my friends whose cousin is a maid there and one thing led to the other and she finally told me about a lecture bateman gave there one afternoon that even caused one of the old girls to pass out and she told me also how sarah cushing happened to be there and that she gave bateman hell haggerty saw the chiefs mouth tighten his signal that it was time to come to the point so thats why i went to see mrs cushing and she told me that the reason she hustled bateman out was for upsetting the guests with his lecture about people worrying about being buried alive and then handing out replicas of the bells they used to put on graves in victorian times seems there would be a string or wire attached to the bell and the other end was then tied to the finger of the deceased the string ran through an air vent from the casket to the surface of the ground that way if you woke up in the coffin you could wiggle your finger the bell would ring on top of the grave and the guy who was paid to listen for it would start digging bateman told the ladies to slip their ring finger into the loop at the end of the string to pretend theyd been buried alive and then to start ringing the bells youre kidding no im not chief thats when all hell broke loose apparently one eightyyearold whos claustrophobic started screaming and fainted mrs cushing said she grabbed the bells broke up the lecture and all but threw bateman out the door then she made it her business to find out who had suggested he lecture there haggerty paused just an instant for effect that person was nurse zelda markey the lady who apparently has a habit of sneaking in and out of rooms sarah cushing heard through the grapevine that markey took care of batemans aunt in a nursing home years ago and got real close to the family she heard also that the batemans were mighty generous in rewarding her for taking special care of old auntie he shook his head women do have a way of finding out things dont they chief you know how theres a question now that there just might be a little problem about all those ladies dying in their sleep over at the home mrs cushing remembers that at least some of them were at that lecture and shes not sure but she thinks all of them who have died recently might have been there before haggerty even finished brower was on the phone to coroner lara horgan at the conclusion of his conversation with her he turned to the detective lara is going to initiate proceedings to have the bodies of both mrs shipley and mrs rhinelander the two people who died most recently at latham manor exhumed and thats just for starters neil checked his watch at eight oclock he was passing the mystic seaport exit on route another hour and he would be in newport he thought he had considered calling maggie again but decided against it not wanting to give her a chance to tell him she didnt want to see him tonight if shes not there ill just park in front of her house until she comes back he told himself he was angry that he hadnt gotten away earlier and as if it wasnt bad enough to hit all the commuter traffic along the way then he had been stymied by that damned jackknifed semitrailer that brought north to a standstill for over an hour it hadnt been all wasted time though he had finally had an opportunity to think through what it was that had nagged at him about his conversation with mrs arlington his fathers client who had lost just about all her money investing with hansen the confirmation of the purchase something about that had just not seemed right finally it had registered when he remembered that laura arlington said that she had just received the confirmation of her stock purchase those documents are mailed out right after the transaction so she should have received it days earlier neil said to himself then this morning he had learned that there was no record that mrs gebhart had owned the stock hansen claimed he bought for her at nine bucks a share today that stock was down to two dollars was hansens game to let people think they had bought a stock at one pricea stock he happened to know was on the skidsand then to wait to put the transaction through once it had reached a very low point that way hansen could pocket the difference accomplishing that would involve faking a confirmation of the order from the clearing house it wasnt simple but it wasnt impossible neil reflected so i actually may be onto what hansen is doing he thought as he finally passed the welcome to rhode island sign but what in hell made that crook bid on maggies house how does that relate to stealing money from gullible older ladies there must be something else in play there be home when i get there maggie neil implored silently youre setting too much in motion and i wont let you do it alone any longer at eightthirty maggie drove to earl batemans funeral museum before leaving she had taken the bell she found in nualas closet and compared it with the bell she had dug out of nualas grave both were now placed side by side on the refectory table in the studio an overhead spotlight shining on them almost as an afterthought she had pulled out the polaroid camera she used when she was setting up a shoot and had snapped a picture of the two bells lying together she hadnt waited to see the picture however but had pulled the print from the camera and tossed it on the table to study when she returned then with her equipment bag in hand heavy with two cameras and all the film and lenses she had headed out she hated the thought of going back into that place but there seemed to be no other way to get the answers she needed get it over with she told herself as she double locked the front door and got into the station wagon fifteen minutes later she was passing the bateman funeral home obviously the establishment had experienced a busy evening a stream of cars were pulling out of the driveway another funeral tomorrow well at least it isnt someone connected with latham manor maggie thought grimly as of yesterday at least all the residents were present and accounted for she turned right onto the quiet street where the funeral museum was located she drove into the parking lot grateful to see that the hearse was gone remembering that earl had said he was going to garage it as she approached the old house she was surprised to see faint light emerging from behind a curtained groundfloor window its probably on a timer and will go off later she thought but at least it will help me get my bearings she had brought a flashlight to use when inside however even though earl bateman had suggested she come back later on her own she didnt want to announce her presence by turning on more lights the key was under the planter where earl had left it as before it made a loud grating sound when she turned it in the oldfashioned lock and as in the earlier visit the first thing her eye encountered was the liveriedfootman mannequin although now his gaze seemed less attentive than hostile i really dont want to be here maggie thought as she darted for the stairs intent on avoiding even a glimpse of the room where the mannequin of a young woman was lying on the couch likewise she tried not to think about the exhibits on the second floor as she switched on the flashlight at the top of the first staircase keeping the beam pointed down she continued up the next flight still the memory of what she had seen there earlier haunted herthose two large end rooms one depicting an ancient roman aristocrats funeral the other the coffin room both were grisly but she found the sight of all those coffins in one room to be the most disturbing she had hoped the third floor here would be like nualas third levela studio surrounded by large closets and shelves unfortunately what she found instead was clearly another floor of rooms with dismay maggie remembered earl saying that originally the house had been his greatgreatgrandparents living quarters trying not to allow herself to be nervous maggie opened the first door in the cautiously low beam of the flashlight she could see that this was an exhibit in the making a wooden hutlike structure set atop two poles was off to one side god knows what it means she thought shuddering or what its for but at least the room was empty enough to tell that there was nothing else there she needed to look at the next two rooms were similar both seemed to contain partially completed deathritual scenes the last door proved to be the one she had been seeking it opened into a large storage room its walls covered with shelves that were crammed with boxes two racks of clothing ranging from ornate robes to virtual rags were blocking the windows heavy wooden crates all apparently sealed were piled randomly on top of each other where can i begin maggie thought a sense of helplessness overtaking her it would take her hours to go through everything and though she had been there only minutes already she was anxious to leave with a deep sigh she fought back the urge to bolt slipped the equipment bag from her shoulder and set it on the floor reluctantly she closed the door of the storeroom hoping to prevent any spill of light out into the hall and thus through the uncurtained window at the end of the passage all that clothing should be enough to make sure that nothing would show through the windows in the room she told herself still she felt herself shaking as she moved tentatively into the large room her mouth was dry every nerve in her body seemed to be quivering urging her to get out of this place there was a stepladder to her left obviously it was used to get at the top shelves she reasoned it looked old and heavy and it would mean taking even more time if she had to drag it around every few feet she decided to start her search in the shelves right behind the ladder and work her way around the room from there when she climbed up and looked down she found that there were neat labels pasted on the tops of all the boxes at least earl had identified everything she realized and for the first time she felt a glimmer of hope that this would not be as difficult a process as she had feared even so the cartons seemed to be arranged in no particular order some that were labeled death masks filled a whole section of shelves others were marked mourning raiment household livery torchère replicas drums brass cymbals ritual paints and so forthbut no bells its hopeless maggie thought ill never find them she had only moved the ladder twice and her watch told her that already she had been there more than half an hour she moved the ladder again hating the rasping screech it made on the floor once again she started to climb up it but as she put her foot on the third rung her glance fell on a deep cardboard box wedged between two others almost hidden behind them it was labeled bellsburied alive she grasped the box and tugged finally wrestling it loose almost losing her balance when it came free she got down from the ladder and placed the carton on the floor with frantic haste she squatted beside it and yanked off the lid brushing aside the loose popcorn packing she uncovered the first of the metal bells wrapped and sealed in plastic a covering that gave it a deceptively shiny appearance eagerly her fingers fished through the popcorn until she was sure that she had found everything in the box everything was six bells identical to the others she had found the packing slip was still inside the box victorian bells cast to the order of mr earl bateman it read twelveand now only six ill take shots of them and the packing slip and then i can get out of here maggie thought suddenly she was almost desperate to be safely away from this place outside with her proof that earl bateman was certainly a liar possibly even a murderer she wasnt sure what first made her realize that she was no longer alone had she actually heard the faint sound of the door opening or was it the narrow beam of light from another flashlight that had alerted her she spun around as he raised the flashlight heard him speaking as it crashed down on her head and then there was nothing but impressions of voices and movement and finally dreamless oblivion until she awoke to the terrible silent darkness of the grave neil arrived at maggies house well after nine oclock much later than he had wished intensely disappointed to see that her station wagon wasnt in the driveway he had a moment of hope when he noticed that one of the bright studio lights was on maybe her car was being serviced he told himself but when there was no answer to his insistent ringing of the doorbell he went back to his car to wait at midnight he finally gave up and drove to his parents house in portsmouth neil found his mother in the kitchen making hot cocoa for some reason i couldnt sleep she said neil knew that she had expected him to arrive hours earlier and he felt guilty for worrying her i should have called he said but then why didnt you try me on the car phone dolores stephens smiled because no thirtysevenyearold man wants his mother checking up on him just because hes late it occurred to me that you probably had stopped at maggies so i really wasnt that worried neil shook his head glumly i did stop at maggies she wasnt home i waited around till now dolores stephens studied her son did you eat any dinner she asked gently no but dont bother ignoring him she got up and opened the refrigerator she may have had a date she said her tone thoughtful she was in her own car its monday night neil said then paused mom im worried about her im going to phone every half hour until i know shes home despite protesting that he really wasnt hungry he ate the thick club sandwich his mother made for him at one oclock he tried maggies number his mother sat with him as he tried again at onethirty then at two at twothirty and again at three at threethirty his father joined them whats going on he asked his eyes heavy with sleep when he was told he snapped for goodness sake call the police and ask if any accidents have been reported the officer who answered assured neil that it had been a quiet night no accidents sir give him maggies description tell him what kind of car she drives leave your name and this phone number robert stephens said dolores youve been up all this time you get some sleep ill stay with neil well she began there may be a perfectly simple explanation her husband said gently when his wife was out of earshot he said your mother is very fond of maggie he looked at his son i know that you havent been seeing maggie for all that long a time but why does she seem indifferent to you sometimes even downright chilly why is that i dont know neil confessed shes always held back and i guess i have too but im positive theres something special going on between us he shook his head ive gone over and over it in my mind it certainly isnt just that i didnt call her in time to get her number before she came up here maggie isnt that trivial but i thought about it a lot driving up and ive come up with one thing that i can maybe pin it on he told his father about the time he saw maggie weeping in the theater during a film i didnt think i should intrude he said at the time i thought i should just give her space but now i wonder if maybe she knew i was there and perhaps resented the fact i didnt at least say something what would you have done ill tell you what id have done his father said immediately if id seen your mother in that situation id have been right beside her and id have put my arm around her maybe i wouldnt have said anything but id have let her know i was there he looked at neil severely id have done that whether or not i was in love with her on the other hand if i was trying to deny to myself that i loved her or if i was afraid of getting involved then maybe id have run away theres a famous biblical incident about washing the hands come on dad neil muttered and if i were maggie and i had sensed you were there and maybe had even wanted to be able to turn to you id have written you off if you walked out on me robert stephens concluded the telephone rang neil beat his father to grabbing the receiver it was a police officer sir we found the vehicle you described parked on marley road its an isolated area and there are no houses nearby so we dont have any witnesses as to when it was left there or by whom whether it was ms holloway or another person tuesday october th at eight oclock on tuesday morning malcolm norton walked downstairs from his bedroom and looked into the kitchen janice was already there seated at the table reading the paper and drinking coffee she made the unprecedented offer to pour him a cup then asked toast he hesitated then said why not and sat opposite her youre leaving pretty early arent you she asked he could see she was nervous no doubt she knew he was up to something you must have had a late dinner last night she continued as she placed the steaming cup in front of him ummmm he responded enjoying her unease he had known she was awake when he came in at midnight he took a few sips of the coffee then pushed his chair back on second thought ill skip the toast goodbye janice when he reached the office malcolm norton sat for a few minutes at barbaras desk he wished he could write a few lines to her something to remind her of what she had meant to him but it would be unfair he didnt want to drag her name into this he went into his own office and looked again at the copies he had made of the papers he had found in janices briefcase as well as the copy of her bank statement he could pretty much figure what she must have been up to he had guessed it the other night when he saw that crooked nephew of hers hand her an envelope in the restaurant he had followed her to seeing her financial records only confirmed what he had suspected she was giving doug hansen privileged financial information about applicants to latham manor so that he could try to cheat rich old women maybe attempt to defraud charges wouldnt stick against her but they certainly wouldnt help her in this town and of course she would lose her job good he thought hansen was the one who made a higher offer to maggie holloway he was sure of it and janice had tipped him off about the upcoming change in the law they probably planned to raise the ante until holloway sold if only maggie holloway hadnt come on the scene and spoiled it all he thought bitterly knowing he could make a killing on the house he would have found a way to keep barbara make a killing he smiled grimly that was rich of course none of that mattered anymore he would never buy the house he would never have barbara in his life he really had no more life it was over now but at least he had gotten even they would know that he wasnt the empty suit janice had sneered at for years he moved the manila envelope addressed to chief brower to the far corner of the desk he didnt want it to get stained he reached for the pistol he kept in the deep bottom drawer he took it out and held it for a moment studying it thoughtfully then he punched in the number of the police station and asked for chief brower its malcolm norton he said pleasantly as he picked up the gun in his right hand and held it to his head i think youd better get over here im about to kill myself as he pulled the trigger he heard the final single word dont maggie could feel the blood that matted the hair on the side of her head which was sensitive to the touch and still ached be calm she kept whispering to herself ive got to be calm where am i buried she wondered probably in some isolated spot in the woods where no one can possibly find me when she tugged the string on her ring finger she could feel a heavy pressure on the other end he must have attached the string to one of the victorian bells she reasoned she ran her index finger up inside the tube that the string was threaded through it felt like solid metal and seemed to be about an inch in diameter she should be able to get enough air through it for breathing she decided unless it became clogged but why had he bothered with all this she wondered she was sure there was no clapper in the bell because she would be able to hear at least some faint sound if there had been one that meant no one could hear her was she in a real cemetery if so was there a chance that people might visit or attend a funeral would she be able to hear even faintly the sound of cars plan maggie told herself youve got to plan she would keep tugging the string until her finger felt raw until her strength gave out if she was buried where someone might pass by then there was always the hope that the moving bell might attract attention she also would try to shout for help at what she calculated to be tenminute intervals there was no way of knowing of course if her voice actually carried up the tube but she had to try she mustnt wear out her voice too soon though and not be able to attract attention if she did hear sounds of someone nearby but would he come back she wondered he was insane she was sure of that if he heard her shouting he might cover the air vent and let her suffocate she had to be careful of course it might all be for naught she realized there was a strong likelihood that she was buried in a completely remote spot and that he was visualizing her clawing at the lid of the casket and yanking on the string the way some victorians reportedly had done when they realized they were buried alive only those people had someone waiting to hear their alarm wherever she was she was certain that she was completely alone at ten oclock neil and his father sat tensely in chief browers office and listened as he soberly revealed the contents of malcolm nortons suicide note norton was a bitter and disappointed man he said according to what hes written because of a change in environmental laws ms holloways property is going to be worth a lot of money when he made the offer to nuala moore to buy her house he obviously was prepared to cheat her by not telling her of its true value so its very possible that he got wind that she was changing her mind about making the sale to him and killed her he might well have been searching the house trying to find her revised will he paused to reread a paragraph of the lengthy note its very obvious that he blamed maggie holloway for everything having gone wrong and although he doesnt say it he may have taken revenge on her hes certainly managed to get his wife in serious trouble this cant be happening neil thought he felt his fathers hand on his shoulder and wanted to shake it off he was afraid that sympathy would undermine his resolve and he would not let that happen he wasnt going to give up maggie wasnt dead he was sure of that she couldnt be dead ive talked to mrs norton brower continued her husband came home at the usual time yesterday then left and didnt return until midnight this morning when she tried to find out where hed been he wouldnt answer how well did maggie know this guy norton robert ste phens asked what would make her agree to meet him do you think he might have forced her into her own car then driven to where you found it but then what did he do with maggie and since he left her car there how did he get home brower was shaking his head as stephens spoke its a very unlikely scenario i agree but its an angle we have to pursue were bringing in dogs to try to follow ms holloways scent so if she is in that area well find her but its a long way from nortons home hed have to have acted in tandem with someone else or hed need to have gotten a ride home from a passerby and frankly both of those options seem unlikely this woman he was crazy about barbara hoffman is in colorado visiting her daughter we checked on her already shes been there since the weekend the intercom rang and brower picked up his phone put him on he said after a moment neil buried his face in his hands dont let them have found maggies body he silently pleaded browers conversation lasted only a minute when he got off he said in a way i think we have good news malcolm norton had dinner last night at the log cabin a small restaurant near where barbara hoffman lived apparently she and norton ate there together frequently the owner tells us that norton was there until well after eleven so he must have gone directly home which means neil thought he almost certainly had nothing to do with maggies disappearance where do you go from here robert stephens asked to interrogate the people ms holloway pointed us to brower said earl bateman and nurse zelda markey his intercom sounded again after listening without comment brower hung up his phone and stood i dont know what kind of game bateman is up to but he just phoned to report that last night a coffin was stolen from his funeral museum dr william lane realized that there was very little he could say to his wife this tuesday morning her stony silence indicated to him that even she could be driven too far if only she hadnt come home last night and found him like that he thought he hadnt had a drink in what seemed like ages not since the incident at the last place he worked lane knew that he owed this job to odile she had met the owners of prestige residence corporation at a cocktail party and had touted him for the directors job at latham which was then being renovated latham manor was to be one of prestiges franchised residences as opposed to fully owned and operated but they had agreed to meet with him and then later had submitted his résumé to the franchiser remarkably he got the job all thanks to odile as she constantly reminded him he thought bitterly he knew that the slipup last night was a sign the pressure was getting to him the orders to keep those apartments filled dont let them pass a month unsold always the implied threat of being let go if he didnt perform let go he thought go where after the last incident odile had told him that if she saw him drunk even once she was leaving as enticing as the prospect was he couldnt let that happen the truth was he needed her why hadnt she stayed in boston last night he thought because she suspected that he was panicking he reasoned she was right of course he had been in a state of terror ever since he learned that maggie holloway had been looking for a sketch nuala moore had made that showed nurse markey eavesdropping he should have found a way to get rid of that woman long ago but prestige had sent her and in most respects she was a good nurse certainly many of the residents valued her in fact he sometimes wondered if she wasnt too good a nurse she seemed to know more than he did about some things well whatever was going on between him and odile dr lane knew he had to go over to the residence and make his morning rounds he found his wife drinking coffee in the kitchen uncharacteristically she hadnt bothered to put on even a minimum of makeup this morning she looked drawn and tired zelda markey just phoned she told him an angry glint in her eye the police have asked her to be available for questioning she doesnt know why for questioning lane felt the tension run through his body gripping every muscle its all over he thought she also told me that sarah cushing gave strict orders that neither she nor you was to enter her mothers room it seems that mrs bainbridge isnt well and mrs cushing is making arrangements to transfer her immediately to the hospital odile looked at him accusingly you were supposed to be rushing home to see mrs bainbridge last night not that youd have been allowed anywhere near her but i hear you didnt show up at the residence till nearly eleven what were you doing until then neil and robert stephens drove to the remote road where maggies station wagon was still parked now it was surrounded with police tape and as they got out of their car they could hear the yapping of search dogs in the nearby woods neither man had spoken since they left the police station neil used the time to think through all he knew so far it amounted to very little he realized and the longer he felt in the dark the more frustrated he became it was good even essential to have the understanding presence of his father he realized something i didnt give to maggie he told himself bitterly through the heavy woods and thick foliage he could make out the figures of at least a dozen people policemen or volunteers he wondered he knew they had found nothing so far so the search had spread out over a wider area in despair he realized that they were expecting to find maggies body he shoved his hands into his pockets and bowed his head finally he broke the silence she cant be dead he said id know it if she were dead neil lets go his father said quietly i dont even know why we came out here standing around here isnt helping maggie what do you suggest i do neil asked anger and frustration showing in his voice from what chief brower said the police havent spoken to this guy hansen yet but they found out hes expected at his office in providence around noon at this point they consider him small potatoes theyll turn over the fraud information norton left with his note to the district attorney but it wouldnt hurt for us to be at hansens office when he comes in dad you cant expect me to worry about stock deals now neil said angrily no and at this moment im not worried about them either but you did authorize the sale of fifty thousand shares of stock that cora gebhart didnt own you certainly have a right to go to hansens office and demand some answers robert stephens urged he looked into his sons face dont you see what im driving at something made maggie mighty uneasy about hansen i dont think its just a coincidence that hes the guy who fronted an offer on her house you can get him on the defensive about the stocks but the real reason i want to see him right away is to try and find out if he knows anything at all about maggies disappearance when neil continued to shake his head robert stephens pointed to the woods if you believe maggies body is lying out there somewhere then go join the search i happen to hopeto believethat shes still alive and if she is i bet her abductor didnt leave her in the vicinity of the car he turned to leave get a ride from someone else im going to providence to see hansen he got into the car and slammed the door as he was turning the ignition key neil jumped in on the passenger side youre right he admitted i dont know where well find her but it wont be here at earl bateman was waiting for chief brower and detective haggerty on the porch of his funeral museum the casket was here yesterday afternoon bateman said heatedly i know because i gave a tour of the place and i remember pointing it out i cant believe anyone would have the insolence to desecrate an important collection like this just as a prank every single object in my museum was purchased only after meticulous research halloween is coming he continued as he nervously thumped his right hand on his left palm im positive a bunch of kids pulled this stunt and i can tell you right now that if thats what happened i will press charges no boyish prank excuses do you understand professor bateman why dont we go inside and talk about it brower said of course actually i may have a picture of the casket in my office its an item of particular interest and in fact ive been planning to make it the focal point of a new exhibit when i expand the museum come this way the two policemen followed him through the foyer past the lifesized figure dressed in black to what obviously had been the kitchen a sink refrigerator and stove still lined the far wall legalsize files were under the back windows an immense oldfashioned desk stood in the center of the room its surface covered with blueprints and sketches im planning an outdoor exhibit bateman told them i have some property nearby that will make a wonderful site go ahead sit down ill try to find that picture hes awfully worked up jim haggerty thought i wonder if he was this agitated when they threw him out of latham manor that time maybe he isnt the harmless weirdo i pegged him for why dont we just ask you a few questions before you look for the picture brower suggested oh all right bateman yanked out the desk chair and sat down haggerty took out his notebook was anything else taken professor bateman brower asked no nothing else seems to have been disturbed thank god the place wasnt vandalized you should realize that this could have been done by someone working alone because the catafalque is missing too and it would have been no trouble to wheel the casket out where was the casket located on the second floor but i have an elevator for moving heavy objects up and down the telephone rang oh excuse me that will probably be my cousin liam he was in a meeting when i called to tell him what happened i thought hed be interested bateman picked up the receiver hello he said then listened nodding to indicate that it was the call he had been expecting brower and haggerty listened to the onesided conversation as bateman informed his cousin of the theft a very valuable antique he said excitedly a victorian coffin i paid ten thousand dollars for it and that was a bargain this one has the original breathing tube with it and was he stopped suddenly as though interrupted then in a shocked voice he cried what do you mean maggie holloway is missing thats impossible when he hung up he seemed dazed this is terrible how could something happen to maggie oh i just knew it i knew she wasnt safe i had a premonition liam is very upset they are very close you know he called from his car phone he said he just heard about maggie on the news and hes on his way down from boston then bateman frowned you knew maggie was missing he asked brower accusingly yes brower said shortly and we also know she was here with you yesterday afternoon well yes id brought her a picture of nuala moore taken at a recent family reunion and she was very appreciative because shes such a successful photographer i asked her to help me by suggesting visuals for the television series im going to do about funeral customs thats why she came to see the exhibits he explained earnestly she looked over just about everything he went on i was disappointed that she hadnt brought her camera so when she left i told her to come back on her own at any time i showed her where i hide the key that was yesterday afternoon brower said did she come back here last night i dont think so why would she come here at night most women wouldnt he looked upset i hope nothing bad has happened to maggie shes a nice woman and very attractive ive been quite drawn to her in fact he shook his head then added no i think its a safe bet that she didnt steal the casket why when i showed her the place yesterday she wouldnt even set foot in the coffin room is that supposed to be a joke haggerty wondered this guy had that explanation right on tap he noted ten to one hed already heard about maggie holloways disappearance bateman got up ill go look for the picture not yet brower said first id like to talk to you about a little problem you had when you gave a lecture at latham manor i heard something about victorian cemetery bells and your being asked to leave bateman angrily slammed his fist on the desk i dont wantto talk about that whats the matter with all of you only yesterday i had to tell maggie holloway the same thing those bells are locked in my storeroom and there theyll stay i wont talkabout it got it his face was white with anger the weather was changing becoming sharply cooler the morning sun had given way to clouds and by eleven the sky was bleak and gray neil and his father sat on the two upright wooden chairs that along with a secretarys desk and chair were the sole furnishings in the reception area of douglas hansens office the one employee was a laconic young woman of about twenty who disinterestedly informed them that mr hansen had been out of the office since thursday afternoon and that all she knew was that he had said he would be in by about ten today the door leading to the inside office was open and they could see that that room appeared to be as sparsely furnished as the reception area a desk chair filing cabinet and small computer were all they could see in it doesnt exactly look like a thriving brokerage firm robert stephens said in fact id say it looks like more of a setting for a floating crap gameset up so you can get out of town fast if someone blows the whistle neil found it agonizing to have to simply sit there doing nothing where is maggie he kept asking himself shes alive shes alive he repeated with determination and im going to find her he tried to concentrate on what his father was saying then replied i doubt he shows this place to his potential clients he doesnt robert stephens answered he takes them to fancy lunches and dinners from what cora gebhart and laura arlington told me he can put on the charm although they both said he sounded very knowledgeable about investments then hes taken a crash course somewhere our security guy who ran the check on him told me that hansens been fired from two brokerage houses for just plain ineptitude both men spun their heads sharply as the outer door opened they were just in time to catch the startled expression on douglas hansens face when he saw them he thinks were cops neil realized he must already have heard about his uncles suicide they stood up robert stephens spoke first i represent mrs cora gebhart and mrs laura arlington he said formally as their accountant im here to discuss the recent investments you purport to have made for them and im here to represent maggie holloway neil said angrily where were you last night and what do you know about her disappearance maggie began to shiver uncontrollably how long had she been here she wondered had she drifted off to sleep or lost consciousness her head hurt so much her mouth was dry with thirst how long was it since she last called for help was anyone looking for her did anyone even know that she was missing neil he said he would call tonight no last night she thought trying to make sense of time i was in the museum at nine oclock she reminded herself i know ive been here for hours is it morning now or even later than that neil would call her or would he she had rejected his expressions of concern maybe he wouldnt call she had been cold to him maybe he had washed his hands of her no no she prayed neil wouldnt do that neil would look for her find me neil please find me she whispered then blinked back tears his face loomed in her mind troubled concerned worried about her if only she had told him about the bells on the graves if only she had asked him to go with her to the museum the museum she thought suddenly the voice behind her mentally she replayed what had happened in the attack she turned and saw the look on his face before he crashed the flashlight down on her head evil murderous as he must have looked when he murdered nuala wheels she hadnt been totally unconscious when she felt herself being wheeled a womans voice she had heard a familiar womans voice talking to him maggie moaned as she remembered whose voice it was ive got to get out of here she thought i cant die knowing this i mustnt die shell do it again for him i know she will help she shrieked help me over and over she called until she finally was able to force herself to stop dont panic she warned herself above all dont panic ill count to five hundred very slowly and then call out three times she decided ill keep doing that she heard a steady muffled sound from above then felt a cold trickle on her hand it was raining she realized and the rain was dripping down through the air vent at eleventhirty chief brower and detective haggerty entered latham manor it was obvious that the residents knew that something was wrong they were standing in small groups in the entrance hall and library the officers were aware of the curious gazes that followed them when the maid led them to the office wing dr lane greeted them courteously come right in im at your service he indicated they should be seated he looks like hell haggerty thought taking in the bloodshot eyes the gray lines around the doctors mouth and the beads of perspiration on his forehead dr lane at this point were simply asking some questions nothing more brower began nothing more than what lane asked attempting a smile doctor before you took this position youd been unemployed for several years why was that lane was silent for a moment then said quietly i suspect you already know the answer to that wed prefer to hear your version haggerty told him my version as you put it is that wed had an outbreak of flu in the colony nursing home where i was in charge four of the women had to be transferred to the hospital therefore when others came down with flulike symptoms i naturally assumed that theyd caught the same virus but they hadnt brower said quietly in fact in their section of the nursing home there was a faulty heater they were suffering the effects of carbon monoxide poisoning three of them died isnt that true lane kept his eyes averted and did not answer and isnt it true that the son of one of those women had told you that his mothers disorientation did not seem consistent with flu symptoms and even asked you to check for the possible presence of carbon monoxide again lane did not answer your license was suspended for gross negligence and yet you were able to secure this position how did that happen brower asked lanes mouth became a straight line because the people at prestige residence corporation were fair enough to recognize that i had been the director of an overly crowded lowbudget facility that i was working fifteen hours a day that a number of the guests were suffering from flu and the misdiagnosis therefore was understandable and that the man who complained was constantly finding fault with everything from the hot water temperature to doors that squeaked to drafty windows he stood up i find these questions insulting i suggest that you leave these premises immediately as it is you have thoroughly upset our guests someone apparently felt the need to inform everyone that you were coming here that would be nurse markey brower said please tell me where i can find her zelda markey was openly defiant as she sat across from brower and haggerty in the small secondfloor room that served as her office her sharpfeatured face was an angry red her eyes cold with rage my patients need me she said tartly theyre aware that janice nortons husband committed suicide and theyve heard a rumor that shes been doing something illegal here theyre even more distressed to learn that miss holloway is missing everyone who met her was very fond of her were you fond of her ms markey brower asked i did not know her well enough to become fond of her the few times i spoke with her i found her very pleasant ms markey youre a friend of earl batemans arent you brower asked to me friendship implies familiarity i know and admire professor bateman he like all the family were very solicitous of his aunt alicia bateman who was a guest at the seaside nursing home where i was formerly employed in fact the batemans were quite generous to you werent they they felt that i was taking excellent care of alicia and were kind enough to insist on rewarding me i see id like to know why you thought a lecture on death might be of interest to the residents of latham manor dont you think theyll all be facing it soon enough chief brower i am aware that this society has a horror of the word death but the older generation has a much greater sense of reality at least half of our residents have left specific instructions for their own final arrangements and indeed frequently even joke about it she hesitated however i will say that it was my understanding that professor bateman was planning to give his talk on royal funerals through the ages which of course is quite an interesting subject if he had stuck to that she paused for a moment then continued and i will admit also that the use of the bells upset some people but the way mrs sarah cushing treated professor bateman was unpardonable he meant no harm yet she treated him inhumanly do you think he was very angry brower asked mildly i think he was humiliated then perhaps angry yes when hes not lecturing hes actually very shy haggerty looked up from his notes an unmistakable softness had come into the nurses tone and expression interesting he thought he was sure brower had noticed as well friendshipimplies familiarity methinks the lady doth protest too much he decided nurse markey what do you know about a sketch that mrs nuala moore made with the late mrs greta shipley absolutely nothing she snapped it was in mrs shipleys apartment it seems to have vanished after her death that is absolutely impossible the room or apartment is locked immediately everyone knows that uhhuh browers tone became confidential nurse markey just between us what do you think about dr lane she looked at him sharply then paused before speaking im at the point where even if it means hurting someone im very fond of im willing to lose another job by speaking my mind i wouldnt let dr lane treat my cat hes probably the stupidest physician i have ever dealt with and believe me ive dealt with my share of them she stood up i also have had the honor of working with magnificent doctors which is why i cannot understand how the prestige people chose dr lane to run this establishment and before you ask that is the reason i check so frequently on residents about whom i am concerned i dont think he is capable of giving them the care they need im aware that sometimes they may resent it but i am only doing it for their own good neil and robert stephens drove directly to newport police headquarters damn good thing you got that restraining order in yesterday robert said to his son that guy was ready to skip at least this way with his bank account tied up we stand a chance at getting coras money back or some of it anyhow but he doesnt know what happened to maggie neil said bitterly no i guess he doesnt you cant be an usher at a five oclock wedding in new york offer dozens of names of people who will state that you stayed for the entire reception and be up here at the same time he had a lot more to say about his alibi than he did about his stock dealings neil said dad that guy has nothing in that office to indicate that hes dealing in securities did you see one financial statement one prospectus or anything like what you see in my office no i did not trust me hes not really working out of that dump those transactions are coming out of another place and one thats probably pulling this same sort of swindle neil paused looking grimly out the car window god this weather is lousy its getting cold and its pouring where is maggie he thought is she out in this somewhere is she scared is she dead once again neil rejected the thought she couldnt be dead it was as if he could hear her calling to him to help her they arrived at the police station to find that chief brower was out but detective haggerty saw them theres nothing helpful to report he said candidly to their urgent queries about maggie no one remembers seeing that volvo station wagon in town last night weve gotten in touch with ms holloways neighbors here when they passed her house on the way to dinner at seven oclock her car was in her driveway it was gone when they returned at ninethirty so we have to assume that she left somewhere in that twoandahalfhour time frame thats all you can tell us neil asked his tone incredulous my god theres got to be something more than that i wish there were we know that she went over to that funeral museum monday afternoon we spoke to her before she left and after she returned funeral museum neil said that doesnt sound like maggie what was she doing there according to professor bateman she was helping him select visuals for some television series hell be doing haggerty responded you said according to professor bateman robert stephens said sharply did i well i mean we have no reason to doubt the professor he may be a bit eccentric but he grew up here people know him and hes got no record of any trouble he hesitated ill be totally honest with you ms holloway seemed to indicate that there was something about him that bothered her and when we checked we did learn that while nothing involving the police was in his history he was responsible for a stir one afternoon among a number of the residents at the latham manor retirement home seems like they ended up throwing him out of the place latham manor again neil thought bateman also volunteered that maggie knew where the key to the museum was hidden and that he had invited her to come back with her camera at any time do you think she actually went there last night alone neil asked incredulously i wouldnt think so no the fact is there seems to have been a robbery at the museum last nightif you can believe it a coffin is missing what we are doing is interrogating some teenage kids from the general neighborhood who have given us trouble before we think theyre probably responsible we think they may also be able to give us some information about ms holloway if she had gone into the museum and they saw her car parked there ive gotta believe they would have made sure she was gone before they went in themselves neil stood to leave he had to get out of there he had to be doing something besides he knew that there was nothing more he could learn here but he could go back to latham manor and maybe find out something his excuse would be that he wanted to talk to the director about the van hillearys possible application ill check in with you later he told haggerty im going over to latham manor and try to talk to some of the people there you never know who might have some bit of information that could be of help and i have a good excuse for visiting i was by there on friday to inquire about the facilities on behalf of a couple who are my investment clients and ive just come up with a few more questions haggerty raised his eyebrows youll probably find out that we were there a little while ago why robert stephens asked quickly we spoke to the director and to one of the nurses there a zelda markey who it seems is a close friend of professor batemans i cant say more than that dad whats your carphone number neil asked robert stephens took out a business card and scribbled the number on the back here neil handed the card to haggerty if there are any developments try us at this number and well be calling in to you every hour or so thats fine ms holloways a close friend isnt she shes more than that robert stephens said brusquely consider us her family as you wish haggerty said simply i do understand he looked at neil if my wife were missing id be going through the same kind of hell ive met ms holloway shes real smart and i believe very resourceful if theres any way she can help herself trust her to do it the look of genuine sympathy on haggertys face brought neil to an acute awareness of just how close he might be to losing someone who surprisingly he now couldnt imagine living without he swallowed over the sudden lump in his throat not trusting himself to speak he nodded and left in the car he said dad why do i feel that latham manor is at the center of all this maggie youre not calling for help are you that isnt wise oh god no he was back his voice hollow and echoing was barely discernible through the rain beating on the earth above her you must be getting wet down there he called im glad i want you to be cold and wet and scared ill bet youre hungry too or maybe just thirsty dont answer she told herself dont plead with him its what he wants you ruined everything for me maggie you and nuala she had begun to suspect something so she had to die and it was all going so well too latham manori own it you know only the outfit that manages it doesnt know who i am i have a holding company and you were right about the bells those women werent buried alive maybe just a little bit sooner than god intended they should have had more time thats why i put the bells on the graves its my little joke youre the only one who really is buried alive when they exhume those women theyll blame dr lane for their deaths theyll think it was his fault that the medicines got mixed hes a lousy doctor anyway with a terrible record and a drinking problem thats why i had them hire him but your stupid interference does mean i wont be able to call on my little angel of death to help the little ladies along to an early grave and thats too bad i want the money do you know how much profit there is in turning over those rooms lots lots maggie shut her eyes struggling to blot out his face from her mind it was almost as though she could see him he was crazy i guess you figured out that the bell on your grave has no clapper havent you now figure this out how long will you last when the air vent is clogged she felt a rush of dirt on her hand frantically she tried to poke open the vent with her finger more dirt tumbled down oh one more thing maggie he said his voice suddenly more muffled i took the bells from the other graves i thought that was a good idea ill put them back when they bury the bodies again sweet dreams she heard the thump of something hitting the air vent then she heard nothing he was gone she was sure of it the vent was packed she did the only thing she could think of to help herself she flexed and unflexed her left hand so that the string on her ring finger would keep the mud from hardening around it please god she prayed let someone see that the bell is moving how long would it be before she used up all the oxygen she wondered hours a day neil help me help me she whispered i need you i love you i dont want to die letitia bainbridge had absolutely refused to go to the hospital you can cancel that ambulance or ride in it yourself she tartly informed her daughter but im not going anywhere but mother youre not well sarah cushing protested knowing full well that to argue with her was useless when her mother got a certain mulelike look there was no point in further discussion whos well at ninetyfour mrs bainbridge asked sarah i appreciate your concern but theres a lot going on around here and i dont intend to miss it will you at least take your meals on a tray not dinner you do realize dr evans checked me out just a few days ago theres nothing wrong with me that being fifty wouldnt cure sarah cushing gave up the argument reluctantly very well but youve got to promise me one thing if you dont feel well youll let me take you to dr evans again i dont want dr lane treating you neither do i sneak that she is nurse markey did see a change in greta shipley last week and tried to get lane to do something about it he of course couldnt find anything he was wrong and she was right does anyone know why the police were talking to her im not sure well find out she snapped then in a quieter tone she added im so worried about that wonderful girl maggie holloway so many young people today are so indifferent or impatient with old fossils like me not her were all praying that shell be found i know and so am i sarah cushing agreed all right go downstairs and find out the latest start with angela she doesnt miss a thing neil had called on the car phone to tell dr lane he would like to stop by to discuss the van hillearys interest in residing at latham manor he found lanes voice curiously indifferent when he agreed to a meeting they were admitted to latham manor by the same attractive young maid they had seen before neil remembered that her name was angela when they arrived she was talking to a handsome woman who appeared to be in her midsixties ill let dr lane know youre here angela said softly as she crossed the entrance hall to the intercom the older woman came over to them i dont want to seem inquisitive but are you from the police she asked no were not robert stephens said quickly why do you ask is there a problem no or at least i certainly hope not let me explain i am sarah cushing my mother letitia bainbridge is a resident here she has become very fond of a young woman named maggie holloway who seems to have gone missing and she is terribly anxious for any news about her were very fond of maggie too neil said once again experiencing the lump in his throat that now was threatening to undermine his composure i wonder if it would be possible to speak to your mother after we see dr lane noting a look of uncertainty in sarah cushings eyes he felt he had to explain were groping at straws to see if maggie may have said anything to anyone even casually that might help us to find her he bit his lip unable to go on sarah cushing studied him sensing his distress her frosty blue eyes softened absolutely you can see mother she said briskly ill wait in the library for you and take you up when youre ready the maid had returned dr lane is ready to see you she said for the second time neil and robert stephens followed her to lanes office neil reminded himself that as far as the doctor was concerned he was here to discuss the van hillearys he forced himself to remember the questions that he had intended to ask on their behalf was the residence owned and operated by prestige or was it franchised by them he would need proof of sufficient reserve capital was there any allowance for the van hillearys if they opted to decorate and refurbish the suite themselves both men were shocked when they reached dr lanes office the man seated at the desk was so radically changed that it was like seeing and talking to a different human being the suave smiling courteous director they had met last week was gone lane looked ill and defeated his skin was gray his eyes sunken listlessly he invited them to sit down then said i understand you have some questions ill be happy to answer them however a new director will be meeting your clients when they come up on the weekend hes been fired neil thought why he wondered he decided to plunge ahead look i dont know whats been going on here obviously and im not asking you to explain the reasons behind your departure he paused but i am aware that your bookkeeper had been giving out privileged financial information that was one of my concerns yes thats something that has just been brought to our attention im very sure it wont happen again in this establishment lane said i can sympathize neil continued in the investment business we unfortunately always seem to face the problem of insider trading he knew his father was looking at him curiously but he had to try to learn if that was the reason lane was being fired secretly he doubted it and suspected that it had something to do with the sudden deaths of some of the residents im aware of the problem lane said my wife worked in a securities firm in boston randolph and marshallbefore i took this position it would seem that dishonest people crop up everywhere ah well let me try to answer whatever questions you have latham manor is a wonderful residence and i can assure you that our guests are very happy here when they left fifteen minutes later robert stephens said neil that guy is scared stiff i know and its not just because of his job im wasting time he thought he had brought up maggies name and lanes only response was an expression of polite concern for her welfare dad maybe we should skip meeting with anyone here he said as they reached the entrance hall im going to break into maggies house to search it maybe theres something there that will give us some idea of where she was going last night sarah cushing was waiting for them however i phoned up to mother she wants very much to meet you neil was about to protest but saw his fathers warning glance robert stephens said neil why dont you pay a visit for a few minutes ill make some calls from the car i was about to tell you that i happened to keep an extra key to the new lock on maggies door in case she ever forgot hers i told her about it ill call your mother and have her meet us there with it and ill call detective haggerty too it would take his mother half an hour to get to maggies house neil calculated he nodded id like to meet your mother mrs cushing on the way up to letitia bainbridges room he decided to ask her about the lecture that earl bateman gave at latham manor the one that got him banished from the place bateman was thelast person to admit seeing maggie yesterday he reasoned shehadspoken to detective haggerty later but no one had reported seeing her had anyone thought about that neil wondered had anyone checked to confirm earl batemans story that he had gone directly to providence after he left the museum yesterday afternoon this is mothers apartment sarah cushing said she tapped waited for the invitation to enter then opened the door now fully dressed mrs letitia bainbridge was seated in a wing chair she waved neil in and pointed to the chair nearest her from what sarah tells me you seem to be maggies young man you must be so worried we all are how can we help having deduced that sarah cushing had to be nearly seventy neil realized that this brighteyed clearvoiced woman had to be around ninety or more she looked as if she missed nothing let her tell me something that will help he prayed mrs bainbridge i hope i wont upset you by being absolutely frank with you for reasons i dont understand as yet maggie had begun to be very suspicious about some of the recent deaths in this residence we know that only yesterday morning she looked up the obituaries of six different women five of whom had resided here and who died recently those five women died in their sleep unattended and none of them had close relatives dear god sarah cushings voice was shocked letitia bainbridge did not flinch are you talking about neglect or murder she asked i dont know neil said i just know that maggie started an investigation thats already leading to an order for the exhumation of at least two of the dead women and now shes disappeared and ive just learned that dr lane has been fired i just found out that too mother sarah cushing said but everyone thinks its because of the bookkeeper what about nurse markey mrs bainbridge asked her daughter is that why the police questioned her i mean because of the deaths nobody is sure but shes mighty upset and of course so is mrs lane i hear that the two of them are closeted in markeys office oh those two are always whispering together letitia bainbridge said dismissively i cant imagine what they have to say to each other markey may be terribly annoying but at least she has a brain the other one is as emptyheaded as they get this isnt getting me anywhere neil thought mrs bainbridge he said i can only stay a minute longer theres one other thing id like to ask you were you at the lecture professor bateman gave here the one that apparently caused such an uproar no mrs bainbridge shot a look at her daughter that was another day when sarah insisted i rest so i missed all the excitement but sarah was there i can assure you mother that you wouldnt have enjoyed being handed one of those bells and being told to pretend you were buried alive sarah cushing said spiritedly let me tell you exactly what happened mr stephens bateman has to be crazy neil thought as he listened to her version of the events i was so upset that i gave that man a real tonguelashing and nearly threw the box with those appalling bells after him sarah cushing continued at first he seemed embarrassed and contrite but then a look came over his face that almost frightened me i think he must have a fearful temper and of course nurse markey had the gall to defend him i spoke to her about it later and she was quite impudent she told me that professor bateman had been so upset that he said he now feared he wouldnt be able to stand the sight of the bells which apparently had cost him quite a bit of money im still sorry i wasnt there mrs bainbridge said and as far as nurse markey goes she continued reflectively in perfect fairness many of the residents here consider her an excellent nurse i just find her to be nosy and pushy and intrusive and i want her kept away from me whenever possible she paused then said mr stephens this may sound ridiculous but i think that whatever his faults and shortcomings dr lane is a very kind man and im a pretty good judge of character a halfhour later neil and his father drove to maggies house dolores stephens was already there she looked at her son and reached up and took his face between her hands were going to find her she said firmly unable to speak neil nodded wheres the key dolores robert stephens demanded right here the key fit the new lock on the back door and as they walked into the kitchen neil thought it all started right here when maggies stepmother was murdered the kitchen was neat there were no dishes in the sink he opened the dishwasher inside were a few cups and saucers along with three or four small plates i wonder if she had dinner out last night he said or made a sandwich his mother suggested she had opened the refrigerator and seen a supply of cold cuts she pointed to several knives in the utensils basket of the dishwasher theres no message pad near the phone robert stephens said we knew she was worried about something he snapped im so damn mad at myself i wish to god that when i came back here yesterday i had bullied her into staying with us the dining room and living room both were orderly neil studied the vase of roses on the coffee table wondering who had sent them probably liam payne he thought she mentioned him at dinner neil had only met payne a few times but he could have been the guy neil had glimpsed leaving maggies friday night upstairs the smallest bedroom contained the evidence of maggies packing up her stepmothers personal effects neatly tagged bags of clothing purses lingerie and shoes were piled there the bedroom she had used initially was the same as when they had fixed the window locks they went into the master bedroom looks to me as though maggie planned to stay in here last night robert stephens observed pointing to the freshly made bed without answering neil started upstairs to the studio the light that he had noticed last night when he parked outside waiting for maggie to come home was still on pointed toward a picture tacked to the bulletin board neil remembered that the picture had not been there sunday afternoon he started across the room then stopped a chill ran through his body on the refectory table in the glare of the spotlight he saw two metal bells as surely as he knew that night followed day he knew that these were two of the bells that earl bateman had used in his infamous lecture at latham manorthe bells that had been whisked away never to be seen again her hand ached and was covered with dirt she had continued to move the string steadily back and forth hoping to keep the tube open but now no more dirt seemed to be falling through the air vent the water had stopped trickling down too she couldnt hear the beating of the rain anymore either was it getting colder or was it just that the dampness inside the coffin was so chilling she wondered but she was actually starting to feel warm even too warm im getting a fever maggie thought drowsily she was so lightheaded the vent is sealed she thought there cant be much oxygen left one two three four now she was whispering the numbers aloud trying to force herself to stay awake to start calling out again when she reached five hundred what difference would it make if he came back and heard her what more could he do than he already had done her hand was still flexing and unflexing make a fist she said aloud all right relax thats what the nurses had told her to do when she was little and they were taking a blood sample this is so youll get all better maggie they had said after nuala came to live with them she had stopped being afraid of needles nuala had made a game of it well get that out of the way first and then well go to a movie she would say maggie thought of her equipment bag what had he done with it her cameras they were her friends there were so many pictures she had planned to take with them she had so many ideas she wanted to try out so many things she wanted to shoot one hundred fifty one hundred fiftyone she had known neil was sitting behind her that day in the theater he had coughed a couple of times a peculiar little dry cough that she had recognized she knew he had to have seen her to have seen her unhappiness i made it a test she thought if you love me you will understandthat i need youthat was the thought she had willed him to hear and to act on but when the film ended and the lights went on he was gone ill give you a second chance neil she said aloud now if you love me youll know that i need you and youll find me four hundred ninetynine five hundred she began to cry out for help again this time she screamed until her throat was raw there was no use trying to save her voice she decided time was running out still resolutely she began to count again one two three her hand moved in cadence with the count flex unflex with every fiber of her being she fought the urge to sleep she knew that if she slept she would not wake up again while his father started downstairs to phone police headquarters neil hesitated for a moment studying the picture he had found pinned to the bulletin board the inscription on the back read squire moore birthday anniversary september th earl moore batemannuala mooreliam moore payne neil studied batemans face the face of a liar he thought bitterly the last man to see maggie alive aghast at what he feared his subconscious was telling him he dropped the picture next to the bells and hurried to join his father i have chief brower on the phone robert stephens said he wants to talk to you i told him about the bells brower came immediately to the point if these are two of the same bells bateman claims are locked in the storeroom of his museum we can bring him in for interrogation the problem is that hell know enough to refuse to answer questions and hell call a lawyer and everything will get delayed our best bet is to confront him with the bells and hope that hell say something to give himself away when we talked to him about them this morning he went berserk i intend to be there when you confront him neil said i have a squad car watching the museum from the funeral parlor parking lot if bateman leaves the premises hell be followed were on our way neil said then added wait a minute chief i know youve been questioning some teenagers did you find out anything from them he heard the hesitation in chief browers voice before he answered something that im not sure i believe well talk about it when i see you i want to hear about it now neil snapped then please understand we dont necessarily credit the story but one of the kids admitted that they were in the vicinity of the museum last night or more specifically that they were across the street from it at about ten oclock that kid claims he saw two vehiclesa hearse followed by a station wagondrive out of the museums parking lot what kind of station wagon neil asked urgently the kid isnt sure of the make but he swears it was black take it easy earl liam moore payne said for the tenth time in an hour no i wont take it easy i know how much this family has ridiculed the batemans and me especially no ones ridiculed you earl liam said soothingly they were sitting in the office of the museum it was nearly five oclock and the oldfashioned globed chandelier spread a murky glow over the room look liam said you need a drink you mean you need a drink without answering liam got up went to the cupboard over the sink got out the scotch bottle and glasses then the ice tray and a lemon from the refrigerator double scotch on the rocks with a twist coming up for both of us he said mollified earl waited until the drink was set in front of him then said im glad you stopped by liam when you called i could tell how upset you were and of course im more than upset about maggies disappearance he paused earl ive dated her casually over the last year or so you know id call and wed go out for dinner when i was in new york but that night at the four seasons when i realized shed left without saying a word to me something happened what happened was that you ignored her because you were gladhanding everyone at the party no what happened was that i realized what a jerk id been and that if she told me to go to hell id have crawled there on my hands and knees trying to make it up to her but besides making me realize how important maggie has become to me that night gives me hope that maybe shes okay whats that supposed to mean the fact that she walked out without saying a word when she was upset god knows shes had plenty of reason to be upset since the minute she arrived in newport maybe she just needed to get away you seem to have forgotten that her car was found abandoned for all we know she got on a plane or train and left her car parked somewhere and someone stole it maybe even kids joyriding dont talk to me about joyriding kids earl said my theory is those same kind of juvenile delinquents committed the theft here last night the shrill sound of the doorbell startled both men earl bateman answered his cousins unasked question im not expecting anyone he said and then smiled brightly but then maybe its the police telling me they found the casket neil and his father joined chief brower in the funeral museum parking lot and the chief cautioned neil to control his tongue and to leave the questioning to the police the bells from maggies house had been placed in a shoe box which detective haggerty now carried unobtrusively under his arm when earl took them to the museum office neil was startled to see liam payne sitting there suddenly uncomfortable in the presence of his rival he greeted him with minimum courtesy although he took some comfort in knowing that neither earl nor liam knew of his relationship with maggie he and his father were introduced simply as two of her concerned friends from new york bateman and payne went to get chairs for the men taking them from the funeral scene in the front room the irritation was clear on batemans face when they returned he snapped at his cousin liam your shoes are muddy and thats a very expensive carpet now im going to have to vacuum that whole viewing room before i leave then in an abrupt shift he turned to the detectives have you any news about the casket he asked no we dont professor bateman brower said but we do have news about some other artifacts we think you own thats ridiculous nothing else is missing except the catafalque he said i checked the casket is what i want to know about you have no idea the plans i had for it the outdoor display i told you about that casket was going to be part of the most important exhibit there ive even ordered mannequins of horses with black plumes and im having a replica built of the kind of funeral carriage the victorians used it will be a stunning display earl take it easy liam payne said soothingly he turned to brower chief is there any new information about maggie holloway no unfortunately there isnt brower told him have you considered my suggestion that maggie simply wanted to escape the terrible pressures of the last week and a half neil looked at liam scornfully you dont know maggie at all he said she doesnt try to escape problems she faces them head on brower ignored both men and spoke to bateman professor at this point were simply trying to clarify a few matters youre not required to answer our questions you do understand that why wouldnt i answer your questions i have nothing to hide all right from what we understand the bells that you had cast for your lecture on victorians who feared being buried alive are all packed away is that true the anger was clear on earl batemans face i simply will not go into that latham manor incident again he said sharply ive told you that i understand but will you answer the question please yes i packed the bells away yes brower nodded to haggerty who opened the shoe box professor mr stephens found these bells in maggie holloways home are they similar to the ones you have bateman paled he picked up one of the bells and examined it minutely that woman is a thief he exploded she must have come back here and stolen these last night he jumped up and ran down the hall and up the stairs the others following him on the third floor he threw open the door of the storeroom and hurried to a shelf on the righthand wall reaching up he yanked at a box that was wedged between two others and pulled it out its too light i can tell already he muttered some of them are missing he rifled through the protective plastic popcorn until he had satisfied himself as to the cartons contents turning to the five men standing behind him his face a deep crimson his eyes blazing he said there are only five of them here seven are missing that woman must have stolen them no wonder she kept harping on them yesterday neil shook his head in dismay this guy is crazy he said to himself he really believes what hes saying professor bateman i must ask you to accompany me to police headquarters brower said his tone formal i have to inform you that you are now a suspect in the disappearance of maggie holloway you have a right to remain silent you can forget your damned miranda warning earl shouted maggie holloway sneaked back in here stole my bells and maybe even my casketand you blame me ridiculous i think you should be looking for the person who helped her she never did this alone neil grabbed the lapels of batemans coat shut up he shouted you know damn well maggie never took that stuff wherever she found the two bells she had they meant something mighty significant to her and you answer me something some kids saw a hearse and maggies station wagon leave here around ten oclock last night which one were you driving you shut up neil brower ordered neil saw the anger on the police chiefs face as robert stephens yanked him away from earl bateman i dont give a damn he thought this is no time to tiptoe around this liar you mean my hearse bateman asked thats impossible its in the garage more rapidly than he had ascended the stairs bateman rushed down them and directly outside to the garage he yanked up the door and ran inside closely followed by the other men someone did use it he exclaimed peering through the vehicles window look at it theres dirt on the carpet neil wanted to throttle the man to beat the truth from him how had he gotten maggie to follow him in that hearse or was someone else driving her car liam payne took his cousins arm earl its going to be all right ill go with you to headquarters ill call a lawyer neil and his father refused to go home they sat in a waiting area at the police station from time to time detective haggerty joined them the guy has refused a lawyer hes answering everything he insists that he was in providence last night and can prove it with phone calls he made from his apartment during the evening at this point we simply cant hold him but we know hes done something to maggie neil protested hes got to help us find her haggerty shook his head hes more worried about his casket and the dirt in that old hearse than he is about ms holloway his scenario is that she brought someone with her to steal the casket and bells someone who drove the casket away in the hearse the ignition key was in clear sight on a hook in the office in a few minutes his cousin is going to take him back to the museum to pick up his car you cant let him go neil protested we cant not let him go haggerty said the detective hesitated then said this will come out anyhow and its something youd be interested in knowing you know we also are looking into accusations of improprieties at latham manor thanks to the suicide note of that lawyer who killed himself while we were out the chief got a message hed made it top priority to find out who really owns latham manor guess who does none other than batemans cousin mr liam moore payne haggerty looked around cautiously as though afraid payne would appear behind him i guess hes still inside he insisted on staying with his cousin during the questioning we asked him about owning latham readily admitted it says its a sound investment but apparently he doesnt want it known that he owns the place says that if people knew hed have the residents calling him with complaints or requests for favors that kind of makes sense doesnt it it was nearly eight oclock when robert stephens turned to his son come on neil wed better get home he urged their car was parked across the street from police headquarters as soon as stephens turned the ignition key the phone rang neil answered it it was dolores stephens she had gone home when they left for the museum any word about maggie she asked anxiously no mom well be home soon i guess neil i just received a phone call from a mrs sarah cushing she said that her mother mrs bainbridge is a resident at latham manor and that you were talking to her today thats right neil felt his interest quicken mrs cushings mother remembered something that she thought might be important and called her daughter who looked up our number trying to track you down mrs bainbridge said that maggie mentioned something about a bell she had found on her stepmothers grave she asked if placing a bell like that was some sort of custom mrs bainbridge said it just occurred to her that maggie might have been talking about one of professor batemans victorian bells im not sure what any of this means but i wanted you to know right away she said ill see you in a while neil gave his father the details of the message dolores stephens had passed along what do you make of it robert stephens asked his son as he started to put the car into drive hold it a minute dad dont pull out neil said urgently what do i make of it plenty the bells we found in maggies studio must have been taken from her stepmothers grave and from someone elses probably one of the women from the residence otherwise why would she have asked that question if she did go back to the museum last night which i still have trouble believing it was to see if any of the bells bateman claimed were in that box were missing here they come robert stephens murmured as bateman and payne emerged from the police station they watched as the men got into paynes jaguar and for a few minutes sat in the car talking animatedly the rain had ended and a full moon brightened the already welllighted area around the station payne must have taken dirt roads when he came down from boston today robert stephens observed look at those wheels and tires his shoes were pretty messy too you heard bateman yell at him about that its also a surprise that he owns that retirement place theres something about that guy i dont like was maggie dating him seriously i dont think so neil said tonelessly i dont like him either but he obviously is successful that residence cost a fortune and i checked on his investments operation he has his own firm now and clearly he was smart enough to take with him some of randolph and marshalls best clients randolph and marshall his father repeated isnt that where dr lane said his wife used to work what did you say neil demanded you heard me i said that lanes wife used to work at randolph and marshall thats whats been bugging me neil exclaimed dont you see liam payne is connected to everything he owns the residence he must have had the final say in hiring dr lane doug hansen also worked for randolph and marshall although for only a brief time he has an arrangement now whereby his transactions go through their clearing house i said today that hansen had to be operating out of another office and i also said that hes clearly too stupid to have worked out that scheme for defrauding those women he was just the front man someone had to be programming him well maybe that someone was liam moore payne but it doesnt all quite fit together robert stephens pro tested if payne owns the residence he could have gotten the financial information he needed without involving either hansen or hansens aunt janice norton but its much safer to stay a step removed neil pointed out that way hansen becomes the scapegoat if anything goes wrong dont you see dad laura arlington and cora gebhart had applications pending he wasnt just turning over the apartments of residents he was cheating applicants when there were no apartments its obvious that bateman uses payne as a sounding board for his problems neil continued if bateman had been upset because maggie inquired about the latham manor incident wouldnt he be likely to tell payne about it maybe but what are you saying im saying that this payne guy is the key to all this he secretly owns latham manor women there are dying under what seem to be unexceptional circumstances yet when you consider how many have died recently and factor in the similarities all of them pretty much alone no close family to check on themit all starts to look suspicious and who stands to gain from their deaths latham manor does through reselling those nowempty apartments to the next name on the list do you mean to say that liam payne killed all those women robert stephens asked his tone incredulous i dont know that yet his son replied the police suspect that dr lane andor nurse markey may have had a hand in the deaths but when i talked to mrs bainbridge she made a point of saying that dr lane was kind and that markey was a good nurse my hunch is she knows what shes talking about shes sharp no i dont know who killed those women but i think maggie had come to the same conclusion about their deaths and she must have been getting too close for comfort for the actual killer but where do the bells come in and bateman i dont get it robert stephens protested the bells who knows maybe its the killers way of keeping score chances are though that if maggie found those bells on graves and looked up those womens obituaries she had started to figure out what really happened the bells might signify that those women were murdered neil paused as for bateman he seems almost too weird to be able to take part in anything as calculating as this no i think mr liam moore payne is our connection here you heard him make that idiotic suggestion to explain maggies disappearance neil snorted derisively i bet he knows what has happened to maggie and hes just trying to ease the pressure of the search noting that payne had started his car robert stephens turned to his son i take it were following him he said absolutely i want to see where payne is going neil said then added his own silent prayer please please let him lead me tomaggie dr william lane dined at latham manor with some of the charter members of the residence he explained odiles absence by saying that she was devastated to be leaving her dear friends as for himself while he regretted having to give up something that had been so pleasant an experience it was his firm belief that as the axiom goes the buck stops here i want to reassure everyone that this sort of outrageous indis cretion will never happen again he promised referring to janice nortons violation of privileged information letitia bainbridge had accepted the invitation to dine at the doctors table do i understand that nurse markey is filing an ethics complaint against you stating that in effect you stand by and let people die she asked so i gather it isnt true of course what does your wife think about that mrs bainbridge persisted again shes truly saddened she considered nurse markey a close friend and more the fool for it odile he added to himself his farewell was gracious and to the point sometimes it is appropriate to let other hands take the reins ive always tried to do my best if i am guilty of anything it is of trusting a thief but not of gross negligence on the short walk between the manor and the carriage house dr lane thought i dont know what will happen now but i do know whatever job i get will be on my own whatever happened he had decided he wasnt going to spend another single day with odile when he went upstairs to the second floor the bedroom door was open and odile was on the phone apparently screaming at an answering machine you cant do this to me you cant just drop me like this call me youve got to take care of me you promised she hung up with a crash and to whom were you speaking my dear lane asked from the doorway perhaps the mysterious benefactor who against all odds hired me for this position dont trouble him or her or whoever it is any longer on my account whatever i do i wont be needing your assistance odile raised tearswollen eyes to him william you cant mean that oh but i do he studied her face you really are frightened arent you i wonder why ive always suspected that under that emptyheaded veneer something else was going on not that im interested he continued as he opened his closet and reached for a suitcase just a bit curious after my little relapse last night i was somewhat foggy but when my head cleared i got to thinking and made a few calls of my own he turned to look at his wife you didnt stay for the dinner in boston last night odile and wherever you went those shoes of yours got terribly muddy didnt they she couldnt keep track of the numbers anymore it was no use dont give up maggie urged herself trying to force her mind to stay alert to remain connected it would be so easy to drift away so easy just to close her eyes and retreat from what was happening to her the picture earl had given herthere had been something about liams expressionthe superficial smile the calculated sincerity the practiced warmth she should have guessed that there was something dishonest about his sudden attentiveness he had been more in character when he abandoned her at the cocktail party she thought back to last night to the voice odile lane had been arguing with liam she had heard them odile had been frightened i cant do it anymore she had wailed youre insane you promised youd sell the place and wed go away i warned you that maggie holloway was asking too many questions so clear for the moment so clear she could barely flex her hand any longer it was time to scream for help again but now her voice was only a whisper no one would hear her flex unflex take short breaths she reminded herself but her mind kept coming back to just one thing the first childhood prayer she had ever learned now i lay me down to sleep you could at least have told me that you owned latham manor earl bateman said accusingly to his cousin i tell you everything why are you so secretive its just an investment earl liam said soothingly nothing more i am completely removed from the daytoday operation of the residence he drove into the parking lot of the funeral museum stopping next to earls car go home and get a good nights sleep you need it where are you going back to boston why did you come rushing down today just to see me earl asked still annoyed i came because you were upset and i came because i was concerned about maggie holloway now as ive explained im not as concerned about her my guess is that shell show up soon earl started to get out of the car then paused liam you knew where i kept the key to the museum and the ignition key to the hearse didnt you he asked what are you driving at nothing except to ask if you told anyone about where i keep them no i didnt come on earl youre tired go on home so i can get on my way earl got out and slammed the door liam moore payne drove immediately out of the parking lot to the end of the side street he didnt notice a car pull out from the curb and follow at a discreet distance when he turned right it was all unraveling he thought glumly they knew he owned the residence earl had already started to suspect that he had been the one in the museum last night the bodies were going to be exhumed and theyd find that the women had been given improper medications if he was lucky dr lane would be blamed but odile was ready to crack they would get a confession out of her in no time and hansen he would do anything to save his own skin so that leaves me liam thought all that work for nothing the dream of being the second squire moore powerful and rich was gone after all the risks he had takenborrowing from his clients securities buying the residence on a shoestring and pouring money into it figuring out squirelike ways to get other peoples moneyhe was after all that just another failed moore everything was slipping through his fingers and earl that obsessed fool was rich really rich but fool though he was earl wasnt stupid soon he would start to put two and two together and then he would know where to look for his casket well even if he figured it all out liam thought he wouldnt find maggie holloway alive her time had run out of that he was certain chief brower and detective haggerty were about to leave for the day when the call came in from earl bateman they all hate me he began they like to ridicule the bateman family business ridicule me for my lecturesbut the bottom line is theyre all jealous because were rich weve been rich for generations long before squire moore ever saw his first crooked dollar could you get to the point professor brower asked what do you want i want you to meet me at the site of my planned outdoor exhibit i have a feeling that my cousin liam and maggie holloway together have played their version of a practical joke on me ill bet anything they took my casket to one of the open graves at the exhibit and dumped it there i want you to be present when i find it im leaving now the chief grabbed a pen where exactly is your exhibit site professor when he hung up brower said to haggerty i think hes cracking up but i also think we may be about to find maggie holloways body neil look at that they were driving along a narrow dirt road following the jaguar when they left the main road neil had turned off the headlights hoping that liam payne wouldnt realize they were there now the jaguar was turning left its headlights briefly illuminating a sign robert stephens strained to make out future site of the bateman outdoor funeral museum he read that must have been what bateman was talking about when he said the stolen casket was going to be part of an important exhibit do you think its here neil did not answer a fear so terrible that his mind could not tolerate it was exploding within him casket hearse cemetery if liam payne had been ordering residents of latham manor to be murdered and then placed symbolic bells on their graves what would he be likely to do to someone who had put him in danger suppose he had been in the museum last night and found maggie there he and someone else neil thought it must have taken two of them to drive maggies car and the hearse had they killed her and taken her out in that coffin oh god no no please neil he may have spotted us hes turning around and coming back neil made an instant decision dad you follow him call the police im staying here before his father could protest neil had jumped out of the car the jaguar raced past them go neil shouted go robert stephens executed a precarious uturn and pressed down on the accelerator neil began to run a sense of urgency so profound that it permeated every nerve ending in his body made him race onto the construction site the moonlight illumined the muddy bulldozed acreage he could see that trees had been felled undergrowth cleared paths staked out and graves dug scattered the holes yawned all around the area seemingly at random next to some of them great piles of clay the cleared area seemed huge extending almost as far as he could see was maggie here somewhere had payne been insane enough to dump the casket with her inside it in one of those open graves and then cover it with earth yes clearly he was that insane neil began to crisscross the site shouting maggies name at one open grave he slipped tumbled into it and wasted precious minutes trying to get a toehold to scramble out but even then he kept shouting maggie maggie maggie was she dreaming maggie forced her eyes open she was so tired it was too much effort she just wanted to sleep she couldnt move her hand anymore it was so stiff and swollen she couldnt scream anymore but that didnt matter there was no one to hear her maggie maggie maggie she thought she heard her name it sounded like neils voice but it was too late she tried to call out but no sound came from her throat there was only one thing she could try with painful effort she grasped her left hand with the fingers of her right hand and forced it up and down up and down vaguely she sensed from the tugging of the string that the bell must be moving maggie maggie maggie again she thought she heard her name being called only it seemed fainter and so very far away neil was sobbing now she was here maggie was here he was sure of it he could feel her presence but where where was she was it too late he had gone over almost all of the bulldozed area she might be buried under any one of those mounds of dirt it would take machines to dig through them to move them there were so many he was running out of time and so was she he could sense it maggie maggie he stopped and looked around despairingly suddenly he noticed something the night was still there wasnt even enough breeze to stir a leaf but over in the far corner of the lot almost hidden by one of the giant piles of soil something was glistening in the moonlight and it was moving a bell moving backand forth someone was trying to signal from the grave maggie running stumbling around open pits neil reached the bell and saw that it was attached to a pipe its opening almost packed with mud with his hands he began to claw at the dirt around it claw and dig and sob as he watched the bell stopped moving chief brower and detective haggerty were in the police car when the call from robert stephens was relayed to them two of our guys have picked up the chase on the jaguar the dispatcher said but stephens thinks that the missing woman may have been buried on that outdoor museum site were almost there brower said dispatch an ambulance and emergency equipment out here now with luck well need both he leaned forward turn on the siren he ordered when they arrived they found neil using his hands like shovels digging and clawing at the wet clay an instant later brower and haggerty were beside him their powerful hands joining in the effort digging digging digging under the surface the soil became looser less packed finally they reached the satiny wood neil jumped down into the hole scraping dirt off the surface of the casket and hurling it away finally he yanked out the clogged air vent and brushed the entry site clear sliding to the side of the wide grave he got his fingers under the casket lid and with a superhuman effort yanked it partially open he held it that way with his left shoulder as he reached in grabbed maggies limp body and lifted it up to the eager hands reaching down from above as her face brushed his he saw that her lips were moving and then heard her faint whisper neil neil im here love he said and ill never let you go sunday october th five days later maggie and neil went to latham manor to say goodbye to mrs bainbridge well be up for thanksgiving weekend with neils parents maggie said but i couldnt leave without seeing you now letitia bainbridges eyes were sparkling oh maggie you dont know how we prayed that youd be all right i think i do maggie assured her and your caring enough to let neil know about the bell id found on nualas grave may have saved my life that was the clincher neil agreed it led to my being sure that liam payne was involved if i hadnt followed him it would have been too late he and maggie were sitting side by side in mrs bainbridges apartment he put his hand over maggies unwilling yet to have her beyond his reach still living the nightmare of searching for her has everybody pretty well settled down here maggie asked oh i think so were more resilient than youd think i understand the prestige people have arranged to buy the residence liam payne will need a lot of the money he killed for to pay his lawyers and i hope they dont do him any good neil said forcefully his girlfriend too although shes going to end up with a public defender realistically i dont think either one of them stands a chance of escaping conviction on multiple murder charges i understand that odile has confessed to deliberately switching medicines on orders from liam maggie thought of nuala and greta shipley and of the women whom she had not known all of whose lives liam and odile had cut short at least i helped to stop them from killing again she consoled herself and they shouldnt get off either mrs bainbridge said severely were janice norton and her nephew douglas involved in these deaths no neil said chief brower told us that he believes that hansen and mrs norton were just involved with liams scheme to swindle applicants to the residence even odile didnt know what they were up to and janice norton had no idea that her nephew was working through liam payne theyre up on fraud charges not murder according to chief brower odile cant talk fast enough trying to get some sort of clemency maggie said soberly she and liam became involved when she worked in his former brokerage firm just when he was buying this place she had told liam about what happened to dr lane at the last nursing home and when liam proposed this scheme to her she jumped at it dr lane simply isnt a good doctor so he was the perfect person to put in charge zelda markey is a pretty lonely person odile made a friend of her and was able to remove herself from ever being connected to the deaths she was always chatting with nurse markey letitia bainbridge said nodding and pumping her for information odile dropped out of nursing school but it wasnt because she failed her courses she knew exactly what drugs to combine to cause heart failure apparently several women whom liam had targeted escaped only because nurse markey was so solicitous odile claims she begged liam not to make her tamper with mrs rhinelanders medication but he was too greedy by then nuala had decided to go into the manor provided she could have a twobedroom unit was it connie rhinelanders death that made nuala suspicious mrs bainbridge asked sadly yes and then when she found that bell on mrs rhinelanders grave she apparently began to be sure that something terrible was going on at the residence she must have asked some very pointed questions of nurse markey who innocently reported them to odile and odile warned liam maggie said oh finnuala she thought bainbridges lips tightened squire moores god was money i remember my father saying moore actually bragged that it was more interesting to cheat someone out of it than make it honestly obviously liam payne is cut from the same evil cloth i would say so neil agreed liam was an excellent investment broker for the clients he didnt cheat fortunately both mrs gebhart and mrs arlington should be able to reclaim the money they entrusted to him from paynes personal assets one last thing maggie said odile took that sketch nuala and mrs shipley had made one of the maids had seen it and joked about it odile knew it could get people thinking im glad dr lane wasnt involved in all this letitia bainbridge sighed oh i must tell you our new director arrived yesterday he seems very pleasant and comes highly recommended he doesnt have dr lanes charm but we cant have everything can we his wife is a refreshing change from odile although she has a rather braying laugh it was time to leave they would drive in tandem back to new york well visit you when we get back up here in november maggie promised as she bent to kiss letitia bainbridges cheek im already looking forward to it mrs bainbridge said briskly then sighed you are so pretty maggie and so nice and so smart youre everything a grandmother would want for her grandson she looked at neil you take good care of her he did save my life maggie smiled he has to get some points for that fifteen minutes later they were ready to leave for new york her station wagon was already packed in her driveway the house was locked up for a moment maggie stood looking at it remembering that night only two weeks ago when she had arrived itll be fun to come up here on vacations and weekends wont it she said neil put his arm around her youre sure it wont hold too many bad memories no she inhaled deeply not as long as youre around to dig me up when i need help then she laughed dont look so shocked gallows humor has gotten me through some pretty bad times from now on that will be my job neil said as he opened the door of the station wagon for her now remember dont speed he cautioned ill be right behind you you sound like your father maggie said then she added and i like that just fine
