jonathan kellerman selfdefence the ninth book in the alex delaware series to my daughter ilana a fine and magical mind a sweet soul and always music she smiled as usual from her chair she had a fine view of the ocean this morning it was a wrinkled teal sheet gilded with sunrise a triangle of pelicans reconnoitered overhead i doubted shed notice any of it she moved around a bit trying to get comfortable good morning lucy good morning dr delaware her purse was at her feet a huge macramé bag with leather straps she had on a light blue cotton sweater and a pleated pink skirt her hair was fawncolored sleek shoulder length with feather bangs her slender face was lightly freckled with great cheekbones and fine features ruled by huge brown eyes she looked younger than twentyfive so she said shrugging and still smiling so the smile died today i want to talk about him okay she covered her mouth then removed her fingers the things he did i nodded no she said i dont mean what weve already been over im talking about things i havent told you the details she squeezed her lips together one hand was in her lap and her fingers began to drum you have no idea i read the trial transcript lucy all of it all the crimescene details detective sturgiss testimony private testimony too oh then i guess you do know she glanced at the ocean i thought id dealt with it but all of a sudden i cant get it out of my head the dreams no these are waking thoughts images float into my head when im at my desk watching tv whatever images from the trial the worst things from the trial those photo blowups or ill flash on facial expressions carrie fieldings parents anna lopezs husband looking away his face i feel like im going through it all over again it hasnt been that long lucy two months isnt long not for what you went through i suppose she said the whole time i sat there in that jury box i felt as if i was living in a toxic waste dump the grosser the testimony got the more he enjoyed it his staring games those stupid satanic drawings on his hands as if he was daring us to see how bad he was daring us to punish him she gave a sour smile we took the dare all right didnt we i suppose it was an honor to put him away so why dont i feel honored the end result may have been honorable but getting there she shook her head as if id missed the point he defecated on them in them after he the holes he made in them tears filled her eyes why she said i couldnt even begin to explain someone like him lucy she was silent for a long time everything was a big game for him in some ways he was just like an overgrown kid wasnt he turning people into dolls so he could play with them some kids play like that dont they not normal kids do you think he was abused the way he claimed theres no evidence he was yes she said but still how could someone could he really have been in some kind of altered state a multiple personality like that psychiatrist claimed theres no evidence of that either lucy i know but what do you think my guess is that his crazy behavior at the trial was faked for the insanity plea so you think he was totally rational i dont know if rationals the right word but he certainly wasnt psychotic or the prisoner of uncontrollable urges he chose to do what he did he liked hurting people she touched a wet cheek you dont think he was sick not in the sense of benefiting from a pill or surgery or even psychotherapy i handed her a tissue so deaths whats called for whats called for is keeping him away from the rest of us well we did that all right the da said if anyones going to get gassed its him she gave an angry laugh does that trouble you i said no maybe i dont know i mean if he ever makes it to the gas chamber im not going to be standing around watching him asphyxiate he deserves it but i guess its the calculated aspect that gets to me knowing that on such and such a day at such and such a time but would i do anything different what would be the alternative giving him a chance of getting out and doing those things again even correct choices can be agonizing do you believe in the death penalty i thought for a while composing my answer normally i avoided injecting my opinions into therapy but this time evasion would be a mistake im where you are lucy the idea of someone being calculatedly put to death bothers me and id have trouble pulling the switch but i can see cases where it might be the best choice so what does that make us dr delaware hypocrites no i said it makes us human i didnt jump at gassing him you know i was the holdout the others were really on me to finish up was it rough for you no they werent nasty or anything just persistent repeating their reasons and staring at me like i was a stupid kid whod eventually come around so i guess i have to wonder if part of it was good old peer pressure as you said what would have been the alternative guess so youre in conflict because youre a moral person i said maybe thats why the images have started returning she looked confused what do you mean maybe at this point in time you need to remember exactly what shwandt did to convince myself what i did was right yes that seemed to calm her but she cried some more the tissue in her hand was wadded tight and i handed her another one it all boiled down to sex didnt it she said with sudden anger he got off on other peoples pain all that defense testimony about uncontrollable impulses was bull those poor poor women what he made them god why am i starting my day talking about this she looked at her watch better be going the clock on the mantel said fifteen minutes to go weve got time left i know but would you mind if i left a little early stuffs been piling up my desk is a she grimaced and looked away its what lucy i was going to say a bloody mess laughter the whole experience has warped me dr delaware i reached over and touched her shoulder give it time im sure youre right time i wish there were thirtyfour hours in the day are you backlogged because of jury duty no i cleared the backlog the first week but my workload seems heavier they keep shoving stuff at me as if theyre punishing me why would they be punishing you for taking three months off the firm was legally obligated to grant me leave but they werent happy about it when i showed my boss the notice he told me to get out of it i didnt i thought it was important i didnt know what trial id be assigned to had you known would you have tried to get out of it she thought i dont know anyway ive got eight new major corporate accounts to clear paper on used to be only tax season was like this she shrugged and stood behind her the pelicans began a dive in formation when we reached the door she said have you seen detective sturgis lately i saw him a couple of days ago hows he doing fine what a nice guy how does he deal with this kind of stuff constantly not every case is like shwandt thank god for that her skirt was in place but she tugged at it smoothing the thin fabric over hard narrow hips are you sure you want to leave early lucy weve gotten into some pretty disturbing stuff i know but ill be fine talking about its made me feel better we left the house and walked across the footbridge to the front gate i turned the bolt and we stepped out to pacific coast highway this far north of the malibu colony coastal traffic was thin a few commuters from ventura and produce trucks rattling down from oxnard but the vehicles that did pass were speeding and deafening and i could barely hear her when she thanked me again i watched her get into her little blue colt the car fired up and she gave the wheel a quick turn peeling out burning rubber i went back inside and charted the session fourth session once again talking about shwandts crimes the trial the victims but not the dreams that had brought her to me in the first place id mentioned them the first time but she changed the subject abruptly and i backed off so maybe the dreams had ceased as she got some of the horror out of her system i started some coffee went out to the deck and watched the pelicans while thinking about her sitting in the jury box for three months ninety days in a toxic dump all because she didnt eat meat pure vegetarian milo had told me over his glass of scotch save the whales sticker on her car donates to greenpeace naturally the defense had the hots for her compassion for all living things i said he grunted defense thought shed be too kneejerk to send that piece of shit to the applegreen room he gave an ugly laugh drank his chivas and ran his hand over his face as if washing without water bad guess not that hes likely to eat cyanide soon what with all the paper his lawyers are churning out he was pretty much drunk but maintaining it was am and we were in a halfempty cocktail lounge in a halfvacant highrise office building downtown a few blocks from the hall of justice where jobe rowland shwandt had held court for onequarter of a year leering giggling picking his nose squeezing blackheads rattling his chains the press turned every twitch into news and shwandt luxuriated in the attention loving it almost as much as the pain hed caused the trial was a rich dessert for him after a tenmonth banquet of blood the bogeyman the more repulsive the testimony got the more he smirked when the death penalty verdict was read he yanked his crotch and tried to expose himself to the victims families no fish said milo putting his glass down on the bar no eggs or dairy products either just fruits and vegetables whats that called a vegan i nodded the bartender was japanese as were most of the patrons the bar food was soyflavored trail mix cucumber and rice wrapped in seaweed and tiny pinkish dried shrimp conversation was low and polite and even though milo was talking softly he sounded loud lots of dogooders are full of shit but with her you get the feeling its real real softspoken gentle voice pretty but she doesnt make a thing out of it i knew a girl like that in high school became a nun does lucy seem nunnish whom i to say youre a pretty good judge of character think so huh well i dont know anything about her love life dont know much about her period other than that shes having bad dreams is she single thats what she said at the voir dire what about a boyfriend she didnt mention any why im wondering about her support system she said her mothers dead and she doesnt see her father in terms of social life she comes across a little like miss lonelyhearts defense guys probably loved that too how come the prosecutors didnt eliminate her i asked george birdwell about that he said they were running out of disqualifications and figured her for a fooler inner toughness that would make her do the right thing do you sense that too yeah i do theres a solid core there you know the old joke about a conservative being a liberal whos been mugged she impresses me as someone whos been through rough times what does she do for a living crunches numbers for one of those big accounting firms in century city cpa bookkeeper did she mention any problems other than the dreams nope and the only reason the dreams came up is i told her she looked tired and she said she wasnt sleeping well so i took her out for a piece of pie and she told me about having them then she changed the subject fast so i figured it was something personal and didnt push next time she called she still sounded wiped out so i suggested she see you she said shed think about it then she said okay she would he took a cigar out of his pocket held it up to the light put it back are any of the other jurors having problems i said shes the only one i had any contact with howd she hook up with you in the first place i was studying the jury the way i always do and we happened to make eye contact id noticed her before because she always seemed to be working real hard then when i went up to testify i saw her staring at me intense after that we kept making eye contact the day the trial ended the jury was being escorted out back and i was parked there too she waved at me really intense look i felt she was asking me for something so i gave her my card three weeks later she calls the station he pressed one hand down on the bar and inspected his knuckles now ive done my good deed for the year i dont know how much she can afford i dont imagine bookkeepers are investing in bullion i said well work something out one hand pulled at his heavy jowls knockwurst fingers tugging heavy flesh down toward his bull neck in the iceblue light of the lounge his face was a pockmarked plaster cast and his black hair hung over his forehead creating a hatbrim shadow so he said is a day at the beach really a day at the beach bitchin dude wanna come by and catch some waves he grunted you ever saw me in a bathing suit you wouldnt offer hows the house coming along slowly very slowly more problems each trade seems to have a sacred obligation to ruin the work of the previous one this week the drywallers covered over some electrical conduit and the plumbers damaged the flooring sorry binkle didnt work out he was competent enough just not available we needed more than a moonlighter hes not that good of a cop either he said but other guys he did construction work for said it came out fine as far as he got it was fine with robin taking over its even better hows she handling that now that the workers are taking her seriously shes actually enjoying it theyve finally learned they cant snow her she gets up on the scaffold takes their tools and shows them how he smiled so when do you think youll be finished six months minimum meanwhile well just have to suffer along in malibu tsk tsk hows mr dog he doesnt like the water but hes developed a taste for sand literally he eats it charming maybe you can teach him to shit adobe bricks cut your masonry costs always the practical one milo it had been a nomad year thirteen months ago just before jobe shwandt had started climbing through bedroom windows and ripping people to shreds a psychopath high on vengeance had burned my house down reducing ten years of memories to charcoal when robin and i finally mustered the strength to think positively we began plans to rebuild and looked for a place to rent the one we found was on a beach on malibu s far west end old ruralroute malibu nudging up against the ventura county line lightyears from the glitz the recession made it affordable had i been smarter or more motivated i might have owned the place during my hyperactive youth working fulltime at western pediatric hospital and seeing private patients at night id earned enough to invest in malibu real estate buying and selling a couple of landside apartment buildings and turning enough profit to build a stocksandbonds portfolio that cushioned me during hard times but id never lived at the beach thinking it too remote too cut off from the urban pulse now i welcomed the isolation just robin spike and me and patients willing to make the drive i hadnt done longterm therapy for years limiting my practice to forensic consultations most of it boiled down to evaluating and treating children scarred emotionally and physically by accidents and crimes and trying to untangle the horror of childcustody disputes once in a while something else came along like lucy lowell the house was small a thousandsquarefoot gray wood saltbox on the sand fronted on the highway by a high wooden fence and a double garage where robin after deciding to sublet her storefront in venice had set up her luthiers shop between the house and the gate was a sunken garden planted with succulents and an old wooden hot tub that hadnt been serviceable for years a planked footbridge was suspended over the greenery a rear gate opened on ten warped steps that led down to the beach a rocky spit tucked into a forgotten cove on the land side were wildflowerblanketed mountains the sunsets were blindingly beautiful and sometimes sea lions and dolphins came by playing just a few feet from shore fifty yards out were kelp beds and fishing boats settled there from time to time competing with the cormorants and the pelicans and the gulls id tried swimming but only once the water was icy pebblestrewn and seamed by riptides a nice quiet place except for the occasional fighter jet roaring down from edwards air force base lore had it that a famous actress had once lived there with two teenage lovers before making the big movie and building a moorish castle on broad beach it was documented fact that an immortal jazz musician had spent a winter shooting heroin nightly in a rundown cottage on the east end of the beach playing his trumpet to the rhythm of the tide as he sank into morphiate peace no celebrities now almost all the houses were bungalows owned by weekenders too busy to recreate and even on holiday weekends when central malibu jammed up like a freeway we had the beach to ourselves tide pools driftwood and enough sand to keep spike licking his chops hes a french bulldog a strangelooking animal twentyeight pounds of blackbrindled muscle packed into a carryon body bat ears wrinkled face with a profile flat enough to write on more frog than wolf the courage of a lion a boston terrier on steroids is the best way to describe him but his temperament is all bulldog calm loyal loving stubborn hed wandered into my life nearly collapsed from heat and thirst a runaway after his mistress died a pet was the last thing i was looking for at the time but he snuffled his way into our hearts hed been trained as a pup to avoid water and hated the ocean keeping his distance from the breakers and growing enraged at high tide sometimes a stray retriever or setter showed up and he romped with them ending up winded and drooling but his new appetite for silica more than made up for those indignities as did a lust for barking at shorebirds in a strangulated gargling tone that evoked an old man choking mostly he stayed by robins side riding shotgun in her truck accompanying her to the jobsite this morning theyd left at six and the house was dead quiet i slid open a glass door and let in some heat and ocean noise the coffee was ready i took it out to the deck and thought some more about lucy after getting my number from milo shed taken ten days to call not unusual seeing a psychologist is a big step for most people even in california somewhat timidly she asked for a am appointment that would get her to century city by she was surprised when i agreed she arrived five minutes late and apologizing smiling a pretty but pained smile rich with selfdefense that stayed on her face almost the entire session she was bright and articulate and full of facts the small points of the attorneys legal wranglings the judges mannerisms the compositions of the victims families shwandts vulgarities the yammerings of the press when the time came for her to leave she seemed disappointed when i opened the gate to let her in for the second session a young man was with her late twenties tall slender with a high brow thinning blond hair lucys pale skin and brown eyes and an even more painful version of her smile she introduced him as her brother peter and he said nice to meet you in a low sleepy voice we shook his hand was bony and cold yet soft youre welcome to come in take a walk on the beach no thanks ill just stay in the car he opened the passenger door and looked at lucy she watched him get in it was a warm day but he wore a heavy brown sweater over a white shirt old jeans and sneakers at the gate lucy turned to look back again he was slumped in the front seat examining something in his lap for the next fortyfive minutes her smile wasnt as durable this time she concentrated on shwandt intellectualizing about what could have led him to sink to such depths her questions were rhetorical she wanted no answers when she began to look beaten down she switched the topic to milo and that cheered her up the third session she came alone and spent most of the time on milo she saw him as the master sleuth and the facts of the bogeyman case didnt argue with that shwandt had been an equalopportunity butcher choosing his victims from all over la county when it became apparent that the crimes were connected a task force involving detectives from devonshire division to the sheriffs substation in lynwood had been assembled but it was milo s work on the carrie fielding murder that closed all the cases the fielding case had brought the citys panic to a boil a beautiful tenyearold child from brentwood snatched from her bedroom in her sleep taken somewhere raped strangled mutilated and degraded her remains tossed on the median strip that bisected san vicente boulevard discovered by joggers at dawn as usual the killer had left the crime scene impeccable except for one possible error a partial fingerprint on carries bedpost the print didnt match the little girls parents or those of her nanny and neither was it a mate for any swirls and ridges catalogued by the fbi the police team couldnt conceive of the bogeyman as a virgin and went looking through local files concentrating on newly arrested felons whose data hadnt yet been entered no leads emerged then milo returned to the fielding house and noticed planters mix in the dirt beneath carries window just a few grains virtually invisible but the ground beneath the window was bricked though he doubted the importance of the find he asked carries parents about it they said no new planting had been done in their yard since summer and their gardener confirmed it the street however had been planted extensively magnolia saplings put in by a city crew to replace some blighted old carrotwoods in a rare show of municipal pride stemming from the fact that one of the fieldings neighbors was a politician identical planters mix had been used around the new trees milo set up fingerprinting sessions for the landscaping crew one laborer a new hire named rowland joseph sand didnt show up and milo went to his apartment in venice to see why no sign of the man or his registered vehicle a fiveyearold black mazda van the landlord said sand was paid up for another two months but had packed some bags and driven off yesterday milo got permission to search and found the apartment scrubbed neat as a surgical tray reeking of pine cleaner a little more searching revealed a disconnected hot water heater and the seams of a trapdoor barely visible underneath an old cellar said the landlord no one had used it in years milo removed the heater and climbed down straight down to hell alex spatter and shreds and gobbets in formalin needles and blades and beakers and flasks in one corner of the cellar stood sacks of peat moss sphagnum moss planters mix human excrement a shelf of pots planted with things that would never grow a background check showed sand had given the city a false name and id further investigation showed him to be jobe rowland shwandt alumnus of several prisons and mental hospitals with convictions for auto theft exhibitionism child molestation and manslaughter hed been in prison most of his life but had never served more than three years at a time the city had given him a chain saw he was picked up a week later just outside of tempe arizona by a highway patrolman who spotted him trying to change a tire on the black van in his glove compartment was a mummified human hand a childs not carries and never identified the fingerprint on the bedpost turned out to be a false lead belonging to the fieldings maid whod been in mexico during the week of carries murder and hadnt been available for comparison printing i sat silently through lucys recitation recalling all those meetings with milo for latenight drinks listening to him go over it sometimes my head still filled with bad pictures carrie fieldings fifthgrade photo shwandts methedrine eyes and drooping mustache and salesmans smile the oily black braid twisting between his long white fingers how much restoration of innocence could lucy hope for knowing more about her background might educate my guess so far shed kept that door closed i did some paperwork drove to the market at trancas to buy groceries and returned at two to catch robins call telling me shed be home in a couple of hours howre things at the money pit i said deeper we need a new main for the sewer thats metal how could fire burn through that actually it was clay alex apparently thats how they used to build them and it didnt burn it was demolished by someones heavy equipment someone no ones fessed up could have been a tractor a bobcat one of the hauling trucks even a pickax i exhaled inhaled reminded myself id helped thousands of patients relax how much dont know yet we have to get the city out here to take a meeting with our plumbers im sorry honey hopefully this is the last of the major damage howd your day go fine and yours lets just say im learning new things every day thanks for handling all the crap babe she laughed a girl needs a hobby hows spike being a very good boy relatively or absolutely absolutely one of the roofers had a pit bull bitch chained up in his truck and she and spike got along just fine thats not good behavior thats selfpreservation actually shes a sweet dog alex spike charmed her she ended up grooming him another conquest for the frog prince i said want me to fix dinner how about we go out name the place and time um how about beauvilla around eight you got it love you alex love you too the beach house had cable hookup which meant foolishness on sixty channels instead of seven i found an alleged hard news broadcast on one of the local stations and endured five minutes of happy talk between the anchors then the male half of the team said and now for an update on that demonstration downtown the screen filled with the limestone facade of the main court building then switched to a ring of chanting marchers waving placards anticapital punishment protestors bearing preprinted posters behind them another crowd twenty or so young women dressed in black waving crudely lettered signs the bogettes at the trial theyd favored ghostwhite face makeup and satanic jewelry they were chanting too and the admixture of voices created a cloud of noise the camera pulled in close on the preprinted placards lock the gas chamber governor all killing is wrong no death penalty the bible says thou shall not kill then one of the handscrawled squares pentagrams and skulls gothic writing hard to make out free jobe jobe is god the marchers came up to the court building helmeted police officers in riot gear blocked their entry shouts of protest jeers another group across the street construction workers pointing and laughing derisively one of the bogettes screamed at them snarls on both sides of the street and stiffened middle fingers suddenly one of the hard hats charged forward waving his fists his companions followed and before the police could intervene the workers knifed into the crowd with the force and efficiency of a football offense a jumble of arms legs heads flying signs the police got in the middle of it swinging batons back to the newsroom that was uh live from downtown said the woman anchor to her deskmate where theres apparently been some sort of disturbance in connection with a demonstration on behalf of jobe shwandt the bogeyman killer responsible for at least and uh we seem to have regained our no we havent folks as soon as our linkup is restored well go right back to that scene her partner said i think we can see that passions are still running pretty high trish yes they are chuck no surprise given the fact that its serial murder were dealing with and uh controversial issues like the death penalty grave nod shuffle of papers chuck fidgeted checked the teleprompter yes and well have something a little later on the situation regarding capital punishment from our legal correspondent barry bernstein and some facetoface interviews with prisoners on death row and their families in the meantime heres biff with the weather i turned off the set the death penalty opponents were easy enough to understand an issue of values but the young women in black had no credo other than a glassyeyed fascination with shwandt theyd started as strangers standing in line outside the courtroom door sitting through the first few days of trial sullenly silently the gore level rose and soon there were six then twelve some press wit dubbed them the bogettes and the morning paper ran an interview with one of them a former teen hooker whod found salvation through devil worship personalitycult magazines and tabloid tv picked them as freaksoftheweek and that attracted a dozen more soon the group was huddling together before and after each court session a uniformed cadre in black jeans and tshirts ghostly makeup iron jewelry when shwandt entered the courtroom they swooned and grinned when victims families cops or prosecutors stepped up to the stand they put forth a battery of silent scowls prompting protest from the da and warnings from the judge eventually some of them earned jail time for contempt exposing breasts to shwandt shouting bullshit at a coroners sworn statement flipping off carrie fieldings mother as she got off the stand sobbing uncontrollably while locked up they granted interviews full of sad autobiography all claimed abuse most had lived on the streets and worked as child prostitutes low selfesteem said the talkshow therapists but that was like trying to explain hitler in terms of artistic frustration restricted from the courtroom during the last weeks of the trial they assembled on the steps and howled for justice the day of the verdict they promised to liberate shwandt at all costs and to seek their own personal justice milo had seen them up close and i asked him if he thought they might act on the threat i doubt it theyre publicity whores when the talkshow morons stop calling theyll crawl back into their holes but youre the shrink what do you think youre probably right the person whod stalked me had warned me first other victims had died without warning sometimes i thought about the others and thanked god that robin and i had been lucky once in a while i thought about the night the house had gone up in flames and found my hands clenching so hard they hurt maybe i wasnt the right therapist for lucy on the other hand perhaps i was eminently qualified robin and spike came home at robins green sweatshirt was smudged with dirt the green played off the auburn in her hair she kissed me and and i put my hands under the shirt im filthy she said love a dirty woman she laughed kissed me harder then pushed me away and went off to bathe spike had tolerated the display of affection but now he looked putupon a visit to the water bowl perked him up i fed him his favorite dinner of kibble and meat loaf then took him for a waddle on the beach and watched him ingest silica the tide was low so he stayed mostly on track pausing from time to time to lift his leg at the pilings of other houses neutered but the spirit remained robin spent some time soaking and reading and i polished a report to a family court judge a custody case where a happy ending was too much to hope for i just hoped my recommendations could save three kids from some of the pain at i checked in with my service then we left spike with a milkbone and a rapmusic fest on mtv and took my old seville past pepperdine university and the malibu pier to beauvilla its a french place on the land side ancient by la restaurant standards which means postreagan monterey colonial architecture a bit of water view past a public parking lot beautifully cooked provençal cuisine genuinely friendly service and a slouching smoking pianist who used to play soapopera sound tracks and manages to turn a steinway grand into a hammond organ we had a quiet dinner and listened to a weird musical medley begin the beguine something from shostakovich a slew of carpenters songs the sound track from oklahoma as we were having coffee the maître d came over and said dr delaware you have a call sir i picked up the phone behind the bar hi dr delaware this is sarah from your service i dont know if i did the right thing but you got a call a few minutes ago from a patient named lucy lowell she said it wasnt an emergency but she sounded pretty upset like she was trying not to cry did she leave a message no i told her you were out of the office but i could reach you if it was an emergency she said it wasnt important shed call you tomorrow i wouldnt have bothered you but she seemed really nervous when i deal with the psych patients i like to be careful i appreciate it sarah did she leave a number she read off an exchange that i recognized as lucys home number in woodland hills peters sleepy voice answered my call were unable to come to the phone right now so leave a message as i began to speak lucy broke in i told them there was no reason to bother you dr delaware im sorry its no bother what can i do for you really its okay long as im on the phone you might as well tell me whats up nothing its just the dream the one i was having when i first started seeing you it went away right after the first session and i thought it was gone for good but tonight it came back very vivid one dream i said a recurrent one yes the other thing is i must have sleepwalked too because i dozed off on the couch watching tv the way i usually do and woke up on the kitchen floor are you hurt no no im fine i dont want to make a bigger deal out of it than it is it was just a little weird finding myself that way is the dream about shwandt no thats the thing its got nothing to do with him thats why i didnt want to get into it and then when it went away i figured i looked over at robin alone at the table powdering her nose would you like to tell me about it um this is going to sound terribly rude but id really rather not get into it over the phone is someone there with you no why just wondering if it was an awkward time no no im alone peter doesnt live with you peter oh the machine soft laugh no hes got his own place he made the tape for me for safety so people wouldnt know i was a woman living by myself because of the trial no before he tries to look out for me really dr delaware im okay im sorry they called you we can talk about it next session next session isnt for a week would you like to come in sooner sooner okay thanks how about tomorrow morning could i impose on you to meet early again if its a problem just tell me but works still piling up and the drive from the valley same time im an early riser thank you very much dr delaware good night i returned to robin as she was putting away her compact emergency no youre free nah but im cheap good she said touching my cheek i was thinking of a walk on the sand and whoknowswhat later i dont know youre a little clean for my taste well roll in mud first when we got back mtv was broadcasting the headbangers ball and spike had lost interest we changed into sweats and took him with us down to the beach the sand was frosty the breakers rising with just enough space for a stroll up to the tide pools and back lights from some of the other houses cast gray stripes across the dunes the rest was black pretty cinematic said robin i feel like im in one of those dreadful movies of the week me too lets talk earnestly about our relationship id rather talk about what im going to do to you when we get back she leaned in and did i laughed what its funny she said no its great the next morning she was late leaving and lucy met her coming through the gate your wifes really gorgeous she told me when we were alone and your dog is adorable what is he a pug french bulldog like a miniature bulldog exactly ive never seen one before theyre pretty rare adorable she turned toward the water and smiled i waited for a few moments to pass then said do you want to talk about the dream guess id better its not an assignment lucy she chuckled and shook her head what is it i said this is a pretty good deal dr delaware you cut your fee in half for me and i still get to call the shots did you know there are quack hotlines on tv dialapsychicpal that cost more than this sure but i dont claim to tell the future only the past right if im lucky she turned serious well maybe the dream is coming from my past because it has nothing to do with whats going on with me now and in it im a little kid how little three or four i guess her fingers moved nervously i waited okay she said better start from the beginning im somewhere out in the woods in a cabin your basic log cabin more fidgeting is the cabin somewhere youve been before not that i know of she shrugged and put her hands in her lap a log cabin i said yes it must be at night because its dark inside then all of a sudden im outside walking and its even darker i can hear people shouting or maybe theyre laughing its hard to tell closing her eyes she tucked her legs under her her head began to sway then she was still people shouting or laughing i said she kept her eyes closed yes and lights like fireflies like stars on the ground but in colors and then she bit her lip her eyelids were clenched men she said quickening her breath she dropped her head as if discouraged men you know lucy nod who no answer several quick shallow breaths her shoulders bunched who are they lucy i said softly she winced more silence then my father and others and and who almost inaudibly a girl a little girl like you headshake no a woman hes carrying her over his shoulder eyes moving beneath the lids experiencing the dream your fathers carrying the woman no one of the others do you recognize him no she said tensing as if challenged all i can see is their backs she began talking rapidly shes over one of their shoulders and hes carrying her like a sack of potatoes with her hair hanging down she opened her eyes suddenly looking disoriented this is weird its almost as if im back in it thats okay i said just relax and experience what you need to her eyes closed again her chest heaved what do you see now dark she said hard to see but the moon theres a big moon and what lucy theyre still carrying her where dont know she grimaced her forehead was moist im following them do they know that no im behind them the trees are so big they keep going and going lots of trees everywhere a forest huge trees branches hanging down more trees lacy pretty deep inhalation theyre stopping putting her on the ground her lips were white then what lucy they start talking looking around im scared theyve seen me but then they turn their backs on me and start moving i cant see them anymore too dark lost then the sound rubbing or grinding more like grinding over and over she opened her eyes sweat had trickled to her nose i gave her a tissue she managed a weak smile thats basically it the same scene over and over how many times have you had the dream quite a few maybe thirty or forty times i never counted every night sometimes sometimes its just two or three times a week over how long a period since the middle of the trial so whats that four five months but like i said after i started seeing you it stopped till last night so i figured it was just tension does the girl in the dream look like any of shwandts victims no she said i dont maybe this is wrong but i get the feeling it has nothing to do directly with him i cant tell you why its just something i feel any idea what it does have to do with no im probably not making much sense you never had the dream before the trial never did anything happen in the middle of the trial to make you especially tense well she said actually it started right after milo sturgis testified about carrie what she went through she stared at me so maybe im wrong maybe hearing about carrie evoked something in me i identified with her and became a little girl myself do you think thats possible i nodded her eyes drifted out toward the ocean the thing is the dream feels familiar like déjà vu but also new and strange and now the sleepwalking i guess im worried about losing control have you ever sleepwalked before not that im aware of did you wet the bed as a child she blushed what does that have to do with it sometimes sleepwalking and bedwetting are related biologically some people have a genetic tendency for both oh well yes i did do that a little when i was very young she shifted in her chair do the dreams wake you up i said i wake up thinking about them any particular time of night early in the morning but its still dark how do you feel physically when you wake up a little sick sweating and clammy my hearts pounding sometimes my stomach starts to hurt like an ulcer poking her finger just below her sternum have you had an ulcer just a small one for a few weeks the summer before i started college the dreams make me feel the same sort of way but not as bad usually the pain goes away if i just lie there and try to relax if it doesnt i take an antacid do you tend to get stomachaches once in a while but nothing serious im healthy as a horse another glance at the water the grinding sound she said do you have any theories about that does it mean anything to you long pause something sexual i guess the rhythm you think the men may be having sex with her maybe but whats the difference its just a dream maybe we should forget the whole thing recurrent unpleasant dreams usually mean somethings on your mind lucy i think youre wise to deal with it what could be on my mind thats what were here to find out yes she smiled guess so is there anything else you want to tell me about the dream she thought sometimes it changes focus right in the middle the picture gets clearer or fuzzier both the focus goes back and forth as if someone inside my brain is adjusting a lens some kind of homunculus an incubus do you know what that is an evil spirit that visits sleeping women and rapes them an evil spirit she repeated now im lapsing into mythology this is starting to feel a little silly does the girl in the dream resemble anyone you know her backs to me i cant see her face can you describe her at all she closed her eyes and once again her head swayed lets see shes wearing a short white dress very short it rides up her legs long legs trim thighs like from aerobics and long dark hair hanging down in a sheet how old would you say she is um she has a young body opening her eyes whats weird is that she never moves even when the man carrying her jostles her like someone with no control thats all i remember nothing about the men nothing eyeing her purse but one of them is definitely your father her hands flew together and laced tightly yes you see his face for a second he turns and i see him shed gone pale and her face was sweaty again i said whats bothering you right now lucy talking about it when i talk i start to feel to feel it as if im dropping back into it loss of control yes the dreams scary i dont want to be there whats the scary part that theyre going to find me im not supposed to be there where are you supposed to be back inside in the log cabin nod did someone tell you to stay inside i dont know i just know im not supposed to be there she rubbed her face not unlike the way milo does when hes nervous or distracted it raised blemishlike patches on her skin so what does it mean she said i dont know yet we need to find out more about you she brought her legs out from under her her fingers remained laced the knuckles icewhite im probably making much too big a deal out of this why should i whine about a stupid dream ive got my health a good job there are people out there homeless getting shot on the street dying of aids just because others have it worse doesnt mean you have to suffer in silence others have it a lot worse ive had it good dr delaware believe me why dont you tell me about it about what your background your family my background she said absently you asked me about that the first time i came in but i avoided it didnt i and you didnt push i thought that was very gentlemanly then i thought maybe hes just backing off as a strategy he probably has other ways of getting into my head pretty paranoid huh but being in therapy was unnerving id never done it before i nodded she smiled guess im waffling right now okay my background i was born in new york city twentyfive years ago on april lenox hill hospital to be precise i grew up in new york and connecticut went to fine upstanding girls schools and graduated from belding college three years ago its a small womens college just outside of boston i got my degree in history but couldnt do much with that so i took a job as a bookkeeper at belding keeping the accounts straight for the faculty club and the student union last thing i thought id be doing never had a head for math but it turned out i liked it the orderliness then i spotted a job card from bowlby and sheldon on the campus employment bulletin board and went for an interview theyre a national firm had no opening except in la on a whim i applied and got it and came west young woman thats it not very illuminating is it what about your family i said my family is basically peter whom you met hes one year older than me and were close his nicknames puck someone gave it to him when he was a little boy because he was such an imp is he your only sib my only full sib theres a half brother who lives up in san francisco but i have no contact with him he had a sister who died several years ago pause all my grandparents and uncles and aunts are deceased my mother passed away right after i was born young i thought to be so surrounded by death what about your dad she looked down quickly as if searching for a lost contact lens her legs were flat on the floor her torso twisting away from me so that the fabric of her blouse tightened around her narrow waist i was hoping we could avoid this she said softly and not because of the dream wheeling around the intense stare milo d seen in the courtroom if you dont want to talk about him you dont have to its not a matter of that bringing him into it always changes things whys that because of who he is she gazed up at the ceiling and smiled your line she said extending one hand theatrically who is he she gave a small laugh morris bayard lowell enunciating another laugh totally cheerless buck lowell id heard of m bayard lowell the way id heard of hemingway and jackson pollock and dylan thomas when i was in high school some of his early prose and verse were in the textbooks id never thought much of his paintsplotched abstract canvases but i knew they hung in museums published in his teens exhibited in his twenties the postwar enfant terrible turned grand old man of letters but it had been years since id heard anything about him shocked said lucy looking grim but satisfied i see what you mean about things changing but the only relevance he has to me is his role as your father she laughed his role roll in the hay is about it dr delaware the grand moment of conception old bucks a loveemandleaveem kind of guy he cut out on mother when i was a few weeks old and never returned she smoothed her bangs and sat up straighter so how come im dreaming about him right its not that unusual an absent parent can be a strong presence what do you mean anger curiosity sometimes fantasies develop fantasies about him like going to the pulitzer ceremony on his arm no i dont think so he wasnt around enough to be relevant but when he comes into the picture things change who he is changes things its like being the presidents kid or frank sinatras people stop perceiving you as who you are and start seeing you in relationship to him and they get shocked just like you did to find out the great man spawned someone so crashingly ordinary i no its okay she said waving a hand i love being ordinary my ordinary job my ordinary car my ordinary apartment and bills and tax returns and washing dishes and taking out the garbage ordinary is heaven for me dr delaware because when i was growing up nothing was routine your mother died right after you were born i was a couple of months old who raised you her older sister my aunt kate she was just a kid herself new barnard grad living in greenwich village i dont remember too much about it other than her taking puck and me to lots of restaurants then she got married to walter lazar the author he was a reporter back then kate divorced him after a year and went back to school anthropology she studied with margaret mead and started going on expeditions to new guinea that meant boarding school for puck and me and thats where we stayed all through high school together no he was sent to prep academies and i went to girls schools it must have been tough being separated we were used to being shifted around what about the half siblings you mentioned ken and jo they lived with their mother in san francisco like i said theres no contact at all where was your father all this time being famous did he support you financially oh sure the checks kept coming but for him that was no big deal hes rich from his mothers side the bills were paid through his bank and my living expenses were sent to the school and doled out by the headmistress very organized for an artiste wouldnt you say he never came to visit she shook her head not once two or three times a year hed call on the way to some conference or art show she pulled something out of her eyelashes id get a message to come to the school office and some secretary would hand me the phone awestruck id brace myself say hello and this thunderous voice would come booming through hello girl eating freshly blooded moose meat for breakfast getting your corpuscles moving witty huh like one of his stupid macho hunting stories a summary of what he was doing then goodbye i dont think i spoke twenty words in all those years she turned to me when i was fourteen i finally decided id had enough and got my roommate to tell him i was out of the dorm he never called again all you get with a great man is one chance she tried to smile lips working at it struggling to form the shape finally she managed to force the corners upward its no big deal dr delaware mother died when i was so young i never really knew what it was like to lose her and he was nothing like i said lots of people have it worse this issue of being ordinary i really do like it not a shred of talent same with puck thats probably why he has nothing to do with us living reminders that hes produced mediocrity he probably wishes wed all disappear poor jo obliged how did she die climbed a mountain in nepal and never came down his wives oblige him too three out of four are dead your mother must have been very young when she died twentyone she got the flu and went into some sort of toxic shock so she was only twenty when she married him just barely he was fortysix she was a barnard girl too a sophomore they met because she was in charge of bringing speakers to campus and she invited him three months later she dropped out he took her to paris and they got married puck was born there when did they get divorced they didnt right after i was born he went back to france it wasnt long after when she died the doctors called him but he never came to the phone two weeks after the funeral a postcard arrived at aunt kates along with a check who told you this puck he heard it from aunt kate he went out to visit her in new zealand after he finished college ken and jo are older than you and puck yes their mother was his second wife mother was his third the first was thérèse vainquer the french poet i shook my head apparently she was pretty hot in postwar paris hanging around with gertrude stein and that bunch she left him for a spanish bullfighter and was killed in a car crash soon after next came emma ken and jos mom she was an artist not very successful she died around fifteen or sixteen years ago breast cancer i think he left her for my mom isabelle frehling his fourth wife was jane something or other an assistant curator at the museum of modern art in new york they met because the museum had a bunch of his paintings stored in their basement and he wanted them exhibited in order to revive his painting career its pretty dead you know so is his writing career anyway he dumped her after about a year and hasnt married since but it wouldnt surprise me if hes got another sweet young thing right now illusion of immortality she crossed her legs and held one knee with both hands tossing out details about a man who supposedly had no role in her life she read my mind i know i know it sounds as if i cared enough to find all this out but i got it from puck a few years ago he was into this discoveryourroots thing i didnt have the heart to tell him i couldnt care less folding her arms across her chest so i said at least we know the log cabin wasnt somewhere youve actually been at least not with your father call him buck please mr macho the great man whatever anything but that touching her stomach remembering the ulcer shed had before college i said where did you live the summer after you graduated from high school she hesitated for a second i volunteered at a head start center in boston was it difficult no i loved teaching this was in roxbury little ghetto kids who really responded you could see the effects after one summer did you ever consider a teaching career i tossed it around but after all those years in school growing up in schools i just wasnt ready for another classroom i guess i might have eventually done it but the bookkeeping thing came up and i just rolled with the flow i thought of the isolation that had been her childhood milo had talked about tough times strengthening her a mugging of sorts but maybe it was nothing specific just an accumulation of loneliness thats it she said now do you understand my dream not in the least she looked at me and laughed well thats straight out better no answer than a wrong one true true laughing some more but her hands were tense and restless and she tapped her feet i guess im ticked off she said about what him in my dreams its an invasion why now maybe youre ready now to deal with your anger toward him maybe she said doubtfully that doesnt feel right i dont know i really dont think im angry at him hes too irrelevant to get angry at anger had stiffened her voice i said the girl in the dream how old is she nineteen or twenty i guess about your mothers age when she married him her eyes widened so you think im dreaming about his violation of mother but mother was blond and this girl has dark hair dreams arent bound by reality she thought for a while i suppose it could be that or something else symbolic the young chicks he always chased but i really dont think id dream about his girlfriends sorry for what i push you for interpretations and then keep shooting them down thats okay i said its your dream yes only i wish it wasnt any idea when ill get rid of it i dont know lucy the more i know about you the better answer i can give you does that mean i have to keep talking about my past it would help but dont make yourself uncomfortable do i need to talk about him not until youre ready what if im never ready thats up to you but you think it would be useful he was in the dream lucy she started to crack a knuckle and stopped herself this is getting tough she said maybe i should call the psychic buddies after she was gone i thought about the dream somnambulism bedwetting fragmented sleep patterns were often displayed as multiple symptoms persistent nightmares insomnia even narcolepsy but the sudden onset of her symptoms implied a reaction to some kind of stress the trial material or something the trial had evoked her allusion to an incubus was interesting sexual intrusion daddy abducting a maiden grinding noises a freudian would have loved it unresolved erotic feelings toward the abandoning parent coming back to haunt her feelings awakened because the trial had battered her defenses she was right about one thing this father was different and relevant i drove down toward the city taking the coast highway to sunset and heading east to the university campus at the research library i looked up m bayard lowell in the computer index page after page of citations beginning in the year hed published his landmark first novel the morning cryand encompassing his other novels collections of poems and art exhibitions covering all of it would take a semester i decided to start with the time period that corresponded to lucys dream roughly twentytwo years ago the first reference was a book of poems entitled command shed the light published on new years day the rest were reviews i climbed up to the stacks and began my refresher course in american lit in the poetry shelves i found the book a thin grayjacketed volume published by one of the prestige new york houses the circulation slip showed it hadnt been checked out in three years i went to the periodicals section and lugged volume after volume of bound magazines to an empty carrel when my arms grew sore i sat down to read command shed the light turned out to be lowells first book in ten years its predecessor an anthology of previously published short stories the new years release date was also lowells fiftieth birthday the book had attracted a lot of attention sixfigure advance main selection by one of the book clubs foreign rights sold in twentythree countries even a film option by an independent production company in hollywood which seemed odd for poetry then came the critics one major newspaper called the work selfconsciously gloomy and stunningly amateurish and this writer suspects a calculated effort on the part of mr lowell to snare the youth market another describing lowells career as glorious lusty and historically indelible gave him credit for taking risks but labeled his verse only very occasionally pungent more frequently vapid and sickening morose and incoherent glory has yielded to vainglory lots more in that key with one exception a columbia university doctoral student named denton mellors writing in the manhattan book review rhapsodized darkly enchanting rich with lyric texture from what i could tell lowell hadnt reacted to the debacle publicly a bottomofthepage paragraph in the january twentyfourth publishers journal noted that sales of the book were significantly below expectations similar articles appeared in other magazines ruminating on the death of contemporary poetry and speculating as to where m bayard lowell had gone wrong in march the manhattan book review noted that lowell was rumored to have left the country destination unknown in june a cheeky british glossy reported his presence in a small village in the cotswolds having confirmed that the sweateredandcapped personage meandering among the sheep was indeed the oncetouted american we tried to approach but were accosted by two rather formidable mastiffs who showed no interest in our bangersandchips and convinced us by dint of greaseandgrowl to beat a hasty retreat what has happened we wonder to mr lowells once insatiable yankish appetite for attention ah fleeting fame other foreign sightings followed throughout that summer italy greece morocco japan then in september the los angeles times book review announced that pulitzer prizewinning author m bayard lowell would be relocating to southern california and contributing occasional essays to the supplement in december the hot property column in the times real estate section reported that lowell had just closed escrow on fifty acres in topanga canyon sources say it is a heavily wooded rustic campsite in need of repair last utilized as a nudist colony it is off the beaten track and seems perfect for lowells new salingeresque identity or maybe the authorcumartist is simply traveling west for the weather may lowell attended a pen benefit for political prisoners a starstudded gala at the malibu home of curtis app a film producer two more westside parties in april one in beverly hills one in pacific palisades lowell newly bearded and wearing a blue denim suit was spotted talking to the current playmate of the month when approached by a reporter he walked away in june he delivered a keynote speech at a literacy fundraiser where he announced the creation of an artists and writers retreat on his topanga land it will be a sanctum he said and it will be called sanctum a blank palette upon which the gifted human will be free to struggle squiggle squirt splotch deviate divert digress dig in the dirt and howsoever indulge the great id art pushes through the hymen of banality only when the nerves are allowed to twang unfettered those in the know know that the true luxuries are those of synapse and spark a september piece in the la times entertainment section reported that a grant from film producer app was financing construction of new lodgings at sanctum the architect a twentyfouryearold japaneseamerican prodigy named claude hiroshima whose last project had been the refurbishment of all the lavatories in a madrid hotel at sanctum he said my goal is to be true to the essential consciousness of the locus selecting materials that provide a synthesis with the prevailing mental and physical geometry there are several log structures already on the property and i want the new buildings to be indistinguishable from them log structures either lucy had read about the retreat or her brother had told her about it december another publishers journal squib paperback publication of command shed the light was canceled and sales of lowells backlist his previously published books had bottomed as had prices for his canvases march the village voice ran a highly unfavorable retrospective of lowells body of work suggesting that his place in history be reassessed three weeks later a letter from someone named terrence trafficant of rahway new jersey attacked the article labeling the author a bloodsucking motherfucking nematode and hailing m bayard lowell as the dark jesus of twentiethcentury american thought all of you are just too fucking blocked and preternaturally dense to realize it you assholefucking new york jew revisionist pharisees july completion of construction at sanctum was announced by lowell in the la times book review the first crop of sanctum fellows was introduced christopher graydonjones sculptor in iron and found objects newcastle england denton mellors former doctoral candidate in american literature at columbia university and critic for the manhattan book review mr mellors will complete work on his first novel the bride joachim sprentzel electronic music composer from munich terrence gary trafficant essayist and former inmate at the new jersey state prison at rahway where he had been serving a thirteenyear sentence for manslaughter next days paper cared only about trafficant describing how acceptance as a sanctum fellow had hastened the excons parole and detailing trafficants criminal history robbery assault narcotics use attempted rape jailed almost continuously since the age of seventeen lowells protégé had earned a reputation as a combative prisoner with the exception of a prison diary hed never produced anything remotely artistic a photo showed him in his cell tattooed hands gripping the bars skinny and fair with long limp hair bad teeth sunken cheeks a devilish goatee questioned about the appropriateness of trafficants selection lowell said terry is excruciatingly authentic on smoothmuscle issues of freedom and will hes also an anarchist and that will be an exhilarating influence midaugust sanctums opening was celebrated by an allnight party at the former nudist colony catering by chef sandor nunez of scones restaurant music by four rock bands and a contingent from the la philharmonic ambience by m bayard lowell in a long white caftan drinking and delivering monologues surrounded by admirers among the sighted guests a psychology professor turned lsd high priest an arab arms dealer a cosmetics tycoon actors directors agents producers and a buzzing swarm of journalists terry trafficant was spotted holding forth to his own group of fans his prison diary from hunger to rage had just been bought by lowells publisher his editor called it an intravenous shot of poison and beauty one of the most important books to emerge this century the new york police lieutenant whod arrested trafficant on the manslaughter charge was quoted too this guy is serious bad news they might as well light a stick of dynamite and wait for it to blow the next few citations on lowell turned out to be crossreferenced interviews with trafficant describing himself as scum made good an urban aborigine exploring a new world the excon quoted from the classics marxist theory and postwar avantgarde literature when asked about his crimes he said thats all dead and im not an undertaker crediting buck lowell for his freedom he called his mentor one of the four greatest men who ever lived the other three being jesus christ krishnamurti and peter kurten when asked who peter kurten was he said look it up jack and ended the interview the article went on to identify kurten as a german mass murderer nicknamed the däusseldorf monster whod sadistically raped and butchered dozens of men women and children between and kurten had other quirks too enjoying coitus with a variety of farm animals and going to his execution hoping he could hear his own blood bubble at the precise moment of death when recontacted and asked how he could term that kind of thing greatness trafficant replied its all a matter of context friend and hung up a storm of outraged letters ensued several religious leaders condemned lowell in their sunday sermons lowell and trafficant refused further interviews and after a week or so the fuss died down in may from hunger to rage was published to uniformly strong reviews went into a second printing and made it to number on the new york times bestseller list a scheduled book tour for trafficant was canceled however when the author didnt show up for an interview on a national morning talk show when questioned about trafficants whereabouts buck lowell said terry walked out on us a couple of weeks ago right after all the sturmdrang idiocy about kurten words mean different things to a man like that he was wounded deeply a sensitive soul asked the reporter its all a matter of context said lowell over the next two decades coverage of lowell diminished steadily and by the end of the period nothing was left but a few doctoral theses inflicting upon him that peculiar gleeful viciousness that passes for wit in the academic world command shed the light went out of print and no further books or paintings materialized no mention at all of terry trafficant though his book did go into paperback checking out the gray volume i drove home when i passed topanga canyon i wondered if the great man was still living there at las flores canyon static wiped out the music on my radio i fooled with the tuner and caught the word shwandt at the tail end of a news broadcast then the disk jockey said and now back to more music i couldnt find a newscast and switched to am both allnews stations were doing the sports scores and everything else was chatter and music and people trying to sell things i gave up and concentrated on the beauty of the highway open and clean as it ribboned past trueblue water even the commercial strip near the malibu pier didnt look half bad in the afternoon sun bikini shops diving schools clam stands real estate companies pretending they still had something to do during the slump once home i took a beer and lowells poetry onto the deck it soon became clear this wouldnt be reading for fun nasty stuff nothing like the luxuriant verse and lustforlife stories lowell had put out during the forties and fifties nearly all the poems dealt explicitly with violence and many seemed to glorify it the first entitled homeicide was almost a haiku he walks in the door briefcaseappendaged and finds shes shot the kids but the dogs still alive time to feed it another proclaimed over the meadows and through the woods to clarity chastity priapisty buggery butchery prepared perfectly for truncation hone the bone toss the i ching then toss the rules out the window the title poem was an empty black page several other pieces seemed no more than random collections of words and a sixpage poem entitled shahtup consisted of four fourline verses in a language that a footnote explained was finnish stupid the final piece was printed in letters so tiny i had to strain to read them slung and arrowed she begs for it shitsmear idiocy who does she think she is snap to give up snap just like that like that easy to see why the book hadnt worked and why it had enchanted trafficant i pictured him poring over it in his cell then rushing to lowells defense his motive would have been more than shared literary taste with a few supportive words hed bought himself early parole i reread the final poem a woman begging for it then scorned for giving up classic male rape fantasy lucys incubus the abduction imagery in the dream had she come across this dreadful little book perhaps as part of her brothers roots research reading it and identifying with the victim or what if the dream represented something more personal being molested herself at the voir dire shed denied ever having been a crime victim but if it had happened long ago and shed repressed it she wouldnt have remembered the dream had started right after shed listened to milo testify about carrie identifying with a child victim abused in childhood not by her father he hadnt been around to do it but by a father surrogate a teacher or some other trusted adult other men in the dream melding with her father because he had hurt her in another way i thought of her waking up on the kitchen floor the helplessness of the position victimization or maybe none of the above i wrestled with it a while longer got no further and went back inside remembering the radio broadcast id heard in the car i flipped tv channels till i found a news show something about eastern europe then shwandts face appeared leering over the anchors left shoulder police in santa ana are investigating the mutilation slaying of a young woman still unidentified whose body was found stuffed in a trash bag by the side of the santa ana freeway early this morning near the main street exit sources close to the investigation say the slaying bears striking similarities to the serial murders for which the bogeyman jobe shwandt was recently sentenced to death and the possibility of a copycat killer operating out of orange county is being considered more on this breaking story as details emerge too much bad stuff time to sweat it out of my system pretending my knees were eighteen years old i took a hard jog on the beach when i got back the phone was ringing my service with lucy again dr delaware im calling from work i had a bit of a problem her voice dropped so low i could barely hear it noise in the background didnt help what happened lucy the dream i had it again since this mornings session yes her voice shook here at work at my desk god this is so i have to talk softly im at a pay phone in the lobby and people are staring can you hear me i hear you fine she caught her breath i feel so stupid falling asleep at my desk when did this happen lunch hour i was brownbagging trying to catch up i guess i nodded off i dont know i really dont remember had you taken any sort of medication just tylenol for a headache no antihistamines or anything else that would make you drowsy nothing i just fell asleep she whispered it must have woken me up i found myself on the floor my legs the dream was still in my head reverberating right in the middle of the office god are you hurt not physically but the humiliation everyone thinks im crazy were there a lot of people around when you fell not when i fell but right after it was lunchtime a whole crowd was coming back and saw me on the floor i ran to the ladies room to straighten up when i got back my boss was there he never comes into the staff area the look on his face like what kind of nutcase do i have working for me if hes worried about anything lucy its probably that youll file a workers comp suit no no im sure he thinks im some kind of bizarro falling asleep in the middle of the day i excused myself to the bathroom again went down to the lobby and called you come over lets talk i i guess id better im sure not in any shape to go back up there i called a neurologist in santa monica named phil austerlitz and told him i had a possible referral when i recounted what had happened he said youre thinking narcolepsy shes got a troubled sleep pattern some childhood enuresis but nothing chronic in adulthood it just started five months ago while she was a juror on the bogeyman trial sounds more like stress thats what i think but i want to cover all bases sure ill see her thanks for the referral sounds like a fun one ive been dealing with brain tumors all week people our age or younger must be something in the air she rang the gate bell just after five her hair was tied back in a ponytail and her face was drawn when i took her hand it was limp and damp i gave her a glass of water and sat her down she took a sip and put her face in her hands whats happening to me dr delaware i touched her hand well find out lucy she tightened her mouth it was different this time this time i saw more taking a deep breath and another sliding her hand out from under mine i sat back it took a few more minutes for her to compose herself remember the grating noise i told you about what i thought might be sex it had nothing to do with sex she leaned forward i saw it they were digging a grave burying her the grating was their shovels hitting the rocks this time i was closer everything was clearer its never felt this real before it was she put a hand over her eyes and shook her head i was close enough to touch them right behind them it felt so real the same men yes three of them including your including lowell she bared her eyes and licked her lips and stared at the floor he was one of the diggers working hard huffing and puffing they all were and cursing i could hear their breathing harsh like runners then they put her in and her shoulders started to shake i started to feel myself transformingmy soul leaving my body i actually saw it fluttering like this thin white feather then it entered her body she stood suddenly i need to walk around pacing the room she covered the width of the glass doors then retraced her steps repeated it twice more before returning to her seat she remained standing both hands on the chair back i could taste the dirt dr delaware it felt as if i was in that grave i tried to shake the dirt off of me but i couldnt move it kept coming down on me stuffing me i thought this is what death is like this is terrible what did i do to deserve this why are they doing this to me her eyes closed and she swayed so low i jumped up and caught her shoulder her body tightened but she didnt seem to notice me the sound of the tide rose up from the beach like a swell of applause suddenly her breathing quickened lucy i said as if her name were a posthypnotic suggestion she opened her eyes and blinked hard what happened then lucy i woke up found myself on the floor again my legs wincing what about your legs they were spots of color appeared on her cheeks spread spread wide in front of everybody it made me feel so sluttish people understand accidents lucy she looked at my hand on her shoulder i removed it and she sat down god she said this is crazy am i going off the deep end no i said firmly youre obviously reacting to some kind of stress and were going to find out what it is i also want you to see a neurologist to rule out anything organic she caught her breath and looked at me terrified like what a brain tumor no nothing like that i didnt mean to alarm you we just need to rule out a sleep disorder that responds to medication its unlikely but i want to be careful so our roads clear our road sounds like some kind of journey in a way it is lucy she turned away from me i dont know any neurologists i gave her phils name and number it wont be intrusive or painful i hope so i hate to be pawed ill call him tomorrow okay id better get home now why dont you stay here and relax before you set out i appreciate the offer but no thanks im really tired just want to crawl into bed want some coffee no ill be fine its more emotional fatigue than sleepiness youre sure you want to go right now yes please sorry for the hassle its no hassle at all lucy thanks for your time well figure it out looking to me for confirmation i nodded and walked her to the door she opened it and thanked me again i dont want to add to your load i said but youre going to see it on the evening news a body was found today that matches the bogeyman victims there may be a copycat out there oh no she said leaning against the doorpost where santa ana thats orange county so milo wont be in on it too bad he could solve it phil austerlitz called me the following day at five clean bill he said healthiest person ive seen in a long time except for her anxiety even with that her blood pressure was great wish mine was as good what kind of anxiety did you notice jumpy nervous about being touched wanting to know exactly what i was going to do to her how when why want to know my guess extreme sexual inhibition is that what she originally came to you for im not dealing with her sex life right now phil no what kind of shrink are you she didnt call for an appointment that day or the next the murder down in santa ana was a pageten story the victim a twentyoneyearold prostitute named shannon dykstra whod grown up a couple of blocks from disneyland and had gotten addicted to heroin while still in junior high the media had fun with that lots of ironic comments about the magic kingdom gone wrong that night i cooked a couple of steaks and made a salad and at seven robin and i sat down to dinner with spike begging for sirloin when we were through robin said if youve got no big plans i thought i might do a little work the time im spending at the house is crimping me want me to take a shift no honey but if i could catch up it would help spike watched her depart with longing but he decided to stay and finish his table scraps he hung around as i washed the dishes and followed me to the couch when i played guitar settling next to me loose lips blowing out bflat snores that missed harmony by a mile shortly after nine milo called and i asked him if he was involved in the dykstra case involved but not committed know the difference in a hamandegg breakfast the chickens involved the pigs committed santa ana called me to compare notes and theyre driving down tomorrow to look at the shwandt file is it that similar damn near identical body position wound pattern decapitation with the head put back in place shit smeared all over the body and stuffed in the wounds but all that came out at the trial anyone could have copied it another monster i said the press made such a goddamn celebrity out of shwandt they pump this one up as bogeyman two well really have fun anyway glad im not on it keeping busy with some nice oldfashioned drivebys so hows miss lucy i cleared my throat i know i know he said you cant get into clinical details just tell me shes basically okay cause she left four messages at my desk today called her back but got some lazysounding guy on a machine thats her brother i havent heard from her for a couple of days whend she call you this morning i was just wondering if some problem had come up you are still seeing her no scratch that you cant even tell me that right lets put it this way i said if a patients in imminent danger of selfinjury its my ethical duty to call the police andor appropriate medical personnel i havent called you or anyone else okay good so ill try her tomorrow hows everything by you rolling along hows rick cutting and suturing with our schedules there aint much quality time we keep talking vacation but neither of us is willing to make plans commitment i said men have such a problem with it bullshit he said im totally committed im a pig right she called on friday morning if you have time today i could come in after work any time im home sick no i havent gone back since the fall dr austerlitz was very nice by the way he says im fine i know i spoke with him howve you been sleeping the last couple of nights pretty well actually since i spoke to you no dream and i wake up in my bed so maybe it was just a shortterm thing and i needed to get things off my chest i recalled the last session lots of questions no answers did you ever reach detective sturgis he told you i phoned he called me last night wanting to know if some sort of emergency had come up said he hadnt been able to reach you the two of you are close friends arent you yes we are he talks about you as if youre some kind of genius did you tell him i was okay i didnt tell him anything confidentiality oh thats okay you can talk to him any time i give you permission thered be no reason to lucy oh okay all im saying is i trust him and after what ive been through im a good judge of men anyway i reached him the reason i wanted to talk to him is just ive been getting some phone calls over the last few weeks what kind of phone calls hangups im sure its no big thing how many couple a week maybe four or five in all mostly when im cooking dinner or watching tv for all i know its some screwup with the phone lines milo didnt seem that concerned said i should hang up right away and if it didnt stop there was a machine i could get from the phone company that would record the callers number sounds like a good plan i said keeping my voice calm the killer whod burned down my house had worked up to it with harassment would you like to come in at noon oh she said as if shed forgotten shed called to make an appointment sure noon would be perfect she was five minutes late and breezed in wearing a snug white cotton turtleneck and red bandanna over jeans white socks and moccasins tiny ruby studs in her ears and her hair was loose first time id seen it that way it flattered her she said everythings really pretty fine glad youre feeling better i said i really am maybe its taking a break from work i always thought my job was so important to me but after being away from it for a couple of days i dont miss it are you thinking of quitting permanently im not much of a spender so ive got enough saved up to last awhile she gave an embarrassed smile what is it ive also got a trust fund not enough to live rich but it is a thousand a month so thats a pretty good cushion thats what i meant by others having things a lot worse are you uncomfortable having a cushion well she said i didnt do anything to earn it and it comes from his side of the family his mother a generationskipping thing they call it to save taxes i generally give a big chunk of it away to charity but if it can help me mellow out a little now why not take advantage of it i agree i mean ive got nothing to prove in three years ive never taken a sick day do you think its irresponsible quitting just like that not at all really really so like i said everythings fine i also talked to milo about the new murder the santa ana police are consulting with him which is smart i remember how impressed i was when he testified all those details at his fingertips he never let the defense lawyer intimidate him i guess his size helps what is he sixfour sixthree her color was high and her fingers were knitting an invisible sweater theres something i want to tell you she said im highly attracted to him keeping my face neutral i held eye contact she crossed her legs and touched an earring its been a long time since ive felt this way about a guy looking away except for a few mistakes im basically a virgin i nodded big mistakes she said i grant you but ive put them behind me is that what you meant this morning when you said after what youd been through you were a good judge of men she muttered something i couldnt make out lucy another mumble that sounded like take a look i leaned closer her mouth continued to work she closed her eyes i hooked okay i didnt answer just for a summer she said remembering the ulcer i said the summer you taught in boston i was a bona fide virgin then i met someone at head start the uncle of one of my students gorgeous very charming bright black guy he used to come and pick the little boy up and we started talking one thing led to another i thought i was in love after we were together for a while he asked me to be with a friend of his i didnt like the idea but i agreed it ended up not being as bad as id thought the friend was okay and he gave me a gift some shampoo loréal i still remember that her eyes opened tears filled them i was able to put myself in another place and get through it and raymond was so proud of me telling me he loved me i was showing real love for him next week he brought another friend over she threw up her hands it was bad but it could have been a lot worse his other girls were all working on the street he let me work out of a room clean warm color tv he made sure i didnt get any violent ones the men came to me it was almost like being popular she let out a dead laugh thats it my sordid past ten weeks of white slavery and mortal sin and then i went on to belding and raymond found some other gullible idiot pushing hair away from her face she forced herself to look at me i havent been with a man since then do you think im still too sullied for your best friend it took courage to tell me i said dont worry about my having evil designs on him or being some freakcase codependent when i say im attracted to him i mean psychologically his kindness his solidity im working up my courage to let him know how i feel is that okay with you you dont need my permission lucy thinking of the complications that were sure to come she stared at me you dont approve do you snapping her head down she studied the floor big mistake to tell you lucy its not i should have known she said softly youre entitled to your feelings i tell you i was a whore its only natural you wouldnt want me near your friend its not that at all then what why does your face change when i talk about liking him theres nothing terrible about that or you what goes on between you and milo or anyone else isnt any of my business she studied me forgive me dr delaware but that just doesnt ring true youre a lovely man and i really appreciate all youve tried to do for me but theres something going on here some kind of resistance ive got a feel for things like that another joyless laugh maybe it comes from screwing ten strangers a day you get good at gauging people quickly she got up and walked across the room lucy flunks therapy seeing milos friend was a mistake how can i expose myself to you and expect you to be impartial how can i expect you to take any sort of voyage with a whore youre not a whore no how can you be sure have you had other patients who were whores lucy for seven years she said between clenched jaws i havent touched a guy for seven years ive been doubletithing my income to the poor not eating meat doing every good deed i can find to cleanse myself thats why i wanted to be on that jury to accomplish some greater good and now i finally find a man i like and im feeling dirty judged by you just like i judged shwandt i should have gotten out of it who am i to judge anyone shwandt is a monster i said you got caught up in something she turned her back on me hes a monster and im sleazy were all defendants in one way or another arent we is that the only reason you dont want me near milo or is he involved with someone else its not appropriate for me to discuss his personal life why not is he your patient too were here to talk about you lucy but i like him so doesnt that make it relevant if he wasnt your friend wed be talking about him and i wouldnt know anything about his personal life she stopped licked her lips smiled okay hes committed though i know hes not married i asked him if he was and he said no she turned sharply and faced me did he lie to me no so hes going with someone maybe living with someone is she beautiful like your wife do the four of you doubledate lucy i said stop tormenting yourself knowing my reticence was feeding her fantasies knowing i couldnt warn milo strangled by confidentiality turning her back on me she pressed her hands up against the glass doors saw the fingerprints shed made and tried to wipe them off with a corner of her sweater sorry nearly sobbing the word theres nothing to be i cant believe i just said all those things how could i be so come on i guided her back to her chair she started to sit then walked past it snatching up her bag and racing for the door i reached her just as she opened it a marine breeze ruffled her hair her eyes were watering please come back lucy she shook her head violently let me go i just cant take any more humiliation lets talk it ou i cant not right now please ill come back i promise soon lucy please let me go i really need to be alone i really need that i backed off she stepped out onto the footbridge had i screwed up or was it something that couldnt have been avoided seeing a friend of his was a mistake who knew trauma counseling would turn into this damn what a mess i tried to call her an hour later no answer one more try an hour after that and i decided to give her time to think that evening robin and i cooked sand dabs and home fries and lingered over the meal i was preoccupied and tried to hide it by being extra affectionate she knew something was going on but said nothing as we watched the sunset then she went to do some carving spike fell asleep and i got in the seville and drove aimlessly up the coast getting off the highway at ventura for no particular reason and gliding through dark empty streets lots of boardedup storefronts and for lease signs the recession had hit the town hard and seeing it did nothing for my mood when i got back robin was in bed reading command shed the light she closed it and dropped it on the covers why did you check this out research into what the dark side such garbage i cant believe this is the same guy we had to read in english the critics couldnt believe it either it killed his career he used to write totally differently she said dark horses that long poem about paris the market i remember dark horses especially because we had to analyze it in freshman english i hated the assignment but i thought the book was fascinating the way he turned the racetrack into a miniature world all those quirky characters this stuff is dreadful what happened maybe he used up his ration of talent what a womanhater seriously what kind of research are you doing it has to to with a patient rob someone hes influenced oh sounds creepy i shrugged and got out of my clothes nice of you to empathize with your patient to that degree she said thats what they sent me to school for i put the book on my nightstand and slipped under the covers she rolled toward me you sound upset no just bushed she didnt say anything her huge dark eyes snared mine and held them captive her curls fell over bare shoulders like a shadow on the moon i wrapped her in my arms okay she said do you have enough energy to empathize with me ive got all sorts of feelings i was still in my bathrobe when the phone rang at the next morning dr delaware this is your service i have a dr shaper for you the name was unfamiliar ill take it a mans voice said who do i have this is dr delaware this is dr shapoor over at woodbridge hospital weve got a suicide attempt came in last night lucretia lowell shes finally awake and claiming shes your patient my heart rocked and rolled how is she stabilized shell survive when did she come in sometime last night shes been going in and out of consciousness claims shes never done this before has she not to my knowledge but ive only seen her a few times well were putting her on a seventytwohour hold one second then you know how those seventytwos go yes shell be seeing one of our staff psychiatrists you can probably get some kind of temporary privileges youre an md right phd oh then i dont know anyway what method did she use gas turned on the stove and stuck her head in who found her some guy brought her in i just came on shift and saw the message in the chart to call you did she take any drugs or alcohol according to the chart she denies any drug use but well see when the blood work gets back does she have a drug history not that i know of but she has been through some rough times recently uhhuh hold on what tell them just to wait anyway i have to go now id like to come over and see her now sure he said shes not going anywhere after i hung up i realized i had no idea where woodbridge hospital was obtaining the number from information i connected with a bored receptionist who said they call it woodland hills but its really canoga park topanga just north of victory i got dressed and drove south on pch taking kanan dume road to the freeway where i got stuck in a jam squeezing out at the next exit i drove north till i found victory and followed it ten miles to topanga boulevard the hospital was a threestory brownbrick column that resembled a giant chocolate bar small smoked windows small brass letters and an illuminated emergency entrance sign bright enough to pierce the morning light parking was free in a giant lot the guard at the door barely glanced up as i passed i gave the clerk my name and she buzzed me in the place was brimming over with misery injured and sick people propped up in plastic chairs periodic moans soloed above efficient medical chatter a colostomy reek hung in the air as i passed someone said doctor in a weak hopeful voice shapoor was outside a room marked observation reading a chart a tall elegant indian around thirty he had wavy black hair humid eyes and nicotine breath his badge said he was a secondyear resident his necktie was handpainted and the disks of his stethoscope were goldplated i introduced myself he kept reading lucy lowell i said yes yes i know pointing to the door hows she doing i said we patched her up there were wounds i was speaking figuratively he snapped the chart shut shes fine we saved her for the time being has her blood work come back yet no narcotics that we pick up what are the side effects of the gas a very unpleasant headache for the next few days some general weakness maybe disorientation congestion shortness of breath it all depends on how much she actually took in we cleaned her out thoroughly was she conscious when she came in semi but she keeps going in and out typical is the person who brought her in still here dont know the psychiatrist on call can fill you in she wont be in till later today but she feels an involuntary hold is definitely called for whats her name dr embrey you can leave your card with the front desk or the triage nurse and ask them to give it to her pulling his stethoscope off he walked to the next door i pushed lucys open she was in bed eyes closed breathing through her mouth hands flat on her thighs her hair had been topknotted with a rubber band a plastic bag of something clear dripped into her veins oxygen hissed into her nose from a thin tube that ran from a pressurized tank a bank of monitors behind the bed beeped and flashed and gurgled trying to quantify the quality of her life her vital signs looked good the blood pressure a little low her face was sweaty but her lips were dry i stared down at her replaying our sessions wondering if there had been warning signs of course thered been genius all that shame and rage confession gone very sour nothing to indicate shed go this far but what the hell did i know about her out of my hands now she was in the system locked up for three days more if the psychiatrist convinced a judge she remained a danger to herself a woman psychiatrist maybe it was what she needed god knows i wasnt her savior she made a deep snoring sound and her eyes moved under swollen lids more fragile than id thought was her summer as a prostitute the cause or more likely a symptom i wondered if everything shed told me was true for all i knew her father was really a truck driver from bell gardens no closer to fame than a subscription to people whod brought her to the hospital whod pulled her head out of the oven her eyes opened partially she tried blinking but couldnt i moved into her field of vision at first she didnt focus then i saw her pupils dilate one hand moved the fingers stretching toward me suddenly they dropped i took hold of them her mouth shifted struggling for an expression finally settling on weariness i smiled down at her she gave a feeble nod the oxygen tube fell out of her nose the hiss growing louder as precious gas leaked i replaced it she licked her lips and her eyes opened completely trying to talk but all that came out were wordless croaks tears in her eyes its okay lucy she fell back her fingers grew cold and loose for the next twenty minutes she slept as i held her hand a nurse came in checked her and left closing the door hard lucy woke up with a start systolic pressure jumping panic in her eyes youre okay lucy youre in the emergency room at woodbridge hospital and youre doing fine she started coughing and couldnt stop the oxygen line flew out again each spasm lifted her from the mattress an involuntary calisthenic that tightened her face with pain she coughed harder and spit up vilelooking gray mucus that i wiped away when the coughing stopped i put the line back it took a long time for her to catch her breath what she said very softly and hoarsely happen youre in the emergency room woodbridge hospital confusion whats the last thing you remember lucy she gave a mystified stare sleeping her face screwed up and her eyes closed more pain or shame or both the eyes opened hurts what does head she moaned and wept i checked the contents of her iv bag glucose and electrolytes no analgesic i pressed the nurse call button a bark came through a wall speaker yes miss lowells in pain is there anything she can have hold on lucy had another coughing fit and spit up she stared at me as i wiped her lips what happened she started to shiver and her teeth chattered i put another blanket over her she said something i couldnt make out and i bent down to hear her sick youve had a rough experience what tears trickled down her cheeks flowing under the oxygen line and into her mouth fear was twisting her face like taffy sick she repeated i took her hand again lucy they say you tried to commit suicide shock widened her eyes no a whisper more lip movement than sound no i gave her fingers a soft squeeze and nodded how gas no behind her the monitors jumped heart rate up systolic blood pressure rising the hand in mine was a sodden claw no its okay lucy no i believe you i lied try to relax didnt okay lucy no okay just calm down she shook her head the oxygen line shot out of her nose like a slingshotted stone when i tried to replace it she turned her head away from me chest heaving breathing harshly the door opened and the same nurse came in young and heavyfaced with chopped hair whats going on shes upset what happened to her line it came loose i was just putting it back well wed better get it right back she took the line from me and tried to insert the nosepiece into lucys nostrils lucy turned away from her too the nurse put one hand on her hip and twirled the tube with the other now you listen to me she said were busy and we dont have time for fooling around do you want us to run tape all the way around your head to keep the line in itll have to be really tight and believe me your headache will get a lot worse do you want that lucy bit her lip and shook her head so be still its for your good were just trying to take care of you and fix you all up nod the line went back in good girl the nurse checked the monitors your pulse is up to ninetyeight better relax no response okay nod the nurse turned to me are you family her therapist quizzical look well thats good maybe you can get her calm she headed for the door about her pain i said she cant have anything not until we really make sure shes been cleaned out lucy croaked sorry hon its for your own good the nurse swung the door open letting in fluorescence and noise just try to think of something pleasant and dont get upset again itll only make your head feel worse the door closed i picked up lucys hand again lifeless as a glove she said i didnt i nodded really i believe you lucy ghome they want to watch you for a while her back arched please its not up to me lucy she tried to push herself up from the bed the line flew out hissing and coiling on the bedcovers like an angry snake the monitors were dancing listen to me i said putting my hands on her shoulders and easing her down without resistance again i replaced the line she pushed up against me take mhome i cant lucy that nurse was no diplomat but she was right about one thing you need to relax right now and to cooperate terrified looks rollercoaster eyes more coughing why she said nearly breathless cant home because they think youre a suicide attempt theyve got you on something called a seventytwohour hold that means legally they can keep you here for three days and offer you psychiatric treatment after that if youre no danger to yourself or anyone else youll be free to go no she moaned and rolled her head from side to side its the law lucy its for your own protection no im really sorry you have to go through this and i want to see you up and around as soon as possible thats why you need to cooperate you treat im sorry lucy im not on the staff here a psychiatrist named dr embrey will be treating you a woman ill talk to her first no i know its frightening lucy but please ride it out three days ill stick by you i promise more moans she flinched and managed to raise a hand to her temple ohh settle down i said i know its hard ow her hand left her head and settled at her side she poked her rib cage with one finger what is it i said broken you think you broke a rib headshake me broken no youre not i said stroking her face just a little bruised no broken youll be fine lucy try to get some rest milo you want me to tell milo youre here tell him someone someone someone struggling for breath she took a deep wheezing inhalation her heart rate had climbed over a hundred a hundred and ten someone she repeated poking her ribs terror in her eyes someone someone what i said leaning in closer killing me she sank back and fell asleep it took the monitors another minute to slow down i waited a while then left to find some coffee a man down the hall said excuse me are you her doctor he looked to be around thirty fiveten broadshouldered stocky and roundfaced with light brown hair a golfcourse tan and wide brown eyes his blue blazer had some cashmere in it his burgundy shirt was broadcloth beige linen trousers broke perfectly over oxblood tassel loafers im dr delaware her psychologist oh good he extended his hand ken lowell her brother movement down the hall distracted both of us an old man waxy white and skeletal was being eased by an orderly into a wheelchair blood dripped from under his hospital gown painting a winding crimson trail on the gray linoleum floor his eyes were blank and his mouth was open only his tremoring limbs said he was alive ken lowell stared as the chair was wheeled away no one rushed in to clean up the blood he turned back to me looking queasy the good clothes made him seem a tourist whod wandered into a slum dr delaware he said she was asking for you i thought she was delirious and wanted to go to delaware for some reason shaking his head hows she doing shes recovering physically did you bring her in he nodded has she done this before not as far as i know pulling a burgundy silk handkerchief out of his breast pocket he mopped his forehead so what happens to her now shell be here involuntarily for at least three days and then a psychiatrist from the hospital will determine a treatment plan she could be committed against her will if the psychiatrist dr embrey believes shes still in danger she can go to court and ask for an extension thats unusual though unless the patient makes another suicide attempt in the hospital or experiences some sort of massive breakdown what led up to this doctor was she very depressed im sorry but i cant discuss details with you confidentiality oh sure sorry its just that i dont know much about her for all practical purposes were total strangers i havent seen her in twenty years howd you come to bring her in pure chance its pretty scary i was looking for puck my half brother peter lucys brother we had a dinner appointment at my hotel at seven and he didnt show it bothered me i didnt think it was something hed miss so i waited for a while then drove out to his apartment in studio city no one was home hed told me how close he and lucy were so on a long shot i decided to look for him at her place it was after ten by the time i got there and i wouldnt have gone up but her lights were on and the drapes were partially open when i got to the door i thought i smelled gas i knocked got no answer looked through the window and saw her kneeling on the kitchen floor i tapped the glass hard and she didnt move so i broke the door down and pulled her head out of the stove she had a pulse and she was breathing but she didnt look too good i called it took a really long time to get through while waiting for the paramedics to arrive i looked up hospitals in the phone book and found this place when they still hadnt shown up i said screw this and brought her in myself he stuffed the handkerchief back in his pocket and shook his head youre from san francisco i said howd you know that lucy told me she was talking about me i took a family history oh actually im from palo alto but im down in la quite a lot on business real estate mostly buyouts and bankruptcies what with the economy ive been down here more than usual and i started thinking about connecting with puck and lucy it seemed wrong that we never even tried to get together lucy wasnt listed but puck was so a few weeks ago i called him he was shocked to hear from me it was awkward but we talked a few more times finally agreed to try dinner was lucy going to be there too no he didnt want her to be protecting her i guess it was a trial balloon the deal was that if it worked out wed get her involved he was pretty nervous about the whole thing still i was surprised when he stood me up have you heard from him since no i tried him a couple times from here no answer he looked at his watch maybe i should try again there was a pay phone up the hall he called waited and came back shaking his head poor kid he said looking at the door to lucys room puck said shed been through some kind of rough jury duty and was pretty freaked out but i had no idea she was this vulnerable he buttoned his jacket tight around the waist too many business dinners he said smiling ruefully not that i imagine shes had it easy did she tell you who our father is i nodded he said i dont know if shes had any contact with him but if she has id be willing to bet thats at least part of her stress whys that the mans a total and complete sonofabitch have you had contact with him no way he lives here up in topanga canyon big spread but thats a call ill never make unbuttoning his jacket when i first started in the business i used to have fantasies of his going bankrupt and me buying his land up cheap smile ive been in counseling myself got divorced last year what happened twenty years ago pardon you said the last time you saw lucy was twenty years ago oh yeah twenty twentyone something like that he squinted and scratched the side of his nose i was nine so it was twentyone it was the summer my mother decided to go to europe to take painting lessons she was an artist she drove us my sister jo and me down to la and dropped us off at sanctum thats the name of his place in topanga ive heard of it a writers retreat yeah anyway here she is dumping us on him no advance notice he was about as happy as getting a boil lanced but what could he do kick us out and lucy was there too lucy and puck they came up a couple of weeks after we did tiny little kids we didnt know who they were our mother had never told us they even existed only that hed left her for another woman as it turned out their mom had died a few years before and the aunt who had taken care of them had gotten married and dumped them how old were they lets see if i was nine puck would have had to be five so lucy was four we looked at them as babies had nothing to do with them tell the truth we resented them our mother was always badmouthing their mother for stealing him away who took care of them a nanny or some kind of babysitter i remember that because they got to sleep with her in the main house while jo and i had to stay in a little cabin and basically fend for ourselves but that was okay we ran around did whatever we wanted twentyone years ago i said that must have been right after sanctum opened it had just opened he said i remember they had this big party for the opening and we were forced to stay in our cabin along with plates of food tons more spread out on these long white banquet tables leftovers for weeks i used to sneak into the kitchen and swipe pastries i gained ten pounds that was the beginning of my weight problem people shouting or maybe theyre laughing and lights like fireflies another glance at his watch well he said good to meet you if theres anything i can do he turned to leave how long will you be in la i was supposed to fly back tonight do you think is there a chance lucy would want to meet me hard to say right now shes pretty out of it yeah i understand he said sadly i wonder where puck is why he didnt show here pulling out a crocodile billfold he removed a business card and gave it to me the alpha group kenyon t lowell senior vice president acquisitions ive got meetings all day but i probably can stick around till tomorrow morning if she does want to meet me or if you hear from puck im staying at the westwood marquis do you have pucks number handy right here an identical card came out of the wallet on the back was a valley exchange written in blue ballpoint let me get some paper and copy it down i said take it he said i know it by heart he left and i returned to lucys room she was still sleeping and i gave my name to the ward clerk along with a message for dr embrey then i phoned west la detectives and got milo at his desk whats up alex lucy tried to kill herself last night shes out of danger physically but still pretty knocked out im at woodbridge hospital out in the valley theyll be keeping her here fuck whatd she do cut her wrists stuck her head in the oven you find her no her half brother did lucky for her he stopped by looking for the other brother and saw her through the window on her knees in the kitchen talk about providence her drapes were open and shes got her head in the oven what was it a cry for help who knows she never dropped any hints to me still im trying hard not to feel like an idiot jesus alex what the hell happened its complicated more than you could ever imagine and you cant tell me no in fact i need to but not over the phone when can we get together coming back into the city yup ginos in fortyfive ginos trattoria is on pico not far from the west la station checkered tablecloths hanging chianti bottles rough wines even during the day the place is murky lit by table candles in amber globes that are never washed the one at milos rear corner table illuminated him from the bottom accentuating every crater and lump giving him the look of a gargoyle with chronic back pain he was wearing a dark suit white shirt and dark tie even at that distance i could tell his hair was freshly cut military clip at the sides long and shaggy on top tothelobe sideburns that were hip now and against department regulations two beers sat in front of him he pushed one over to me in the dirty glare his green eyes were graybrown how come all of a sudden you can talk to me because lucy asked me to she said someone was trying to kill her and she wants you to protect her im sure its some sort of gasinduced delusion or massive denial because she just cant face the fact that she tried to kill herself but im taking it as a formal instruction how does she figure someone tried to kill her with gas dragged her to the stove and jammed her head in shes nowhere near coherent enough to discuss details remember those four calls she put in seems shes been getting some hangups she told me said you didnt think it was serious i didnt because she didnt she told me it might be some technical problem with her phone the line goes out all the time kind of casual about the whole thing made me wonder if she just wanted to talk im sure she did thats part of what i have to tell you shes got a major crush on you admitted it to me during yesterdays session he was silent and still she wanted approval from me milo i couldnt tell her you were gay because i didnt want to violate your privacy and i couldnt warn you about the way she felt because of confidentiality she got really upset and left now this i feel like ive really screwed up but i dont know what i couldve done differently you coulda told her about me alex im not your patient i didnt think it was appropriate to get into your personal life she was the patient i was trying to keep the focus on her jesus his cheeks turned to bellows and he blew out beery air has she ever shown any romantic feelings i dont know he said furiously i guess looking back i mean she hung around phoned but i figured it was a copvictim thing looking for big brother rubbing one eye pretty fucking dense huh goddammit im an asshole to let it get this far all these years ive been careful not to get personal with victims or their families so why her you didnt do anything wrong i said you gave her support and when it became clear she needed something more you referred her to me yeah but there was more in my head she probably picked up on it more what involvement id find myself thinking about her worrying couple of times i called her just to see how she was doing he slammed a big hand down on the table how else could she take it what am i brain dead he shook his head for chrissake she was only a juror ive dealt with thousands of victims who had it a helluva lot worse i must be losing it you didnt put her head in the oven neither did you but you still feel like shit both of us drank if i hadnt tried to help her he said i wouldnt know about her head being in the oven would i and you and i would be sitting here talking about something else his glass was empty and he called for a refill looking at me no thanks he said ignorance is bliss right all the talk about insight and selfunderstanding but far as i can tell being a good ostrich is the key to psychological adjustment christ now i have her sitting on my shoulder so what do i do tell her gee honeybunch if i went for women youd be at the top of my list might as well shove her head back in the oven theres no need to do anything right now i said lets see how she handles the seventytwo hours if the psychiatrist at woodbridge is good shell know how to deal with it seventytwo hours praise the law theres more you need to know about i told him about lucys summer as a prostitute oh man it keeps getting better just a summer fling huh so she says she confessed right after she told me how she felt about you asked me if i thought she wasnt good enough for you as if she was giving me a reason to reject her not good enough for me he gave a scary laugh remember i told you she reminded me of a girl in high school who became a nun someone else who convinced herself i was wonderful this time he rubbed his face hard prom night back in hoosierville all the little virgins and wouldbe virgins from our lady on the arms of us pimpled lads from st thomas i was eighteen and knew i was gay for a couple of years no one to tell it to her name was nancy squires and when she asked me to be her date i said yes because i didnt want to hurt her feelings orchid corsage tux dads car washed and waxed doing the twist in the gym mashed potatoes and the fucking hully gully drinking the fucking spiked punch he looked into his beer glass she was pretty if you liked skinny and pale and tortured wrote poetry collected these little porcelain doohickeys didnt know how to dress tutored the boys in math of course the other girls treated her like a leper he turned and faced me she was nice to talk to a little lady then when i drove her home she put her hands all over me and when i parked in front of her house she told me she loved me it was like being suckerpunched genius that i was i told her i liked her as a friend but couldnt love her then i explained why he gave another frightful laugh in the bad light he looked homicidal she didnt say a thing for a while just let her hands drop and stared at me as if i was the biggest goddamn disappointment in her eighteenyear life she didnt have it easy her whole family was a bunch of assholes brothers in jail father a drunken shit who slapped her around from time to time maybe worse and here i was the last straw he rubbed his eyelids she kept staring at me finally shook her head and said oh milo youre going to end up in hell no anger sympathetic then she patted her brandnew tonette and got out of the car and thats the last i saw her next week she shipped off to a convent in indianapolis five years ago my mother wrote me she was murdered over in el salvador she and a bunch of other nuns washing clothes in a stream he threw up his hands lets do a screenplay lucy reminds you of her that strongly they could be sisters alex the way she carries herself the vulnerability the vulnerabilitys definitely there i said given what ive learned of her childhood its no surprise her mom died right after she was born her father deserted the family shes functionally an orphan yeah i know she was talking to me about shwandt once said he had two parents nice home father who was a lawyer so what was his excuse said her own father was a lowlife did she tell you who her father is he looked up who m bayard lowell staring he put his hands around his beer glass what is this big fucking surprise day the goddamn moon in pisces with herpes or something lowell as in mr belles lettruh none other unbelievable he still alive living in topanga canyon his career died and he moved to la i read him in school everyone did shes his daughter unreal you can see why hed have impact even being absent sure he said hes just there like the goddamn ten foot gorilla lucy compared it to being the presidents kid i can understand her looking for a benevolent authority figure maybe your thoughts about a big brother werent all that far from the truth great and now i disappoint her too so how do i handle this visit or keep my distance lets see how she does during the next few days sure head in the oven no idea what could have led her to it i shook my head she was upset but nothing that pointed to suicide upset about me that but wed also started to get into other things the prostitution feelings toward her father and the dream she mentioned to you thats something else i want to talk to you about i described the buried girl story he said im no shrink but i hear daddy scares the shit out of me she started having it midway through the trial right after you testified about carrie i figured all that horror raised her anxiety level and released longburied feelings toward lowell seeing herself as some kind of victim his last poems are viciously antiwoman she may have read them and had a strong reaction and the last time we discussed the dream she said shed felt her soul entering the darkhaired girls body as if she were being buried too explicitly identifying with the victim but something the half brother told me in the hospital makes me wonder if theres even more she claims shes had no contact with lowell her entire life but the brother said twentyone years ago she spent the summer with him in topanga all four of his kids did lucy was four years old at the time the age she feels in the dream and lowells place has log buildings exactly what she describes now the newspapers did cover the opening of the retreat down to the architecture i found the clippings so she couldve also or she could have heard about it from her brother peter he did some family research and filled her in if thats the case shes flat out denying being there but the alternative is that she really doesnt remember maybe because something traumatic happened that summer his jaw flexed daddy did something to her like i said his last poems are grossly misogynistic if he abused her i can see why the trial might kick in the memories sex and violence thrown together one things for sure shes struggling with something major the recurrent nature of the dream and its intensity when she talks about it she actually seems to experience it shes trancelike almost as if shes going into hypnosis by herself that tells me her ego boundaries are weakening this is something potent so maybe i shouldve been more careful but there was no profound depression no hint shed do this what about the other two guys in the dream could be that parts fantasy or maybe what happened to her wasnt a solo act and ive got another possible participant that summer lowell had a protégé living with him named terry trafficant career criminal history of attempted rape assault manslaughter locked up longterm till lowell helped him get parole and publish his jail diary it became a bestseller yeah yeah i wasnt a cop yet still in college but i remember thinking how asinine so did a lot of other people the last cop who arrested him called him a stick of dynamite waiting to go off there was a stink about lowells patronage then trafficant disappeared a guy like that all those years in confinement stick him in topanga canyon with a cute little girl running around who knows he grimaced trafficants record include pedophilia i dont remember reading that but a guy like him might very well not be repulsed by sex with a little girl yeah the other possibility alex is that nothing happened directly to her but she saw something and not even criminal violence maybe wild sex some kind of orgy a girl and three guys that would freak out a fouryearold right what if the grinding was exactly what she first thought it was and her mind ran away with it like you said sex and violence are all mixed up in her head i thought about that its sure possible the half brother said the kids were at the retreat for the opening a big party took place the papers described it as a pretty wild scene and in the dream lucy talks about noise and lights the night she leaves the cabin she couldve seen something xrated involving daddy he and a couple of buddies having their way with a girl he said not the kind of thing a little kid could handle easily and the trial reawakens it on the other hand what if she did witness violence and thats why hearing about shwandt evoked memories of a crime maybe unconsciously she was motivated to be a juror in order to right some kind of wrong maybe thats the toughness the prosecutors sensed possible he said trafficant was an attempted rapist milo and he dropped out of sight right after the party on the lam why else would he disappear at the height of his celebrity all those years behind bars then hes a bestseller it wouldnt have made sense to quit unless he had something to hide he and lowell the publicity would have been devastating so maybe he took the money and ran for all we know hes on some tropical island living off his royalties he rubbed his face and contemplated the table light for that to make sense there would have to be no witnesses meaning violence taken all the way maybe lucy actually did witness a burial lowell and trafficant and someone else getting rid of the body he thought a long time its a helluva leap based on a dream for all we know trafficant disappeared because he died blew all his dough on dope and odd he was a psychopath loser dont they always end up doing something selfdestructive usually but still the idea of him and lucy up there at the same time her blocking out that summer and now shes dreaming about a dead girl i could call trafficants publisher and see if they know where he is if you feel up to it you could run a background check sure why not bestseller shaking his head what is it with these intellectuals anyway all those fools marching for caryl chessman as if he was a saint norman mailer with his pet creep william buckley rooting for that asshole edgar smith beat a fifteenyearold girl to death with a baseball bat i thought about that i suppose artists and writers can lead a pretty insulated life i said no freeway jams or time cards getting paid to make things up you could start to confuse your fantasies with reality i think theres more to it alex i think the socalled creative bunch believe theyre better than everyone else dont have to play by the same rules i remember once when i was first on the force i pulled jail duty down at the hall of justice and some sociology professor was leading a tour earnest students pens and notebooks they walked past one assholes cell and it was full of drawings bloody stuff but very well done the guy had real talent not that it stopped him from robbing liquor stores and pistolwhipping the owners prof and the kids were totally blown away how could someone that talented be in there such injustice they started talking to the guy hes a stone psychopath so he immediately smells an opening and plays them like guitars mr misunderstood artist poor baby robbed cause he couldnt afford paints and canvas he shook his head goddamn professor actually came up to me and demanded to know who the guys parole officer was letting me know it was criminal for such a gifted fellow to be shackled thats the equation they make alex if youre talented youre entitled to privileges every few years you see another bullshit article some idealistic fool setting up a program teaching inmates to paint or sculpt or play piano or write fucking short stories like thats going to make a damn bit of difference truth is theres always been plenty of talent in jail visit any penitentiary youll hear great music see lots of nifty artwork if you ask me psychopaths are more talented than the rest of us but theyre still fucking psychopaths theres actually a theory to that effect i said psychopathy as a form of creativity and youre right theres no shortage of artistically brilliant people who had low moral iqs degas wagner ezra pound philip larkin from what i hear picasso was pretty hard to live with so why are people so goddamn stupid naäiveté wanting to believe the best about others who knows and its not just the creative bunch who buys into it years ago social psychologists discovered something called the halo effect most people have no trouble believing that if youre good at one thing it transfers to unrelated areas its why athletes get rich endorsing products yeah he said trafficant shoulda stuck around somebody would have paid him to endorse cutlery lowell set him loose on society dropped him in a totally unstructured situation full of booze dope groupies and cute little kids he laughed wearily get us together feeling like failures and we do build a nice house of cards ill grant you its interesting scumbag on the loose almost always spells some kind of trouble but like you said lucy could have read about him or heard about him from her brother maybe the goddamn dream is pure fiction could be i admitted he got plenty of media coverage much as i like her shes got problems right the head in the oven this paranoid talk about someone trying to kill her and those hangup calls i feel like a bum saying this but now that i know shes been wanting to get close to me id be an idiot not to wonder if she made them up to get attention even the way she tried to kill herself has a touch of that doesnt it gas with the drapes open he gulped down the rest of his beer and looked at me yes there is a hysterical quality to it i said but lets be charitable and assume that even if she is making things up its out of neediness rather than manipulation that still doesnt eliminate the possibility that something traumatized her that summer dont forget shes not trumpeting herself as a victim or trying to make anything out of the dream on the contrary she tends to minimize things just as she did with the hangups shes an ostrich milo blocking out that entire summer my gut tells me something happened when she was four and its stuck down in her unconscious something that relates directly or indirectly to lowell shes not the only one with strong feelings about him the half brother called him a total sonofabitch hes in the real estate business and his big fantasys foreclosing on dads land maybe that summer was bad for all the lowell kids okay he said lets say we do somehow get to the bottom of it find out daddy did do something terrible twentyone years ago and lets assume lucy gets herself to a point where she can deal with it then what bring the bastard to the bar of justice you know what uncorroborated memories are worth in court and the fact that it came out in therapy makes it even weaker nowadays prosecutors assume anything retrieved in a shrinks office is bullshit till proven otherwise too many cases thrown out of court too much poppsych crap satanic bullshit if you feel youve been abused you have been babywiththebathwater i said just like when the courts tossed out hypnotic evidence but you know as well as i do hypnosis does help some witnesses remember facts and plenty of patients do retrieve valid memories during therapy ive seen dozens of corroborations the key is never to plant anything in a patients head and never to lead stay skeptical as hell but keep it to yourself and if you end up with something check it out to the max i know i know im just saying its an uphill battle look even if it never goes anywhere legally i think at some point knowing what really happened or didnt will help her what if we learn daddy did something cant touch him legally and the bastard gets away with it what does that do to her psyche so what do you suggest drop it im not suggesting anything just creating problems to keep your mind active what a pal i said anyway its probably theoretical after the way the last session went i doubt lucyll want to see me maybe shell hook up with embrey maybe seeing a woman will make it easier whoever her therapist turns out to be theyll need to know whats going on think theyll keep her in past the seventytwo not unless she really falls apart its whatll happen when she gets out that worries me neither of us spoke for a while i thought of all the possibilities wed just raised wondered if lucy would connect with embrey i found myself hoping so what he said that summer i said at least we could try to narrow things down by finding out if any darkhaired girls were reported raped or murdered or missing in topanga that summer if they were weve got possible corroboration if not that will also define the focus of lucys therapy either way she doesnt need to be told until the times right narrow things huh i cant see it hurting he scraped a tooth with a fingernail guess i could make a call to malibu sheriffs its a lowcrime neighborhood there shouldnt be too much paper to wade through assuming they keep their old files i can also look into any public records on mr trafficant when exactly was this party august midaugust he took out his notepad and wrote it down his beer glass was empty and he reached for a breadstick hope she heals he said softly amen twirling the breadstick he put it down havent had lunch yet you in any mood to eat not really me neither hed left his unmarked around the corner from the restaurant in a loading zone and a meter maid was approaching it with a predatory look in her eyes milo flashed his badge wagged his finger and grinned the meter maid snorted returned to her buggy and puttputted away power he said intoxicating as fine cognac and it wont damage your liver as he got in the car i said anything new on the santa ana murder shwandts lawyers are going to use it as grounds for a mistrial youre kidding in lawyer logic the similarity between this one and the bogeyman murders casts doubt on jobes guilt for all of them we only had physical evidence on carrie marie rosenhut and berna mendoza all the others were circumstantial so what he still did those three three versus fifteen the victim load their phrase prejudiced the jury against him and was responsible for the death penalty they want a retrial on carrie and the other two physicals too fruit of the poisoned tree or some shit like that absurd i said like you said anyone whod been at the trial or read the transcripts would have had enough information to copycat he put his hand on my shoulder logic has nothing to do with it its a game theres a whole subspecies of sharpies makes a living filing death penalty appeals theyve got it down to a science and we pay for it with our taxes he shook his head and laughed what does that say about our society alex a piece of shit like shwandt can cut up women and kids gouge their eyes out shit on them and get himself a supporting case of legal beagles access to a law library three squares tv magazines nutritious snacks i mean lets cut through all the theology and ideology and tell me what reason can there possibly be to let someone like that live no argument from me does that mean youve finally converted to what the church of abject hostility depends on what day you catch me he laughed and started his engine i said do you think theres really any chance of a new trial who the hell knows the goddamn press corps loves the slimy fuck he feeds them like trained seals i wondered how lucy would react to the legal circus would she see it as diminishing what shed done in that jury box right now that seemed the least of her problems i called woodbridge hospital and used my title to cadge information from a nurse the patient was still sleeping dr embrey had not come in yet i tried to reach peter lowell no answer phoning my service i discovered dr wendy embrey had left a message my callback got her voice mail i said id be happy to speak to her and returned to the seville i couldnt rid myself of the thought that something had happened to lucy that summer couldnt erase the idea of a little girl and a paroled killer thrown together heading north on westwood boulevard i drove to vagabond books parked in the back and entered the store the owner was playing his sax he looked up as i approached not missing a note then he recognized me and said hey the glass case of first editions fronting the register had something new in it along with the books big silver automatic he saw me looking at it theres a guy running around robbing used bookstores comes in just before closing time pulls a gun beats and sodomizes the clerk and takes the cash kid over at pepys books is getting tested for aids god he fingered his ponytail so what can i do for you terrence trafficant from hunger to rage he took the gun out put it in his waistband and stepped out from behind the counter ambling over to the rear of the store he came back with a wornlooking paperback bright red cover black title letters that resembled knife slashes two cover blurbs it stirs and jolts with all the cruel authority of the electric chairtime twisted heroic visionary touched with genius trafficant holds us by the scruff and forces us to stare into our own nightmare this may be one of the most important books of our century denton mellors the manhattan book review doing some kind of psychology research he said ringing up the sale you couldnt be reading for pleasure its really a piece of crap i opened the book more raves from newsweek vogue the washington post the times on both coasts the critics didnt think so the critics are brainless sheep trust me its crap well i said paying him youve got the gun i got home at three feeling antsy yet tired the ocean was green and silky putting the book on the coffee table i went out lay down on a lounge chair caught a face full of ultraviolet and fell asleep robin kissed me awake someone on the phone for you what time is it fivefifteen must have dozed off she wiped my forehead youre really hot better watch that sun honey i took the call in the kitchen rubbing my eyes and clearing my throat dr delaware doctor this is audrey from dr wendy embreys office dr embrey said to tell you shed like to meet with you concerning lucretia lowell if youve got the time would sometime tomorrow be okay tonight would be okay too dr embreys all over the place tonight she attends at a bunch of different hospitals how about tomorrow around lunchtime sure where shell be over at the university all morning if its convenient she could meet you in the med school dining room at twelvethirty that would be fine good ill tell her hows ms lowell doing im sure shes doing as well as can be expected i read from hunger to rage over breakfast the bookseller had been right trafficants style was crude and uncontrolled boiling with juniorhigh revolutionary rhetoric and obscenities his editor had left his faulty spelling and grammar intact aiming i suppose for gritty authenticity in the first half he worked two themes to the death society screwed me and im getting even the next fifty pages were letters hed written to various celebrities and officials only two had answered the congressman from trafficants home district in oklahoma who responded with a dear constituent form letter and m bayard lowell who praised trafficants bloody poetry the two men began to correspond trafficant ranting and lowell commiserating the final page was a photocopy of trafficants approved parole application a biography and picture were on the inside back cover the mug shot the papers had run terrence gary trafficant of uncertain parentage and hot blood was born april in walahachee oklahoma beaten often and suckled by wolves he spent his formative years in various institutions and hellsonearth his first major punitive adventure came at the age of ten when he was locked up at the oklahoma institute for children for stealing cigarettes he proved an uncooperative prisoner and alternated for the next thirty years between steadily escalating violence and incarceration much of it in solitary confinement he brings a unique perspective to our perception of right and wrong from hunger to rage has been purchased for adaptation as a major motion picture a psychopath making it in hollywood not a huge stretch yet trafficant had turned his back on it a bestseller who admired the däusseldorf monster steadily escalating violence the more i thought about it the harder it was to ignore his presence that summer call his publisher too late to phone new york i let my own imagination run on trafficant seducing the longhaired girl things getting out of hand or maybe shed resisted and hed raped again then killed her and told lowell lowell panicking rushing to bury the evidence unaware that a little girl was watching a little girl who wet the bed maybe dank sheets had aroused her waking and walking and witnessing and paying for it now the med school cafeteria was a mass of flatware clatter white coats everywhere soon after i walked in a pretty asian woman in a plumcolored silk suit came up to me dr delaware wendy embrey she was young and petite with long straight blueblack hair and onyx eyes a faculty picture badge clipped to her lapel showed her hair permed w takahashiembrey md psychiatry ive got a table over there she said would you like to get some lunch no im fine she smiled have you eaten here before occasionally are you on staff she said as we walked to her table crosstown i interned crosstown are you in psychiatry pediatrics im a child psychologist she gave me a curious look and we sat down on her tray were a tuna sandwich coleslaw red jello and milk she unwrapped her utensils and spread her napkin on her lap but lucretia was your patient yes once in a while i see adults shortterm consults usually stressrelated she was referred by the police another curious look she couldnt have been more than a year or two out of residency but shed learned her therapeutic nuances i consult to the police occasionally i said what kind of stress had she been through she was a juror on the bogeyman trial she picked up her fork well that could certainly be difficult how long did you treat her only a few sessions she came to me because of sleep problems a recurrent nightmare and later some somnambulism walking in her sleep at least once before the suicide attempt she woke up in her kitchen i guess looking back it can be seen as a rehearsal for the attempt she also had an episode of something that looked like narcolepsy falling asleep at her desk at work and waking up on the floor yes she told me about that said youd sent her to a neurologist and he pronounced her healthy phil austerlitz hes on staff here did he come up negative the way she claims yes he thought it was stress the fork dipped into the coleslaw thats what the neurologist at woodbridge said too interesting though the somnambulism do you think the suicide attempt could have occurred during some sort of sleepwalking trance ive read case histories of selfdestruction during arousal from deep sleep have you ever seen anything that extreme no suicide attempts but i have treated children with night terrors who hurt themselves thrashing and walking around i even had a family where the children and the father had terrors the father used to try to strangle the mother in his sleep and there are cases of people committing murder and claiming somnambulism claiming you dont believe its possible its possible but its rare she ate some slaw looked at her sandwich then at me its a strange case her denials so absolute usually with attempters you see just the opposite guilt confessions promises never to do it again because they feel physically lousy and want to get out of hold the really severe ones the ones whore sorry they failed either get really mad or go mute but lucretias cooperative and articulate she understands why she has to be observed yet she remains adamant that she never tried to kill herself which would be a dumb approach to take if you were trying to convince your psychiatrist to let you go right in the wrong hands you could be tagged as delusional you dont see her as delusional im not sure how i see her yet but she sure doesnt look crazy maybe im missing something but i think she truly believes on a conscious level that she didnt make an attempt did she give you an explanation for what happened she says she fell asleep and woke up in the hospital and that her first thought when you told her why she was there was someone had tried to kill her now that shes fully awake she realizes it makes no sense all in all shes pretty confused i could be missing the boat completely but i dont see any schizophrenic output just depression but not the crushing depression youd associate with an attempt i had our psychologist test her for a bipolar disorder she seems to have such a big stake in keeping busy i thought maybe there was some mania going on and the daytime sleep was crashing after an episode he found her mmpi somewhat elevated on depression and anxiety but no hint of anything manic and her lie scale was normal so she seemed to be telling the truth he said unless shes been tested a lot and knows how to fool the instruments theres no serious personality disturbance shed have other reasons to be anxious i said just before the attempt we got into some areas that upset her she had a very isolated childhood a mother who died when she was an infant a highly troubled relationship with an absentee father but she was always coherent and if she was really disturbed i doubt she could have lasted three months on that jury what areas upset her i described the dream interesting she said any indication he molested her she denies ever being with him but her brother told me she spent a summer up at his place when she was four so shes either denying that or shes repressed it completely as to what happened up there i dont know i told her about trafficant emphasizing how speculative everything was well she said at the very least it sounds like lots of garbage coming to the surface going to take a long time to sift through this is one where well have to tread carefully adding to the garbage she had a brief episode of working as a prostitute when she was eighteen she denies any guilt but theres probably lots and she developed a crush on one of the detectives who worked on the bogeyman case the one who referred her to me hes gay she put the sandwich down just a few sessions and all that came out most of it during the last one i said too much too soon but i couldnt stop her that night she put her head in the oven lovely are you planning to let her go after the seventytwos up shes not psychotic or violent i cant see a judge giving me any more time but she sure needs careful outpatient followup a prostitute she seems so prim how long is brief part of a summer she claims shes been celibate since and phil austerlitz said she had a real aversion to being touched she put her hands together i can see what you mean about that summer with her father despite all that she relates well to a male therapist talks very fondly about you are you planning to follow her the last thing i want is for her to be abandoned again i said but i may not be right for her the policeman she likes is a close friend i recounted lucys request for permission to love milo my silence the reaction so she doesnt know hes gay not yet she opened the milk carton i dont want to get personal but is he your lover no just a friend i said adding im straight and wondering why it sounded so defensive i can see what you mean by complications it might be in her best interests to transfer her care if it can be done without traumatizing her when i heard she was going to be seen by a woman i was glad we seem to have a good rapport she said she cooperates appears to be relating then i review my notes and realize she hasnt told me much i felt the same way about her in the beginning i said like i said most of the substantive material came out in the last session maybe its her family style i spoke to her brother and he didnt tell me much of anything either given the situation youd think hed want me to know as much as possible he doesnt know much about her himself hes a half brother hasnt seen her in over twenty years no im not talking about the one who brought her in this was the other one peter he phoned me this morning from taos said hed heard about lucretia from ken very upset about not being able to be with her but he couldnt fly back and when i tried to ask questions he backed away like he was in a big hurry to get off the phone why cant he be with her business obligations i called ken hes gone back to palo alto he knew nothing like you said pretty nice of him to pay for her care i got the sense he wants to make contact me too he offered to handle everything he seems to have money lucretia has no insurance because she quit her job so thats lucky the hospital looks askance at doctors who treat nonpaying patients nowadays we have to be bookkeepers too right i nodded anyway she said sounds like a complicated family are there any other relatives in town for support in town i said but not for support i told her who lucys father was and she reached for her jello without registering much reaction i was a math major never much for fiction she said then you get into med school and your whole world really narrows so the pain of abandonment would be that much worse hes available to the whole world but not to her and now that dream thats pretty darn freudian this is starting to sound like oldfashioned psychiatry i dont get much of that what do you do mostly medication almost totally i attend at six different ers and i rarely get to do any followup so yes if lucretias willing to see me id be very interested shes an interesting woman wheres your office tarzana i rent space from another psychiatrist she gave me her card where are you malibu not too shabby i would like you to stay closely in touch we need to make sure she doesnt see you as yet another man whos walked out on her i was planning to visit her while shes in when would you like me to start any time youre ready ill leave your name with the charge nurse she ate some more jello and finished her milk wiping away the white mustache while youre there though id keep it casual especially in terms of your gay friend id just as soon hold off on any more surprises until i have a better feel for whats going on with her make sense yes but once shes out shes likely to seek him out she views him as a protector i described how lucy and milo had connected at the trial well she said for now id tell him to keep a low profile what she needs is protection from her own impulses i drove home thinking wendy embrey might be very good for lucy but i wondered how lucy would react to a change in therapists i had conflicts of my own about the transition relieved at the chance to get out of a mess but more than a bit guilty at how good that freedom sounded and i still wanted to know what had happened that summer for her sake or mine the answers werent comforting i put on some music and drove like a robot when i got home surfers vans were parked all along the turnoff to the public beach when i opened the door the phone was ringing my service with a longdistance call from ken lowell hi doctor anything new on lucy she seems to be holding her own i spoke to dr embrey and she sounded pretty sharp but im a little confused whos going to be lucys doctor as long as lucys in the hospital dr embreys in charge unfortunately i cant seem to reach dr embrey now are you going to be speaking to her if you are id like to pass something along i think she should know sure i got a call from my brother early this morning explaining why he hadnt shown up for dinner some sort of business emergency in taos new mexico of all places i told him what had happened to lucy and he really went ballistic but then he said he couldnt come back because he was tied up he said the same thing to dr embrey must have called her right after he spoke to you but it doesnt make any sense because when we met last week he wasnt involved in any business told me hed been unemployed for a long time so what was so urgent i really dont know ken no no reason for you to i have to tell you doctor he sounded very edgy i cant help thinking hes in some kind of trouble i was just wondering if lucy said anything to you that you could divulge without breaking confidentiality she really didnt ken all right thanks ill be back and forth to la for the next few weeks would visiting lucy be appropriate id talk to dr embrey about that yes of course i have to tell you doctor this is strange what is instant family at robin called to let me know shed been invited to attend a showcase that night at the whiskey a band of thrashmetal heroes brandishing guitars shed built would you mind if i passed i said if i had a good excuse id pass too zero showed up at the site and invited me personally what time do you think itll be over late how about if i come by before and we grab some dinner what about spike i can bring takeout that would be great when should i get there soon as possible i picked up earplugs at a pharmacy in point dume and sandwiches and drinks at a deli nearby it took forty minutes to get to the jobsite several trucks were pulling away and robin was conferring with a barechested man with a tobaccostained walrus mustache nearly bald except for some yellow back fringe and a ponytail he was concentrating hard as she spoke she saw me and waved and continued to talk to him waving a roll of blueprints spike was on the rear bed of her truck and he stuck his frog face above the tailgate and barked i went over and lifted him out he licked my face and waved his forelegs in the air and when i put him down he stood up hugged my knees and rubbed his head against my leg what a handsome guy you are i said handsome was his favorite word after meat loaf he started panting then his nose went after the bag in my hand robin said okay larry in a tone of voice that meant she was working at patience yes maam so lets try for inspection by next monday if there are any other problems let me know right away she shifted the blueprints to the other hand yes maam for sure larry looked at me this is dr delaware he pays the bills sir said larry were fixing up a nice new place for you you bet great i said he scratched his head walked up toward the house and began talking to another worker the pond was empty and half filled with dirt what had once been a garden was a muddy pit the new houses roof points sliced the sky at sharp angles the sun that showed through was platinumwhite what do you think she said very nice soon she kissed my cheek i kept looking at the construction the framing was complete and the walls had been papered and partially mudded the mud was ridged with trowel marks and still wet in spots the original house had been redwood walls and a cedar roof kindling on a foundation the fire marshal had called it the new building would be stucco and tile id get used to it robin put her arm around me and we walked to the truck sorry about tonight hey everyone has their emergencies heres something for your sanity i gave her the earplugs and she laughed pulling down the tailgate she spread an army blanket and we set out the food we ate listening to the sounds of hammer guns and saws feeding spike bits of sandwich and watching birds circle overhead soon i felt pretty good i brought spike home fed him dinner took him for a jog on the beach and settled him in front of the tube then i showered changed into fresh clothes and headed for woodbridge hospital making it to the parking lot by seven the psychiatric unit was on the third floor behind swinging doors labeled locked i pressed a buzzer gave my name and heard the tumblers click pushing i entered a long welllit hallway the chocolate carpet was freshly vacuumed the walls a pleasant brownishwhite ten closed doors on each side the nursing station at the end one nurse sat there soft conversation came from somewhere along with television dialogue radio music and an occasional ringing phone when i got to the station the nurse said dr delaware yes here it is lucretias in thats back there on the left side she was very young and had yellow cornrowed hair studded with tiny blue ribbons and beautiful teeth i retraced my steps before i got to the door to opened and a small sweetfaced woman around fifty looked out at me she wore a pink dress pearls and pink pumps the back wall of her room was covered with family photos and the aroma of chocolate chip cookies poured out have a nice day she said smiling i smiled back trying not to look at the bandages around her wrists her door closed and i knocked on lucys come in the room was eight by eight painted that same brownishwhite with a bed a fakewood nightstand a tiny doorless closet and a desk and chair that looked childsized the tv was mounted high on the wall the remote control bolted to the nightstand next to it was a stack of paperbacks the top one was entitled grievous sin no bathroom a single immovable window embedded with metal mesh offered a view of the parking lot and the supermarket that was the hospitals neighbor lucy sat on the bed on top of the covers dressed in jeans and a white buttondown shirt her sleeves were rolled to the elbow her hair was pinned up and her feet were bare an open magazine rested in her lap she could have been a college girl relaxing in a dorm room hi she put the magazine aside good homemaking the cover promised holiday snacks your family will love you for hows it going i said sitting in the chair ill be glad to get out of here they treating you okay fine but its still prison i spoke to dr embrey she seems nice nice enough flat voice i waited nothing against her she said but im not going to have anything to do with her when i get out whys that because shes too young how much experience could she have did she do or say something to weaken your confidence no shes smart enough its just her age and the fact that shes the one whos keeping me in a jailors a jailor once im out im finished with this place and anyone associated with it do you think thats foolish i think you need someone to talk to what about you i smiled and touched the gray at my temple so im old enough for you youre experienced dr delaware and weve already got a relationship why start from scratch i nodded you dont agree she said ill never abandon you lucy but you think i should see embrey her voice had tightened i think ultimately you make the choice i dont want you to feel abandoned but i also dont want to sabotage dr embrey she seems very capable and shes interested in you shes a kid i said nothing she scooted to the edge of the bed and sat there legs dangling toes brushing the carpet so thats it for my therapy with you ill always be here for you and ill help you any way i can lucy i just want you to do whats best for you she looked away who knows maybe i dont even need a therapist she turned back to me sharply do you really think i tried to kill myself it looks that way lucy a painful smile flickered well at least youre honest and at least you call me lucy they call me lucretia he gave me that name after lucretia borgiahe hates women jos full name was jocasta hows that for oedipal what about your brothers no the boys names are okay he let the boys be named by their mothers he was only out to ruin the girls ruin how rotten names for one how can i have confidence in this place when they dont even respect me enough to call me what i want i keep telling them lucy but each time a new nurse comes on shift all they do is read the chart lucretia this lucretia that how are you lucretia she got up and looked out the window i didnt put my head in that oven she said i have no idea how i ended up there but i didnt do it not sleepwalking or any other way how can you be sure because i just know not that id ever tell embrey that shed think im crazy she doesnt i said and neither do i but i do think you might have done it while sleepwalking its unusual but not impossible maybe for someone else but not me she turned around shed cried and moisture streaked her cheeks i know it sounds bizarre and paranoid but someones trying to kill me i told embrey i changed my mind about that because i didnt want her to lock me up forever but theres something you should know about can i tell you in confidence without your telling her that puts me in a bind lucy okay she said i understand i dont want to do that to you but either way she wont know not until i get out of here we didnt speak she dried her eyes and smiled thanks for coming thanks for doing what you think is right i didnt put my head in that oven why would i do that i want to live she dried her cheeks those phone calls i thought they were nothing maybe they were nothing but i am going to tell you even though youll probably think im nuts and ill get locked up till whoknowswhen she began to cry i put my hand on her shoulder and it made her cry harder when she stopped she said i so dont want to be locked up i cherish my independence i wont do anything to lock you up if you promise not to hurt yourself thats easy i dont want to hurt myself i promise dr delaware i swear she sat quietly for several moments one time right after i started seeing you i came home and found some of my stuff moved what kind of stuff clothes underwear im no neat freak but i do have places for everything and my panties and bras had been moved reversed in the drawer as if someone had taken them out and put them back folded a way i never fold them and one pair of panties was missing why didnt you tell anyone about this i dont know it only happened once and i thought maybe i was imagining it id just done a load of laundry the day before i figured it was possible id left the panties in the machine and maybe i had put my stuff back differently absentminded i mean im not the kind of person to imagine the worst but now i realize someone must have been in my place she grabbed my arm maybe thats why i started having the dream again because i felt threatened i dont know sometimes i think i am imagining everything but im not crazy i patted her shoulder and she let go of my arm did ken really save me yes whats he like he seems nice another thing im worried about is wheres puck embreys giving me some story about his calling her from new mexico but that makes no sense he called ken from there too she took hold of my arm again harder then why hasnt he called me i was silent it doesnt make sense she said he told both dr embrey and ken that he was on some kind of business trip he had a dinner date with ken a couple of nights ago but didnt show up thats how ken came to save you he was looking for puck at your place because puck told him you were close we are puck never told me about any dinner date it was a trial balloon the two of them had worked out to see how theyd get along if they did they were going to get you involved protecting me typical she stood up and yanked her hair loose pucks always trying to protect me even though so why hasnt he called even though what hesitation even though hes not the toughest guy in the world himself what does he do for a living another pause different things over the years she turned around brown eyes hot right now hes not doing anything he has three years of college with a major in history try to find something decent with that well im sure hell be back soon and well straighten it out ive got lots of things to straighten out thank god im getting out soon i left the hospital parking lot and got onto the freeway i agreed with embrey lucy really believed she hadnt tried to kill herself had the walk to the oven occurred during sleepwalking not impossible i supposed for some people slumber could be a shadow life some sleepwalkers denied walking lots of snorers claimed they were silent id seen patients experience shrieking night terrors only to wake up the next morning claiming theyd had sweet dreams the man whod tried to strangle his wife in his sleep refused to believe it until confronted by videotape and lucy did have a history of fractured sleep so maybe it all boiled down to a physiological quirk but what of her newly expressed belief that someone had stolen her underwear the hangup calls delusional thinking embrey had found no psychosis or major personality disorder and neither had i both of us wanting to believe the best even milo had put aside his cop cynicism and gotten more involved with her than anyone hed met on the job before i remembered his guilt as he aired his doubts about her credibility my quick response that she was needy rather than manipulative i thought about the way shed just gotten me to promise not to collude in locking her up my gut was telling me she was sincere but was that worth as much as i wanted to believe should i have tried to convince her to stick with embrey maybe embrey could handle that on her own who knows maybe i dont even need a therapist had i let that go by too easily should haves could haves tomorrow night shed sleep in her own bed i hoped i hadnt made a terrible call i hoped freedom wouldnt kill her milo phoned the next day just after noon and i recounted my visit to woodbridge and lucys feelings about wendy embrey whats embrey like personable bright motivated but she aint you im not sure lucyll want me either last night she made noises about dropping out of therapy completely a moment later shes telling me shes scared someones out to get her i told him about the underwear all of a sudden she remembers this she passed it off as absentmindedness same way she dismissed the phone calls as technical problems like i said shes not one to play victim has a hard time being dependent she talks about her brother peter as being her sole protector but hes not exactly coming through out of town on urgent business even though he hasnt worked for years and he took the time to phone ken and embrey but not lucy avoiding her looks like it lucy insists theyre close but hes an odd one i met him once when he came with her to a session refused to come in and sat in the car the whole time kind of withdrawn withdrawn as in schizo it was only a brief encounter and i didnt pick up anything bizarre more like intensely shy he was protective enough to shield her from meeting ken right away but when i asked lucy what he did for a living she got very defensive and started making excuses for his being unemployed as if shes used to protecting him now that shes in crisis his failing to come through for her could be traumatic another abandonments the last thing she needs should i visit her embrey suggested you take a low profile for now and i agree meaning you dont volunteer but if she approaches you dont turn her away whens she getting out tomorrow all right youre the doctors anyway what i was calling about is i talked to malibu sheriffs and they faxed me if youre still interested in the dream one way or the other its relevant to lucys mental state well nothing juicy no homicides or attempted homicides of females in the entire beach area from june to november of that year and of the eight rapes theyve got seven were up in oxnard no victim matches to the longhaired girl two of them were probable domestics middleaged women two were little kids and the other three were mexican bar scenes with hookers all charges dropped the eighth one was malibu but nowhere near topanga ranch up in decker canyon some cowboys getting drunk and assaulting a lady horse groom did the lady have long hair the lady was fiftyfive two hundred pounds and grayhaired no topanga missing females either during that time span they did send me paper on four missing persons cases in the area that never got closed but once again they were all north oxnard and malibu given the flavor of the times flower children hitchhiking four doesnt seem like a lot do any of the four match the girl in the dream i didnt really study them alex hold on let me pull them out number one is jessica martina gallegos oxnard sixteen years old high school sophomore black hair brown eyes five one hundred and fifty doesnt sound long and leggy to me last seen waiting for a bus at ten pm in front of the teatro carnival on oxnard boulevard the pictures came through the fax pretty grainy but i can see enough to tell you she doesnt have long flowing hair short and curly and light with dark roots number two iris mae jenrette thirtytwo fivefour oneten blond and green last seen at the beachrider motel point dume apparently this one was out from idaho on a honeymoon had a fight with hubby took the car and split didnt come home long hair but its ultraplatinum and teased want the other two why not karen denise best nineteen fiveseven oneseventeen blond and blue waitress at the sand dollar restaurant in paradise cove last seen working the dinner shift reported missing by parents from new bedford mass they didnt get their weekly phone call and number four christine nomiddlename faylen also nineteen fivefive onetwenty brown and brown freshman at colorado state another tourist traveling with two friends staying at a rented place in venice says here she went for a coke on the beach at zuma and didnt return to her buddies both of those have long straight hair but only faylens is dark fivefive onetwenty i said slender she could be leggy and the circumstances are interesting going for a drink in broad daylight and not coming back and what she ends up in topanga ten fifteen miles away at a party for all we know she showed up the next day and the friends never bothered to let the sheriff know missing persons cases are like that and no red flags on any of these my vote is lucy never witnessed any crime alex either she saw people having sex and misconstrued it or daddy andor scumbag trafficant did something to her or the whole things total fantasy im sure youre right but but what theres a but in your voice would you mind if i did a little followup what kind of followup calling the families of the four missing girls especially faylen why alex to eliminate as many variables as possible for whoever ends up doing therapy with lucy for lucy herself shes sounding more and more confused the clearer the information we have the more likely we are to get close to the truth what if no one ends up doing therapy with lucy you said she wanted to drop out then i wasted a few phone calls lets say she ends up on your doorstep wouldnt you want to know as much as possible if she starts convincing herself she witnessed a murder guess so okay herere the numbers i hope for your sake all of them did show up twentyone years of grief aint a pleasant thing to dig up id copied down jessica gallegos last seen parents mm ernesto gallegos iris jenrette husband james jenrette karen best parents mm sherrell best christine faylen shelley anne daniels lisa joanne constantino parents mm david faylen i sat for a long time trying to figure out how to cushion the shock of each call then i punched buttons the gallegos home number was now our lady of mercy thrift shop the venturaoxnard directory listed a couple of dozen gallegoses none of them ernesto or jessica the high school student would be close to forty now maybe married maybe with kids of her own i turned to the next number iris jenrette boise a woman answered is james jenrette there hes at work whos this im calling about

now youll have to call him back after nine hes working late at the store sure i said dial tone the best familys number in massachusetts was busy and at the faylen household i got a recorded message an older womans voice softened by an undertone of laughter hi youve reached the home of cynthia and dave were not in or maybe we are and are just too darn lazy to get off our butts and come to the phone so if youre one of those persistent types wait for the proverbial beep and speak your proverbial piece i tried denver information for a listing on christine faylen and got one immediately law offices christine faylen please the office is closed this is the exchange id like to reach ms faylen its important one moment a few minutes later a woman came on chris faylen ms faylen im calling from the

kind of case an individual here in las having memories of seeing a young woman abducted at a certain time and place weve been reviewing missing persons cases that might be related memories what some kind of psychic cause we went through all that no this is a possible witness but i have to emphasize its very tenta what time and place are you talking about the malibu area midaugust your sister was working as a waitress at a place called the sand dollar before that she worked in beverly hills waitressing yeah a chinese place ah loo she got jobs in the fancy neighborhoods because she wanted to be an actress and thought shed run into movie stars god knows who she did run into what makes you think it was karen this witness saw we dont think anything of the sort mr best the investigations still at a very early stage and im sorry if this investigation he said we could never get malibu sheriffs to do a serious one so what are you investigating would you mind verifying a few things for me i read off karens height and weight he said yeah thats right blond hair jesus he said i cant believe thats still on there we told them she dyed it brunette that summer brilliant why why what whyd she go from blond to brunette its usually the other way around that was her point everyone in la was blond she wanted to stand out her natural hair was gorgeous my parents thought it was what color hair did

years of grief sherrell bests number stared up at me it wasnt going to get easier a womans taped voice answered welcome to the church of the outstretched hand if youre calling about food donations our warehouse is located on sixteenseventyeight north cahuenga boulevard between melrose and santa monica our dropoff chute is open twentyfour hours a day figuring it for a wrong number i hung up redialed and got the same tape this time i listened to the end specially canned goods powdered milk and baby formula if youre calling for spiritual guidance our twentyfourhour help line is i copied that number down the tape ended with a quote from first corinthians christ our passover is sacrificed for us therefore let us keep the feast not with old leaven neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth the help line was answered by another woman i asked for sherrell best the reverends out in back with the packages can i help you i gave her the police psychologist semitruth the police she said is there some problem its concerning the reverends daughter karen her voice jumped an octave yes one minute seconds later a man said sherrell best

that wont be necessary coffee then or tea coffee coffee he said as if committing a menu to memory i look forward to it sir god bless you at eightfifteen i left robin and spike in the garage workshop and drove over malibu canyon to the midway through the valley it turned into the and a few miles later i connected to the glendale freeway south and got off just past eagle rock in highland park the streets were dark hilly and tilting crowded with small houses duplexes and apartment buildings on scratch lots suburban silence broken by a constant freeway dirge runt lawns hosted old cars and trucks the neighborhood had once been workingclass white now it was mostly workingclass hispanic gangs had made some inroads a police chief had lived there but that hadnt made much difference sherrell bests home was a single that overlooked a dry wash and the six lanes of asphalt that paralleled it a box with a lowpitched tar roof the stucco was sprayed on and looked pink in the nightlight the grass was split by a concrete walkway iron grating shielded the windows spanish music came from the place next door bests place was silent but all the lights were on custardcolored patches behind woven curtains a twentyyearold olds sat in the driveway he was at the front door before i got there a small round man with a small round head he wore blackrimmed glasses a washandwear white shirt and a narrow gray clipon tie dr delaware he said holding the door open then closing it behind us and doublebolting the house smelled of canned vegetable soup the front was divided between a low narrow living room and a dining area even more pinched the furniture was old and fussylooking and arranged very neatly polished wood tables with queen anne legs beaded lamps with floral shades overstuffed chairs sleeved with doilies a gray hooked rug spread on the vinyl floor like a sleeping pet the walls were covered with framed posters of biblical scenes all the characters looked nordic and on the brink of emotional collapse heres our coffee sir please sit down the dining table was bridgesized and metallegged crowded with an electric percolator two plastic cups on saucers a box of sugar a pint container of halfandhalf and a plate of oreo cookies next to that was a twofootsquare cardboard box labeled karen in black marker we sat down facing each other and best picked up the pitcher and started pouring his complexion was florid and mottled like raw sweetbreads and his blue eyes popped behind thick lenses furrows scored his brow as if the flesh had been plowed the rim of his collar bit into his neck flesh like a knife in shortening his mouth was thin his nose wide and bulbous with large pores the little hair he had was slicked and black karen looked like her mother he said cream and sugar black is fine i took the cup mrs best was beautiful he said talk of our town was what did she ever see in me short laugh wide spaces between brown teeth lots of silver fillings my son craig took after her too here have an oreo karen used to break them apart and eat the filling first she could spend half an hour on one cookie behind him against a backdrop of fruiting trees and golden wet sheaves a weteyed ruth embraced naomi he filled his own cup so what exactly led you to karen just what i told you reverend memories do you have children doctor no his lips puckered and his eyes closed for a moment here reaching for the box let me show you what ive got and you tell me if any of it helps you standing he shoved his hands deep into the carton like a surgeon rearranging viscera what little space was left on the table quickly filled with spiral notebooks bound stacks of newspaper clippings and other papers he untied the clippings first and passed them to me the newsprint was brittle and dry the color of weak tea the cutouts were twentyone years old all from a beachside throwaway called the shoreline shopper best ate a cookie then another as he watched me read the first pages were taken from the classifieds two months worth of a personals ad circled in blue lost reward karen denise best yo blond hair maybe dyed brown blue eyes speaks with a new england accent appendectomy scar our daughter was last seen walking up the road to pch at the sand dollar restaurant in paradise cove we love her very much and miss her and we are worried please call collect any hour to any information leading to finding her will be rewarded did anyone ever call i said lots of people called liars and practical jokers and some wellmeaning people who thought theyd seen her i paid out eighteen hundred and fiftyfive dollars he poked a finger under his glasses rubbing his eye i turned back to the clippings the last was an article from the oped page written by the editor of the paper a woman named marian sonner and surrounded by ads for local shops a poorquality photo of a beautiful fairhaired girl was set in the middle of the text even the blurred reproduction couldnt hide the innocence and enthusiasm on the heartshaped face father travels from east in quest for missing daughter malibu special to the shopper sherrell best is a determined man maybe even stubborn but whos to blame him isnt stubbornness part of the american dream malibuites raised in the midst of the great depression he fought in world war ii rising to the rank of sergeant came back and married his high school sweetheart the lovely eleanor and built up a plumbing supplies business from scratch to top it off he and eleanor had two younguns beautiful blond karen and two years later frecklefaced craig so far so good then it crumbled out here no less in golden so cal where the waves are blue and the sky is too and sometimes what happens to people isnt all sun and prettiness malibu the golden heart of a golden state where peace and freedom and love are the bywords of a new generation thats never experienced the hardships of its forebears karen beauty of face and form and heart prom queen and volleyball player and lover of dogs left vying suitors in new bedford mass to chase the dream hollywood the silver screen she came on greyhound and learned that the dream was played out in beverly hills and malibu to some of us those places are just home but to karen they were glamour and excitement the dream like so many others she ended up slinging hash or should i say catch of the day sorry marv and barb damato of sand dollar fame like so many others but then unlike so many others she disappeared vanished like the smog when the beach breeze hits it she was last seen six months ago leaving marv and barbs sd on foot after the night shift and thats the last anyone saw of her vanished the sheriffs looked for her they did their best were proud of our men in tan but they didnt find her neither did a gumshoe hired by sherrell and his beloved eleanor so sherrells out here from massachusetts staying at the beachrider motel and living off savings trying to find his princess this is her picture karen best her hair might be dark she wrote home that she was dying it to look more exotic vanished sherrells a determined man hes not rich but hell pay a hefty reward to anyone who can find karen maybe youve seen him handing out flyers in the parking lot at alexanders market or in front of bill and sandy levingers shell shack or the frostee kup down by cross creek asking his questions have you seen this girl maybe youve walked right by him maybe you just shook your head and said poor guy no matter hes a determined man he wont give up help him malibuites if you can maybe this story can have a happy ending maybe this really is a generation of peace and freedom and love maybe i put the page down best said she meant well she was a sweet old woman died a few months later and the paper went out of business did you pay for the article i paid for many things no regrets he took off his glasses and rubbed his eyes some more more coffee no thanks did the sheriffs do a thorough job i suppose they did their job asking questions of the same people id spoken to finally they mounted a real search for one day in the canyons and gullies then they flew a helicopter over the coastline for an hour or so they said the layout made it impossible to do much more too much brush places that were hard to get to i dont think they really believed shed be found there they were convinced shed run away with a boy was any of this in the major newspapers i said the papers werent interested i phoned all of them over and over they never returned my calls part of it was the way things were back then all those hippie boys and girls dropping out but karen wasnt like that im not saying she was a perfect angel but she was no hippie when did you hire the private detective after the sheriffs stopped returning my calls i hired two of them really its all here he handed me a white sheet of paper perfectly typed karen people involved i law enforcement a la county sheriffs dept malibu station deputy shockley took the call but nothing else dep lester took report sgt concannon in charge of search his superior lt maarten but never met him various eagle scouts under sgt

napoli took the money and another thousand i paid him for investigation and left town he smiled i dont regret my foolishness hope maketh not ashamed after napoli swindled me i went to a third firm one that advertised finding missing people within fortyeight hours they took a consultation fee and said all that could be done had been after the first one whyd you hire someone out in hollywood i was hoping someone from the outside could see clearer barnard was slow very easygoing all of malibu seemed that way people smiling but moving very slowly id never been to california wasnt used to it when did you move out here two years later permanently that is before that i was coming out every two months for a couple of weeks at a time i stayed in motels or lived in a rented car driving up and down the coast every day from manhattan beach to santa barbara once i went as far north as san simeon every canyon or state park id pass id drive through walk around talking to the rangers ground crews campers anyone it became my job my business suffered then mrs best developed an aneurysm and died and i sold what was left of the business and came here to settle craig and taffy were starting out and i let them live in the house a few years later they bought it it was a good time for me to leave they needed their own life and i wanted to devote myself to looking for karen i spent ten hours a day in the car hoping one day id run into her somewhere maybe shed lost her memory and was somewhere he pushed the cookies away what does your witness remember just what i told you reverend a young girl being carried away by some men thats vague yes it is and im sorry i cant promise you it means anything i tried to return the data sheet no thats a copy take it ive got plenty i folded it and put it in my pocket a young girl he said long dark hair long legs when karen was a little girl we used to call her storkie for stork where does your witness is it a man or a woman im not at liberty to say he frowned where does this witness think this abduction occurred some sort of rustic site maybe a log cabin trees all around he pressed his belly against the table edge youre a police psychologist you could hypnotize this person couldnt you that helps with memory thats a possibility why not a probability the witness is in a fragile state of mind how fragile im sorry i cant say any more yes yes of course sorry but you are going to follow up ill do whatever i can reverend you work for the police department im a private consultant the witness is a patient of mine a police detective is aware of what im doing but its not official yet the bulging eyes narrowed why are you going to all this trouble to help my patient he looked at me for a long time youre a devoted fellow i shrugged he fiddled with his glasses looked at his coffee but didnt touch it i highly advise that you find some way to talk to gwen and tom shea on the sheet shes listed by her maiden name peet but theyre married now they worked with karen at the sand dollar worked with her that last shift ive always felt they knew more than they let on whys that the way they acted when i spoke to them shifty nervous felix barnard said they seemed innocent to him so did the sheriffs they were both local kids good reputations neither had any sort of criminal record but ill tell you one thing when i asked them about karen they couldnt look me in the eye theyd been friends with her gwen waited tables tom tended bar why would talking about her make them uncomfortable and they left the restaurant just a few minutes after karen did karen was walking but they were in a car doesnt it make sense that they would have overtaken her maybe someone picked her up who would she have allowed to pick her up she wasnt dating anyone had no close friends and she never would have hitchhiked we talked about that before she left massachusetts his voice remained low but his eyes bulged even more and the ridges in his forehead were wet im sure theyre hiding something i know what guilt looks like i pulled the paper out of my jacket unfolded it and circled the two names i kept going back to them said best offered them money the last of my cash before i started selling off the stocks and bonds they wouldnt even talk to me finally tom called the sheriff complained i was harassing them i returned a few days later anyway wanting to catch gwen alone she wouldnt open the door and the next day tom came to my motel and threatened to beat me up if i didnt leave them alone was that the end of it he sighed i did drive by their house once or twice a week then they upped and left moved out of malibu if that isnt guilt i dont know what is i called up the restaurant pretending to be a friend and was told theyd gone to aspen but theyve been back in malibu for over sixteen years own a place called shooting the curl surfing supplies shop near the pier doing very well i might add tom drives one of those bmws and gwen has a fancy van you still drive by only once a year dr delaware on the anniversary of karens disappearance do you do anything else do i try to talk to them no what would be the use for me its a day of reflection i drive from santa monica to santa barbara if i see a homeless person i stop and give them food sometimes i pull over at a campsite but i dont talk to anyone or show karens picture what would be the sense showing the picture of a nineteenyearold girl he looked down hooked his fingers under his glasses and rubbed his eyes again shes almost forty by now but i still think of her as nineteen dont worry doctor i dont bother the sheas whatever they did they have to live with and they have their own troubles now a crippled child maybe one day theyll come to see that providence and fate emanate from the same place when you approach them dont mention my name im sure they think of me as a raving lunatic how long was karen out in california before she disappeared five months how often did she write she never wrote she phoned always on sunday and sometimes on wednesday and friday thats why we were alarmed that first sunday she was like clockwork when it came to those sunday phone calls we phoned the restaurant and they said she hadnt shown up for work i assume she never said anything on a previous call that hinted at her disappearance nothing she was happy enjoying the weather enjoying her job everything was fine she was trying to earn enough money to enroll in acting school did she say which school no it never got that far how did you feel about her becoming an actress we didnt really think shed become one we thought shed try awhile and come back go to college meet someone nice his lip quivered my wife took most of the calls i was usually at the store after karen disappeared i grew to hate the store gave it to craig but he sold it and got a job with the state building and safety after i moved here my first year was taken up completely by looking for karen the second year too but nothing was turning up i had time on my hands and started to read the bible till then i wasnt a religious man id gone to church but i thought about profits and losses while pretending to worship this time the bible started to mean something to me i found a seminary in eagle rock and enrolled got ordained five years later and started the church do you know what we do distribute food to poor people to anyone we dont ask questions no one gets paid i live off my social security and the few bonds i have left and the others are all volunteers restaurants donate the food its a good life i only wish karen were here to see it he gobbled a cookie and swallowed coffee that had to be cold i looked at the cardboard box he emptied the rest of the contents onto the table im going to clean up clearing the dishes he began washing them i opened the first of four photograph albums covering karen bests development from infancy to young womanhood taped to the second was a tiny envelope labeled first haircut holding the packet up to the light i saw several curly snippets inside grade school graduation program karen the winner of a good citizenship award high school yearbook karen in french club and song girls karrie her eyes speak volumes a prom shot karen beautiful and maturelooking by now her blond hair long and silky and curled at the ends on the arm of a gawky boy with a dark beatles do and a struggling mustache a dessicated orchid corsage in a stiff plastic packet embossed with the name of a new bedford florist a hundred or so copies of the sheet best had given me bound by rubber bands a copy of the lords prayer i put it all back best was standing over the kitchen sink hands in plastic gloves the water full blast and steaming i went in as he washed he stared at something over the faucet another bible picture this one a blackandwhite etching a young woman being dragged by her hair dinahs abduction by shechem bests gloved hands were clenched the steam had fogged his glasses and his lips moved rapidly praying when i got back i read the bible what i learned made it hard for me to fall asleep the next morning robin and i had breakfast in town then i drove back to the library and had a second look at the newspaper account of the sanctum party august karen best had been last seen the night before after xeroxing the article i called milo he was out but del hardy picked up the black detective was milos occasional partner but they hadnt worked together recently hey doc hows it going pretty good hows the guitar sitting in a closet no time to play listen bigfoots finishing up a robbery at the smart shop on palms maybe you can catch him he gave me the number and i talked to a female officer who finally put me through to milo morning salutations he sounded distracted dont want to bug you but nah im finished here whats up i told him the best girl he said wasnt she a blonde she dyed her hair that summer and according to her brother she had very long legs it may turn out to be nothing but i just it uhoh tv crew just drove up gotta split where are you westwood meet me at rancho park on the north end past the baseball diamond take the first entrance past the golf course and go as far as you can youll know me cause i wont be feeding the ducks i got there a quarter hour later and found him on a bench near a cement wading pond that had been drained but was still streaked with algae a stray retriever was nosing the grass no ducks or people in sight i showed him bests data sheet and the clipping and pointed out the date of the party night before she missed her call home for what its worth he skimmed and handed it all back to me you actually met with the father at his request how does he grab you devoted obsessive so you two got along great there was a certain rapport there i summarized what best had told me about the search for karen ending with his suspicion of the sheas so what does that have to do with lowell and trafficant paradise cove is what ten fifteen miles up from topanga she worked in paradise cove but she lived near topanga beach i passed the address coming into town just a hop and a jump from topanga canyon road then theres the time frame and her physical similarity to the girl in the dream crossing his long legs he looked up at the sky an airplane was writing something illegible he shook his head this father sounds obsessive to the point of nuttiness the way hes been bugging those people he says he hasnt done it for years if thats true it indicates selfcontrol he continued skygazing actually that does amaze me living in the same city with them believing they know something and letting it go maybe his work keeps him going he fills his days with good deeds food to the poor huh could be im a chump but he impressed me as a good guy milo trying to deal with his loss by finding some higher meaning the only thing that bothered me was a picture he had hanging up in the kitchen over the sink a bible print dinah being abducted by shechem he was staring at it as he washed the dishes i looked up the story when i got home its in the book of genesis dinah was jacobs daughter shechem was a canaanite prince who kidnapped her and raped her two of her brothers took revenge by slaughtering him and his whole village nice image for a man of the cloth to meditate on i dont want to light any fires under him i know what revenge can do he lowered his eyes and looked at me so whats the theoretical scenario here she took a nature hike on friday night ended up at lowells place the day before the party and got invited in not unless she was a serious hiker were talking several miles up to the top of topanga but maybe she was hitchhiking and got picked up and maybe the party started early or it was informal people drifting in at all hours i held up the clipping this makes it sound like a loose scene rather than some formal bash all those big shots and people are just wandering in you remember how things were back in the seventies peace love people playing at social equality best said that was one of the reasons the sheriffs didnt take karens disappearance seriously times were casual kids on the road everyone into freeandeasy he looked out at the baseball diamond and the rolling lawns beyond i spent the seventies grinding away in college then shooting at guys in black pajamas but i take your word for it i was a grind too i said but i remember hitchhikers thicker than gulls on pch best says karen was a good girl but shed been away from home for almost half a year and kids can change fast when they taste freedom plus she wanted to be an actress what if she was thumbing or just taking a short walk up the canyon unwinding after work and a person with a famous face pulled alongside her in a stretch limo telling her theres a hot party up the hill lots of other showbiz types hop in would an aspiring actress turn that down guess its plausible he said if the partying started early but even then all youve really got is a dream and a missing girl a girl who called home every week and then stopped and was never heard from again he faced me once more im not saying shes not dead alex sounds like she probably is but that doesnt mean she died up in lowells place and after all these years i dont see how youre gonna get any closer to it i dont either god i really hope i havent lit a fire under best at the very least im giving him false hope well he said if youre right about his being a man of faith maybe itll carry him through maybe i sat forward on the bench a tiny colorless spider had crawled onto my knee i picked it up carefully and its thread legs wriggled frantically placing it on the grass i watched it disappear among the blades milo said something has been bothering me though what you told me about brother peter guy never travels but he just happens to be out of town when she sticks her head in the oven unemployed but hes too tied up with business to get back then he takes the time to call embrey and a half brother he hasnt seen in twenty years but not lucy then you tell me hes weird and now lucys saying someone swiped her underwear and he has a key to her apartment you think he did it i think it sounds like hes running from something maybe nasty impulses maybe hes close to her in a way that scares him so he split to the desert to be alone with his goddamn thoughts oh man i said just what lucy needs i thought about my brief meeting with peter trying to remember as much as i could about him pale face sleepy voice cold hands bulky sweater on a hot day eager to get back to the car looking down at his lap what if hes running from something else i said i described the brother milo looked at me his big black eyebrows were up junkie it fits doesnt it his unemployment lucys defensive attitude evasive actually i remember her saying he was always trying to protect her even though heand then she broke off the sentence when i pressed she said even though he isnt the toughest guy in the world but it wasnt what she started to say i know its conjecture but he really wanted to get back inside that car when i glanced back he was sitting low in the seat as if he was doing something lucy looked back too and that session she dropped her chronic smile he could have been fixing right there she could have known junkie he repeated could be hungry hypes dont wait for a corner suite and fresh linens it would explain his cutting out on lucy in her time of need talking to everyone else but her because shed know he was traveling to make a buy and he didnt want to have to explain doesnt lots of stuff come into new mexico from the border he nodded but no shortage of stuff right here in la maybe he couldnt buy here because hed run up some serious debts that could be why he left town avoiding creditors the kind who dont send overdue notices my stomach tightened for all we know the creditors know about lucy and are trying to use her as leverage maybe those phone hangups were real maybe someone really did break in and mess with her underwear no one broke in he said she said there was no evidence of that okay so they tossed pucks place and found the key to lucys apartment thats awfully subtle for people like that he said theyd enjoy breaking in maybe its at a subtle stage intimidating him so he makes a big score for them and settles up maybe hes a longtime seller how else would he pay for his habit without a job lucys got a family trust fund that pays her a thousand dollars a month so he might too but with any kind of habit a thousand a month wouldnt go very far trust fund from lowells side of the family or the mothers lowells daddy abandons the kids but supports them its a generationskipping thing set up by his mother for taxes he may have no control over it leverage he said yeah be nice to blame it all on the dope demons and restore her credibility but i still dont see any connection to her head in the oven what if someone drugged her and put her there shes a creature of routine has a drink of juice every night watches pbs that would explain the drapes being open they wanted her to be found wanted to send a message to puck wouldnt that be something were all assuming shes lying or denying and shes telling the truth he rubbed his face it would absolutely be something alex it would be fantasyland cause theres no knot on her head and the hospital found nothing on her dope panel what if they gave her something the panel doesnt test for like chloroform hey he said you wanna theorize i say its more likely pucky himself tried to gas her pissed cause she wouldnt give him dope money or maybe hes just after her chunk of the trust fund and split town to give himself an alibi and hes calling ken to find out if shes dead you like that one i can make up six more like it for a quarter couple more quarters ill fill your day with fantasy off in the distance the retriever sniffed the air and bolted off after something youre right i said im lapsing into wishful thinking because id just love it if she didnt try to destroy herself but she did and for all i know puck never touched dope just a shy guy with circulatory problems no he said theres something off about him i wanted to check him out on the computer this morning but i got called to the market twoeleven at sixthirty first thing i do when i get back is play computer games got an address for him ken said studio city are you still going to check out trafficant sure why not im already pushing buttons poor lucy i said another hurt yeah he said hurt seems to be on her dance card it was pm when i got back to malibu while stopped at a red light near the pier i caught a look at shooting the curls facade white building blued windows a sign with fat white letters spelling out the name over a mural of a wetsuited surfer riding a big wave paradise cove was ten miles later a neon sign on a tall pole pointed toward the beach the sand dollar breakfast lunch dinner impulsively i turned off a dipping road took me past an acre or so of wildflowers then a trailer park shaded by huge shaggy eucalyptus between the trees the water was flat and silver another hundred feet and i came up against a guardhouse and a lowered wooden arm a sign said the beach was private and it would cost to go any farther unless i was eating at the restaurant the kid in the guardhouse stuck his head out his nose was peeling and his sunglasses were mirrored sand dollar i said five bucks he handed me a ticket get this stamped and ill give it back to you when you leave i drove down the final slope to a big wide parking lot the restaurant was down at the bottom set on the sand a woodshingled shuttered thing with a happy hour banner above the door inside was a dark waiting area carpeted in red felt paneled in cheap wood and hung with salteaten nautical gear no one was waiting but a cigarette was smoldering in an ashtray to the right was a cavelike bar with a couple of people bellying up and watching standup comedy on cable straight ahead was an empty hosts stand and beyond that the restaurant the main room was gigantic the way la restaurants used to be before the land boom with two long rows of red brassbuttoned booths and the same felt carpeting the entire beach wall was glass a big storm several years ago had sheared off onethird of the pier the remains jutted over the water a few tourists sat on the beach the people in the restaurant looked mostly like locals but there werent many of them and they were distributed thinly a couple of waitresses were working one young and redheaded the other in her fifties with a squat face and cropped gray hair both wore pink blouses black pants and red aprons their sleeves rolled up their eyes tired a busboy collected dishes from a table in the far corner the host was a tall heavy whitebearded man he noticed me and stopped talking to a busboy lunch for one i said and he took me to a window booth the older waitress showed up a few minutes later all business i ordered the anglers breakfast served all day deepfried red snapper eggs hash browns juice and coffee the food was good and i tried to eat slowly by the time i finished the restaurant was nearly empty and the waitress was nowhere in sight i finally spotted her in the bar smoking and watching tv and gave a wave she came over looking peeved her name tag said doris i handed her a twenty and the parking stub and she went to get change pulling out bests data sheet i scanned the names of the restaurant staffers doris reingold when she returned i said keep five for yourself and got a big smile thank you sir how was your meal excellent the anglers one of our popular ones i can see why looks like things are pretty quiet today it goes up and down on sunday no one gets in without a reservation that so all the hollywood people show up theyre over at their beach places for the weekend barbra streisand sits in that corner shes tiny we get chefs too like the guy who runs la poubelle they bring their kids i keep telling marvin to raise prices but he wont why not she shrugged old habits well probably be closed down by next year anyway marvins not healthy and they keep after him for the land its worth a fortune too bad ill have to come here more often while youre still open you do that i could use customers like you she laughed live around here just moved in i said near the county line on the beach i nodded ooh thats pretty i pass by there on the way home to ventura own or rent rent me too only the millionaires own right better believe it been working here for a while she pulled on a jowl and grinned it shows huh but i wont tell you exactly how long so dont even ask i smiled back so whatll you do if it closes down i dont know maybe catering all those chefs theres always something comes up not that i look forward to that you dont like catering big hassle used to do it years ago friend of mine she worked here too used to get catering jobs for herself and anyone else who wanted them good money but a big hassle she winked marvin never liked our moonlighting we did it behind his back im thinking of throwing a housewarming party could use a good caterer whos your friend she shook her head she doesnt do it anymore got rich owns her own business lucky her yeah what kind of business gets you rich nowadays she smiled at me youre living on the beach what do you do psychologist oh she winked again so maybe i shouldnt be talking to you dont worry off duty i said you know she said i wouldnta tagged you for that i figured you for a lawyer or the music business or something fingering her apron pocket where the tip had gone i used to play in a band i said cocktail lounges i know what its like to depend on peoples generosity aint that the truth and most of the time people arent thats what i hated about catering parties you see people at their worst to them youre a stick of furniture and no tips one collective service charge if the boss isnt honest youre sunk was your friend honest which oh her yeah honest enough you must have seen some interesting parties though working around here she reached for a cigarette mind i shook my head she lit up maybe to some it was interesting all it was to me was serving and clearing and people sticking their hands in my face she shook her head and looked back want more coffee maybe ill have some myself marvins in the john as usual love the company i said she got the pot and another cup sitting down opposite me cigarette fuming she poured for both of us its been real nice working here she said so close to the ocean howre things in ventura dying who knows maybe ill move got two grown boys both in the army ones in germany the others near seattle or nevada i like nevada things are booming there your rich friend cant help you find anything nah like i said shes out of it she and her husband own a surf shop nothing for me to do there shooting the curl yeah you know it ive passed by doesnt look like a big business believe me it is theyve got a place right on the sand at la costa own not rent and that aint spam salad she took a deep drag as her eyes swung toward the window here we go again i followed her eyes to the beach a camera crew was setting up sound trucks and vans were parked in the background and a couple dozen people were standing around commercials she said they come here all the time suntan lotion cars cocacola you name it pay marvin so much he doesnt have to raise his prices speaking of the devil she looked out toward the front of the restaurant the whitebearded man was coming toward us head down scowling arms swinging she stood and held out a hand to him smiling and muttering hold your horses marvin he stared at her then at me finally turned around and returned to his booth back to base she said stubbing out her cigarette nice talking to you nice talking to you too doris she said touching her badge ask for me the next time you come in ill get you a beach seat catering jobs contracted by gwen shea for anyone who wanted them all those chefs contacts had karen best gotten a job at the sanctum party gone up early to set up and never come back i sat in the car and had another look at bests data sheet felix barnard the private eye hadnt noted anything about moonlighting the others not telling him in order to hide it from marvin or maybe barnard just hadnt asked the right questions best had said the detective was slowmoving too laid back flipping through the rostale directory i looked for his name in both the yellow pages and the personal listings but found nothing house of cards but what doris had just told me tightened the connection between karen best and sanctum one tiny notch maybe sherrell bests intuition about the sheas was right on target doris was an eager conversationalist thered been no way to bring up karens disappearance with her but it was worth another try no telling what a little positive reinforcement could accomplish the names of the other sand dollar people sue billings mary andreas leonard korcik i got home and looked them up neither of the women was in the book but korcik l t was listed in encinal canyon a man answered tree farm leonard korcik please this is len are you the same leonard korcik who used to work at the sand dollar no thats my dad whos this im working with the police clearing some old missing persons cases a girl named karen best disappeared a number of years ago your dad was questioned about it and i just wanted to check a few things out my dad died three years ago im sorry did he ever mention karen best who karen best how long ago was this twentyone years he laughed i was seven years old then i never heard nothing what did your dad do at the restaurant worked the bar part time and cleaned up we got a tree farm you need any trees call me click wendy embrey phoned just before five cant be sure but my bet is shell be back in your court whys that the minute i told her i was authorizing her release she closed up friendly but clearly nothing to say what makes you think shell want to see me i asked her if youd visited and she lit up if i were you id be checking my transference meter regularly straining for graciousness but an edge had come into her voice im not so sure i said when i was there she said something about not needing any therapy at all great she said theres some aplus reality testing for you well you can only lead them to water lack of insight isnt grounds for extending the seventytwo anyway her father called me since im probably out of the picture i thought id pass that along when did he call this morning she read off a number very quickly was there a message i said copying nope just to call him good luck shes getting out tonight a woman answered yes dr delaware returning mr lowells call who im his daughters psychologist i thought she was seeing dr embrey shes off the case oh well if youre the doctor mr lowell will have a meeting with you about what lucretia i assume i couldnt do that without lucys permission hold on a few seconds passed then a very loud deep voice said lowell whore you alex delaware delaware the first state an ignoble little backwater what are you french canadian acadian coonass how can i help you mr lowell you cant help me at all maybe i can help you my boy snitched on the girls attempt to snuff herself the implication being of course that it was my damned fault nammer nammer nammer i doubt shes changed much the constipated squall basic character never does so i can give you some piercing insights unless youre one of those biopsychiatric frankenmaniacs who believes character is all a matter of serotonin and dopamines which of your sons called you the opium fiend who else peter selfsame whered he call from how would i know my girl took it and dont try arraigning me at the tribunal of ruined progeny guilt may be your stock in trade but its not my currency ill see you not tomorrow but the day after an hour at the most significantly less if you annoy me youll come to me i dont travel sorry i said i cant talk to you without lucys permission what he laughed so loud i had to move the phone away from my ear bedlam is the new olympus the lunatics rule the asylum what the fuck are you talking about confidentiality mr lowell there are no secrets boy not in the massagemessage age mcluhans books are a shitbin furor loquendibut its true were all staring up each others assholes very well youve lost your chance salaam as the arabs say to hell with everyone if lucy does consent i would like the opportunity to talk to you may i call you back may you he laughed again at your own risk you may also pass go or eat raw fish with the japs or take three baby steps or fuck yourself with a garden tool robin and i had dinner out on the deck the tide had whipped the sand like cream and the beach at twilight was a graying plane of peaks and troughs i couldnt stop thinking of my conversation with lowell had he missed a dose of lithium or was he cultivating nuttiness for attention he probably didnt get much attention anymore why had he called his offer to provide insights was almost comical the opium eater the hunch about peter confirmed maybe a shattered career and old age had finally caused lowell to survey the ruins of his family one child dead the other three estranged an addict an attempted suicide ken seemed a nice enough fellow but his antipathy for his father was right on the surface whats on your mind honey said robin nothing much she smiled and let her hand rest on my bicep i tried to chase away clinical thoughts and turned to her a trace of color remained in the sky a paint smear of salmon capping the sinking sun it played on the auburn in her hair and made her eyes coppery and catlike still at work she said stroking no more i drew her to me and kissed her deeply her tongue lingered in my mouth carpe foxum i said whats that seize the babe despite a decent nights sleep my first thought upon waking was lucys out of the hospital i wasnt happy with the idea of her trying to make it on her own but if i pushed shed probably back away so i decided to give her till noon before calling in the meantime id catch milo up on what doris reingold had told me he hadnt come into the station yet and no one picked up at his home i called the business number he used for his private moonlighting and the tape answered blue investigations i left a message it was just after nine robin and spike had been gone for over an hour i drove to the market at trancas and bought groceries thinking about all the places off the highway where a girl could disappear just as i got home milo phoned im at lucys place can you come out right now is she okay physically shes fine just come out well talk once you get here heres the address the street was three blocks north of ventura boulevard the block was treeless and sunfried all apartments mostly megaunits with underground parking and security gates that would give an experienced burglar pause for about twenty seconds for rent banners and real estate brokerage signs on most of them promises of movein incentives lucys building was older and smaller a twostory quadriplex of fleshtone stucco and dark red wood two units on top two below each open to the street with individual entrances set back from a covered walkway another for rent sign staked in the lawn near the groundlevel mailbox her apartment was number upstairs number was vacant her welcome mat featured a chipmunk saying hi the windows through which ken had seen her kneeling in the kitchen were masked by shades the doorjamb around the hinges was splintered a bit and nailed together kens breaking in to save her but the door was locked i rang the bell and milo parted the shades then let me in the front of the apartment was divided into living and dining areas the kitchen was a cubby with avocado cabinets and white appliances barely enough room to kneel all the walls were offwhite not that different from the psych unit at woodbridge the oven was a squat little twoburner kenmore maybe fifteen years old the dining room table was fake oak surrounded by three folding chairs in the living room were a tufted blue velvet love seat and two matching chairs a glasstopped coffee table and a inch television and a vcr on a rolling stand on top of the tv was a single photo of lucy and peter head shots no identifying background she was smiling he was trying to lucy sat on the blue couch barefoot wearing jeans and a baggy gray sweatshirt that said las the one her hands gripped each other and she looked up and gave me a struggling smile milo went and stood behind her his jacket was over a chair he wore his revolver in a waist holster he looked at the coffee table look but please dont touch a short stack of magazines had been pushed to one side next to it was a sheet of yellow ruled legal paper next to that a white envelope on the paper was a note typed offcenter crowding the left margin and the top of the page fuck you bitch in hell jobe dies you die twice below that was something affixed to the page with transparent strips of cellophane tape dark shriveled things the size and shape of olive pits rat turds said milo pending lab analysis but i dont need a tech to tell me mailed or delivered delivered delivered right inside said lucy i found it on the table when i got home last night what time was that three in the morning they let me out at one but then there was paperwork and i left some clothes up in my room and had to go back when i got here the door was unlocked but i just figured ken or the paramedics had forgotten to lock it trying to be calm her hands were white you came home alone she nodded i didnt notice it because i was tired just wanted to sleep i fell off then i woke up around five to get a glass of water and saw it who has keys to the apartment just peter and myself and the landlord i guess whos the landlord some old woman who lives in port hueneme said milo her handyman patched the jamb i just spoke to him and he claims he locked it when he was through anything weird about him mr gonsalvez said lucy no hes a sweetie and he couldnt have written that he barely speaks english milo nodded lucy hugged herself i found his eye is the lab on its way not yet to lucy why dont you pack those few things can i take a shower i really dont think anyone was in the bathroom sure she left a door closed and a few moments later the sound of the shower filtered through like heavy distant rain milo sat down where shed been he pointed to the chair without the jacket and i took it what do you think he said softly the timing is pretty convenient i said out of the hospital a few hours and she gets you right back here but what about our theory about peters loan sharks loan sharks tend to escalate the violence why would they gas her than regress to this maybe they came to do serious harm but didnt find her home or maybe they and peter have nothing to do with it what if it is someone connected to shwandt remember how the bogettes threatened justice or some other nut whos latched on to lucy someone who noticed her at the trial how would anyone know she was away they watched her stalked her remember she leaves her drapes open tension in my voice is there anything that makes you doubt her no thats the thing shes calmed down now but when i first got here she was petrified shaking either genuine terror or great acting alex and she doesnt have a typewriter so the note couldnt have been written here where else would she write it between two and five in the morning where the hell would she get rat shit thats reminiscent of shwandt he nodded was anything else disturbed i said no i took in the skimpy decor you should see the bedroom he said single mattress on a board a cheapie end table nothing on the walls her clothes arent bad but she doesnt have much nunnish he looked at me sharply i said so whats bugging you about it i just dont trust my instincts with her he dropped his chin into one palm black and gray stubble popped through the pockmarks how long have you been here i said since fiveforty it was after eleven whyd you wait so long to call me didnt want to interrupt your beauty sleep seriously he frowned and pushed hair off his forehead after i calmed her down we talked capital t i told her i was gay i know you warned me but it just seemed right i followed my instincts once in a while it works looking at me okay howd she take it almost as if she was relieved maybe she is i said on two counts shes not personally rejected and she can be with you while avoiding the mess of a sexual relationship whatever sorry if i jumped the gun alex i didnt want to screw anything up but sitting there holding her shes crying her head on my shoulder i could just see something happening and all she needed was another rejection i figured obviously you figured right his smile was slow to form mr validation ever think of working with people are you going to call the lab to do a crime scene if i do this could get really messy once those wheels start rolling itll be impossible to keep it quiet someones bound to talk bogeyman juror harassed its only a matter of time before the press dogs find out and start peeing all over it then they start focusing on her and learn she tried to kill herself and got committed whod love that shwandts lawyers i said mentally ill juror grounds for instant reversal especially coming on the heels of the copycat my bet is theyd get the whole thing thrown out lucy would be humiliated i said big time he got up and paced i looked over at the note is there any conceivable way this could be related to the copycat could the bogettes or someone else in shwandts camp have hatched up some scheme to get his conviction reversed who the hell knows those girls are crazy as shit lowiq fanaticism the worst kind it would sure be a lowiq plan no other jury will ever let shwandt walk the street again yeah but if hes in court they get to see him for all i know theyre planning to liberate him out of there i read the note again die twice could that mean humiliation as well as the real thing he shrugged the shower stopped okay he said till we clear this up priority one is keeping her safe if she manufactured this the worst thing is i get snookered so where do i stash her she says shes got no close friends and no family other than him glancing at the picture on the tv and he is a junkie by the way i know i said his father told me when did you speak with him yesterday i tried to get hold of you to tell you i have some other stuff to talk about too but lets figure out what to do with lucy first i could put her in a hotel but any place above a fleabag is gonna eat into her money pretty damn fast what about ken hes in real estate deals with distressed properties even if he doesnt have anything himself he might know of a lowcost shortterm rental here or up in palo alto maybe she should go out of town for a while its a thought he said she talked about him a little wanting to thank him for saving her but not knowing how to approach him how weird it was having a brother she didnt know then she changed the subject to the puckster worried that he hasnt called worried not angry worried i got the feeling shes been worrying about him for a long time im sure she has i said she say anything more about him no and i didnt push okay can you reach ken ive got his card the bedroom door opened and lucy came in the room toweling her hair definitely nothing else missing she said my stuffs all intact good said milo he got up and held out a chair for her another trial she said carries poor parents going through it again all the families you really think those horrible girls could be behind this we dont know said milo but publicitys their meat thats why we want to keep you safe and do it quietly my she bit her lip what lucy i said the oven id been starting to wonder if i really but do you think someone could have done that to me drugged me somehow remember how i mentioned feeling drugged to you a couple of sessions ago i nodded i thought i was just tired she said too much work not enough sleep but could it be anythings possible i said she raised her knees to her chin her arms were around her legs and her body looked very small well do what you need to get to the bottom of it dont worry about me ill handle whatever comes along publicity would mean more than just a new trial i said instant celebrity including the three days you spent at woodbridge that made her flinch oh the crazy juror oh boy looking at milo he said im going to fingerprint your apartment myself instead of calling in the lab itll take longer but ill be able to keep it under wraps depending upon what i find well take it from there has anyone visited you recently no no one ill also find you a temporary place for the next day or so after that we thought wed ask ken to look into something cause hes in real estate you okay with that guess so sure to me would he want to at the hospital he mentioned wanting to meet you though im sure hes a little nervous about it she smiled like im really scary the unknown is scary the smile faded she began packing and i returned to malibu and called kens office no secretary i spoke to his answeringmachine tape and he came on the line as soon as i mentioned my name hi doc whats up i told him someone broke in lucy said she found the door open when she came home shit i bet i left it open i was in such a hurry to get her to the hospital no the lock was fixed after that and the handyman claims the door was locked so either he was careless or someone jimmied it why would maybe someone was casing the neighborhood knew she was out did they take anything no they just left the note detective sturgis is looking into it but we need to keep it quiet to avoid publicity that might hurt lucy and give shwandt a retrial hurt her how if the story gets out someone could do some checking and find out about her seventytwo hours at woodbridge oh yeah i see what you mean that would be terrible in the meantime were trying to find a safe place for her to stay your brothers still out of town and we wondered if you could put her up in palo alto thats okay with lucy shes a bit nervous about meeting you but youd be doing her a great favor then sure but she doesnt even need to come up here the companys got lots of vacant properties in la most are lowincome but some are pretty nice i think theres a really good one in brentwood totally furnished i was planning to fly down tonight anyway let me check unless you think she should leave town no i said a secure place down here would be fine i could stay with her if thatll help i couldnt stick with her every moment but id be home most nights sounds good thanks ken sure no problem glad to be useful milo called at threethirty to say he was on the way over he arrived just after four got her over at the ramada on beverly drive and pico registered under my name he gave me the room and the phone number she okay by herself seems to be i gave her all the usual precautions though i cant see how anyone could possibly find her there after spending more time with her any new thoughts about her credibility she seems goddamn credible nothing shaky or flaky if shes lying shes either totally nuts or a stone psychopath and i cant believe im that gullible its not a matter of gullible all of us are like locks no matter how strong the bolt theres always a key out there that opens it so whatre you saying im a sucker for her you think shes lying i think shes a very confused young woman the dream now this im having trouble sorting out reality so i imagine its pretty tough for her you only answered one question do i think youre a sucker for her id term it emotionally susceptible and yeah you sure are do i think its bad no she needs help and youre providing it like you said the worst that can happen is you get snookered any more discussion about your being gay nope it didnt come up he looked burdened what i said whats the other stuff you said you wanted to talk to me about the karen best scenario looks a little less theoretical i was over at the sand dollar yesterday and happened to get served by a waitress named doris reingold she was on bests list been working there all this time she told me gwen shea recruited staffers regularly for nighttime catering gigs karens name didnt come up there was no way to work it into the conversation but best did say karen was friendly with the sheas its logical theyd have thrown some work her way so maybe she worked the sanctum party why didnt the private eye find any of this out maybe he was incompetent and didnt ask the right questions the staff kept catering gigs quiet the dollars owner didnt approve he pushed back from the table and stretched his legs you just happened to get served by her huh scouts honor and you just happened to be eating there place has a great view i said he looked at the glass doors like you need to go somewhere for that i didnt turn any rocks over i said doris thinks im just a friendly guy who tips big and its at least thoughtprovoking isnt it karen fits the girl in lucys dream she disappears the night before the party big bash like that could have taken a couple of days to set up maybe she went up early if the sheas hired her and something happened to her that would be a fine reason for them to act evasive with her father throw in trafficant and his disappearance and its a little more than random numbers wouldnt you say he walked over to the window okay my thoughts are provoked but lets not forget the only reason this came up in the first place is lucys dream and we still dont know how much of that is real karen bests disappearance is real and thered be no easy way for lucy to know that unlike the party it wasnt covered in the times best said all the major papers shined him on i got the copy of the shoreline shopper and handed it to him he paid for this the paper went out of business shortly after i doubt its catalogued in any library he read as i looked at the gulls says here no one saw her after she left the restaurant at eleven pm on friday never came home that night so youre saying she went up to sanctum and spent the night maybe she had a onenight stand with a guy a guy who picked her up and hurt her trafficant he was famous then what he offs her friday night or parties with her again on saturday and then offs her in the dream lucy remembers lights and noise maybe that was the staff setting up but it sounds more like the party itself the dream he said shaking his head so shes there working on saturday slinging designer hash to hundreds of people and no one remembers her theres no indication either the sheriffs or barnard made any connection to the party maybe because karen wasnt there he waved the clipping this is major coverage locally youd think someone around the beach area would have seen it that piece ran six months after the disappearance whos going to remember a waitress who served them half a year ago with lowell and movie stars at the party whod notice the staff period it would be nice to get hold of felix barnard and see if he has any of his old records but i cant find a listing on him some background on the sheas would be useful too like have they gotten involved in anything shaky since then i can pay another visit to the sand dollar and try to get more out of reingold the chef who catered the party would be another potential source for old time cards or personnel records that could verify karens presence some guy named nunez scones restaurant dead said milo aids couple of years ago you knew him rick knew him patched up a sliced finger in the er we went to his restaurant a couple of times and got comped vegetables id never seen before and the portions were too small he tapped the glass lightly have you punched trafficant into the computer yet he nodded nothing on ncic havent had a chance to look into his tax returns have you called his publisher no too late to do it now ill try tomorrow i may also get a chance to sound out his patron i described my conversation with lowell he said sounds like the asshole lucy says he is why his sudden interest good question peter phoned him from new mexico too and told him about lucys suicide attempt lowell implied it was an attempted guilt trip that didnt work he claims he has insights to offer on lucy though his tone was more contemptuous than concerned insights after all these years hes sure she hasnt changed much the only thing i can think of is hes trying in a bizarre way to get some kind of relationship going by being contemptuous hes a real piece of work milo spews out words nonstop he made such a point about not feeling guilty it could mean on some level he does feel responsible weird he said so old pucko continues to call everyone but lucy guy gives me a definite bad feeling like that picture on her tv shes smiling but he looks like he cant wait to get the hell out of there and jam a spike in his arm and hes more than a pennyante addict three arrests for possession of heroin and two for selling all within the last six years theres also a sealed juvenile record back in massachusetts and some misdemeanor stuff with boston pd the biggest bust was three years ago he tried to peddle thirty grand worth of smack to an undercover cop got off on technicalities case dismissed gary mandel was his lawyer ever hear of him no exprosecutor specializes in serious dope cases very big retainer think pucks connected thirty g doesnt make him king smack but it does make him more than a streetcorner pusher if he was playing with the bigtentacle crowd and offended someone that would explain the quick escape whatever lucy aint winning any family values sweepstakes hope ken turns out to be a good egg when you gonna go see daddy im not unless lucy wants me to and im not going to bring it up until im sure it wont agitate her yeah he turned toward the tide pools a couple of skiffs were floating out near the kelp beds god its gorgeous here you could forget what planet youre on sure could i said but i was thinking of log cabins and the crushing terror darkness could bring to a small childs mind the phone rang jolting both of us i picked it up doctor ken lowell im still in palo alto but i wanted you to know i got that brentwood place set up for lucy im catching a seven oclock flight should be able to be there by eightthirty nine do you want me to come by and pick her up or should i just meet you there i asked milo tell him to meet us i did see you then said ken he gave me an address on rockingham avenue hows she holding up fine good we lowells are tough built to take it he hung up i gave milo the address and he wrote it down he returned to the table glanced at the shoreline shopper piece and headed for the door ill see what i can do about locating the pi regards to beauty and the beast where are you off to get lucy some dinner and then well drive over to brentwood get her set up im glad he came through finally someone in the family does yeah i was planning to spend the night with her rented a suite two separate bedrooms and all no one had called by ten the next morning so i phoned the brentwood house ken answered yawning oh hi we didnt get to sleep till late hold on ill get lucy seconds later morning dr delaware hows everything fine i just got up ken and i were up late talking hold on pleasebye ken he just left to buy some groceries hes nice i keep thinking about puck im sure hell be back any day but i guess the last few days are a jumble its hard to believe any of this is really happening she managed a brief tight laugh would you like to come in i said i would but my cars still back at my place i need to get it towed here i can come out no i dont want to put you through any more bother no bother no dr delaware i cant keep imposing dont worry about it lucy how about noon sure she said noons fine another small laugh im not going anywhere just as i was getting ready to leave sherrell best phoned im sure theres nothing new doctor but nothing yet reverend though the police are interested in speaking with felix barnard hes not in malibu anymore any idea where he went why do they want to speak to him normal followup oh of course no im sorry i dont know where he is probably retired he was in his sixties back then and he closed up shop right after he mailed me his report your case was his last the very last at least thats what he told me i thought his age meant experience but maybe a young man would have done better some people get to a certain age its hard for them to feel inspired i got on the highway at eleven the beach was placid the landside hills upholstered with yellow poppies reaching the pier and passing it i spied the fat white letters of shooting the curls facade and turned left impulsively into the shopping center up close the painted sign was cartoonish the surfer hypermuscular with a massive head topped by brasscolored hair and a grinning mouth big enough to swallow a shark he balanced on a swirl of foam while giving the thumbsup sign with a swollen red digit the white letters had been touched up recently and they sparkled in the sun i found a parking space in front of the shop next to a charcoalgray bmw coupe with chromed wheels and a rear spoiler despite the customization the car hadnt been washed in a while and the marine air had done its job on the paint the license plate read sht crl a bumper sticker said save the coast and a blue handicappedparking permit rested atop the dashboard a cement ramp with metal railing led to the entrance of the store brass wind chimes tinkled as i stepped in then i was assaulted by the drum solo from wipeout the store was doublewidth with one half devoted to surfboards custom wet suits and surfing paraphernalia the other to beachwear suntan lotion and posters mostly variations on the tinymanridesmonsterwave theme or fleshinyourface shots of overripe women in microbikinis logos filled the rest of the wall space body glove one wave no fear a few girls in their late teens browsed the poster bin giggling and a middleaged couple stood by the swimwear fascinated by the neoprene bathing suits no one worked the clothing counter but a man in his forties sat behind the surfboard register eating a fastfood breakfast from a styrofoam box and looking down at something above him a pink banner screamed sex wax without glancing up he said what can i do for you just browsing he forked something into his mouth and i noticed the sports section in his other hand his hair was longish very thin minnowsilver combed across his forehead but unable to hide the sunburnt skin of his brow he had wellproportioned features except for lightbrown eyes that were set too close his skin had loosened its hold on the bones below the eyes were bloodshot and bagged and though he was lean a second chin tugged at his first he wore a limecolored polo shirt with sleeves that reached his elbows his shoulders were broad his forearms chunky and furred with gray hair that nearly obscured an anchor tattoo the music switched to the beach boys in my room one of the browsing girls brought a rolled poster over to the clothes counter and looked around as she fished money out of her jeans the man said ill take that here he put down his paper the girl came up and paid for her poster and left with her friends laughing the man swallowed a mouthful of eggmuffin and watched the girls wiggle the glass doors having fun i said yeah he said you see what she bought stud poster centerfold from pretty boy its meant for gays but they put out a calendar and it sold so well to women they decided to market the months separately he grinned in our day girls werent like that huh not the ones i knew so what is it for you he said reincarnation or just passing through from chicago reincarnation second childhood second chance at the big wave thats what it usually is when a guy your age comes in or a tourist wanting to bring home a little piece of california for aunt ethel i laughed im looking for bathing trunks he hit his forehead and gave another grin wrong again good thing i dont gamble suits are over there i went over to a rack marked dudes and flipped through the merchandise a pair of baggy black trunks caught my eye because of a square patch with a saint bernard over the pocket bearing the legend big dog the mutts tongue was out and he looked mischievous clearly a spiritual brother to spike i pulled the shorts off the rack and brought them up the man said cool baggies and rang up the sale i said what do the guys having a second childhood usually buy the works board board cover leash wet suit wax sport sandals zinc hair dye we have the suits customcut for us usually theyre freaked out to see what size they take now plus all the changes in board technology a guy your age might have rode something as big as a tree trunk name of the game now is minimum weight turning his hand into a blade he sliced air the new stuff once you get the feel its like hydroplaning you can drive out to zuma or county line and see kids that are basically jesus walking on water sounds like you did a bit of water work yourself still do he grinned and handed me my receipt no second childhood for me cause i never got out of my first the chimes sounded a darkhaired woman had opened the door and stuck her foot in i need help tom she was tall and nicelooking with a narrow graceful figure and long thin arms with some muscle definition her hair was wavy and very short almost black her eyes so light they seemed pupilless the sun had cured her face to tight bronze leather she wore highcut pink shorts that exposed long smooth legs her blouse was white and sleeveless and tucked in snugly tom said just finishing up a sale babe she didnt smile or answer just kept standing there in the door i heard a powerful engine idling and looked out to see a white ford van conversion smoke puffing from its rear the woman cleared her throat tom said here you go pal enjoy em i left the store taking as long as possible to get back to the seville once in the car i sat behind the wheel pretending to look for something a few seconds later tom shea came out of the shop and followed his wife to the van she got behind the wheel and closed the drivers door and a metal ramp slid out from the rear of the vehicle it touched the asphalt and i heard it scrape tom opened the rear door and reached in back muscles bunching as he pulled on something a moment later an electric wheelchair appeared in the doorway bearing a slumping bronzehaired boy tom guided the chair down the ramp i started the seville and inched out watching the boy could have been anywhere from twelve to twenty his head was large and it lolled eyes wide tongue extended his shrunken body was belted into the chair despite the restraint he slanted sharply to the right the head almost touching his right shoulder one arm was belted too the other clutched a joystick at the front of the chair tom wasnt smiling he said something and the joystick hand moved the chair rolled down the ramp very slowly and when it was on the asphalt tom closed the van door then he got behind the chair and guided it up the cement slope toward the store the vans engine cut off and gwen shea came around sprinted up ahead and held the store door as tom eased the chair through i caught a glimpse of the boys face sleepy but grinning big grin almost voracious his hair a thick straight mat the kind that might turn silverminnow when it aged but he reminded me of more than his father as i drove away i realized what it was the grin triumphant cartoonish he was an atrophied version of the surfer on the sign years ago the mother of a severely braindamaged child sat in my hospital office and cried for half an hour without break when she finally stopped she said i love her but god forgive me sometimes i want her to die she never cried again in my presence and whenever we passed in the hall she looked away from me with a face that was part despair part rage the same face gwen shea wore the idea of approaching her about a twentyoneyearold disappearance seemed ridiculous and cruel what reason did i have to believe best wasnt just an old man deluded by hope i caught a green light and sped out of malibu into the palisades making my way to rockingham avenue and possibly more delusions the house was a sizable twostory tudor with pink roses and blue agapanthus along the front and a low hedge of waxy privet bordering the brick walkway a white ford taurus with a rental sticker sat in the driveway ken lowell answered the door wearing a blue suit and holding a filofax his shoes were shined and his hair was wet morning just on my way out he let me into a parqueted foyer a statuarymarble center table held a black vase full of white silk flowers behind it the stairway was a softly curving arc of polished oak the front rooms on either side were dark and vaulted shaded by heavy cream damask drapes and filled with gleaming furniture nice repo i said ken nodded the owners cut out to europe overnight food in the fridge and clothes in the closet some kind of shopping center deal that went bad people are looking for them been seeing a lot of that lately more than usual for the last couple of years its what we specialize in we pick them up from the bank rehab them and turn them around i guess that makes us capitalist exploiters he smiled and picked out one of the silk flowers its not what i thought id be doing when i was in berkeley what were you interested in then my sister jo was an archaeology major she turned me on to old bones after she graduated she went to nepal to climb around and explore i flew there to be with her and we hung out together in katmandu place called freak street telegraph avenue transplanted to the himalayas he shook his head and looked at the flower i was with her when she died what happened i said we were hiking she was experienced very athletic this was just a stroll for her but she put her foot down and something gave way and she fell over a hundred feet i was way behind she passed right by me as she went down landed on a ledge full of sharp rocks he touched his eyes and pressed down on the lids then his hands flew to his lapels a door opened on the upstairs landing and lucy came down the stairs morning she said looking at ken everything okay everythings great he smiled and buttoned his jacket i should be back around six dont worry about your car ill have it brought over a wave and he was gone looks like youre being well taken care of i said hes a sweet guy she looked at the living room not too shabby for a hideout huh can i get you something to drink no thanks would you like to talk outside its nice in here but i find it a little gloomy the backyard was generous with a porkchopshaped swimming pool and waterfall spa a brick patio running along the rear of the house contained a table and chairs and potted plants that needed watering the neighboring properties were blocked from view by tall honeysuckle hedges and billowing mounds of plumbago we sat lucy crossed her legs and looked up at the sky her eyes were tired and she seemed to be fighting tears what is it i said i cant stop thinking about puck after a seconds debate i said he called your called lowell two days ago to tell him you were in the hospital he obviously cares about you but somethings keeping him out of town her legs uncrossed and her head shot forward why would he call himhow do you know this lowell phoned me wanting to talk about you i told him i couldnt without your permission thats crazy why would puck call him he knew you were at woodbridge he must have found out some absurd i dont understand any of this i got the impression puck had been in contact with him she stared at me then lowered her head as if ashamed he told me puck had a drug problem i said i didnt assume it was true but milo checked it out her mouth opened then closed her fingernails scraped the glass top of the table and my short hairs rose damn him he had no right why did milo have to do that for your sake and pucks we couldnt understand why he couldnt come back to see you figured he might be in some kind of trouble how longs he been addicted he i dont know exactly he started smoking grass in prep school by the time he started tufts he was already into the bad stuff he had to drop out in his junior year because a campus policeman caught him shooting up in a dorm room after that he didnt care and just hit the streets the police kept picking him up for vagrancy and the system kept spitting him back he tried to get help student health free clinics private doctors nothing worked its a disease her fingers ran down the glass again but silently even with all his problems she said softly he was good to me he cares about me thats what scares me he must be in trouble it would have to be something serious for him not to be here hes been telling everyone it was business she gave a miserable look covered her face exposed it yes he sold once in a while only to get his own stash i know its wrong and im sure in some part of his brain he does too but he felt he had no choice he was broke and he wouldnt give him more than pennies i tried to help him but most of the time he wouldnt take anything from me not unless he was hurting really bad hes the one who suffers the way he lives a hole over a hairdressers she looked out at the landscaped yard its not like he sold to little kids or anything like that just to junkies and theyd have to get it one way or the other its the heroin all this talk about crack and heroin goes on eating people up she began to cry i patted her shoulder so many times i offered to have him come live with me to try another program he said he was beyond hope and didnt want to drag me down didnt want treatment he liked junk it was his lover hed never give it up but still he was always there for me if i called him to talk about something hed always listen even if he was stoned hed try sitting there pretending to be normal hed be here now if he wasnt in some kind of major trouble what kind of trouble she squeezed her hands together the people he hung out with who are they thats the thing i dont know he made a point about shielding me whenever i came over he rushed around cleaning up putting his kit away lately he didnt even want me over at his place too depressing he said so we had coffee in restaurants hed come in looking half dead trying so hard to act okay i know he sounds like just another stupid junkie but he really is a wonderful brother i nodded thinking of pucks dinner date with ken how an addict might have viewed the sudden appearance of a wealthy half brother yet he hadnt shown up milos not going to call the police in taos or anything like that is he i dont want to put him in any more danger no i said milos main concern is you yes i cant believe all hes done you too and now ken she wiped her eyes i must bring it out in people like a wounded bird puck told me that once that hed always seen me as wounded i didnt like that i wanted him to perceive me as strong you are strong she spread her fingers on the glass looked through the tabletop studying the pattern of the bricks milo told me you know about being gay it shocked me now i understand the position you were in i really put you in the middle im sorry it was one of those things that couldnt be helped she shook her head id never have suspected it a big burly guy like that thats stupid of course but still it was the last thing id have guessed it must be so hard for him the job how did finding out affect you what do you mean how do you feel about his being gay how do i feel about it well im certainly glad i know the truth now she looked away anything else i said i guess on a selfish level i guess im disappointed she shook her head maybe it was just a stupid crush but it sure i mean the feelings are still there how can you kill feelings right i nodded she stood and walked up and down the patio he and i both do this she said pace when were nervous we found out when we were at the hotel all of a sudden we started doing it simultaneously it was a riot she looked at me you know how i feel cheated but ill get over it and im still grateful to have him as a friend dont worry about me i may look wounded but its an illusion all done with mirrors smile she sat down now lets talk about the great man what does he want all of a sudden whats his game i dont know lucy maybe to connect with you somehow no she said angrily no way hes up to something believe me hes a master manipulator you have no idea he loved hitting puck when he was down puck went to him for money after he cut off the trust fund he has that power not officially but the lawyers work for the family trust and they do one call from him snapping her fingers they invoked some sort of spendthrift clause after that puck had to go to him only a few times as a last resort and of course he demeaned puck and made him beg for every penny lectured him about financial responsibility as if hes some expert he lives off a trust fund too his mothers father owned textile mills all over new york and new jersey made a fortune before income taxes hes never had to work a day in his life if he did hed be sunk he hasnt published or sold a painting in years she slammed a fist into a palm forget him forget whoever played around with my undies and hung up on me and wrote that stupid note no more fear no more bullshit im evicting it all from my mind i dont care what it looks like i never tried to kill myself i love life and i want a real life a regular boring ordinary life this is a nice place but in a few days im out of here where to i dont know somewhere on my own im not going to spend my life looking over my shoulder she got up again had the dream again last night ken came in said hed heard me crying out i was sweating its as if that damned incubus is sitting back there just waiting to torment me as if theres a big pile of garbage stuck in my memory banks i want to evict that too get my head clear how do i do that i considered my answer the delay brought panic to her eyes what is it is there something wrong with me did they find something on those tests in the hospital no i said youre perfectly healthy then what timing the art of therapy mine was off i felt out of balance her nails scraped the table the dream i said has it changed in any way no what are you holding back from me what makes you think im holding back please dr delaware i know your intentions are good but im tired of being protected i thought of her head in the oven sometimes theres nothing wrong with being protected please im not crazy or do you think i am no i said then what is it what arent you telling me i continued to deliberate she looked ready to jump out of her skin feeling like a firsttime skydiver about to step into space i said some things have come up they may be related to your dream or they may mean nothing given all your stress im not comfortable dropping them on you unless you can promise youll take them calmly what things can you promise me yes yes what her hands were flexing she stilled them forced a smile sat waiting like a child not knowing if candy was coming or the strap you dont remember any contact with lowell i said but ken says you spent a summer with him at sanctum all four of you did you ken puck and jo what when the summer the retreat opened you were four years old how could when did he tell you this the night he brought you into the hospital i asked him not to discuss it with you i wanted to pace things four years old how can that be id remember that your aunt kate had just gotten married and gone on her honeymoon does the time frame fit she stared at the lawn slumped low in her chair i she said very softly i still cant see how i couldnt remember something like that memories from any age can be blocked out four thats the age i feel in the dream i nodded she started to reach for my arm then stopped herself her face had gone graywhite like skim milk you think it could be real i dont know lucy thats what we need to figure out four im so confused some parts of the dream seem to match reality i said there was a big party that summer that could explain the sounds and lights and the buildings at sanctum are made of logs her hands fisted her eyes were cold yet electric what about the rest of it what i saw i dont know she started to shake and i held her shoulders till she stopped finally she was able to take a deep breath calm she said to herself i can handle this another breath she closed her eyes her shoulders loosened and i let go a few more inhalations and for a moment i thought shed lapse into the semihypnotic state id seen a few days ago then her eyes opened i dont feel anything no big insights but could it the girl what do you think do you know anything else that youre not telling me i studied her face no muscles moved her eyes were still and dry and piercing yes i said after ken told me milo and i did some research looking into crimes in that area we found no murders or rapes that matched but we did come across a missing persons case involving a girl who was never found she did have long dark hair and long legs but that could apply to lots of girls so lets not assume anything for the moment oh god it may very well mean absolutely nothing lucy and latching on to it may distort your memories thats why i didnt want to rush into it its okay she said i wont rush into anything either putting her hands in her lap smoothing her hair what else do you know about this girl her name was karen best she disappeared the night before the party which wouldnt fit with the dream she was last seen in paradise cove fifteen miles from topanga and theres no evidence she was ever up at sanctum the only thing that does match is her physical description and theres nothing very distinctive about it as i told you before dreams can be mixtures of reality and fantasy you were four years old may very well have seen something a childs mind couldnt process such as something sexual like you initially assumed small children who witness the sexual act often interpret it as an assault but the scraping sounds the last couple of times like last night it was definitely shovels digging burying her hunching her back she bit her finger lucy she removed the finger and rubbed the upper joint dont worry she said softly im not going to fall apart im just trying to put this into place dont try to do it all at once she nodded breathed deeply again and placed her hands on the table as if summoning a spirit at a séance why now she said if ive forgotten it all these years why now perhaps the stress of the trial i said hearing about all that sexual violence or maybe youre strong enough to deal with it now she expelled air what does milo think about this hes openminded but skeptical but he didnt dismiss it the girl karen do you have a picture not with me but i can get one i want to see her i nodded does she have a family a father and a brother have you met them the father the brother lives back east was she originally from back east massachusetts boston new bedford ive been there plenty of times used to go out there with ray to buy squid from the portuguese fishermen what was she doing in la she came out to be an actress and ended up waiting tables poor thing she said poor poor thing does her family know about me i told the father someone had a distant memory of a girl who resembled his daughter being abducted how did he take that he hopes something will come of it whats he like hes a minister seems nice does he want to meet me at some point i said if we learn more so he hasnt given up on finding her hes not doing anything active anymore no of course not all these years what about right after it happened he mounted an intensive search he loves her she said flatly a minister which church its a group that feeds the poor a good man maybe i can help him can you hypnotize me or something ive heard that can unlock memories im sure id be an easy subject sometimes i feel as if im walking around in a trance anyway she gave an angry nervous laugh when i hooked for raymond i used to trance out all the time see how tough i am i havent repressed any of that i even told milo the slate is clear so lets get into my head i want to get rid of all the garbage hypnosis isnt just something you jump into lucy its dangerous not when done with a properly prepared patient youre worried about my mental stability im concerned about your stress level she sat back as if studying me tell me honestly do you think i tried to kill myself i really dont know lucy ken saw you with your head in that oven okay it was there she said im not going to deny reality but the phone calls the undies the note i know it sounds paranoid but all that happened i didnt put those horrible rat things there tell me you believe that i nodded she said maybe one of those crazy girls is out to get me or some other nut who knows im even willing to consider the possibility that i did it while i was sleepwalking like the first time i ended up on the kitchen floor but i wouldnt willfully try to kill myself life means too much to me and killing myself would be giving in to him confirming his preconception that were all weak and useless thats what he told puck every time puck came to him we were weak spineless useless banal id never do myself in give him the satisfaction do you understand yes a distant look came into her eyes sleepwalking the more i think about it the more im sure that has to be the key from the beginning i must have gotten up in the middle of the night and left that cabin and seen something sex and violence just like you said i cant put it in words but that feels right theres an internal logic she smiled and exhaled its good you told me about all this i wont disappoint you and misuse it youve really helped me today dr delaware i nodded not that its easy she went on im still shaking inside touching her belly but things are finally starting to make sense viscerally she touched my arm keep helping me please help me get into my head and find out the truth help me get back in control a hummingbird shot up in the air a tiny rocket a gardeners air gun blasted from somewhere down the block her eyes were fixed on me ill help you any way i can lucy what about hypnosis right now yes i feel ready i dont even care if it works just that i tried my best if i dont do something ill just sit around here feeling helpless so much has come down on me thats exactly why i dont want to jump into anything i understand she said but if hypnosis could help clarify things wouldnt that help unload me what do you know about hypnosis not much i mean i saw stage shows in college but they were rather silly people quacking like ducks i have heard that when you go under in therapy sometimes you can unlock memories thats true i said but any time you work with the unconscious theres a risk of unleashing unpredictable things im a veteran of that already wouldnt you say all the more reason i said okay she said youre the expert but i also know that whats stressing me is carrying around all this stuff and not understanding it i looked at her trying not to appear coldly clinical her posture was loose receptive she seemed calmer than ever before purposeful i gave her my preinduction lecture explaining that hypnosis was deep relaxation combined with focused concentration nothing magical how it didnt weaken the patients control but was merely the harnessing of a process that occurred naturally for most people that all hypnosis was selfhypnosis and the more she did it the better shed get as i spoke her body pitched progressively forward and her lips parted when i finished she said i understand her fingertips were inches from mine her face close enough for me to see my reflection in her pupils i looked worried i want to help someone else she said all right well start out with some simple muscle relaxation exercises but we may not go any further today whatever you say i had her tense and loosen muscle groups moving from her head to her toes she closed her eyes and her body swayed in time with my voice i was sure shed go under quickly instead she fell asleep at first i didnt realize it and kept talking then i saw her head tilt back and her mouth open letting out soft delicate snores no more body sway no movement at all but the heave of her chest lucy if you can hear me lift your right index finger nothing i picked up her hand limp i flexed her head no tension lucy silence her eyes moved rapidly behind their lids then stopped sleep the ultimate resistance i put her hand down and made sure she didnt slip off the chair the air gun had stopped the yard was too quiet she dozed for a while then suddenly her body began jerking and twitching crunching her facial features grunting fragmented rem the kind associated with nightmares i stroked her hand told her everything was okay she fell asleep a moment later the same pattern after two more episodes i said wake up lucy she didnt till a minute later and i wasnt sure it was in response to my voice sitting up she opened her eyes looking at me but not seeing me she closed them and went slack oblivious once more i tried to shake her awake gently each time i got her to open her eyes she rolled them drowsily and the lids closed finally i managed to bring her out she blinked and stared and muttered something and rubbed her eyes whats that lucy what happened you fell asleep i did yawn youve been sleeping almost half an hour i we we were doing hypnosis werent we i wasnt dreaming about that was i no we were doing hypnosis was i hypnotized yes you were right about being good at it did i do say anything no you fell asleep she stretched i feel refreshed was that supposed to happen falling asleep it needed to happen i didnt say anything at all no but were just starting out you did great but im a good subject youre an excellent subject she smiled okay i guess id better just let it play itself out but i do feel good hypnosis is great you should do it with ken whys that hes going through some very tough times his exwife is really vindictive out to take him to the cleaners doesnt let him see his kids he has visitation and the court keeps ordering her to comply but when she doesnt they dont enforce it when did they get divorced a year ago he didnt come out and actually say so but i get the feeling she had an affair hes real cheerful all the time for my sake but hes feeling it very restless at night i heard him go downstairs twice this morning i got up at fivethirty and he was dressed and doing paperwork sounds like a hard worker very he got into real estate right out of college started off as a clerk and worked himself up but its taken a toll hes got a bottle of maalox in his briefcase she was silent for a moment one big happy family huh closing her eyes she tilted her head back again you know its strange but as we talk right now im starting to get in touch with bits and pieces of memory about being sent to california that summer in touch how like bits of light poking through a piece of fabric i cant really explain it it doesnt feel bad what do you remember nothing specific just the bits and pieces like something on the tip of your tongue its almost as if the corners of my mind are being pulled back and im peeking through but i cant see clearly she frowned her forehead knitted nothing more she said opening her eyes but it doesnt seem weird anymore being up there and not remembering its as if im getting in touch with my own history i thought of the nanny ken had mentioned enough for one day when can we do this again she said i can see you tomorrow two oclock at my house great in the meantime i assume you want me to ignore lowells invitation i expected a quick reaction but she put her finger to her lip and thought i guess the only reason to talk to him would be to find out what hes up to and maybe i should do that myself thats a lot to bite off right now i said if you want to scope him out i could listen to what he has to say and report back to you believe me im not rushing off to have a têteàtête with him but if i send you to represent me thatll just show him im weak he already knows youre seeing me and why should we care what he thinks true she said but i dont want anything to do with him directly or indirectly id rather put my head in the oven just kidding we went back into the house you know she said maybe im being too rigid i guess it would be okay for you to meet with him if you think it could do any good i cant promise you it would are you interested in meeting the great man im interested in meeting someone so destructive a psychological specimen huh that wasnt what id meant but she went on putting him under the microscope okay go ahead meanwhile ill concentrate on relaxing getting comfortable with my unconscious i was surprised to find robin and spike home the electricians didnt show up she said the truck broke down probably in the parking lot at dodger stadium no doubt i left the drywallers there figured id get some work done here and then maybe you and i could go out and have some fun fun whats that i think its something the chinese invented they invented everything right she put her arms around my waist and her face against my chest actually she said im glad the turkeys flaked out ive been thinking about how little weve seen of each other lately when its all done i said lets go away somewhere where some remote island without phones or tv something bumped my ankle i looked down and saw spike staring up at us he cocked his head and snorted but with airconditioning for the pooch i said robin laughed and bent to pet him he began breathing hard then rolled over on his back paws up offering his beer gut as robin scratched him he grumbled with pleasure once in a while things are simple at ninethirty that evening they got complicated we were watching a bad old movie laughing at the dialogue when the phone rang and milo said theres someone i thought you might like to meet right in the neighborhood actually my neighborhood must be i see the ocean he gave me a name then an address in paradise cove oh trailer park right near the sand dollar are you there now actually im at the sand dollar bar is this a bad time robin sat up and mouthed patient milo i told her hes got someone hed like me to meet now i nodded go she said but definitely no phones on the island the road down to the cove was unlit and hemmed in by hillside and sky the guardhouse was empty and the gate was up beyond the sand dollar lot the ocean was a tight stretch of black vinyl the lot was nearly empty and the restaurants neon sign was suspended in the darkness i turned right and drove up a short steep road to the trailer park the mobile homes were stuck into the sloping terrain like metal studs in leather to the left was a small flat parking area atop a low bluff ricks white porsche was parked there and i pulled in next to it under the grasping branches of a huge pittosporum tree the units were numbered in a system that defied logic and it took a while to find the address milod given me i climbed nearly to the top of the park walking on asphalt paths lined with rock and seashell borders most of the trailers were dark blue tv light seeped from behind a few curtained windows the address i was looking for matched a white happy tourister with aluminum siding and a bolton carport a barbecue sat in the port geranium ivy grew around the wheel wells milo answered my knock a short solidlooking woman in her midsixties stood behind him her hair was tinted the color of ranch mink and permed and she had a small square face and searching dark eyes she wore a peagreen sleeveless blouse and stretch jeans she wasnt fat but her arms were heavy eyeglasses hung from a chain around her neck milo stood aside the trailers front room was a goldstained pine kitchen with a brown linoleum floor and white formica counters it was sweet with the smell of baked beans the woman met my smile with one of her own but it seemed obligatory milo said mrs barnard this is dr delaware our psychological consultant doctor mrs maureen barnard mo said the woman holding out a hand we shook milo said mo was married to felix barnard the woman acknowledged the relationship with a sad look and led us into the living area more pine gold carpets a quilted white sofa specked with gold and a matching recliner big tv and a very small stereo the place was immaculate mo barnard took the recliner and milo and i shared the couch the ceilings were very low and milos bulk made the room look even smaller than it was on the coffee table was a years worth of readers digest along with a thick bound stack of supermarket coupons and a sandpiper carved out of driftwood next to mo was an octagonal pressedwood table bearing a remote control and a cutglass bowl of miniature candy bars hersheys mr goodbar krackel she picked up the remote and put it in her lap then handed the bowl to milo unwrapping a mr goodbar he said as i told you it was dr delaware who got us involved in the case that led us to look into your husbands death to me mr barnard was murdered a year after karen best disappeared mo barnard was looking at me im sorry i said quite a shock when it happened she said but its been a long time strange to be hearing about it after all these years but you never know do you despite living at the beach her skin was white and puttysoft her eyes had the flat dark cast of a grant wood matriarch she fingered the remote control and looked at the blank tv screen milo gave me the candy bowl as i unwrapped a hershey bar he said felixs killer was never found he was shot in a motel on la cienega near pico west side of the boulevard la cienega was the border between wilshire divisions jurisdiction and west las the west side of the street made it milos territory mo barnard sighed milo smiled at her and the way she reciprocated it let me know hed been here with her for a while strange she said all these years i thought he was with a whore didnt know whether to be sad or mad after a while i forgot about that part of it now you come and tell me it could have been something else you just never know do you just a possibility milo reminded her yes i know itll probably never be solved but just the chance that he wasnt with a whore cheers me up a bit he wasnt a bad guy lots of good qualities really milo told me the motel was one of those places rented by the hour so you can see why mo assumed that the police assumed it she said even though the motel clerk said he hadnt seen any woman go in with felix but of course he couldve lied felix was once a policeman himself just for a short time in baltimore thats where he grew up i met him in san bernadino he was working for an insurance company investigating accident claims i was a records clerk at city hall he got let go right after we got married and we moved to la did you work for the city here too i said no i got a job doing the books for fred shale real estate over in pacific palisades i did that for thirtyone years felix and i lived in santa monica near the venice side felixs office was out here in malibu but this last years the first time ive actually lived in malibu my sister and her husband own this place but hes got bad lungs so they moved over to cathedral city near palm springs milo said the interesting thing is mo feels felix may have come into some money about a year before he was killed im pretty sure of it said mo he denied it but the signs were there i thought he was keeping someone on the side her cheeks colored truth be known hed done that before more than once but in his younger days he was sixtythree by then ten years older than me but when i married him i thought he was mature she chuckled and said hand me a krackel bar will you milo did what signs did you notice i said first of all his retiring for years hed talked about it but he always complained he couldnt get enough money together always griped about my having health benefits and a pension from san berdoo and from shale and he was out on his own with nothing then all of a sudden he just walks in and announces theres enough in the kitty i said what pie dropped out of the sky felix he just smiled and patted my head and said dont you worry sugaroo were finally going to get that place in laguna niguel we were always talking about buying a condo down there but we didnt have the money we might have been able to afford one of those retirement communities but felix never saw himself as old when he turned fifty he bought himself a toopay and contact lenses i guess he figured being so much older than me i used to look like a kid people would sometimes mistake me for his daughter he should do something about it the other thing he did that made me suspicious was get a new car a cherryred thunderbird the landau model the vinyl top which was their top of the line we had a big fight over that me wanting to know how we could afford it and him saying it was none of my business she shook her head we fought a lot but we stayed together thirtyone years then he got himself killed and there was no big money in his bank account just a little over three thousand dollars and i figured hed spent whatever he had on the car and whores i drove that car for fifteen years finally junked it did he leave any business records behind i said you mean his detective files no i told mr sturgis he wasnt much for keeping records truth is he was pretty disorganized in general after he died i went through his things and was surprised how little there was just scraps of paper with scrawls i figured his line of work there might be things there that would embarrass people i threw everything out what kind of cases did he work on she looked at milo same questions no i dont mind i dont really know what kind of cases felix didnt talk about his work truth is i dont think there were too many cases toward the end i know he did some work for lawyers but for the life of me i cant remember the names of any of them i wasnt part of his work had my own job to do im no feminist but i always worked we never had kids both of us just went and did our own job i nodded she said i dont mean to paint him as some kind of bum basically he was a nice guy didnt raise his voice even when we fought but he could be a little easy around the edges know what i mean cutting corners zactly the first time i met him he tried to pay me five dollars to release an accident record to him without filling out the proper forms and paying the county fee i turned him down and he was real goodnatured about it laughed it off he had a great laugh i was only nineteen should have known better anyway but i didnt he came back the next day and asked me out my parents hated his guts six months later we were married despite all the problems he was a pretty good husband so he never discussed karen best never she said truth is we didnt discuss much period we kept different hours id be up at six walking the dogs we used to have miniature poodles in the office at eight back by five felix liked to sleep late he claimed a lot of his work had to be done at night and maybe it was true he was gone a lot when i was home and vice versa she grinned maybe thats how we stayed together thirtyone years the grin dropped from her face still his being killed was the worst thing ever happened to me after my parents passing away to milo when you first called i didnt want to talk about it but you were a gentleman and then you told me maybe felix didnt die because of whoring around that would be nice to know she showed us two pictures of herself and felix saying these are the only ones i have when you go mobile you keep things to the minimum the first was a wedding portrait the young couple posed in front of a painted backdrop of the trevi fountain shed been a pretty darkhaired girl but even at nineteen her eyes had been wary felix wasnt much taller than his bride a spare man with slicked hair and clark gable ears hed worn a pencil mustache like gable but had none of the actors strength in his face the second snapshot had been taken two years before barnards murder the mustache was gone and the pi was stooped his face lined the toupee embarrassingly obvious he wore a gray sharkskin suit with skinny lapels and a white turtleneck and held a cigarette in a holder mos hair was bleached blond and shed put on some weight but despite that she did look young enough to be his daughter the picture had been taken in a back yard their faces shaded by a big orange tree our place in santa monica she said i rent it out now the income along with my pensions what keeps me going milo asked to borrow the more recent photo and she said sure we thanked her and left as we stepped out of the trailer she said good luck to you let me know if you find out anything nice lady i said as we walked down to our cars she fed me dinner said milo beans and franks and potato chips i was ready for camp songs before she really opened up we watched jeopardy she knows a lot about presidents wives how long were you there since six four and a half hours dedication yeah beatify me howd you learn about barnards murder social security said he was deceased so i checked county death records and it came up homicide which needless to say surprised me according to the autopsy report he got shot in the back of the head in that motel just like she said what she doesnt know is that his pants were down around his ankles but there was no evidence of sexual activity and he hadnt ejaculated recently was the place an outright bordello more of an anythinggoes place i knew it well from when i used to ride westside patrol drugs assaults allaround obnoxious behavior the detectives on the case assumed barnard was a john who got in trouble he was shot i said wouldnt a hooker have been more likely to stab him there are no rules alex some of the girls pack fire or a pimp could have killed him lots of them carry did anyone hear the shot nope clerk discovered his body cleaning up by the time he called it in place was empty deaf clerk its a busy street he had the tv blasting who knows there was no reason to think it was anything more than barnard picking the wrong time and place for a blowjob and now maybe still i called you because the fact that he was murdered knocks the karen best case up another notch on the intrigue scale as does mos feeling that he came into dough best told me karen was barnards last case i said and barnard was killed a year after karen disappeared you think he could have been blackmailing someone about karen and they finally got tired of paying or he got too greedy on the other hand he could have been blackmailing someone about another case totally unrelated to karen or maybe he got the tbird by saving pennies behind his wifes back or at the track she said all he left her was three thousand bucks how much would a tbird have cost back then probably six seven thousand not majorleague blackmail were still a long way from evidence barnard could have been shot simply because some whore did get mad at him so where do we go from here ill see if i can turn up anything more on him then i guess the logical thing is to try to find those sand dollar people and see if they remember anything about karen he looked through the trees at the restaurant no cars in the lot and only a few lights were on i went in there tonight looking for doris reingold but shes off for a couple of days the thing that bothers me about barnards investigation is if karen was hired by the sheas to work the sanctum party why wouldnt anyone at the dollar have mentioned it you think someone told barnard and he left it out intentionally who knows like you said maybe he was just an incompetent boob and didnt ask the right questions or he got answers and didnt think they were important malibu sheriffs interviewed the same people i said if karen was working the party why wasnt it in their reports maybe she never was at the party or could be the sheriffs found out she was and didnt think it was important either the last place she was seen wasnt important her serving hors doeuvres to five hundred people isnt much of a lead alex she could have been picked up by some party animal and run into trouble later what reason would anyone have to suspect she was somewhere on the grounds six feet under we reached the bluff and i walked him to the porsche he opened the drivers door and fished for car keys i told lucy about karen i said oh im still not sure it was right but i followed my instincts it was either continue to hold back information from her and take the chance it would destroy our rapport or be straight howd she react initial shock then she warmed to the idea that the dream might actually mean something learning the truths become her mission great im doing my best to keep the lid on so far shes being reasonable she asked for hypnosis to enhance her memory and i agreed to try some basic relaxation i thought shed be really susceptible and at first she seemed to be then she fell asleep which means shes resisting strongly she slept very deeply and her dream patterns fragmented i actually watched her go in and out of several phases im not surprised shes a sleepwalker and has chronic nightmares shed like to believe she sleepwalked her way into the kitchen and put her head in the oven and i guess its possible sleeps her great escape she blocks things out by dozing off the keys came out of his pocket and he jangled them did it bother her falling asleep i downplayed it made it sound routine i was worried about getting into too much too quickly but overall the session seemed to help her she left in good spirits other than the dream her main concerns puck shes well aware of his addiction defends him as a sick guy and thinking about him helps her forget about her own troubles you had any thoughts on the note not really anything new on the copycat not a thing but im gonna check out the bogettes very seriously he got in the porsche started it and lowered the window i went by the sheas surf shop today i said bought a pair of shorts gwen arrived with their son hes got severe cerebral palsy needs constant care tom shea drives a newish bmw gwens got a customized van for transporting the boy and both best and doris reingold said the sheas have a house on the beach at la costa even years ago that was serious money not to mention all the medical expenses the shop didnt look like any big cash cow but even assuming it is howd they get the capital to start up a business by tending bar and waiting tables now that were thinking about barnard getting paid off it makes me wonder if they did too gwen was obviously an enterprising lady subcontracting catering maybe she had other things going its still quite a leap from moonlighting to living on the sand coming into a little venture capital twentyone years ago would have helped be interesting to know what transpired between the time the sheas left for aspen and returned and why they left in the first place if it was just because sherrell best was bugging them that would imply some kind of guilt well he said i gave the widow barnard plenty of information malibus still a small town there should be some whispering break a few eggs and who knows flushing out the prey he turned his hand into a pistol and pointed it at the windshield boom i may have a shot at big game i said lucy and i decided i should accept buck lowells invitation to chat his hand lowered where you going to meet with him sanctum dont go snooping around the dirt looking for burial plots i promise dad listen i know you meanwhile you want to talk to doris reingold again or should i try i can do it were already pals if shes got nothing to hide another big tip might be enough to pry something loose hoohah daddy warbucks i expect to be reimbursed by the department oh sure absolutely officer santa clausll deliver it to you personally and no new taxes the next morning feeling like a hunter i called sanctum the same woman whod answered the first time picked up before i finished introducing myself she said hold on several minutes later hell see you here tomorrow at one were hard to find these are the directions i copied them and she hung up i got terry trafficants book from the bedroom and searched

night no dream so i shouldnt doze off its a little weird sleeping in someone elses bed but ken said id get used to it he does it all the time suddenly she clamped her lips her eyes misted anything wrong i said nothing i was just thinking of the summer i worked for raymond sleeping in that bed i used to have to put on stuff for the customers lots of makeup skimpy outfits sometimes wigs costume jewelry so they could pretend they were rich she hunched and dropped her head each hand gripped a bicep and she hugged herself very tightly they had their fantasies she said the ocean roared she didnt move i hated it she said softly i really hated it being invaded hour after hour day after day i put myself somewhere else like hypnosis i guess maybe thats why its easy for me cutting yourself off nod whered you go to the beach she laughed hows that for karma usually it worked but sometimes id come back to the real world lying there someone on me i dont want ever to lose control like that again straightening her back she said no offense but no man can ever really understand men dont get invaded maybe thats why the dreams coming back all those years ago i saw karen invaded and it stuck in my head and somehow she reached for a tissue so she said time for hypnosis i wont go bananas on you i promise scouts honor scouts honor i had her relax and stare at the ocean as i explained that age regression wasnt always effective or accurate how some people couldnt get in touch with childhood memories even under the deepest hypnotic trance how others imagined or manufactured false memories she nodded dreamy already i began the induction and she went under almost immediately achieving waxy limbs and surface anesthesia to a pinprick i had her go to a favorite place and left her there for a while she looked serene i said lucy can you talk to me her yes was low and throaty nearly inaudible over the waves you can i said but talkings hard work isnt it yes but youre comfortable yes and you want to communicate with me yes talkings hard work because youre so relaxed lucy thats good to make it easier for you to communicate you can answer yes or no with finger signals if the answers yes raise your right index finger if its no raise your left index finger do you understand she mouthed something then her right finger rose very good put it down now from here on you just have to leave it

picture yourself in a room with a giant tv screen a very pleasant comfortable room youre in a comfortable chair and the screen is in front of you youre watching the screen and feeling very relaxed on the screen is a calendar with todays date on it a desk calendar the type with pages that flip can you see it right finger good this calendar is special instead of each page being a day this calendar

work right finger where at work desk at your desk good now tell me what youre doing at your desk she tightened her face then it loosened very slowly simkins manufacturing accounts receivable doing the books on simkins manufacturing is it a big job right finger a big accounting job how do the books look pause her brows knitted sloppy sloppy right finger but that doesnt bother you because youre just watching it youre not experiencing it her brow relaxed good do you want to stay there for a while working left finger smile no boring okay lets go to another year take a deep breath count to three and well return to our calendar on the screen one two three i took her back in time gradually careful to avoid the summer in boston she remembered her sixteenth summer playing gin rummy with a cleaning maid in her summer school dorm room no other children around twelve was similar isolation reading jane eyre in a room with a single bed as she felt herself younger her posture loosened and her voice got higher more tentative displaying an occasional stammer i brought her back to the age of eight a summer at yet another boarding school riding horseback with the headmistress but unable to remember any other children no mention of puck or any other family member the loneliness shed grown up with became more vivid i felt sad and made sure to keep that out of my voice she sat very low in the chair nearly supine ankles crossed knees slightly apart a fingertip on her lip i changed the date on the calendar to august took her back to age six her eyes moved very fast and her voice assumed a slight whine as she told me about losing a favorite doll breathing deeply and peacefully okay i said now lets flip two more pages lucy youre four years old her breath caught and she knuckled her eyes deeper relaxed lucy so so peaceful watching the screen so it doesnt have to bother you her hands fell to her lap her legs spread more the feet turned on their side four years old i said what are you watching

nose sniffed and blinked and opened her eyes but she wasnt seeing me they closed again sleep walk sleep walk door wood out out out out she grimaced her breath quickened and her chest heaved relax lucy deeper and deeper relaxed remembering what you need to remember seeing what you need to see good very good just keep breathing deeply no matter what you see or hear or touch or smell or remember youll stay deeper and deeper relaxed watching yourself from the tv room so safe and calm and in control good okay go on out lights people yelling puzzled look not my fault deeper and deeper relaxed she sighed and her head drooped said something i couldnt hear i moved my chair right next to hers a carotid pulse was beating slow and steady her cheeks were pink i touched the top of her hand warm her fingers curled around mine and squeezed walk she said trees pretty she said nothing for a long time but her eyes kept moving and her head bobbed walking in place her head moved from side to side taking in the scenery suddenly i felt her hand go cold what is it lucy father you see father on the screen long pause as she gripped my hand then her right index finger rose but the rest of her fingers stayed clamped deeper and deeper relaxed lucy slow breathing but louder and harsher you can leave this place lucy you can turn off the tv any time you want to she made a growling sound and the left finger stayed up in the air for several seconds you want to stay here right finger okay thats fine go ahead do what you want to do and tell me what you want to tell me a long silence father men

into mine the childs voice returned lady gone lady gone lady gone lady gone she slipped into inert silence as i flipped the calendar pages back to the present before i brought her completely out i gave her posthypnotic suggestions to feel refreshed and successful and to be able to remember anything shed seen that night while remaining relaxed she came out smiling and yawning im not sure what happened but i feel pretty good i had her stretch and walk around then i told her three men she said you described one as having a hairy lip she rubbed the rim of her water glass a mustache i cant really remember that cant remember anything but that feels right hints of memories distant but right am i making sense perfect sense can i go back under and try some more i think weve done enough what about tomorrow all right i said but promise me not to try anything by yourself before then i promise now can i see that picture of karen i went and got the clipping from the shoreline shopper the moment she looked at the photo her hands began to shake she took the paper from me stared at it for a long time as she began to read her hands stilled but the color had left her face and her freckles stood out like braille dots handing the clipping back to me she nodded then she cried at four i drove to the sand dollar the film crew was there again and a blond beach goddess in a black thong bikini was posing on the sand with a sweating can of beer as i entered the restaurant i spotted doris reingold at the bar she got off her stool hi there after seating me near the window she said back in a jiff i was the only customer in the place the beach was unpopulated a busboy brought me coffee and i watched the blonde smile on command flipping her hair turning herself slowly like a chicken on a spit good view said doris pad in hand hooray for hollywood she laughed good to see you back early dinner we just got in some fresh local halibut no just a snack what kind of pie do you have lemme see she ticked her pad with her pen today weve got apple and chocolate cream and i think pecan apple with vanilla ice cream she brought me a double wedge under two dollops of ice cream feel free to sit down i said she touched her gray hair sure marvins not in for a while why not after pouring coffee for herself she slid into the booth the way she had the first time looking out at the blonde she said girl like that gonna get herself one of two things rich or in trouble or both i cut into the pie true she said one doesnt eliminate the other you have kids no im not married that doesnt mean anything you know the definition of a bachelor no kids to speak of we both chuckled i said you said you had two right two boys both grown both army master sergeants both married with kids of their own their dad was an army man too i divorced him when they were little but somehow it rubbed off must have been tough raising them by yourself wasnt a picnic she freed her pack of cigarettes and lit up then took in a mouthful of coffee tell you what i do enjoy being a grandmother you buy them stuff play with em and then you go home so ive heard yeah its great she smoked and stirred some sugar into her coffee id like to have kids of my own i said why not youre young its a little scary all those things that can go wrong i used to work in a hospital saw plenty of misery yeah theres plenty of that i was over by your friends surf shop the other day and saw their son really sad she appraised me through the smoke what made you go there needed some swim trunks when i passed by i remembered your telling me about it nice place but howd they get a house on the beach with that she shrugged and gave a sour look still i said that kid no money in the world can make up for that what is it cerebral palsy birth accident she said but wariness had crept into her voice i think he twisted his neck coming out or something how old is he sixteen or so yeah its tough but weve all got our crosses to bear so why dwell on it she kept smoking and pretending not to study me i ate some more pie after dragging half her cigarette down she put it in the ashtray and watched it smolder i do feel sorry for them its a good example of what you just said money and trouble looking at the film crew again she said why all the interest in gwen and tom handsome all friendliness gone from her voice no particular interest they just came up that so sure is something the matter she stared at me you tell me i ate pie and smiled everythings fine with me you some kind of bill collector or a cop neither what are you then whats the matter doris thats not an answer im a psychologist just like i said are gwen and tom in some kind of trouble she pocketed her smokes and her lighter and got up standing over me one thigh pressing into the rim of the table she smiled to a casual observer she would have looked like a helpful waitress you come on real friendly and then you ease the conversation around to tom and gwen that just seems a strange thing for a guy to talk to a gal about turning her back on me she walked back to the bar the restaurant was still empty i ate a few more bites of pie and then i saw her leave the restaurant throwing bills down on the table i went after her she was heading for a shopworn red camaro parked near the movie crew trucks cables were strewn across the parking lot and one caught her heel and she went down one of the grips picked her up and other film people gathered around her the blond model stopped posing i was within twenty feet of her when she saw me she pointed and said something that made the people look at me as if i was slime on bone china a human knot closed around her protectively i turned around walking not running but when i made it to the seville i was breathless i got in the car no one had followed me but everyone was still looking at me they kept on looking as i peeled out i reached milo at work and told him what had just happened didnt have a chance to get to karen just talking about the sheas how they made their money upset her jealous there was some kind of hostility there she wasnt sympathetic about their having a kid with cp what if she and the sheas all got paid off to keep quiet about karen but the sheas used it to build up a personal fortune and she blew it i know its a big jump but she did say she worked catering gigs for gwen if the sanctum party was one of them she could very well have been there huge jump he said but ill see what i can find out about her meanwhile stay away from there something else lucy and i did hypnosis again and this time there was no resistance i ageregressed her back to four years old and she was able to make out more details of the dream definitely two other men besides lowell ones back was to her the whole time the other had what she called a hairy lip which i assume is a mustache trafficant wore a mustache and goatee back then anything come up on him yet havent learned a damn thing except he stopped filing tax returns the year he vanished as far as i can tell he hasnt shown up in any major penal institutions no death records either but a guy like that would know how to work the system i tried to trace him through his publisher no one seemed to remember him at all i didnt get the feeling they were trying to stonewall just that hed really faded from the scene yeah well for all we know hes in algeria or cuba or something still getting his royalty checks meanwhile ive got something more immediate to deal with another copycat discovered this morning weve kept the media at bay but youll see it on the eleven oclock news fourteenyearold kid named nicolette verdugo walking home from school yesterday never showed up cal trans crew found her at daybreak in a drainage ditch out in diamond bar near the orange county border fourteen i said oh jesus he coughed and cleared his throat so now its a new task force the fbis probably going to be called in and guess whos representing angel city when shwandts lawyers find out about this i promise you its war but the whole thing stinks keep this confidential both shannon and nicolette were defecated on but neither had any semen in or on or near them ejaculation was a major thing for shwandt sometimes he did it more than once on a victim in fact the only time he didnt ejaculate was with barbara pryor because he was too stoned to get an erection now why would someone pull off a firstrate copycat cover all the details and leave that out someone who cant ejaculate i said a woman you think the bogettes really could be behind it who the hell knows its pretty hard to imagine women butchering another woman that way but mansons hags were pretty good with forks and knives problem is how do we get close to them theres absolutely no grounds for warrants all we can do is try to interview them and if they say fuck you as they did today we say thank you ladies and go home that leaves surveillance and with their level of paranoia theyll probably burrow deep underground anyway it means eighteenhour days for me so do me a favor and keep an eye on lucy im not going to be much of a guardian angel anything specific i should do keep her away from her own apartment till i clear up that goddamn note given this new murder id rather err by being too cautious the turds by the way were of rattus rattus origin our little black scurrying pal and speaking of rats all ive been able to learn about brother puck was that he had some dealings a few years ago with a dope group from montebello smalltime buys and sells then they handed him thirty grand to peddle to other junkies and he got busted after that they cut him off and hes been going to east la for bits and pieces who paid for his defense havent found that out yet if he comes back to town ill have a little talk with him meanwhile give lucy my best one more thing i said i showed karens picture to lucy and shes sure karen was the girl in the dream its possible shes confabulating wishful thinking because she hates her father and is on a mission to learn the truth but her reaction was pretty extreme she went white started shaking your intuition tells you its genuine my intuitions been rather quiet recently mine too when it comes to her maybe we can get corroboration of karens presence at the party from someone who worked that night someone who wasnt paid off you know alex the more i think about it the whole idea of payoffs doesnt really cut it logically all youve got on the sheas is that best doesnt like the look in their eyes and they were lucky enough to make some money over a twentyyear period all youve got on doris is she doesnt like the sheas no indication of any collusion if something happened that the three of them and felix barnard found out about whats the theory the whole bunch of them put the arm on lowell or trafficant or whoever had something to hide and if barnards death was tied in with blackmail why would the others be allowed to live they didnt break the rules barnard did still to leave all those loose ends for so long people living down the road from you knowing you were involved in killing a girl maybe they didnt know the gory details just that karen was last seen at the party lowell could have told them she had a bad drug trip and left early something like that so why pay them off to avoid bad publicity for sanctum trafficants presence had already created controversy trafficant killing karen would have finished lowell off so whos our corroborator some other server what do we have here a whole platoon of people who knew karen had worked the party with best looking for her obsessively all those fliers he put up cornering people at the shopping center you mean to tell me no one came forward they might not have if they really didnt believe shed been harmed what if the other servers were told shed run off with a boyfriend and didnt want to be found or that best was an abusive father and karen was scared to death of him maybe spinning that yarn was what the sheas got paid for which would make them collaborators and help ensure their silence a yarn he said convincing young people it was true wouldnt have been too hard remember the times dont trust anyone over thirty maybe he said doubtfully locating the other servers would help i said especially those other women from the dollar andreas and billings nothing on them yet and i cant promise you ill have time to do a comprehensive in the near future so do me a favor and dont launch lucy on any trajectory you cant control keep yourself safe too ive got enough to worry about a warm quiet morning lit by a primroseyellow sun hypnosis session number three induction was effortless within minutes lucy was four years old and watching herself wander through the forest once again hairy lips and lowells faces were visible but the third man kept his back to her and she could produce nothing more about him i questioned her more about the mustache is the hair on his lip dark or blond she looked confused is hairy lips hair brown lucy dont know is it blond yellow consternation the hairy lip is it just a mustache is the hair only on the top lip or does he have a beard hair all over his face um shrug hairy lip just a hairy lip shrug when she came out i reviewed what shed told me didnt do very well this time did i you did fine its not a performance she knuckled her forehead i know its all in here why cant i bring it out maybe theres nothing else to remember youre seeing things the way you saw them then through a fouryearolds eyes certain concepts wouldnt have been available to you i was so excited about today i thought wed make real progress give it time maybe more will come out i let her sit quietly for a while actually she said there was something the trees where they buried her i noticed something about them but you didnt ask me so i couldnt tell you didnt have the words her eyes closed the image keeps coming back to me lacy lacy trees nod what kind she frowned i dont know just that they were lacy and pretty its like her eyes openedi guess what you said was true i didnt have the word lacy when i was four so i couldnt put it into words but now that im an adult again it came back to me pretty lacy trees does that make sense yes she shook her head lacy trees thats all i can say do you have time for me tomorrow tomorrow morning any time ive got nothing to do but read old magazines and watch tv being alone in a big house is a lot more solitude than im used to kens not around much hardly at all were planning to spend some time together over the weekend maybe take a drive somewhere her hands were busy fingers rubbing against one another the third man she said he keeps his back to me the whole time its frustrating and all i can really see of the other one is the mustache i went and got the copy of terry trafficants book opened it to the rear flap and showed her the author photo no definitely not sorry his mustache is wimpy hairy lips was big and dark and thick she put the book down i said could you describe him so someone could draw him her eyes closed again her squint looked painful i can see him but i cant really describe his features its as if im handicapped as if part of my brain is working but i cant translate what i see into words she opened her eyes i think id know him if i saw him but i just cant tell you anything more about him other than the mustache im sorry its not like actually seeing more like images making their way into my mind that sounds flaky doesnt it maybe im totally off base on all of it well just take it as far as it goes lucy but i want to find out for karens sake its possible karen has nothing to do with the dream she does she said quickly i feel it i know that sounds as if im letting my imagination get out of control but im not i didnt wish this upon myself why would i want to be dreaming about him i didnt answer okay she said well just take it as it comes is today the day you go up to see him today at one she scratched her knee has that been on your mind i said a bit any change of heart about my meeting him no i guess im a little nervous though why should i be youll be dealing with it not me i left the house at twelvethirty turned off pch at the red clapboard buildings of the malibu feed bin and headed up topanga canyon road cutting through the palisades the drought had stripped the mountains down to the chapparal but last months freak rains had brought back some tender buds and the granite was freckled with weeds and wildflowers randomly planted eucalyptus appeared on the west side of the road to the east was a gorge that deepened and darkened as i gained altitude there was little to break up the scenery for the first few miles other than an occasional shack or abandoned car then a scattering of small businesses appeared among dry yellow clearings a lumberyard a general store and post office a leanto advertising magic crystals at discount at the top of the road was a fork that separated old topanga road from the newer highway that led into the valley both routes were empty the original topanga settlers had been californio homesteaders and new england gold panners asking for little but beauty and riches and privacy their descendants still owned land in the canyon and individualism remained the topanga way during the sixties and seventies the time of the sanctum party the hippies had invaded in giddy droves living in caves scrounging for food and eliciting outrage the natives hadnt known they had in them gary hinman had a house in topanga back then as did lots of other musicians and he was recording rock n roll tracks in his home studio when the manson family murdered him no more hippies now most had wandered off some had died from overdoses of freedom a few had become transformed to topanga burghers but the canyon hadnt turned into levittown artists and writers and others who didnt keep regular hours continued to homestake here and i knew several professors and psychotherapists willing to brave the hourplus drive to the city in order to return here at night one of them a man who studied the biochemistry of rage once told me hed come across a mountain lion in his back yard one night savaging a raccoon and licking its chops scared the shit out of me alex but it also took me to a higher spiritual level i turned left onto the old road the next couple of miles were darker and greener and cooler shaded by sycamores maples willows and alders that arched over the blacktop pretty lacy trees houses appeared every hundred to two hundred feet most of them modest and onestoried and set into vinecrusted glades those on the left side of the road sat behind a dry wash accessible by footbridge or through old railroad boxcars turned into tunnels mine was the only car on the road and though i could smell horse manure there were no steeds in sight i pulled over and read the directions the woman had given me look for a private road around three miles from the bridge and a wooden sign to the east i drove a slow mile there were several dirt paths cutting into the hillside on the east all unmarked and i made a couple of false starts before spotting a wooden sign nearly obscured by a heavy bank of scarlet honeysuckle s nc m the road if you could call it that was an acutely slanting dirt path lined with elderberry and ferns and sugar bush i traveled a thousand feet of kidneyjarring hairpin solitude the trees here were thicktrunked and hypertrophied the brush beyond them impenetrable the growth was so thick that branches scraped the roof of the car and in some places the vegetation sprouted in the center of the road and brushed the sevilles underbody soon i heard the highnote trickle of a stream groundwater that explained the lushness during the drought looking for trees here would be like searching for pedestrians in times square a couple of turns then i saw a twopiece gate up ahead heavyduty chicken wire framed by planks of weathered redwood latched but not locked i got out freed the bolt and swung both gates open they were heavy and rusty and left brown grit on my hands another five hundred feet another gate a twin of the first beyond it was a big lowslung lodgetype building flanked by enormous bristlecone pines and backed by a forest of more pines and firs and coast redwood the roof was green asphalt shingle the walls logs i parked in the dirt between a black jeep cherokee and an old white mercedes convertible a row of iron hitching posts fronted the lodge behind it wide wooden steps led to a wraparound porch shaded by the eaves of the building and set up with a few bentwillow chairs the cushions on the chairs were blue floral and mildewed the windows of the lodge were gray with dust flat thick silence then a squirrel scampered across the porch stopped and shimmied up a rain gutter i climbed the stairs and knocked on the front door nothing happened for a while then it was pulled open and a woman looked out at me thirtyfive or so fiveseven with straight shoulderlength black hair parted in the middle and painted with copper highlights her face was a tan oval the skin smooth as fresh notepaper the jawline crisp she wore secondskin black leggings under a bright green oversized sleeveless tshirt her arms were bronze and smooth her feet bare her eyes orangebrown she had the kind of face that would photograph beautifully perfectly aligned slightly oversized features both ears were doublepierced dr delaware she said in a bored voice im nova she waved me into a gigantic main room furnished with sagging tweed couches and thriftshop tables and chairs to the right was a clumsy narrow staircase the grubby plank flooring was covered haphazardly with colorless rugs the ceiling was beamed with more planks and raw logs and each beige stucco wall bore two large windows plenty of furniture and still enough room to dance along the rear wall beyond the stairs what had once been a reception desk had been turned into a wet bar crammed with bottles on either side of the bar were doors the walls were covered with scores of mounted animal heads deer moose fox bear a snarling puma lacquered trout with their vital statistics engraved on plaques all the specimens looked motheaten and tired almost goofy one was particularly grotesque a gray lumpy porcine thing with quasimodo features and yellow mandibular fangs that hooked over a sneering upper lip wally warthog said nova stopping next to a serapecovered couch goodlooking fellow charming does mr lowell hunt she gave a staccato laugh not with a gun these came with the place and he kept them he planned to add some of his own critics and reviewers never bagged any huh her face got hard wait here ill tell him youve arrived if you need to fix yourself something to drink she walked off toward the lefthand door i went over to the bar empty bottles lined the floor premium brands mostly on the counter were eight or nine cheap glasses that hadnt seen water recently an old refrigerator was filled with mixers i washed a glass and poured myself some tonic water then returned to the center of the huge room as i sat on a needlepoint rocker dust shot up in front of me was a coffee table with nothing on it i waited and drank for ten minutes then the door opened his face appeared two feet lower than i expected he was sitting in a wheelchair pushed by nova the famous face long and hatchetjawed with a bulbous nose and deep dark eyes under shelf brows now white his hair was grayblack worn past his shoulders and held together with a beaded band the venerable chief look his skin liverspotted and creased was as rough as the ceiling beams my eyes dropped to his body wasted and spindlelimbed reduced to almost nothing above the beltline he wore a longsleeved white shirt and dark pants everything bagged and sagged and though the trouser fabric was heavy wool i could see his kneecaps shining through his feet were encased in cloth bedroom slippers his hands were huge and white and grasping dangling from the thin wrists like dying sunflowers as nova propelled him forward he glared at me the chair was an oldfashioned manual and it squeaked and wrinkled the rug she positioned him opposite me need anything he didnt answer and she left he kept glowering i gave him a pleasantly blank look goodlooking piece of veal arent you if i was a fag id fuck you that assumes a lot he threw back his head and laughed his cheeks were flaccid and they shook he had most of his teeth but they were dark and discolored youd let me he said without hesitation youre a starfucker thats why youre here i said nothing despite his crippled body and the size of the room i began to feel hemmed in whats in the glass he said tonic water he gave a disgusted look and said put it down and pay attention im in pain and i dont have time for any lumpenyuppie bullshit i placed the glass on a table okay little dutch boy tell me who the hell you are and what qualifies you to be treating my daughter i gave him a brief oral résumé very impressive you now qualify for a variablerate mortgage of your iq if youre so smart why didnt you become a real doctor cut into the cortex and get to the root of matter why didnt you he pitched forward winced and cursed violently gripping the armpieces of the chair he managed to shift slightly to the left william carlos williams was a doctor and he tried to be a poet somerset maugham was a doctor and he tried to be a writer both sour pretentious fucks mixandmatch works only in womens fashions somethings got to ebb somethings got to flow i nodded his eyes widened and he grinned go ahead patronize me pricklet i can chew up anything you serve me digest it for my own benefit and shit it back at you as highdensity compost timbales he licked his lips and tried to spit nothing came out of his mouth im interested he said in certain aspects of medicine cabala not calculus a fool i knew in college became a surgeon i met him years later at a party teeming with starfuckers and the pinbrain looked happier than ever his work there was no other reason for him to be satisfied i got him talking about it and the bloodier he got the more ecstatic if words were jism id have been soaked and do you know what brought the greatest joy to his dysphemistic face describing the scummy details of exploratory surgery while eating a cocktail frank cracking open the bones tying off the veins swandiving into the heat and jelly of a stinking cancerous body cavity he raised his hands to nipple level and turned the palms up he said the greatest fun was holding living organs in his hands feeling their pulse smelling their steam he was a yawny idiot but he had the power to flex a wrist and rip spleens and livers and shitfilled guts out of someone elses fleshark he let his hands fall he was breathing hard the remnants of his chest heaving thats what interests me about medicine dropping a nuclear bomb on certain individuals interests me too but id never waste my time studying physics man ray once said perfect art would kill an observer upon first glance damned near close to universal truth not bad for a photographer and a kike delaware thats not a kike name is it no and its not wop or nigger or spic either his mouth ticced and he laughed again but it seemed obligatory look what we have here a wit at least by half a fucking yuppie halfwit youre the future arent you offtherack gentlemans farterly suits pretending to be bespoke politically correct careerism masquerading as moral duty do you drive a beemer or a baby benz either way hitler would be proud though i dont imagine youve ever studied history do you know who hitler was are you aware that he didnt drive a buick that eichmann worked for mercedesbenz while hiding out in argentina do you know who the fuck eichmann was remembering the white convertible out front i said i drive american how patriotic did you get it from daddy i didnt answer thinking suddenly of my father never able to afford a new car daddys dead isnt he was he a wouldbe doctor too a machinist i said tool and die he tooled then he died tuttut so youre a bluecollar hero shakykneed arriviste by way of the public school system first in the family to go to college and all that a kiwanis club scholarship no doubt mommys so proud in her formica prison is she dead too i stood up and began walking to the door oh he bellowed after me oh ive offended him five minutes and hes running off to puke in the bushes the fortitude of a mayfly i half turned my head and smiled at him not at all its just boring the shape youre in you should know lifes too short for small talk his face incandesced with rage he waited until id opened the door and stepped out onto the porch fuck you and fuck your charwoman mother on a formica counter walk out now and youll eat my shit in a soufflé before i give you my insights do you really have any i said with my back to him i know why the girl tried to kill herself i heard squeaks turned and saw him wheeling himself forward very slowly he stopped and spun the chair finally managing to turn his back on me his hair hung in greasy strands either nova wasnt much of a caretaker or he didnt allow her to groom him fix me a drink cubby and maybe ill share my wisdom with you none of that singlemalt swill you yuppie pricks go for give me blended everything in life is blended nothing stands on its own spinning again he faced me i thought he looked relieved that i was still there whats yellow and red yellow and red yellow and red he said what i said jap in a blender hawf hawfand dont give me that look of outrage you buttoneddown poot i fought in the only war that counted and saw what those scrawnydicked monkeymen are capable of did you know they used to peel the faces off the allied prisoners marinate human hearts and kidneys in teriyaki sauce and barbecue them theres your sushi bar for you truman dryroasted the bucktoothed capuchins only good thing that exophthalmic ragpimp ever did stop standing there gawking like a virgin sailor at wet pussy and fix me a fine blended drink before i tire of you beyond the point of forgiveness i went to the wet bar and found a bottle of chivas almost empty as i poured he said know how to read i had no intention of answering but he didnt wait for a reply ever read anything i wrote i named a few titles did you have to write term papers on them a few what grades did you get i passed then fuck you you didnt understand a thing i brought him his drink he drained it and held out his glass i refilled it he took longer with the second drink staring at the whisky sipping lifting a leg and passing gas with satisfaction i thought of all hed written about heroism and finally understood the word fiction he tossed the glass away his throw was weak and the tumbler landed near the wheel of his chair and rolled on the rug he said the girl tried to end it all because shes empty no passion no pain no reason to keep going so anything you do with her will be worthless you might as well be psychoanalyzing a tadpole in order to prevent its froggy fate i on the other hand have a surplus of passion spilling over as it were he made slurping sounds the only thing that can save her is getting to know me i tried not to laugh or scream getting to know you will be her therapy not therapy you limited gowk therapy is for moral anencephalics and hamstrung aerobigeeks im talking about salvation leaning forward tell her ill let her know i said he laughed and raised the pitch of his voice does she hate me im not free to talk about her feelings la da la da la da la da you claim you read dark horses what was the point there the racetrack as a miniworld the charac the point was that we all eat horseshit some dress it up with béarnaise sauce some nibble some hold their noses some stick their faces right in it and wolf but no one plays hooky best novel of the millennium flew out of me my cock tingled every day i sat down at the typewriter he looked at the glass on the floor more i obliged him pulitzer capons thinking they were giving me something he finished the whisky she hates me i dont give a shit about her feelings hatreds a great motivator ive always hated writing i looked over his shoulder at the animal heads the leering warthog he said no attention span vealchop they came with the place i considered adding to the collection critics with glass eyes know why i didnt i shook my head no taxidermist would take on the job too hard to clean he laughed and demanded another drink the chivas was gone and i poured him cheap scotch with his body weight his blood had to be pickled but he showed no effects of the alcohol have you ever looked into the toilet after youve shat he said the bits of crud that are left sticking to the porcelain next time scrape some of that off and place it in a dish of agaragar feed it more shit and anything foul you can find and in no time at all youll have cultured yourself a critic more laughter but strained a criminal the vilest childfucking inchworm of a motherraper is entitled to a trial of his peers do you know what kind of justice artists merit trial by cretin dickless decorticate pettyante pissbladders whod give their glands to have the gift but dont so they take out their frustration on the blessed those who can do those who cant teach those who lack the tongue motility to lick the arseholes of teachers write reviews hed finally produced saliva a strand trickled down the side of his mouth he stared at me i readied myself for another outburst but he grew very quiet and his eyelids started to droop then he fell asleep i listened to him snore nova came in as if summoned by the noise shed changed into a filmy collarless white blouse that barely reached her waist and black shorts that showed off beautiful legs her breasts were large and soft and unfettered the nipples darkly evident through the thin fabric she said no sense in your staying hell be that way for a while does he do that often just nod off all the time hes tired all the time its the pain is he on painkillers what do you think whats wrong with him everything his heart and his liver are bad hes had several strokes and his kidneys are weak basically hes just falling apart her tone was matteroffact are you a nurse she smiled no his assistant he wont accept nursing would rather drink and do things his way youd better be going i walked to the door are you bringing the daughter back she said thatll be up to the daughter she should meet him whys that every daughter should meet her father a caricature said lucy trying to smile but there was fear in her eyes outside the sun hid behind a cloud bank and the ocean was a restless gray curdle very low tide i heard the breakers die far back slapping the sand like slow monstrous applause it was eight in the morning id just finished telling her about my visit nicolette verdugos murder was all over the news jobe shwandt was giving deathrow interviews lecturing on astrology and utopianism and the proper way to cut up a side of beef one of the bogettes had told the times the day had come for all victims to rise up and slaughter the oppressors lucy had come in holding the morning paper but she hadnt wanted to talk about any of that so whats his angle i dont know i said in his own bizarre way he may be reaching out or just trying to regain some control she shook her head and smiled then her mouth turned down see any lacy trees there are trees all over the place the house is set into a forest a log house yes i said like a giant log cabin ken told me thats where you and puck slept you were being cared for by a nanny any memory of that i know she said he told me too some woman with short hair and he remembers her as being grumpy but that didnt trigger anything for me has he come up with anything else about that summer she shook her head apparently we had nothing to do with each other its frustrating why would i block out something like a nanny maybe she wasnt with you very long not every memory registers guess not the tendons in her neck were stretched tight maybe i should jog my memory directly go up there from what youve told me i should be able to handle him lets not rush things i said i need to know the truth hes old and feeble but far from innocuous lucy remember how manipulative he was with puck i understand that ill go in expecting a total monster and no matter what he tries its not going to work because im not puck he doesnt have anything i need i just want to look for those trees the tide broke thunderously and she jumped i said humor an overcautious therapist lucy lets take our time she was looking at the water does it get that loud often once in a while is there anything else you want to talk about i said i want to talk about putting together a battle plan going up there and learning what happened going up there doesnt mean youll learn anything but not going up there means i definitely wont hes a crippled old man what can he do to me he has a way with words thats all a writer ever has the point is he may be reaching out to you because hes dying her eyes flickered but she didnt move ive seen it plenty of times lucy the most abusive neglectful parents wanting some sort of relationship before they die you need to sort out your own feelings about that very carefully what if you go up there expecting brutality and he turns tender i could handle it she said he cant collect debts that arent owed to him she fooled with her hair and looked out at the ocean i just thought of something its horribly mean but its funny if he really gets obnoxious ill handle him by falling asleep doze right off thatll get the message across more hypnosis i took her back to two days before the sanctum party thursday morning despite my attempt to cushion her with the tv screen technique she lapsed into a childs voice and began muttering about trees and horses and brudda questions about a nanny or babysitter or anyone else elicited puzzled looks and an upstretched left index finger further questioning revealed that brudda was puck whom she called petey petey playing with her petey throwing a ball the two of them tearing leaves and looking at ladybugs petey smiling she smiled as she told it then her own smile melted away and i sensed that the present was beginning to intrude whats happening lucy frown i took her forward past the dream to sunday she remembered nothing back to saturday night this time she described her walk in the forest calmly even the scared look on the abducted girls face didnt ruffle her i zeroed in on the three men talking about her father made her eyes move frantically under her lids she thought he looked angry described his clothing long uh white like a dress the caftan the society column had described she could have read it i asked her if there was anyone else she wanted to talk about waiting to see if shed move on to hairy lip without prodding left finger i repeated my question about mustache versus beard using simple phrasing a fouryearold could understand is it a big mustache or a little mustache pause big real big right finger does it hang down or go straight out down it hangs down dig she grimaced i thought shed shifted forward to the burial now theyre digging left finger anguished headshake what is it lucy dig diggity dog for a second i was thrown then i remembered a cartoon character from the seventies a lazy slowtalking bassetthound sheriff with a twentygallon hat and a drooping walrus mustache the mustache hangs down like diggity dogs right finger what color is it black a black mustache that hangs down like diggity dogs right finger rigid jabbing upward hard anything else about the man with the mustache lucy black a black mustache she grimaced good i said youre doing great now is there anything you can tell me about the other man the one with his back to you contemplation eyes moving under the lids he hes says says in there in there in there dammit buck hurry roll it roll it hurrydammit rollit inthere after she left i sat thinking about her sudden change of heart courage competing with selfdefense maybe courage was her selfdefense no matter i couldnt allow her to face him id hold her off try to get her to discover as much as she could on her own i thought about what shed seen today hairy lip maybe someone other than trafficant the third man always with his back to her in there dammit buck was he trafficant barking at his patron from what id seen of lowell i couldnt imagine his tolerating that but maybe his relationship with trafficant had been more complex than mentor and protégé as i thought about it ken lowell called im a little concerned about lucy doctor she told me about this dream shes been having now i understand whats been getting her up at night she hasnt been sleeping well she thinks she has because when she asks i tell her she has but she gets up two or three times every night and walks around usually she goes out onto the landing stares at a wall for a second or so then returns to her room but last night was a little scary i found her at the top of the stairs about to step off i tried to wake her but i couldnt she let me guide her back to bed but it was like moving a mannequin i didnt say anything because i didnt want to upset her aside from that i guess id like to know if you think theres anything to the dream i mean he was no great shakes as a father but a murderer what do you remember about that night nothing really there was a party it was loud and wild jo and i were stuck in our cabin not allowed to come out i do remember looking out through the curtains and seeing people laughing and screaming and dancing around some had paint on their faces a bunch of rock bands were blasting sounds like a lovein yeah i guess thats what it was so you never saw anything resembling lucys dream three men carrying off a girl no just couples slinking off together i remember jo telling me guess what theyre doing she was eleven really into the facts of life can you recall anything about lucy and pucks nanny ive been trying to actually she might not have been a nanny because i think she was wearing the same kind of uniform the waiters and waitresses were wearing all white so maybe she was just a waitress to be honest i dont trust my memory on any of this but if something really happened is there anything i can do to help lucy with her sleepwalking just keep her bedroom as safe as possible no sharp objects lock the windows if she doesnt object have her lock the door before she goes to sleep okay he said doubtfully is there a problem with that not really just the thought of being locked in im a little claustrophobic probably because they did it to us that summer put us in a cabin and bolted the door from the outside it was like being caged we hated it robin came home at six kissed me and went into the shower i sat on the floor tossing a ball to spike going along with his retriever fantasies until the phone got me up sherrell best said sorry to bother you again dr delaware but is there anything new nothing concrete yet reverend im sorry nothing concrete does that mean youve learned something i wish i could give you some real progress but could i please meet your patient maybe the two of us can put our heads together i dont want to cause any problems but it might even help ease the burden let me think about it reverend thank you doctor god bless robin and i took spike for a chicken dinner and a drive he wedged himself between her legs and the passenger door and stared out the window with a determined expression on his flat face robin laughed hes guarding us alex look how seriously hes taking it thank you spikey i feel so secure with you joe stud i said she put her hand on my knee i feel secure with you too yeah i said but he takes up less room and he doesnt get emergency calls the night sky turned violet id driven north and just like last week ended up near ventura this time it was more than chance bests call had gotten me thinking about doris reingold and the sheas the discrepancy in their lifestyles i turned off the highway and entered the city limits robin looked at me but didnt say anything we cruised the empty quiet streets the first thing open was a gas station the seville had a quarter tank left i pulled in filled up washed the windows then told robin one sec and went to the pay phone the directory was on its chain but half the pages were gone the rs remained though and reingold d was listed on palomar avenue the cashier told me that was ten blocks up when i got in the car robin said home please indulge me for a second theres something i want to check out is it related to a patient indirectly youre going to drop in on someone no i just want to see how someone lives it wont take long okay she said stretching yeah i know im a real fun date its all right she said if you dont behave yourself he can drive me home the address was a onestory bungalow court on a treeless street three units on each side of a u security floodlights washed the stubble lawn some of the streetlights were out six or seven collegeage boys sat on the grass in folding chairs drinking beer bags of potato chips and fritos lay at their feet they had long hair and though the night was cool all were shirtless when i got closer a couple of them mumbled evening and one of them gave me the thumbsup sign the rest didnt move at all i walked up to the thumber his hair was dark and down to his nipples his cheeks were hollow above curly chin whiskers hey man he said in a slurred voice police i shook my head cause we been quiet after that time man he flicked hair out of his face and stared at me you with the management no i said just someone looking for we paid the rent man cash to mrs patrillo if she dint give it to you thas not our fault doris reingold i said do you know which unit is hers he digested that five but she aint here do you know where she is he scratched his head she packed up some stuff and split when was this frown another head scratch yesterday yesterday night what time um i was just comin home and she was leavin it was at night i said you wan me to carry that stuff for you but she inored me he belched and i could smell the hops taking a swig he said why you looking for her man im a friend he smiled well shes okay ackshally shes a old bitch laughter from some of the others a crewcut kid said youre just pissed cause she cleaned you out kyle thumber moved his head fast and stared at him the other boy said face it kyle fuck you kyle looked back at me she cheats the old bitch at what i said everything poker craps dice whatd you play with her chess yeah well hate to tell you but maybe she got herself a new boyfriend really yeah she split with a dude another of the boys said pass the rinds kyle bent and fumbled on the grass for a long time to a chorus of derision before finally picking up a bag of pork rinds rolling it up he tossed it behind his head someone caught it someone else said shit watch it asshole i said do you remember what this guy looked like nope but he had a fine beemerdubyou to his friends remember that beemerdubyou with the bitchin spoiler on its ass a roundfaced boy with very long wavy blond hair said dint it have a bra yeah said someone for its tits laugh track i looked back at the curb the seville was five cars down the block under a working streetlight the drivers window was open and i was pretty sure i saw spikes blocky head leaning out a dark gray bmw i said chrome wheels yeah said kyle he shifted imaginary gears gonna get me one of them bullshit said another boy first you got to get your license back then you gotta learn how to play cards not like some asshole ill get it back fuck you said kyle suddenly his shoulders were hunched and he was drawing his hand back as if ready for a touchdown throw he snapped his wrist and tossed his beer can it flew by me and landed in the street clattering and rolling narrowly missing a parked car hey man said someone chill fuck you kyle was up on his feet both his hands were tight and he was bouncing on bare feet he had nothing on but baggies tangles of tattoos on both arms he said fuck you again no one answered the snoring boy was awake kyle wheeled and looked at me what do you want he said in a new voice i gave him the thumbsup sign and left as i got back in the car robin said was everything okay back there fine i said oh glorious youth i drove back to malibu thinking of something doris had told me i like nevada a serious gambler was that where the payoff money had gone if thered ever been any her leaving town under tom sheas escort right after i talked to her made me sure i was on to something giving lucys dream new credence i thought about the three men lowell and two others one of them almost certainly trafficant probably the one with his back turned so who was hairy lip maybe just another guest but more likely someone who knew lowell and trafficant well enough to be invited to the private party member of the club another sanctum fellow when we got home i reread the newspaper coverage of the sanctum opening while robin brushed her hair and got into her nightgown three names no pictures christopher graydonjones the english sculptor joachim sprentzel the german composer and denton mellors the aspiring american novelist the sole reviewer to praise command shed the light hed also lauded trafficants book his fellowship payback just as trafficants had been the more i thought about it the more it made sense lowell and his two star pupils maybe hed coached them in something other than writing but where to go with it robin was in bed curled on her side i slipped out of my clothes and got in next to her wrapping my arms around her she mumbled i held her and felt her drift off to sleep i woke up before sunrise thinking about lucys dream she and ken were spending some time together today and her next session would be tomorrow i made breakfast for robin and myself and brought it to bed while she showered i called new york and made another attempt to locate trafficant through his publisher all i learned was that outofprint authors dont garner much respect robin was ready to leave for the jobsite at as her truck pulled away spikes flat face pressed up against the passenger window i was right behind in the seville at bel air she continued east and i turned off at the university i walked into the research library at a few early birds were studying but plenty of computer terminals were available i accessed the periodicals index and typed in names starting with my most likely candidate denton mellors not a word i checked books in print academic journals every sublist i could find nothing if hed ever published his novel there was no record of it i went on to christopher graydonjones three citations the first twenty years ago when the sculptor had received a commission from a company called enterprise insurance to create a bronze and iron piece for the lobby of its corporate headquarters in downtown la minor coverage in the la times arts supplement no picture two years after that a business journal had him working for the same company as assistant deputy director of marketing an interesting transition five years later hed advanced to chief operating officer at enterprise and a publicity photo showed him looking older than his thirtyfive years balding with a long face wide pouchy eyes and a weak chin cleanshaven next joachim sprentzel the german had taught composition at juilliard before committing suicide eight years ago in hartford connecticut a hartford courant obituary cited a protracted illness and noted sprentzels commitment to textural atonalism and chromatic adventure his parents still lived in munich no wife or children a tenyearold juilliard faculty shot portrayed an intenselooking man with a very strong square jaw bushy dark hair and nervous eyes behind tiny wireframe eyeglasses above the jaw a thick drooping mustache remarkably similar in shape and color to diggity dogs hairy lip suicide after a protracted illness a single man my gut assumption was aids but it could have been anything dead another avenue closed off i photocopied all of it and checked in with my service messages from two lawyers a judge and sherrell best i saved the reverend for last he wasnt home and a woman at the church of the outstretched hand said he was out making food deliveries i returned the phone to its cradle three men at a gravesite lowell trafficant and sprentzel all three out of reach i reviewed the photocopied articles it was a long shot but maybe christopher graydonjones was still working downtown i looked up enterprise insurance in the central la book no listing but a scan of the yellow pages revealed an address on th street in santa monica and the subheading specializing in workers compensation plans and corporate liability i called the number and asked for mr graydonjones to my amazement i was put through to a happysounding secretary when i asked to speak to her boss she managed to stay happy while getting protective whats this in regard to sir mr graydonjoness fellowship at sanctum whats sanctum sir an artistic retreat run by the novelist m bayard lowell mr graydonjones was a sculpture fellow there quite a while ago im a freelance writer working on a biography of mr lowell and im attempting to reach an artistic what retreat a place where artists can go to pursue their art youre saying mr graydonjones was once an artist he was a sculptor he did the sculpture in the lobby of enterprises corporate office downtown we havent been downtown for years i realize that but mr graydonjones was commissioned back in is this some sort of joke sir no could you please give him the message he may want to speak with me hes out right now your name sir del ware sandy del ware i gave her my number very well mr del ware she said too quickly then she hung up i looked at my watch twelvefifteen graydonjones out to lunch or sitting behind a big desk shuffling papers a busy important man i had plenty of time enterprises headquarters was only a twentyminute drive the building was just south of olympic in a highend industrial park favoring electronics companies five stories brick and glass with a restaurant on the ground floor called escape specializing in expensive burgers and tropical drinks enterprise was just a suite on the second floor the door was locked and a sign dangling from the knob said out to lunch until pm i went back down to the ground floor no sculpture the door to the restaurant was open and the odors from within werent bad i decided to have lunch and then try again a hostess looked me over and said just one i gave her my best awshucks lonelyguy smile and she put me in a tiny corner table near the rest rooms the place was teeming with suits and smiles the air ripe with alcohol and gravy paper palms on white walls gauguin prints hanging alongside travel photos of blue water and brown bodies i ordered a beer and a tahiti burger and was working my way down the foam when i saw him across the room in a booth with a woman older balder the little hair he had left irongray but definitely the same long face mournful eyes and a chin that had lost even more bone receding into a stringy neck he wore a dark blue suit and a tie so bright it seemed radioactive the woman was in her thirties honeyblond and well put together no food in front of them just red drinks with celery sticks and piles of paper i ate and watched them then the woman collected the papers shook graydonjoness hand and left he ordered another drink and lit up a cigarillo i left money on my table and approached mr graydonjones he looked up the sad eyes were blue i repeated the pitch id given his secretary he smiled yes i got your message sanctum how strange english accent tinged with workingclass cadences that wouldnt mean much here but would pigeonhole him back in the uk what is i said hearing about that place after all this time what was your name again sandy del ware and youre writing a biography of lowell trying to do you have a business card no sorry im a freelance he tapped ashes into an ashtray trying does that mean you have no contract several publishers are interested but my agent wants me to submit a thorough outline before he negotiates a deal ive been able to get all the basics on lowell except for the time period when he opened sanctum in fact youre the only fellow ive been able to locate that so he smiled please sit down drink no but id be happy to buy you one he laughed no thank you two at lunch is my limit he called for the bill ordered coffee for both of us and scrawled something on the check i appreciate your talking to me i said only for a few minutes looking at a big rolex now why on earth would you want to write a book about buck hes an interesting character rise and fall of a major talent hmm yes i suppose that would be nicely ironic but to me he was rather a bore no offense but one of those eternal children americans seem so fond of well hopefully theyll stay fond and buy my book he smiled again and buttoned his jacket over his thin chest the suit looked to be one of those highly structured english affairs that costs thousands his shirt was white with horizontal blue stripes and a high white collar probably turnbull asser the conspicuous tie was patterned with artists brushes and palettes on black jacquard silk simulated dabs of paint supplied the color scarlet and orange and turquoise and limegreen so what would you like to know about the bug farm pardon the bug farm thats what we called the place it was infested with bugs beetles spiders whatever and we were all buggy back then bugged out a bit crazy the old man probably selected us for that hows he doing alive but ill sorry to hear that i suppose anyway theres not much i can tell you the bloody farce only lasted one year i know i lied but no ones been able to tell me why the old man lost interest is why one year we were his prize pigeons the next we were out on our arses best thing that ever happened to me i learned about the real world how were you selected i was an artist back then or at least i thought i was he looked at his hands longfingered powerful bronze and stone i wasnt half terrible actually won some awards in england and got a contract with a gallery in new york the owner heard about the retreat and recommended me to lowell in lieu of paying me for two pieces from sculpture to insurance i said must have been an interesting switch he crushed out the cigarillo theres art in everything anyway im sorry i cant be more helpful as i say it was a foolish year do you have any idea how i can locate the other fellows not joachim sprentzel of course hes dead he scratched his neck really poor chap how suicide his obituary said hed been ill for a long time aids was he gay as springtime not a bad sort kept to himself writing music all day no piano or violin just scratching away at that funny lined paper is there anything else you can tell me about him such as personality characteristics that might be interesting in a book personality he said touching the side of his nose quiet withdrawn a bit gloomy perhaps probably because there were no boys to play with and of course being german thats about it he didnt socialize much none of us did buck gave us each a little cabin and told us to wax brilliant isolation was encouraged it wasnt a sociable place ive heard the grand opening party was pretty interesting so have i wine women song music all sorts of fun one damned bit of haha the whole year and i was having my appendix out bit of bad luck eh when i healed up and got back the old man wouldnt talk to me punishment for not being there as if id defied him by bursting my bloody appendix a few months later i was out on my arse removing the celery stick from his glass he nibbled the edge gawd this takes me back you really think youve got a book in it i hope so send me a copy if it ever gets published absolutely speaking of getting published i cant find anything on the two writing fellows terrence trafficant and denton mellors trafficant had a bestseller then faded from view and mellors just seems to have disappeared without publishing anything terry the pirate and denny this is a hoot havent thought about them in ages well terrys probably in jail somewhere i have no idea about denny you think trafficant got into trouble again i wouldnt doubt it trouble was his art fancied himself a bad guy bloody wild west outlaw bloody criminal is what he was used to walk around with a big hunting knife in his belt take it out during mealtime pick his teeth clean his nails he put it by his plate when he ate protecting his food with one arm as if we were out to steal it he really gave poor sprentzel a hard time removing his shirt asking sprentzel if he thought he was pretty imitating sprentzels accent calling him a faggot and worse threatening him what kinds of threats make you my wife faggot that kind of rubbish the rest of us were scared witless but lowell always stood up for terry a bloody pet one big cheery family we were where else could trafficant be other than jail still its odd i said achieving all that success and reverting back to his old ways a criminal he said with some passion his forehead was shiny and he licked his lips he was never anything but what about mellors another charmer very bright actually wellspoken educated but a bit of an arselicker lowells ass and terrys he got on with terry better than the rest of us not as cherished as terry though numbertwo man on the ladder sounds like there was a hierarchy definitely terry first then denny then sprentzel and me vying for low rung id have to say sprentzel was at rock bottom because he was gay buck had no tolerance for that mans man and all that raw meat for breakfast but he chose sprentzel as a fellow he didnt know when he chose him sprentzel wasnt one of those nellyfairy types flouncing around in fact im not sure how we all found out about him probably from terry terry always made a big point of it he looked downward all that bluster that knife yes poor sprentzel was definitely low man was mellors a tough guy too no not really university type devious but not nasty trying to figure out how to ask what he looked like i said ive seen pictures of trafficant but none of mellors yes terry became quite a celebrity for a while the book what about mellors did he ever publish his book i have no idea shrug as i said buck encouraged isolation what did he look like just to help me form a mental picture big muscular light for his race he was black tan he said what the south africans call colored black features but tan skin blond hair nicelooking fellow actually facial hair i think so its been a long time a beard a mustache i believe he didnt like being thought of as black didnt like to talk about race one time sprentzel brought it up all that german guilt and mellors just walked away then terry showed up with his knife and went into his little fag routine it was really a boring place why were trafficant and mellors highstatus denny because he went around telling everyone what a genius buck was with terry it was something else almost as if buck looked up to him as if he represented something buck admired such as who knows hatred of women he stared at me hatred of everything i suppose the two of them would drink together get pissed and take walks in the woods singing filthy songs did trafficant ever get into any trouble while up there he ran his fingernails over the ridges of the celery stalk other than playing with that knife and making our lives miserable i never saw anything why trying to flesh him out i said i still think its strange the way he vanished as i said check the jails or the cemeteries he had a very nasty temper anything could set him off person like that the chance of leading a long peaceful life goes down thats my business now risk assessment figuring out wholl make it and who wont anyway i must be going its been fun but time to get back to reality milos exhaustion saturated his phone voice taskforce blues i said nothingaccomplished blues the coroner gave us zero on nicolette verdugo our copycats being obsessivecompulsive what about the feces on the corpse the feces he said are of the canine variety another one of those charming details were withholding from the media do any of the bogettes have a dog they have a goddamn pack of dogs but try getting hold of a single turd theyre holed up at some dirt ranch out past pacoima belongs to one of shwandts death penalty lawyers mangy mutts and cats and horses behind chain link and barbed wire a commune at least having them all in one place should make surveillance easier not really theres no real cover too much open space girls come out the front door wearing skimpies and flipping us off the investigation has not progressed apace sir hows lucy havent seen her today shes out driving with ken and someone else took a drive last night i repeated what the boys had told me about doris leaving with tom shea they also said she loves to gamble so if there was some sort of payoff that could explain why the sheas live well and she doesnt you said she didnt seem to like the sheas now tom picks her up if shes taking a temporary vacation because my questions shook things up tom and gwen could be looking over shoulders too they might help her split cause its in their best interests could be your questions combined with our chat with mo barnard she lives right up the hill from the restaurant if she dropped in for dinner and let on that karens file was being opened wonder if the sheasll rabbit too they already left once though now theyve got community ties its possible they view doris as a loose cannon and feel once shes gone they can handle the pressure all her ties are out of town two sons in the army both master sergeants one in germany one near seattle i dont know if they go by reingold she could be with either one of them or somewhere in nevada playing she told me she liked it was thinking of moving there early retirement huh okay when i get a chance ill look into her nothing new on trafficant by the way i cant hit every jail but so far he hasnt shown up in any of the major ones i learned a little more about him today managed to locate one of the sanctum fellows a sculptor named christopher graydonjones hes become a biggie at an insurance company in santa monica we had drinks he remembers trafficant as a knifewielding bully and lowells pet trafficant and lowell used to get drunk together and take walks in the forest and the third man in the dream may be a writer named denton mellors only critic to give lowells last book a good review he had a mustache though it doesnt match the one lucy describes in the dreams and he idolized lowell he and trafficant were a clique at the retreat so my moneys on him as hairy lip and trafficant as the man with his back turned graydonjones said something else that supports that lowell looked up to trafficant it wasnt a standard studentteacher thing last session i had with lucy she described the third man as talking roughly to lowell ordering him to roll the girl into the grave from what i heard today trafficant couldve done that and gotten away with it what do you think i think he said that youve got threads getting closer to a weave but with all these people gone so many years passed it may not happen then again whom i to criticize i spent today praying for wisdom in dog shit denton mellors had been a graduate student at columbia but it was too late to call the university on the chance that hed returned to new york i tried information in all the new york boroughs and new jersey but found nothing then i wondered if hed stayed in la and gotten a writing job on a newspaper or magazine or in film before i could get any further with that my service called emergency from mr ken lowell doctor he couldnt stay on the line sounded pretty upset heres the number my heart lurched as i copied down the exchange and called it another suicide attempt or worse lucy more vulnerable than id thought hypnosis a terrible mistake weakening her defenses van nuys division the police worse this is dr delaware returning ken lowells call whos he probably a victims brother probably im a doctor returning an emergency call to this number what was the persons name lowell four unbearable minutes later ken said thank god they reached you were in real trouble lucy no no its puck we found him lucy and i it was horrible she didnt actually see him i closed the door before she could but what happened ken theyre saying overdose he must have gotten hold of some strong stuff or something he the needle was still sticking out of his arm i heard him gag sorry take your time he was all but you could see the damned needle his voice broke and i heard him choke back sobs it wasnt even an arm anymore he said gulping but you could see the damned needle the van nuys station is part of the municipal complex on sylvan just off the boulevard where thrift shops pawnbrokers bail bondsmen and discount westernwear barns prevail posted just inside the door among the bulletins and wanted posters was a xeroxed flier from a local gang threatening to assassinate officers someone had written on it come and get it lowlife the front room was noisy and active several handcuffed men waited to be booked it took a while to get past the desk finally a detective named almondovar came out and walked me through the squad room to the robberyhomicide area thirtyfive or so he was compact and stubby with neat graying hair and curious eyes his ultrasuede sportcoat was gray his slacks a darker gray and he wore lizardskin cowboy boots whose doctor are you he said lucy lowells was it an accidental od did you know the victim just by reputation bigtime addict longterm addict from the shape he was in you couldnt tell much here we are he opened the door of an interrogation room lucy and ken sat next to each other at a folding card table looking like prisoners of war before them were two cups of coffee untouched hey folks said almondovar kens eyes were red and his blondstubbled face looked swollen lucy didnt move or blink her dull gaze went right through me almondovar said we already took statements from them doctor if theres anything more we need well let you know neither ken nor lucy budged what i mean doctor is they can go well get going soon as possible i said almondovar whispered in my ear we might need the room soon to lucy and ken sorry folks well do what we can to clear this up he walked out ken covered his face and shook his head i patted his shoulder he looked at me trying to smile then turned to lucy she was staring at the wall her eyes were glassy i took her hand and gave it a gentle squeeze she squeezed back then she took a very deep breath and stood up she seemed unsteady ken was out of his chair grabbing her elbow but she was okay i walked them out through the station a few cops looked up but most didnt we left kens taurus in a city pay lot and i drove them to rockingham avenue when we got in the house lucy said im tired ill settle you in said ken the two of them disappeared and i waited in the living room leafing through a coffeetable book on the great mansions of newport rhode island a quarter hour later ken came down hed removed his jacket and his shirt was wrinkled can i get you a drink or something no thanks do you want to sleep too he made a hard angry sound that could have been a laugh or a cough i guess i should tell you what happened it doesnt have to be now might as well he said its not going to get any easier we went through the kitchen into the breakfast room and sat down at an oak table we were going to drive out to look at some horse land im foreclosing on said ken first we went out to breakfast this morning lucy seemed very uptight when the food came she didnt touch it i asked her what was wrong and she said she couldnt stop worrying about puck then she started crying he gave a pained look sure i cant get you some coffee im fine okay where was i rubbing his chin so i said why dont we go over to his place and see if he left any indication where he went she said she didnt know if that was a good idea in case people were looking for him she didnt want to tip them off didnt want to put me in danger either he wiped his eyes drug people i said i guess we never actually talked about his problem i never even realized he was addicted until later i mean when i met him i knew something was wrong thin always coughing his nose running i wondered about aids anyway we ate for a while at least i did then lucy said maybe we should go we could look around to make sure no one was watching the apartment and if there wasnt we could go in excuse me he got up fixed a cup of instant coffee and brought it to the table then she said she was sure he was in some kind of danger otherwise he would have called her at least once i asked her what danger she said she really didnt know puck tried to keep his problems to himself but probably some kind of debt situation so we went to his place lucy had a key wiping a tear what a rathole basically an abandoned building the store below was vacant to get to pucks place you had to climb up some rear stairs near the trash bins he ran his hands through his hair and swallowed hard we went in and there was this smell right away like stale laundry mixed with badly rotting food but the place was a mess open cans crap all over the carpet so i didnt think anything of it it was a surprisingly big place two bedrooms but no real furniture lucy said the rear bedroom was pucks so we went back there the door was closed but we heard something behind it like an electric shaver we looked at each other scared out of our minds then i figured maybe its good news he just got back hes shaving cleaning up so i opened the door he blinked and put the cup down just a crack but this cloud came out at me flies hundreds maybe thousands of them that was the sound and maggots the whole bed was covered with them on the floor on the drapes like someone had tossed rice all over then i saw underneath a big mound of them on the bed this thing the needle sticking out of it shiny and clean the only clean thing in there he was under them on the bed and on the floor it was hard to tell what was him and what was hed melted milo said its called purge fluid stuff leaks out when putrefactions well under way it means hed been there for a while we were in the living room of the brentwood house hed just arrived nearly two hours after id brought ken and lucy back both of them were sleeping how long i said hard to say there was no airconditioning in the apartment coroner says the most we can expect is an estimate three to eightday range well we know its closer to three because before that he was in new mexico looks like he came back soon after he called lowell but he still didnt call lucy came back after scoring he said van nuys found a nice little chunk in the toilet tank mexican brown but very strong small corner chipped away sampling the goods and he odd i said too stoned to call lucy he looked around the room how longs she been asleep hour and a half ken too he went up to see how she was doing a half hour ago and didnt come down escape to sleep he said old buck tends to nod off when hes under stress too he cracked his knuckles some people just have shitty lives dont they and the rest of us live off them hey why dont we blow this joint go to the circus or something did i ever tell you i once busted a clown when i was on patrol peeping tom never worked that into his act he got up and paced the room nice place the scamsters set up for themselves crime almost paid ken came down the stairs holding on to the banister his hair was combed but he looked sick guess i dozed off hi detective they shook hands is lucy awake i said just up she said if you wanted to come up it was okay shes at the end of the hall i went up the stairs lucys room was pale blue with white trim smallish with a canted ceiling and a big fourposter with laceedged covers she was sitting on the edge staring out the window i sat next to her she didnt react her eyes were dry and her lips were chapped im so sorry lucy gone she said everything i patted her hand fingers cold as pucks junkie digits heard the doorbell she said that was milo she nodded then kept the movement going a faint rocking no surprise she said guess i always knew but its never easy like being stripped one thing at a time empty world i squeezed her fingers he can come up she said milo almost pleading i stepped out to the landing milo and ken were still in the entry it didnt look as if either of them had moved shed like to see you he bounded the steps two at a time when we were alone ken touched his belly and gave a squeamish look stomachs off cant hold on to anything maybe ill finally take off some blubber i smiled gained way too much fifteen pounds during the last year my divorce it hasnt been a friendly one kelly my wife met another guy shed been complaining about being bored so i suggested she take some classes at the junior college she met him there some outofwork construction guy i tried to get her to go to counseling but she wouldnt when i finally realized we were going to break up i tried to keep it amicable for the kids but she badmouthed me to them that doesnt help the kids its been going on over a year and were still in court her dads got lots of money lawyers on retainer she says she wont give up until she has everything he gave another coughlaugh thats why i was motivated to get in touch with puck and lucy now this milo returned she fell asleep again id better go lock the door said ken milo said why i told him oh turning to ken call me if you need anything thanks detective are they treating what happened as an accident probably guess it was said ken sometimes it seems like everything is outside at the curb i asked milo if lucyd said anything she held my hand and took turns smiling and crying think she has any chance coming out of this reasonably intact shes pretty tough but this shes topping off the stress scale beautiful day he said looking at the sapphire sky i had time to make some calls the surf shops closed meaning the sheas may have split too still nothing on trafficant and if your mr mellors is a bad guy hes been a careful one nothing on ncic in fact i cant find any record of him at all whats going on i said everyones just disappearing he rubbed his face we all do eventually i returned home and tried columbia university theyd never heard of denton mellors either hed lied about his educational background or was using a false name pen name i got the number for the manhattan book review and called the magazine the man who answered let out a stuffedsinus laugh mellors and who are you lord chatterley sometimes i feel like it that cut off his laughter hes not one of ours we have no grounds to keep he definitely wrote for you i said reviewed m bayard lowells last book that sounds awfully like ancient history twentyone years ago well thats paleolithic isnt it is there anyone on your staff who was working on the magazine at the time were not a magazine he said miffed were a review a state of mind actually and we have no permanent staff just mr upstone myself and a bevy of freelance hopefuls what does it take to be a reviewer one has to recognize the proper criteria for judging books which are style and substance now i fail to see the importance i work for a law firm out in la mr mellors has come into an inheritance nothing big but he still might want to know about it how nice for him was mr upstone around when mr mellorss review came out mr upstone has always been around may i speak with him please if youre good i promise he laughed california how can you live there a few minutes later a crosssounding tobacco voice said mason upstone i repeated my request upstone broke in i wont tell you a damn thing havent you ever heard of the right to privacy im not thats right youre not tell your friends at the cia or the fbi or whoever it is youre with to do something more constructive than spying on creative people slam i went out on the deck and tried to relax the sky out there was even bluer but i couldnt unwind i couldnt stop bad things from happening to lucy but i should have been able to deal with a dream lowell trafficant mellors i pulled out the clipping on the sanctum party and read it one more time lowell holding court trafficant with his own circle of groupies had they tried to outdo one another the night of the party had karen best been the victim of that competition there had to be some way to connect the pieces i ran my eyes down the names of partygoers the usual westside showbiz list no indication any of them had a relationship with lowell with one exception the film producer whod financed construction of the retreat curtis app his name had come up before i shuffled through articles till i found it a pen fundraiser at apps malibu house had been the site of lowells reentry into the public eye fundraiser for political prisoners had app shared lowells sympathy for talented criminals or was he just a generous man calculated generosity film peoples selfesteem often lagged their wealth had app tried to buy himself respectability by hitching up with a great man an independent producer had optioned command shed the light for film app or some other patron paying to adapt poetry to the screen seemed an absurd business decision more charity great man on the skids app buying in cheap sinking money into sanctum then watching it all fall apart as lowell lost interest he might very well have a few opinions on lowell no phone listings under his name no great surprise didnt producers belong to some kind of trade group the producers guild i found the address south beverly drive in beverly hills and was just about to punch the number when my service clicked in someone on your line from mr lowell doctor she wouldnt give a last name sexy voice i took the call nova said are you still planning to bring the daughter up there were no plans i was under the impression there were hes expecting her the best times late afternoon five or later he takes a long nap after lunch and there were no plans i repeated and somethings come up oh really she said coolly and whats that mr lowells son peter was found dead today silence when did this happen she said skeptically the body was discovered this morning hed been dead for a while how did he die heroin overdose damn she said how am i going to tell him call the police and let them do it no no its my job this is obscene the mans been through so much when he wakes up hell expect me to tell him about the daughters visit you should have her come especially now he deserves it think so i said why are you being so hostile im just trying to do whats right so am i im sorry suddenly a softer tone im sure you are this caught me by surprise i have no experience with this kind of thing i really dont know what to do theres no easy way to tell him i said just find the right time and do it whats the right time she said almost timidly when hes not drunk or highly medicated or upset about something else that doesnt leave much but youre right ill just have to bite the bullet sounding miserable whats the matter i said what if i tell him and he has a fit and hes in such bad shape what if he has another stroke what do i do all alone with him he obviously needs a doctor i know i know but he hates them then i dont know what to tell you he likes you would you come up and be there when i tell him maybe coach me i laughed i think youve got the wrong guy no no he does said hed given you both barrels and youd shot right back he respects you its the first time ive heard him say anything respectful about anyone i know its an imposition but ill pay you for your time please this freaks me out i dont do death well too much weirdness in this family this wasnt what i expected when i took the job but i cant abandon him too many people have it seems to me hes the one doing the abandoning youre right she said but he doesnt see it that way he cant help himself hes too old to change im really worried im going to mess this up please help me ill make it worth your while i wont take your money i said conflict of interest but ill come up and it has to be now the kindly therapist even as i mapped out a walk through the grounds looking for lacy trees you will she said thats so incredible if theres anything i can do in return sexy voice lets just get through this i said i feel sorry for the whole family yes she said theyre a pitiful bunch arent they she was sitting on the porch and got up to meet me as i pulled up to the hitching posts she had on a soft black minidress and black sandals a bra this time the cups patterned in relief under the cotton she jogged down the big wooden steps smiling and i felt about to be tackled as she came straight at me stopping inches away she took my hand her body was sleek but this close with the sunlight bathing her face i noticed tiny tuck scars where her ears met her jawline face lift older than id thought her hand held on to mine and i looked down and saw other scars on her arms small barely discernible with the exception of one long white line running parallel to the knuckles of her right hand thank you she pecked my cheek hes still sleeping letting go she directed me onto the porch with just a touch at the small of my back how long does he usually sleep i said he can go anywhere from two to five hours i try to ease up on the morphine before lunch so hell have an appetite but he generally reacts strongly to it who prescribes the morphine a doctor in pacific palisades does this doctor ever actually see him she rubbed her index finger with her thumb sighed and smiled what can i say i thought of how lowell had despised puck for his addiction come on in she opened the front door how about a walk i said ive been cooped up all day sure she said smiling and smoothing back her hair let me get something first she ran up the stairs and came back with a white plastic hand radio with a rubber antenna the brand sticker said kidstuff its for babies she said clipping it onto her waistband but thats what old people are right big babies she rotated a dial on the radio and static came on its got a range of about five hundred feet so we cant go too far sometimes he wakes up like a baby crying out he wears diapers too she stayed very close to me as we strolled around the house directly behind the building was a dry unplanted parcel broken only by an empty laundry line on metal posts beyond that the beginnings of forest the brush growing so thick it looked impenetrable nova and i crossed the dirt and i studied the house no porches or balconies just rough logs and windows and a single door drapes covered three of the windows on the ground floor is that his bedroom i said uhhuh it used to be the library but he cant get upstairs anymore she started to walk i kept looking at the house and she stopped ugly isnt it she said like a big log cabin she nodded and pressed her arm against mine yeah that old rustic feeling in his shape i said i dont imagine decor means much i doubt it ever did money doesnt mean much to him either probably cause hes always had it hes cued in to one thing only himself cool appraisal no malice everything about her seemed cool have you worked for him a long time six months whats your background she laughed im a writer what kind of things do you write poetry mostly im thinking of doing a screenplay about california the strange things you see here are you from the east no up north howd you hook up with him i wrote him a fan letter and he answered i wrote back and he sent an even longer letter we began a correspondence about writing style and story structure things like that a few months later he offered me a job as a personal assistant he made it sound as if he was fundamentally healthy and just needed light care then i arrived and found out i was going to have to change diapers but you stayed anyway sure she said swinging her arms and picking up her pace hes an institution how could i turn him down not to mention material for a screenplay i said my impression was that hes a faded institution her jaw tightened deepening the tuck scars maybe to fools who follow the bestseller list stopping she raised the volume on the radio nothing but the static she lowered it again but didnt move i said i heard this place was once a retreat for artists and writers long time ago nice concept what is retreating getting away from the grind oh you never do you just change gears she turned and began circling back toward the front of the house i stayed with her so youre a fan of his absolutely any books in particular everything didnt he write a book of poems that was considered antiwoman she gave me a sharp smile you mean am i being a traitor to my sex by admiring him yes to him women are meat he grabs my ass at least once a day but if women were honest theyd admit men were meat to them too lets face it big cocks are better than little cocks holding the smile she swung her arms and brushed my thigh were all meat she said almost singing it what else is there at least bucks honest about it i clean his shit he cant hide anything from me nor you from him what do you mean you still have to tell him about peter she made a grumbling sound nearly masculine a scarred hand pinched her nose then scratched the tip gnats she said slapping the air they think im delicious yes ill tell him but just the fact that youre up here makes me feel good believe it or not knowing smile youve got a certain aura you get off on helping people dont you another thigh brush thanks she said touching my chin i stepped away from her she looked amused any advice for me what was his relationship with peter like only met the little shit once faggodly coward begging for money heres buck struggling to live using dope only as a last resort and the stupid little snot shoots it voluntarily into his veins i caught him once trying to rip off some of bucks ampules told him to give them back or id tell daddy you should have seen the way his mouth dropped he handed them over never came back maybe he was being honest in his own way how she demanded picking up her pace and moving out of touching range the front porch came into view maybe being nothing but meat was too much for him to handle why what else is there a house in the suburbs look at that she pointed upward to a bird skittering among the treetops how long will it live a month a year one day it will be flying along and some predator will come crashing down on it crushing its bones in its jaws squeezing the juice out her neck muscles were tense the tuck scars were deep black lines but it was here it served its time were fools if we think were any different our only meaning is being so whats wrong with cutting it short she stopped you advocate suicide thats a switch for a psychologist isnt it i dont advocate it but i dont judge either i do a writer always does thats the difference youve devoted your life to learning the rules i cherish the exceptions good speech but lowells voice seeped through she put her hands on her hips get her up here the daughter what else does he have left isnt he entitled to it he hasnt been much of a father hes tried has he in his own way which is what staying out of their lives so his genius wouldnt overshadow them giving them money who do you think paid for the cowards dope after he ran through his trust fund then he tries to pocket those ampules the little puke whys buck so interested in seeing lucy because hes her father a girl should meet her father if she doesnt its her loss hes one of a kind theres beauty in that alone dont you see one of a kind i said look she said fighting to keep her voice low you get off on helping people but that doesnt mean you know everything if you were hiking in some strange place and you came across a snake that had never been seen before maybe it was poisonous you had no idea would you run from it or would you try to capture it and learn about it depends on the danger her nostrils widened and pulsed she opened and shut her hands several times okay i tried youve got your script a few more steps then hes the only thing in her miserable little groundchuck existence that can make her prime meat but go on let her continue in the same old way sound came from the radio low and anguished then louder wordless moans then filthy words a chain of them babys up she said just past the stairs she said you can wait here alone with the stuffed heads i walked around the giant room listening to loud voices from the back of the house when she finally pushed his chair out he was in a dark blue silk robe over white pajamas and his hair was disheveled the jew he said slapping the wheels with his hands trying to go faster but nova was in control and she steered him right at me der yid spittle flecked his lips and his eyes were crusted he rubbed one picked something out and flung it away and dont tell me your cock hasnt been peeled and your mother goes to mass youre a dimestore freud and that makes you a jew thinking youre better than everyone and have a right to nose into everyones business every analyst i knew felt that way thats why all analysts are kikes i stared at a stuffed owl he said wheres the girl nova said be nice to him buck in an overly sweet tone he came all the way here to tell you something important i stared at her she shrugged and walked over to a window i said did i she said didnt you youre the expert then she left lowell watched her those cheeks he said like sugarcoated sponge rubber to be between them whats on your mind dimestore the girl still working on her bruisedvirgin courage dispatching you on another reconnaissance mission its puck i said hes dead drug overdose he nodded stopped clamped both hands down on his wheels and turned his back on me all right he said very quietly all right youve delivered the message now fuck you to hell if i see you again ill kill you he showed up two days later at the funeral arriving late wheeled across the rolling lawn of the cemetery by nova conspicuous in a white suit and shirt and a widebrimmed straw hat he stayed well back from lucy and ken as a minister on call to the mortuary recited a dispirited prayer once novas eyes met mine and tried to hook me into a staring contest one of her hands touched a breast i turned my attention back to the service the cemetery was one of those hundredacre things yearning to be a theme park offices in a colonial mansion bulldozed hillocks of golf turf replicas of michelangelos statuary cropping up in odd places instead of gravestones brass plaques were set flush with the ground ken had bought peters strip of perpetuity yesterday after milod helped speed release of the body id spent a good part of the past fortyeight hours at the house on rockingham ken and lucy had been nearly inert eating little resting a lot barely capable of speech id experienced some inertia myself not following up on curtis app or doing anything else about karen best sherrell best had phoned once and id had my service call him back to say id get to him in a couple of days the grief of the moment loomed so huge it seemed to have blotted out the dream i wasnt sure when or if lucy would ever return to it still as i stood there among all that barbered green it chewed at me a few feet behind me two laborers waited under a tree the minister said something about the puzzles of life and gods will then he shot a glance at the laborers and they came over one of them activated a motor attached to thick cloth straps that supported the gray lacquered coffin the straps loosened very slowly and descended as it hit bottom it made a resonant almost musical sound and lucy let out a high agonized wail ken held her and rocked her as she cried into her hands behind them buck said something to nova the laborers began shoveling dirt on the coffin each clump made lucy cry out kens face looked ready to crumple buck shook his head and nova wheeled him away the chair bumped its way over the grass catching a couple of times and forcing nova to free its wheels finally she got it to the curb of the swooping drive where the hearse sat and worked a long time getting lowell out of the chair and into the jeep folding the chair and stowing it in back she sped off i dropped milo off at the west la station and drove back to malibu shooting the curl was still closed had i flushed the prey too well i stopped off at the malibu civic center and killed an hour locating a business license for the surf shop when the original papers had been filed the sheas had been living on the land side up rambla pacifica three years later theyd moved to the block of pacific coast highway i drove back south and found the place a onestory cape cod white board and green shutters squeezed between two bigger stucco edifices probably one of the original beach structures of the twenties and thirties reminiscent of a quieter simpler malibu sometimes big storms washed the old places out to sea i rang the bell no answer the knocker was a bronze sea lion patinaed with salt i used it to drum the green wooden door a couple of times still nothing neither gwens customized van nor toms bmw was in sight but no mail in the box not even throwaways i went home and called the producers guild and learned that curtis app was president of new times productions in century city a call to new times got me a voice mail system that required an engineering degree to understand i pushed to speak with mr app and got cut off it was just after noon i drove into the city heading straight for the university library the computer held a dozen references to app the most recent being fiveyearold reviews of a movie hed produced called camp hatchet ii bomb review maybe that was his spiritual link with lowell the next seven citations were more of the same then i found a thirteenyearold article in american film entitled app on the defense teen pix producer says he keeps kids out of trouble the magazine hadnt been microfilmed but it was in the stacks the article was an interview in which app acknowledged the dreadful critical notices hed received on each of the nine softsex bloodandgore flicks hed produced and admitted that my pictures arent dostoyevsky theyre popcorn for the head but no pubic hair or nipples kids watch them space out and have a good time in the drivein when theyre there theyre off the streets so think of it as public service programming as a parent id rather have my kid watch janey makes the squad or red moon over camp hatchet than a lot of the garbage thats on network tv the accompanying color photo showed app sitting in the drivers seat of a longsnouted red ferrari convertible a satisfied smile on his face a perfect sky and palm trees in the background from the narrowness of his shoulders a small man thin face with ratlike features and an extremely pointed chin gray hair caesar cut white tennis shirt red sweater that matched the ferrari great tan no mention of his ever optioning lowells book so either id guessed wrong about that or it was something he wanted to forget scrolling back i came across nothing on him for the next nine years then a piece in the wall street journal entitled retail food a growth market it turned out to be one of those centerofthefrontpage lightweight articles the journal runs in order to amuse nervous businessmen the full title read retail food a growth market if consumers special needs are met curtis app likes sprouts and jicama back in those days three years before the sanctum party app had been a financial analyst for an investors group specializing in supermarket chains vending machines coinop laundries and fastfood outlets in the article he predicted that retailers were going to have to cater to ethnic and special needs to be successful in an increasingly competitive market a photoengraving showed the same pointy face with full dark beatlelength hair from groceries to slasher flicks an association with lowell must have seemed the next step toward high art i left the library and stopped at an instantprint place in westwood no other customers in the store and it took exactly twentythree minutes to obtain fifty business cards good paper ecru shade classy embossed script sander del ware freelance writer below that a phony post office box in beverly hills and a phone number id used ten years ago while in private practice putting three cards in my wallet and the rest in the trunk of the seville i headed for century city new times productions was located in a twentystory black tower on avenue of the stars a hit movie a few years ago had featured a building just like it under siege by terrorists in the film a rogue cop had vanquished the bad guys using guile and machismo most of the actual occupants of the reallife building were attorneys and film outfits in real life the terrorists would have been offered a deal the production company took up almost all of the top floor the exception one office belonging to an outfit named advent ventures the new times entry was two huge glass doors i pushed one of them and it opened silently on a skylit waiting room the floor was black granite the furniture lucite white leather and iron powdercoated deep blue variety and the hollywood reporter were piled up on tables big frameless blackandwhite paintings hung on gray wool walls a girl who looked about eighteen in a white tshirt and secondskin jeans tucked into spurred blackandwhite cowskin boots sat behind a deskette her long straight hair was buttercup streaked with ebony a diamond was set into one nostril despite bad skin she had a great face i stood there awhile before she looked up from her cuticles uhhuh im here for mr app name sandy del ware are you the chiropractor i thought you were tomorrow i handed her a card she wasnt impressed the place was silent no one else seemed to be around do you uh have an appointment i think mr app would like to see me its about sanctum her lips rotated a couple of times as if spreading lipstick if thered been a pencil on her desk she might have chewed it ive only been here a couple of weeks hes in a meeting at least ask him i said sanctum buck lowell terry trafficant denton mellors she agonized then punched two numbers on a seethrough lucite phone its some producer about santa and dylan uh miller im what oh okay sorry she put the phone down looked at it blinked hard hes in a meeting no problem i can wait i dont think he wants to see you really yeah he was pretty bent about being interrupted oh i said sorry the meeting must be with somebody important no hes all by she touched her mouth frowned yeah its important is a big star in there with him she went back to her cuticles to her left was a hall i strode past her desk and went for it hey she said but she didnt come after me just as i rounded the corner i heard buttons being punched i passed gray wool doors and movie posters depicting guntoting hugebusted women of the receptionists age and leathered fourdaybearded malemodel types pretending to be bikers and soldiers of fortune the films had names like sacrifice alley and hot blood hot pants and several had recent release dates the drivein circuit or instant video at the end of the hall was a big tooled brass door wide open standing in the doorway was app he was around sixty fivesix maybe a hundred and twenty his caesar cut had been reduced to a few white wisps tickling a deep tan forehead he wore a custardcolored cashmere cardigan over a lemonyellow knit shirt knife edgepressed black slacks and brown crocodile loafers get the fuck out of here he said in a calm bigmans voice or ill have your fucking ass thrown out i stopped he said turn yourself the fuck around mr app he cut the air with both hands like an umpire calling a runner safe ive already called security you fucking jerk reverse yourself and you just might avoid getting arrested and your fucking paper sued from here to kingdom come im not with any paper i said im a freelancer writing a biography of buck lowell i put a card in his face he snatched it and held it at arms length then gave it back to me so your name came up in my research mr app id just like a few minutes of your time you think you can pop in here like some fucking salesman if id called would i have been able to get an appointment hell no and youre not getting one now he pointed to the door okay i said ill just write it up the way i see it your optioning command shed the light bankrolling sanctum only to see it collapse a year later thats business he said ups and downs pretty big down i said especially on lowells part he took your money and funded guys like terry trafficant and denton mellors denny mellors he laughed without opening his mouth she said something about santa claus and dylan miller you know who dylan miller is i shook my head grand prize asshole and that asswipe rag he works for every other week weve got droves of assholes just like him fucking paparazzi creeping around the building like roaches looking for stars the other day julia roberts was on the twelfth floor for a meeting and they were sweeping the bastards out with brooms theres no end to it maybe you need better security i said he stared at me this time his laughter came with a flash of capped teeth pulling up the left cuff of his cardigan he peered at a watch so thin it looked like a platinum tattoo i heard footsteps behind me app looked over my shoulder then leaned against the doorframe turning i saw a big heavy samoan security guard the name on his tag was long and unpronounceable some kind of problem mr app he said in a tuba voice that made apps sound prepubescent app moved his eyes back to me and studied my face the way a casting director would smiling he put a hand on my shoulder no mr del rey and i were just having a little chat delondra called down a misunderstanding were going to take a meeting clem sorry to bother you i smiled at the guard he sucked his teeth and left app called out delondra the receptionist came over taking geisha steps in her skintight jeans what mr app app reached into his pocket and drew out a wad of bills clamped by a sterling silver monkey paw peeling off five he held them out to the girl hundreds thanks mr app whats this for severance pay you no longer work here her mouth opened a small smooth hand closed around the bills app turned his back on her and said come on in was it sandy lets hear whats on your mind maybe we can conceptualize it for film two walls of his office were windows the other two bleached maple burl the windows showed off la county the way a hawk would see it just before it swooped the wood showcased a warhol silkscreen of a smiling marilyn monroe and transparent plastic shelves full of bound scripts some of the screenplays had titles handlettered on their spines others were blank app took a seat behind a blue triangular marble desk with nothing on it but a blue marble phone and offered me the only other chair in the room an unupholstered black straightbacked thing at his feet was a large marble wastebasket full of more scripts so he said what else have you done besides this book journalism i threw out the names of a few magazines betting he didnt read much what made you want to write about buck fall from grace the whole notion of genius gone bad no kidding giving him money wasnt one of the brighter things ive done you can write that what led you to option poetry soft heart he said everything was collapsing around the bastard he touched his chest got a soft spot for creative types same reason you financed sanctum yeah helping young artists what could be more fucking important right dont put fucking in hey arent you going to take notes didnt bring anything i said i figured id have enough trouble getting through the door without a tape recorder and a notepad see more capped teeth never know you caught me on a good day im mother fucking teresa there must have been a drawer in the marble desk because he pulled a piece of paper out of it and waved it at me new times stationery here he said retrieving a bound script from the wastebasket write on this do i need to give you a fucking pen too i pulled out a ballpoint five minutes he said all you can eat during that time and then vamoose putting his arms behind his head he sat back so you liked the concept of sanctum i said what about lowells choice of fellows terry terry was a talented guy actually personal problems but who doesnt so you never saw him act violent not to me he used to put on this mr macho thing walking around without a shirt all these tattoos of naked girls but he had talent whatever happened to him hell if i know idiot had all sorts of good stuff coming to him i coulda had deals for him and he just split do you think lowell knows where he went i always figured he did but he never admitted it that was the final straw between us after all i did for the bastard i figured i had some honesty coming you meet him yet just briefly sick isnt it guys rolling in money and he lives like a pig if hes rich how come he needed to come to you for financing he slid his arms from behind his head and placed them on the desk because i was a jackass didnt know he was rich never checked him out and i used to be a fucking financial analyst no excuse tapping the marble hey thats showbiz another glance at the platinum watch i said so you have no idea about what happened to trafficant no but if you find out let me know asshole owes me a script shaking his head stupid mudfuck he coulda made a living great ear for dialogue he knew how to conceptualize in terms of scenes now denny mellors was another story wooden ear thought he was some fucking ivy league literatitype and no fucking boy scout either he never got the bad pr terry got but he was antisocial from day one nasty temper not that i have anything against black people not that he was even that black i think his mother was white or something he talked like a white but the guy waving disgustedly he put his feet up on the desk the soles of his shoes were shiny black unmarked what did he do i said he looked out the window the san gabriel mountains were capped with brown air you know my friend talking to you is giving me ideas any film interest in your book yet some you have any experience in film not really then dont jump into anything people are going to tell you they can do all sorts of things for you meanwhile theyve got a thumb in the vaseline ready to yank down your jockeys ive been in the industry for twenty years can get things done and this book of yours is flashing concept lights like you said fall from grace and did you know the place used to be a nudist colony hows that for a premise writers and artists and nudists they get thrown together and shit happens violent shit i said all kinds of shit youd have to change things around of course for legal purposes maybe make lowell a musician a cellist yeah i like that its a music retreat nudists and musicians rock types and classical types all thrown together seductive right interesting so whos the bad guy mellors thats not too pc so we make him white he was mostly white anyway blond hair little yellow mustache big strong buck nasty nasty how nasty temper talked all the time about hurting things hurting women im not saying he actually did anything but you talk like that long enough who knows see what you mean i said ive read about the grand opening party for sanctum sounds like a wild affair a lovein that might be a good place for the shit to happen he looked up at the ceiling cheap acoustical tiles maybe yeah like a felliniesque thing dolce vita with acid pot kind of a sixtiesseventies thing thats coming back you know were you at the party in the beginning he said then it got too loud and my wife made me take her home did you see mellors or trafficant nah he said too many people noise mess all sorts of shit one of those situations where you see everyone but you dont see anyone know what i mean la dolce vita meets the trip exactly he moved his eyes from the ceiling to me you know how to conceptualize have an agent still looking for one you got a book deal without one contacts from journalism whos your editor i made up a name he nodded well get yourself an agent or talk to me directly and we just might work something out lets say an eighteenmonth option with first rights to renew what kind of option money are we talking about hey he said grinning maybe you dont need an agent what kind of money the usual assuming we get a network interested but ive got to have everything tied up before i go to them nowadays theyre more cautious than a virgin on horseback you werent thinking big screen were you actually forget it sammy tvs the only way to go theyre taking chances the studios wont and even though syndications not the honeymoon it used to be its still a serious game think you can write me up a treatment one or two pages lets say by next tuesday sure i said but i want to discuss some story elements with you first make sure were talking the same language story he said dismissively youre the writer give me good and evil some conflict resolution maybe some martial arts networks are ripe for martial arts nothing decent since kung fu musicians and nudists and evil course they couldnt be shown nude but youll find some way to let everyone know theyre buck naked like a sly wink know what i mean but respectful of the human body something women can get behind good and evil the characters arc but they maintain their basic goodbad nature the more i think about it the better i like it he rubbed his hands together and stood you got thirteen fucking minutes for the price of five sam you see mellors as the evil lead i said if you make him white can you tell me anything more about him that would flesh out the character nasty piece of work like i said he hated women called them manipulative bitches i took him in after sanctum closed gave him a job because i felt sorry for him he was working on a book couldnt finish it writers block money block writers block was lowells game talk about big talk no action anyway denny came to me begging because he knew i was a soft touch broke hed depended on lowell he was writing this novel gonna be the greatest thing since moby dick if he could only finish it being a liberal dogooder i gave him a job with my company in return for first refusal on the manuscript what kind of job idiot work business affairs office writing memos filing contracts xeroxing the idea was to free him up to write then one day he waltzes in announces no more book its a screenplay now the story lends itself to that form fine makes my life that much easier i wait six months then six more he walked to the bookcase eyeing the shelves for a second he pulled a thin unmarked volume out of the middle opened it put it back and removed another one even thinner this is what he gives me i took the folder bound in brown marbled cardboard the title page said the bridea screenplay by denton w mellors take it home said app i like you but youre outa here got a meeting i folded my notes and put them away app tossed the script id used for a writing board back into the trash we walked to the door i havent been able to locate mellors i said any idea what happened to him who the fuck knows after i told him i couldnt use that piece of shit youre holding he cursed me out threw a chair broke some precolumbian pieces and left last i saw of him thank god scared the shit out of me first time i hired a bodyguard we left the office and walked down the postered hall past the empty reception desk he opened a glass door and held it nice meeting you sammy what makes you run ha ha lets both of us do some serious thinking about what we want out of this write something up and then we can break some bread lets say wednesdayish lunch i walked over to the century city shopping mall found a café with private booths and sat down to coffee and denton mellorss script not a complete script it soon became clear just a fivepage triplespaced summary what app had called a treatment the bride we open upon a man watching a woman undressing from his face we see he is a homicidal maniac but handsome and muscular the kind of man women gravitate to he holds a boning knife it is nighttime the moon hits it and it glints the maniac gets up from his crouch and cuts through a sliding glass door the woman is in the shower soaping herself up we see soap on her breasts and her vagina she is masturbating enjoying it the maniac flings open the shower door the woman screams as the maniac rapes the woman anally then fillets her the maniac removes his clothing showers in the womans shower as the body still lies there then he gets dressed and drives home to his marital bed his bride is young beautiful clearly virginal she loves him madly he is the love and lust of her life the maniac and his bride engage in foreplay and the maniac makes tender love to his innocent young bride he is capable of great sensitivity when the situation calls for it as she comes thunderously the camera cuts to juxtaposed faces of the bride and the maniacs other savaged women all of them his chosen the brides prolonged cataclysmic orgasm alternates with their anguish to the maniac it is all music i managed to finish the rest of it resisting the temptation to stow it in the garbage instead i took it home and called milo the minute i got through the door but he wasnt at the station and i had to content myself with leaving a message at blue investigations i tried lucy in brentwood phone off the hook probably sleeping again checking in with my service got me one message wendy embrey wanting to talk about billing problems that irritated me and i didnt bother to copy down her number i got a beer from the fridge and watched a couple of surfers struggle to master infinity mellorss treatment screamed in my head like a car alarm he and lowell and trafficant drawn together not by art but by hatred of women discovering common interests slaking their needs together the night of the party lowell shutting down the retreat less than a year later new use for his acreage another type of cemetery robin came home in a great mood and we ended up in bed i tried to keep the bad pictures out of my head wondering if id be able to make love when the time came i did the right things but my mind was still elsewhere firing like a strobe light she fell asleep quickly but i found myself itching to get up i lay there for a long time not moving restless maybe ill get up and take a drive or something she started to sit up but i kissed her forehead rest is everything okay alex just one of those jumpy nights you know me sometimes i wonder she said but she closed her eyes and pursed her lips i kissed them and touched her eyelids with my fingers she gathered the covers around her head and curled up i sped past broad beach zuma the colony carbon beach la costa one very bright light shone above the sheas house two protomalibu cars were parked along the highway in front a porsche bathtub roadster and a corvette between them was an elderly olds that looked vaguely familiar i pulled up behind the corvette and was walking to the front door just as it opened and a man backed out stumbling i thought i heard a voice from inside the house but the combined roars of the highway and the ocean drowned out the words the man approached the house again and i got close enough to hear a womans voice go away ill call the police the man shouted just you out get the hell out ill call the police the man stopped and folded his arms across his chest go ahead gwendolyn tell them youre a murderer then he charged the door the woman screamed again you bastard the man stumbled again shoved back with force falling into a pool of lamplight sherrell best in his dark suit and tie his hairless dome shiny as a ball bearing i was right in back of him now as the door started to slam shut he whipped out his right foot and managed to wedge it between the door and the jamb his ankle was trapped he shouted in pain threats and curses from gwen shea no backup from tom so she was there alone best tried to pull his ankle free but it was visegripped gwen shea kept screaming through the crack putting her weight against the door trying to crush the ankle i shouted cut it out hes stuck her eyes spread with panic as she focused on my face she opened the door kicked at bests leg as i pulled it free and slammed it shut best lay there groaning i pulled him up but when he stood on his right leg he buckled and i had to support him lets get out of here i said trying to pull him toward the olds he shook his head im staying here what if she calls the police she didnt did she because she knows shes guilty i can smell guilt he folded his arms again what if she has a gun i said this is exactly how bad things happen then shell add to her sins that wont solve your problem will anything else solve my problem thats not a very religious answer he looked away come on i said lets talk about this rationally ive learned some things that may he grabbed my sleeve what kinds of things if you leave and promise not to confront her again ill tell you he looked back at the house shook his right leg and winced stared at the speeding cars then once more at the house all lights off i take that as a solemn oath he said tell me he said sitting in the drivers seat and massaging his ankle do you need to see a doctor for that no no its fine tell me what youve learned i need you to promise you wont act on it i cant promise that then i cant tell you you swore its for your own safety reverend i can take care of myself i see that his nostrils widened for an instant he looked like anything but a man of god all right i made a fool out of myself so did elijah coming down from the hills raving at ahab so did moses talking to a bush and jesus consorting with the low and the needy reverend the last thing i want to do is prolong your suffering i want to find out the whole truth about karen also why for my patient i said keeping it simple thats hard to believe so was walking on water he started to touch his sore ankle then stopped himself and brushed his fingers against the keys dangling from the ignition if you really know something tell me doctor trust me to do the right thing not unless you promise not to act your getting involved the way you did tonight will only slow things down slow things down does that mean theres progress some im sorry i know youve lived with this for a long time but its going to have to be a while longer a while he said flexing his foot why did you come here tonight because youre probably right about the sheas knowing something but if you get in the way we may never find out what and i wont tell you another word unless im sure youll cooperate the pain in his eyes had nothing to do with his leg all right i promise not to do anything that gets in the way nothing at all i said no contact with anyone associated with the case until i tell you its safe fine fine what do you know i consider that a religious oath i wont swear needlessly but you have my word i gave him some of it leaving out names the growing possibility that something had happened to karen at the party and that felix barnard had learned about it tried to profit and died because of greed a tremor of rage took hold of his face he forced himself placid an unsettling calm almost like death i knew there was something about that man he said polite too polite i never completely trusted him how did he die i told him thats why we have to be careful reverend if covering up was worth killing for then it still is yes yes he said but there was no fear in him only a cold quiet acquiescence id asked a lot of him thinking of the picture in his kitchen dinahs abduction by shechemi wondered if i was putting too much faith in him and them he said looking at the sheas house no direct involvement so far other than the fact that they may have hired karen to work at the party and we still havent been able to verify that i cant believe that their evasiveness look what just happened if shes innocent why didnt she call the police on me and their shops been closed for two days no sign of him so maybe he knows somethings up and has left town isnt flight the first sign of guilt how do you know about the shop reverend he didnt answer more surveillance his smile was grim what made you decide to watch them now talking to you on the phone the other day i could tell from your voice that you were on to something is your patient ready to meet me yet my patients in mourning death in the family oh no he put his hands on the steering wheel and sank down im so sorry was he or she close to the deceased can you at least tell me the sex of the person youve been talking to so i can pray accordingly a woman i thought so he said a womans compassion poor thing hopefully the time will come when shell be able to step away from her grief hopefully of course you cant rush her those things cant be rushed he turned and gripped my hand when she is able to whenever it is call me maybe i can help maybe we can help each other i nodded and got out of the car through the passenger window he said youre a good man forgive me for not believing your intentions nothing to forgive are you religious doctor in my own way what way is that i dont believe the worlds random a major leap of faith he said i try to renew it in my own mind every day some days are easier than others everythings surreal said lucy it was am and id finally reached her at the brentwood house in what way one moment ill be talking to him and it feels so real then ill wake up and realize ive been dreaming and the truth hits me i guess thats normal very much so ive been doing nothing but sleeping cant help it i feel drugged every time i try to get up i just want to crawl right back should i force myself to stay awake no let nature take its course god i miss him she started to cry im not angry at him he couldnt help it getting hold of such strong stuff not knowing when he was hungry for it he couldnt think about anything else more tears such pain what a waste my heart feels as if its really breaking i dont know if ill ever feel totally good again everything takes time lucy i cant do hypnosis cant focus on anything im sorry nothing to be sorry for later well do it later all i can do now is cry and sleep i dont even want to talk im sorry its okay lucy im sorry im sorry she mocked herself sorry for the world for carrie fielding and the others and puck and karen i havent forgotten her i wont forget three psychopaths in the forest barnard learning something about it dead the sheas living on the sand doris reingold alive and poor gambling away her payoff spirited out of town by tom shea into hiding or something more final i played with it some more barnard kept popping up in my thoughts like one side of a loaded die if hed been murdered because he was a blackmailer the conspicuous nature of his death made sense a corpse on a motel bed had plenty of educational value whod done the shooting the murder had taken place a full year after karens disappearance by then mellors or whatever his real name was was working for app and trafficant had vanished and m bayard lowell was living in splendid isolation in topanga canyon i didnt see the great man risking a meeting at a sleazy motel and why that particular dirtysheets dive because it catered to hookers mo barnard had described felix as a womanizer had he been lured there with the promise of another payoff the bigger one hed pressed for happy to enjoy a quickie while he waited i pictured him pants down and happily expectant on a narrow gray bed in a darkened room porno on video booze on the nightstand a woman in hotpants and spike heels she smiles and ducks into the bathroom with a wink and a one minute honey the toilet flushes water runs barnard concentrates on the movie oblivious to the door opening someone rushes to the side of the bed and begins squeezing off rounds someone with a key the clerk paid off the hooker in on it too but still why that motel three miles east hollywood was crammed with mattress palaces maybe because the killer knew that place well enough to set up an inside job the police had never suspected according to milo the motel was a chronic trouble spot so one more felony even a homicide would be no great surprise barnard had led a pathetic life spending his days prying into other peoples secrets taking money to look into cold cases twenty years later his own file was stone cold an inconsequential man had the papers even bothered to write up his death this time i stayed closer to home and used the main santa monica library on th street barnards name wasnt listed in the computers for that year or any other but a search under homicide struck gold in the newspaper files motel homicide at police say the adventure inn on the westside is site of numerous crimes the latest the murder of a retired private investigator the full article was tucked into a bottom corner of the last page of the metro section homicide prompts ire about motel the early morning shooting death of a retired private investigator in a westside motel has prompted increased citizen concern about the hostelry police confirm a history of criminal activity at the adventure inn on south la cienega boulevard including numerous arrests for prostitution narcotics disorderly conduct and assault despite complaints by neighbors police claim they are legally powerless to close the business down the victim felix slayton barnard of venice was found dead of multiple gunshot wounds in room by the motels clerk edgely sylvester during a morning room check sylvester reported hearing and seeing nothing and by the time police arrived all other residents had vacated the premises no surprise said a bystander refusing to be named they register by the halfhour sylvester denied any personal knowledge of prostitution at the motel when asked how he could have failed to hear three gunshots he said theres a lot of traffic questioned about why steps couldnt be taken to close the motel captain robert bannerstock of the lapds westside division said its a free country all we can do is go out and investigate occurrences people need to be careful about where they spend the night ownership of the motel is registered to a nevada corporation the advent group and attempts to reach the manager darnel mullins were unsuccessful darnel mullins denton mellors inside job meet me at the adventure inn felix therell be a room reserved for you have a whore on the house i looked up darnel mullins in every southern california phone book the library owned no darnels over a dozen ds spread around various counties thirtyfive minutes on the pay phone in the entrance eliminated most of them the rest werent home roadblocked again i sat at a library table drumming my fingers until i thought of another route the clerk edgely sylvester thank god it was an unusual name and listed in the central la book on the block of arlington i took pico east toward the center of town la cienega was a couple of miles before arlington and i veered south and drove to still a motel now called the sunshine lodge and painted turquoise blue three arms of cinder block around a dipping pitted parking lot two pickup trucks in the lot i pulled in next to one of them room was in the northwest corner catercorner from the office a do not disturb sign hung from the doorknob i went into the office a korean man sat behind the desk watching korean language tv a wall dispenser sold pocket combs and condoms and a wire rack on the desk was stuffed with maps to the stars homes robin had shown me one last year given out by a record company as a party favor marilyn monroe was still alive and living in brentwood and lon chaney was haunting beverly hills the clerk eyed me and said room not knowing what to say i left edgely sylvesters neighborhood was just past the old sears store near la brea not far from the wilshire division police station the house was a twostory brown craftsman bungalow subdivided into apartments the front lawn had been turned into parking spaces a rusting cadillac fleetwood and a twentyyearold buick riviera shared it two black men in their sixties played dominoes at a card table on the front porch both wore shortsleeved white shirts and doubleknit trousers and the heavier of the two wore stretch suspenders he was bald and had moist mocha skin a cigar dangled from his lips the skinny man was ebonytoned and his features were sharp still handsome he had all his hair and it had been pomaded he could have been chuck berrys less talented brother they stopped their play as i came up the walkway the dominoes were bright red and translucent with sharp white dots i had no idea who was winning gentlemen i said does edgely sylvester live here nope said the skinny one know him they shook their heads okay thanks as i walked away the heavy one said why do you want to know the cigar was between his fingers wet and cold he was sweating a lot but it didnt look like anxiety reporter i said la times were doing a story on old unsolved crimes for the sunday magazine mr sylvester worked at a motel where an unsolved murder occurred twenty years ago the victim was a private detective my editors thought it would make a great piece lots of new murders all the time said the skinny one citys falling apart no need to talk about stupid old stuff the new stuff scares people the old stuffs considered romantic i know i think its ridiculous too but i just started out cant buck the boss anyway thanks is there money in it said the skinny one for talking to you well i said im not supposed to pay for stories but if somethings good enough i shrugged they exchanged glances and the heavy one put down a domino i said did mr sylvester tell you something about the unsolved case another look passed between them how much you paying said the heavy one how much cash did i have in my wallet probably a little over a hundred i really shouldnt pay anything it would have to be something good the heavy one licked the end of his cigar what if i could find mr edgely

pointed across the table say hello mr sylvester the skinny man closed his eyes and laughed rocking in his chair hello hello hello he held out his hand hello from the star of the show prove youre

for him just for fingering me and i only get thirty more thats stupid man i said seventy if youre really sylvester and thats it because it cleans me out i took all the bills out of my wallet and fanned them frowning he reached behind and pulled out a mockalligator billfold flipping it open he showed me a soiled social security card made out to edgely nat sylvester anything with a picture no

rest of the money back hey he said rising out of his chair when were finished the heavy man said we got ourselves a dude here eddy street dude knows what it is sylvester looked at the twenty as if it were tainted how do i know youre righteous man because if you complain to the times and my boss finds out i paid you my ass is grass i dont want any hassles okay just a story fair is fair eddy said the heavy man with glee he gotcha fuck your mama said sylvester the heavy man laughed and wheezed why should i do that eddy when i already fucked your mama and she squeezed all the juice outa me sylvester gave him a long dark stare and for a second i thought thered be violence then the heavy man flinched and winked and sylvester laughed too picking up a domino he slapped it on the table to be continued fatboy he said standing where you goin eddy to talk to the man stupid talk here i wanna hear what kind of seventydollar story you got ha said sylvester ask my mama about it to me lets go someplace where the atmosphere aint stupid we walked down the block past other big subdivided houses an occasional palm tree skyscraped from the breezeway most of the street was open and hot even as evening approached the air smelled like exhaust fumes when we got near the corner sylvester stopped and leaned against a lamppost a brownskinned woman in a brownflowered dress walked past several small children trailed her like goslings laughing and speaking spanish they come here said sylvester taking jobs for crap pay dont even wanna learn english whynchu write about that he patted his empty shirt pocket and studied me smoke i shook my head figures now what murder is it you wanna hear about was there more than one at the adventure inn could be could be that place was no good you know what

stories all the man did was bitch and brag his daddy was a doctor he worked for some movie hotshot met all these movie stars at parties he laughed writing a book like im stupid why would a brother who could do all those things be working at a hole like the adventure not that he admitted he was a brother he didnt like being black he didnt admit it talking all white and tell the truth he was light as a white man laughing again he pinched the skin of his forearm too much pale in it and his hair was yellow nappy but real yellow like hed been dipped in eggs mr french toast did he have a mustache dont

blue eyes like yours but even wishier yeah come to think of it i think he had a mustache little one fuzz weak yellow fuzz stupid i paid him the rest of the money and he began walking away from me one more thing i said in the article you said you didnt hear the shots cause of traffic was traffic that strong at am he kept walking i caught up mr sylvester the same dry angry look hed shown his friend i repeated the question i hear you im not stupid is there a problem with answering it i said no problem i didnt hear any shots okay okay did barnard check in alone if thats what it says in your paper it doesnt say just that his name was the only one on the register was he with anyone how the hell would i know he stopped our business is finished man you used up your money a long time ago were you really there or was it one of the nights darnel mullins asked you to leave he stepped back and touched a trousers pocket implying a weapon but nothing sagged the pocket you calling me a liar no just trying to get details you got em now get flicking a hand and dont send no white boy around a camera to take my picture white boys with cameras dont do well around here my stomach grumbled i had lunch at a deli near robertson rabbis cops and stockbrokers were eating pastrami and discussing their respective philosophies i asked for matzoball soup and while i waited i tried milos home ready to leave another message rick answered with his oncall voice dr silverman hi its alex alex hows the new house coming along slowly big hassle huh better since robin took over good for her looking for el sleutho he left early this morning some kind of surveillance must be the bogettes i said who those girls who worship jobe shwandt probably hes not pleased having to deal with that again not that hes talked about it much we have a new arrangement i dont discuss the finer points of cutting and suturing and he doesnt remind me how rotten the world is back home i tried columbia university again darnel mullins had indeed graduated from the university and done one year of graduate school before dropping out shortly after reviewing command shed the light the alumni office had a home address in teaneck new jersey and a phone number to go with it but when i called i got a dress shop called millies couture remembering what eddy sylvester had said about mullins claiming a doctor father i called new jersey information and asked for any mullinses with mds in teaneck the only one i have said the operator is a dr winston mullins but thats in englewood at that number a man with an elderly cultured voice said hello dr mullins yes whos this i gave him the biography story no reply dr mullins im afraid i cant help you darnels been dead for a long time oh im sorry yes he said a little over twenty years i guess i never called columbia to notify them was he ill no he was murdered oh no out where you are matter of fact he had an apartment in hollywood surprised a burglar and the burglar shot him they never caught the man im sure darnel would have liked to talk to you he always wanted to be a writer yes i know ive got one of his articles here with me really something from the manhattan book review he used a pen name denton mellors he said after a character in a dirty book he did that because i didnt approve of that paper too leftwing after that he kept using it maybe to prove something to me though i dont know what he sounded very sad it says here he was working on a novel i said the bride he never finished it ive got the manuscript i tried to read it not my type of thing but not bad at all maybe he could have gotten it published sorry i couldnt help you what kind of a book is it well he said thats hard to say theres some romance in it a young mans book i guess learning the ropes falling in love a comingofage novel i suppose youd call it feeling like dirt i said would it be possible to send me a copy maybe i can quote from it in my book dont see why not its just sitting in a drawer here i gave him my address malibu he said you must be a successful writer darnel said thats where the successful people live literary critic to aspiring novelist to motel manager working for some guys from reno the advent group why was that name familiar even while managing the motel hed held on to his ambition kicking sylvester out of the office to use the typewriter from time to time from the way sylvester had reacted to my questions i was sure one of those times had been the night of the barnard hit mullins setting up the hit maybe even pulling the trigger finished off himself a few months later a lightskinned black man blond blue eyes light fuzzy mustache not the dark scimitar lucy remembered but as id told lucy dreams play fast and loose with reality something else didnt fit dr mullinss description of the bride bore no similarity to the trash app had given me had mullins used the same title for two disparate works or had app given me the script summary as a diversion directing my attention to mullins because he had something to hide i remembered my initial scenario of karens disappearance a man in a fancy car picking her up on the road to topanga it didnt get much fancier than a red ferrari still there was nothing connecting app to karen and mullins wasnt coming across like some innocent shill i thought of the way his career had dived after karens disappearance lowell distancing himself from coconspirators eliminating the undependable ones karen felix barnard mullins and where was trafficant but the sheas still lived on the beach i left a note for robin and hit the highway once more gwens van was parked in front of her house cars were lined up all along the beach side no space for the seville but the land side was nearly empty i pulled over and was about to chance a run across the highway as soon as northbound traffic thinned when i saw the vans headlights go on it sat there idling then pulled out it took a minute or so to get into the center turn lane another few to pull off a threepoint and head south i put on as much speed as the traffic could bear and finally saw the van eight or nine lengths up it stopped at the light at the bottom of the ramp up to ocean front avenue by the time it was heading east on colorado i was three lengths behind and maintaining that distance i followed it to lincoln boulevard where it headed south again through santa monica and venice then over to sepulveda where it continued at a steady pace making more lights than it missed we crossed into inglewood a mixture of eisenhowerera suburbs and new asian businesses fifteen minutes later we were approaching century boulevard the airport the van entered the departure lanes and continued to the parking lot opposite the bradley international terminal it rode around a while trying to find a groundfloor space though the upper levels were less crowded i parked on the third level took the stairs down and was waiting behind a hedge when gwen emerged ten minutes later pushing travis in his wheelchair her purse over her shoulder no baggage jets thundered overhead cars sped along the road which snaked through the airport like a freeway gwen walked to an intersection a red light stopped her before she could cross the street to the terminal travis twisted his head moved his mouth and rolled his eyes gwen looked around nervously i hung back and kept my head down she wore an expensivelooking white linen dress and white flats a string of pearls glimmered around her neck her short dark hair shone but even at this distance her eyes were old short hair somber look the grumpy babysitter ken remembered abandoning her post then returning to discover lucy gone going to look for her and finding her sleepwalking seeing and hearing what lucy had would have been grounds for a payoff the light turned green and she entered the terminals big bright greenglassed atrium a dozen airlines flew out of here she headed for the aeromexico desk waiting in the first class line she moved up quickly to the clerk he smiled at her then listened to what she had to say travis was twisting and turning in the chair people stared the terminal was crowded phony nuns panhandled i picked up an abandoned newspaper and pretended to read it looking instead at a tv screen filled with flight information aeromexico leaving in one hour for mexico city the clerk was shaking his head gwen looked at her watch then turned and pointed at travis the clerk got on the phone spoke got off shook his head again gwen leaned toward him standing taller her calf muscles swelling the clerk kept shaking his head then he called another man over the second man listened to gwen got on the phone shook his head half a dozen people had lined up behind her the second clerk pointed to them gwen turned around her face blazed with anger and her hands were clenched no one in the queue said anything or moved but some of the travelers were staring at travis gwen took hold of the chairs handlebars and wheeled him away i followed as she pushed her way through the crowd to a row of phone booths all were occupied and she waited twisting her hair and tapping a handlebar when a booth opened she dashed in and stayed on the phone for fifteen minutes feeding coins and punching numbers when she emerged she looked crushed and even jumpier rubbing her fingers together very fast biting her lip eyes darting up and down the terminal i stuck with her back to the parking lot running up the three flights and timing my exit from the lot to hers was tricky but i managed to get two vehicles behind her as she paid at the kiosk i stayed with her out of the airport and onto the north she took it to the west got off at route back to malibu but instead of pulling over at la costa she continued on another few miles shopping center across from the pier the parking lot was nearly empty the only business still open was a submarine sandwich store bright and yellow i put the seville in a dark corner and stayed in the car as gwen got travis out of the van she pushed him up the ramp to the surf shop then stopped opening her purse she took out her wallet and pulled out a gold credit card staring at it blankly she replaced it and knitted her fingers some more travis moved constantly gwen took out a key she was opening the shops front door when i stepped up and said hi she threw up her hands defensively letting go of the chair it started to slide back and i held it in place the boy had to weigh a hundred and twenty pounds gwens eyes were huge and the hand that held the keys was drawn back ready to strike get the hell out of here or ill scream scream away travis had positioned his head at an impossible angle trying to get a look at me his smile was innocent and empty i mean it she said so do i what was the problem at the airport tickets not there as planned her mouth opened and her arm dropped slowly the hand settling on her left breast as if pledging allegiance youre as crazy as your father she said my father dont fool with me mr best putting weight on the last word as if her knowledge would throw me off you think im his son i know you are i saw you with him when he tried to break in now youre asking questions all around town pretending to be someone else pretending pretending to be a customer buying those big dogs we dont want your business mister you get the hell out of here and tell your father hes going to get both of you in big trouble people know us in malibu you get lost or im calling the police please do i said pulling out my wallet i had an outofdate card that said id once consulted to the police along with one of milos i hoped the word homicide would impress her hoped her panic would stop her from remembering that lapd had no jurisdiction here confusion clogged her face travis said something incoherent he was still smiling at me i dont she inspected the cards again youre a psychologist its complicated mrs shea but go ahead and call the police theyll clear it up for you karen bests death is back under investigation because of new facts a new witness im involved in helping the police question that witness they know now that something happened to karen at the sanctum party and that you and your husband and doris reingold got paid off to keep quiet about it throwing out wild cards the way she fought to stay still told me i had a winning hand her right eye twitched she said easy honey to travis even though he looked happy this is absolutely crazy at the very least were talking obstruction of justice even if the plane tickets had been there youd never have been allowed to board i think its pretty obvious you were being watched if i were you id start making arrangements for travis somewhere clean and trustworthy where he can stay while youre tied up in the legal system bye have a nice day i started to leave she made a grab for my arm but i moved away why are you doing this to me im not doing anything to be honest im not even here officially if the police knew id followed you theyd probably be upset they think im a bleeding heart maybe i am but ive treated kids with cp and i know its not easy under the best of circumstances what youve got ahead of you is far from the best watching the boy contort and remembering how id lied to dr mullins justice seemed very abstract thinking about karens buried corpse sherrel best and his grief brought it a little closer to home what do you want the truth about karen why dont the police come themselves oh they will i said turning to go again i dont understand she said you work with the police but youre not working with them now right now im here because karens important to me you knew her im not going to say more mrs shea but i will give you some advice some people think you and tom were involved in her murder if you were we have nothing to talk about and i really need to get out of here if youve done nothing but obstruct i might be able to run interference for you lying about it wont help because the evidence is piling up its just a matter of time and if you do make it to mexico the police will impound your house and this place a group of teenagers went into the sandwich shop happy shouting traviss age she said i dont know about any murder and thats the gods truth why did you try to leave town tonight vacation no luggage or was tom supposed to handle that too along with the tickets she remained wooden i shrugged and walked toward my car what if i dont know anything she called after me what if i cant help anyone with what i know then you wont be able to help yourself but i dont thats the truth karen she she broke down and hid her eyes with her fingers travis looked at her then at me i smiled at him his return grin was quick more of a grimace his eyes clouded and dull most people with cerebral palsy are intellectually normal the eyes told me he wasnt despite the contortions he was almost handsome and i could see traces of the young man he might have been a faint almost holographic image of a golden malibu kid his mother kept her face concealed i walked up to the chair hey pal he started to laugh gulping and whooping did it louder and tried to clap his hands shut up gwen screamed a crestfallen look wormed its way among the boys involuntary facial movements he began stabbing with his arms and kicking his feet his lips twisted like an outofhand garden hose and a deep foggy noise issued from his mouth aanglm gwen embraced him oh im so sorry honey oh honey honey i felt like surrendering my license gwen said he needs me no one knows how to take care of him properly have you seen the kind of places they put kids like him lots of them i said but youll put him in one without thinking twice i wont put him anywhere i have no official power other than the fact that the police sometimes ask my advice sometimes they even listen i got involved in karens case and im going to see it through but i dont know about any murder thats the truth what do you know she turned away facing pch you know something valuable enough to get paid off for your silence i said why do you keep saying ive been paid off i looked at her travis rolled his head out from under her embrace she said that was twenty years ago twentyone this august she looked ill all i know is she went off with some guys at that party and i never saw her again okay whys that worth anything you tell me she looked at the asphalt i said other people were paid off too some of them were murdered now that the nets tightening what makes you think youre safe or tom for that matter wherever he is in mexico a new fear pierced her eyes shed been beautiful a long time ago one of those lithe laughing beach girls for whom bikinis were invented life had glazed her like pottery and id added a few new cracks oh god a car pulled into the shopping center as its headlights washed over us she jumped the car was going to the sandwich place an old chrysler fourdoor two ponytailed tanktopped men in their thirties got out surfboard clamps were attached to the roof but no boards one of the men cupped his hands and lit a cigarette gwen turned her back on them not afraid embarrassed old customers i said she stared at me then at her keys in the lock inside she said keeping the lights off she pushed travis to the back of the store and unlocked a door inside was a small neat storeroom metal shelves filled with merchandise a desk and three folding chairs positioning travis in a corner she pulled a box down and gave it to him a diving mask he began turning the package over and over working hard at holding on to it studying a photograph of a girl snorkeling as if it were a puzzle she started to go behind the desk i got there first and checked all the drawers just papers and pens and staples and clips she gave a weak smile yeah tough old mes gonna shoot you im sure you can be plenty tough i looked at travis she sat down heavily i took a chair tell me what happened i said promise me they wont put him away i cant promise but ill do my best if you had nothing to do with karens murder i keep telling you i dont know about any murder just that she disappeared from the sanctum party nod you hired her to work at the party so what does that make me a criminal i hired her as a favor she needed the money her tips werent that good because she wasnt the greatest waitress kept getting orders wrong and that hypocrite father of hers didnt approve of her being an actress so he never sent her a dime i helped her so now people are getting murdered and im being treated like a criminal whens the last time you saw her how can i remember it was twentyone years try silence in the middle of the party she said i dont know what time it was we were all working i wasnt paying attention to her you never told anyone she was there did you more silence did the sheriffs ask they came around the dollar a few days after she was gone they thought she was lost up in the mountains they had helicopters looking for her and you didnt tell them any different who says it was any different she could have left the party with someone and gone to the mountains in the middle of work she wasnt the most reliable person used to call in sick at the dollar so she could go to disneyland coming out here was a big vacation for her she bit her lip look im not putting her down she was a nice kid but not too bright tears filled her eyes i never wanted to see anything happen to her i never did anything to hurt her she put her hands over her face again travis had managed to turn himself around and was looking at her fascinated the box slid down his lap and landed on the floor he reached for it but the leather belt restrained him and he started to shout gwen uncovered her face and started to get out of her chair i retrieved the box and gave it to him tousling his hair aagaah he said grinning aagaamnuhuh gwen said it wasnt any big intense investigation or anything a deputy just dropped in and asked if anyoned seen her then he sat around and had coffee what about the private eye karens family hired felix barnard what did he ask you he was weird an oily old guy what did he ask you same stuff the police did when did we last see her and you told him friday night after her shift at the dollar he was a sleazeball i didnt want anything to do with him he found out karen had been at the party how i dont know but it wasnt from me she said the way she looked away quickly let me know she was hiding something i decided not to push right now thinking of the unaccountedfor time between karens leaving the dollar and the party the next day i said why did karen go up to sanctum early the caterer needed someone to set up chairs and tables before the food got there and you picked karen even though she wasnt reliable i felt sorry for her like i said she needed the money she blinked several times is that the only reason she took a deep breath and turned to travis you okay honey ignoring her he continued to study the box whats the real reason you chose karen to go up early gwen someone called wanted us to send the bestlooking waitress up early who long silence lowell and karen was the bestlooking waitress she was cute why would looks be important if all he wanted was for her to set up i dont know it wasnt like he mentioned that first more like as long as youre sending someone send a goodlooking one and some other stuff crazy words i dont remember something about eternal beauty i dont know why maybe he had big shots over and wanted to make an impression it was none of my business what difference did it make to me who set up karen was happy to do it happy to be with big shots definitely she was still a tourist going over to hollywood boulevard looking for movie stars howd she get up to sanctum someone picked her up at the dollar no on pch where on pch pch and paradise cove right at the turnoff to the dollar nod who picked her up i dont know another look away this isnt very helpful gwen travis was staring at me i winked at him he laughed and the box slipped from his fingers again i returned it to him then stared at gwen making it a hard stare was no effort i saw a car she said we did tom and me pulling away just as we got there but thats all i couldnt see who was in it i dont even know if thats the one that picked her up she left twenty minutes before we did someone else could have picked her up what kind of car tom said a ferrari tom said hes into cars to me it was just a car and taillights tom was all excited what color it was nighttime tom thought it was red he said most of them are red its ferraris racing color convertible or hardtop convertible i think but the top was up we couldnt see who was inside did you ever see the car again she played with her earrings and twisted her fingers as if wringing them out there was one up there up where the party there were all kinds of fancy cars there porsches rollses valets parking them up and down the road total chaos who did the ferrari belong to i dont know i stared at her i dont know she said what do you want me to do make something up did it have customized plates no not that i noticed i couldnt have cared less cars dont interest me my head was into the party making sure everything went okay did it what did the party go okay people seemed to be having fun what about karen what about her was she having fun she was there to work she said sharply yeah she seemed happy all those big shots she shrugged did she sleep at sanctum on friday night i dont know when did you go up saturday morning was she there nod how early in the morning seventhirty eight we drove up early to start getting the food ready she was already up and running what kind of mood was she in a good one shed set up the tables and chairs and was goofing around how playing with some kids whose kids lowells at first i thought they were his grandchildren cause they were so little but karen said no they were his she was jazzed about that about what that she was playing with a famous guys kids thats the way she was really starstruck she started telling me how famous the guy was won the nobel prize or something everything was a big deal to her pretty impressed with lowell huh yeah what else did she say about him thats it did you get the feeling theyd spent the night together i have no idea did she mention any other people shed met headshake how many of lowells kids was she playing with two how old were they little three or four something like that boys or girls i dont remember why boys or girls i repeated she shrugged probably girls they both had these long mops of blond hair cute kids and karen was babysitting them no just playing around with them laughing chasing them she wanted to babysit instead of serving said lowells regular babysitter got sick some kind of emergency operation but she was too ditzy so i said no so who babysat the kids another girl name hesitation another waitress short dark hair grumpy doris reingold she opened her mouth closed it why doris i said she was older had two of her own i figured shed know what to do were there any other kids around not that i saw but i knew of two locked in their cabin so what did karen do then worked with the food like the rest of us we slaved like dogs it was a huge party four hundred people tons of stuff the ice ran out and tom had to make a bunch of trips down to malibu to get more the caterer was some little gay guy with a bad temper brought in some illegals to help out no one spoke any english then all these bands started showing up setting up their equipment doing sound checks trying to see who could play loudest portable fans and lights a generator electrical cables all over the place by the time the people started coming it was already getting dark berserk unless youve worked food service you wouldnt understand was there a lot of dope and booze what do you think but none of the staff messed with it i had a rule about that youre behind a buffet table spooning out coleslaw you cant be freaking out was karen behind the buffet at first then the caterer started screaming for someone to pass around the hors doeuvres trays so i had her do that thats the last time i saw her going into the crowd with a tray not that i looked for her i was like a chicken with my head cut off it was so crazy i worked till five in the morning the cleanup was outrageous the caterer split with all his mexicans and left it to tom and me were you back on shift at the dollar on sunday sunday evening was karen supposed to be on too yes but like i said she always took time off so her not showing up was no big deal when did you first realize shed disappeared a couple of days later i guess i didnt think much about it i wasnt her mother when did lowell call you who said he called me we know he did gwen to arrange the payoff our information is that it was three days after the party is that true she turned one of her earrings then reversed the circuit more like four or five i dont know tell me about his call she turned to travis you okay baby the boy played with the box and giggled i said hes fine gwen another turn of the earring she cleared her throat coughed picked something out of one nail i crossed my legs and smiled at her youre making a mountain out of a molehill he didnt say anything about any payoff she said he asked for tom and me to meet him said he had a bonus for us for doing such a good job at the party whered you meet him at sanctum no out in the valley on topanga canyon boulevard just before ventura uppermiddleclass residential area where on the boulevard it was i guess youd call it a turnoff a piece of empty land right on topanga just off new topanga actually around the corner from topanga some side street i dont remember the name but i could probably show it to you probably its been a long time it was dark almost midnight you didnt find his wanting to meet that late strange i found lots of things strange he was strange always yakking most of the time he made no sense the party was strange he wanted to give us money i didnt argue did he come alone nod he was waiting when we got there sitting in his car what kind of car a mercedes i think i told you im not into cars just a casual midnight meeting to pick up some money it would have had to be late because tom and i were working at the restaurant some people have to earn a living what happened after you got there he stayed in the car told us wed done a great job at the party and he was giving us a bonus twisting her fingers what else he said there was something else we needed to talk about he wasnt sure but he thought one of the girls whod worked for us had gotten into some kind of fight with a guest and had walked off did he name karen he called her the pretty one did he say which guest no youre sure yes did he mean a physical fight i assumed he meant just an argument he might have even said argument i cant remember moisture in her eyes she stared at me flaunting the tears what else nothing he just said the girl hadnt behaved properly had really stepped out of line but he wouldnt hold it against us or complain because other than that wed done a really good job then he said we also had to promise not to say anything about the fight because the press was out to get him and any scandal would cause a giant hassle for him even if the girl disappeared and people came asking for her because when shed cursed out the guest shed said something about being disgusted and splitting town did that sound like karen cursing she shrugged and dried her eyes i didnt know her all that well at the dollar did she ever have problems losing her temper with customers no just getting orders wrong but the party was different lots of pressure so supposedly she pulled a fit left the party and said she was splitting town thats what he said did you believe him we didnt think about it one way or the other then he gave you the money our bonus how big of a bonus she looked at travis then down at the desk five she said very softly five what thousand a fivethousanddollar bonus the catering bill must have been fifty sixty thousand it was like a tip cash nod in a suitcase a paper bag big one like from a supermarket fivethousanddollar tip in a bag it wasnt all for us he told us to distribute it to the others what others the other servers the people from the sand dollar thats right names a guy named lenny lenny korcik nod and doris and two other women mary and sue mary andreas and sue billings if you know why are you asking korciks dead and doris lives in ventura i said where are mary and sue i dont know both were temps hippies i think they hitchhiked into town together they stuck around maybe another month or two then split no notice together i think sue ran off with a truck driver who came into the restaurant and a couple days later mary joined up with some surfers driving up the coast or maybe it was down the coast i dont remember we werent close or anything they were hippies but you split the money with them sure they worked even split long inhalation no why should we i contracted the whole thing and tom and i ended up doing all the cleanup how much did you give them she mumbled something whats that twofifty twofifty for each of them nod leaving four thousand for you and tom they didnt complain they were happy to get anything doris too why not she doesnt seem like a very happy person youd have to ask her about that we will once we find her where did tom take her two nights ago she wrung her hands and let loose a stream of filthy words cursing sherrell best for spying on her where i said she needed a ride to the airport so he took her vacation for her too she didnt answer gwen i said wearily if you want to talk fine if not youre on your own give me a chance she said this is hard remembering all this stuff okay she decided to split town she got nervous after you came asking around she thought you were bests son we all did raking things up again she didnt want the hassle nervous about her role in the coverup it wasnt like that like i said there was no big plot we just you just what kept our mouths shut cant catch any flies that way bitter smile did doris see something the rest of you didnt maybe okay okay but its not any big deal she wasnt even sure herself it was probably nothing another tug at the bodice what did she see gwen it was she put the kids to sleep left to get a drink when she got back one of the kids was gone and the door to the outside was open she went out looking finally found the kid wandering around in back there were a lot of trees paths and all these other cabins like a big summer camp it used to be a nudist colony the kid was spaced out when doris picked her up she started babbling about bad men monsters hurting a girl something like that doris figured she was having a bad dream and took her back but when she put her in bed the kid started screaming woke up the other kid and got that one crying too doris said it was a real hassle they were really making noise but with all the music from the party you couldnt hear it finally got them both quiet what made her suspect the kid might have really seen something when karen didnt show up and i told her the same story i told the others what was that that she hated her father and he was coming out to bring her back home so she was going to split town the others believed it but doris didnt she said karen had told her she liked her father did doris tell the others that headshake lenny was into plants real stupid hed believe anything mary and sue were hippies they hated their folks so doris kept her story to herself shrug why didnt you tell them lowells story about the fight i told you he didnt want any of that getting out nothing that could connect karen to him actually he made up the other story as a replacement at first he said to say her father abused her i didnt make it that strong why not it just wasnt right too much looking at me as if for praise so the others bought it i said but doris didnt and she started to wonder if the little kid had seen something happen to karen she didnt know anything for sure but she came to me and told me about finding the kid kind of thinking out loud wanting more than two fifty silence how much did you give her seven fifty more one thousand total how much did she think lowell gave you hesitation its just a matter of time before we find her and ask her gwen two and a half thousand she said very softly so she thought she was getting more than you when did she realize youd held back on her she didnt then why are you still paying her off who says we are the police and tom was there to pick her up and take her to the airport theres obviously some relationship there do she and tom have something going she laughed no he hates her because shes got a hook in you its not like that not like what blackmail or anything like that she just comes to us when shes broke its like charity shes got a problem compulsive gambling her head snapped up if you know everything why do you need me how long have you been financing her addiction off and on most of the time shes okay but then she goes off drinking and gambling and wipes herself out so we help her its a sickness remembering the boys on the lawn i said does she ever win play enough youre bound to one time she won big fifteen thousand at craps in tahoe fifteen thousand next day she blew it all at the same table we feel sorry for her shes toms first cousin used to babysit him after she got married she started drinking and gambling how much have you given her over the years never added it up but plenty she probably could have bought a house but she doesnt care about normal things thats why her husband left her we help her cause shes family the room was cool but she was sweating and her mascara started to run she grabbed a tissue from a box on the desk and took a long time to wipe her eyes i understood doriss hostility to her and tom now the rage of the charity receiver okay she said is that enough for you where did tom take her to the airport where did she fly i dont know and thats the truth she just said she wanted to get out of town for a while you spooked her she was worried youd rake things up did she feel guilty about never telling anyone what shed seen how would i know did she start drinking and gambling after the party or before before i told you it was right after she got married she was only seventeen then she had her kids two boys i said one in germany one in seattle she looked away whats the name of the son in seattle kevin kevin reingold nod at what army base is he stationed i dont know somewhere up there shes your cousin and you dont know shes toms cousin theyre not a close kind of family glancing at travis trying to open the box but the plastic wrap was tight and his fingers struck at it uselessly i peeled some plastic back he laughed and tossed the box in the air again i retrieved it gwen was staring at the shelves so tom dropped her off i said then caught a plane to mexico city the box dropped again this time travis rejected it shaking his head and arching his back i gave him a can of surf wax and he began rolling it between his palms gwen burst into tears and tried to stop them by pinching her nose travis held up the can and shouted aangul she looked at him first with anger then defeat this is stupid youve got me feeling like a criminal and i didnt do anything how much more money did you get from lowell nothing oneshot deal yes how often have you seen him since never he lives in topanga youre five miles away in la costa and youve never seen him never thats the truth we never go up there he never comes down just one fivethousanddollar payment and that was it thats the truth we didnt want anything more to do with it because after hearing doriss story you wondered if karen had been hurt or worse we just didnt want anything to do with him he was weird the whole scene was weird but didnt you wonder at all about karen five thousand dollars in a paper bag and then he asks you to keep mum gives you a phony story and she never shows up again i it made sense his not wanting the publicity he was rich and famous i figured to him five thousand was nothing okay i was naive twentyfive years old working since i was sixteen what was i supposed to do give the money back and go to the sheriffs saying something was fishy like they would have listened to me right when that deputy came to the dollar it was whambamthankyoumaam coffee black and a glazed donut he wasnt taking it seriously told us shed probably left town with some guy or maybe shed gone hiking and was up in the hills they sent helicopters up looking for her for all i knew she was up there what about what doris saw doris is weird she drinks she blacks out she blows fifteen thousand dollars in one day why should i pay attention to some little kid freaking out okay i said seven fifty to lenny mary and sue another thousand to doris that left thirtytwo fifty for you and tom howd you parlay that into a business and a beach house we had more savings five years worth we worked hard some people do that pulling at the dress some more the linen had wrinkled her face was flushed and moist so who told felix barnard about the party no one then howd he find out i dont know he probably figured it out talking to marvin the owner about karens work habits marvin told him she was gone a lot hed been planning to fire her he suspected her of cutting work to moonlight did marvin tell you this nod as a warning barnard came in to the dollar like he was a customer he was my table and i served him then he handed me his card and started asking questions about karen i told him i didnt know where she was which was true marvin hated us fraternizing with the customers so he came over and sent me to another table then i saw him sit down with barnard and i thought great hes going to find out about the party then barnard left and marvin came up to me asking me if i knew where karen was i said no he said that idiot thinks somethings happened to her but in my opinion shes off somewhere having fun or working another job then he tells me he doesnt approve of the moonlighting weve all been doing hell put up with it from me cause my works good but karen was an amateur couldnt even do one job right so i figure he told barnard he suspected a catering moonlight and barnard kept snooping around till he found out which party it was no great feat of detection the sanctum party had been in the papers did barnard ever try to talk to you again never and hed never recorded his talk with marvin damato did you warn lowell that barnard might be snooping around no i told you i had nothing to do with him after he gave me the bag did barnards showing up make you suspect anything about lowells story why should it i figured her cheap father had finally decided to spend some money on her her arms were across her chest like bandoliers five thousand dollars gwen just to avoid bad publicity she tried not to look at me i waited her out okay she said i thought it was possible shed odd or something what was i supposed to do whatever happened to her she was gone nothing i did would bring her back was karen into drugs she smoked a little pot what kind of dope was floating around the party pot hash mushrooms acid you name it people were tripping out taking off their clothes going off together into the woods meaning if thered been a burial it would have had to be far enough away was karen the type of girl whod get into that kind of thing who knows she wasnt wild but she wasnt any nuclear scientist either being at that party was the biggest thrill of her life there were movie people all over the place but you never saw her go off with anyone specific nope not with lowell no one i wasnt looking at who was with who i was spooning out designer slop and trying to keep it off peoples cuffs what about tom working the bar people were putting it away he never even stopped for a break whyd you go to aspen she frowned as if thinking cause of best he was driving us crazy showing up every day on our doorstep and we were tired of seeing marvins sour puss why aspen tom had a buddy who spent the winters there teaching skiing hed inherited a house just outside of starwood he got tom a job tending bar at one of the lodges i found a position at a fur shop it was good to be away from food i still dont see how you got from there to here hard work and luck toms buddy needed some cash fast the house was all he owned it wasnt much just a little place whyd he need cash fast tugging he got busted for what drugs she said reluctantly are drugs what drew you to aspen no he was busted not us check the police records there greg fowler gregory duncan fowler iii he got busted for selling cocaine and needed bail money so he signed over the house to us for how much thirteen thousand he kicked in two of his own and put down bond on a hundred and fifty thousand bail lowells three and ten of your own thats right not bad for a house in aspen the house wasnt as big a deal as it sounds it was a shack really a hunting shack tom and i didnt even want it the plumbing and electric was all shot but greg begged us he said real estate was starting to take off and wed be doing each other a favor we lived in it while tom fixed it up hes good with his hands the real estate did go crazy all these hollywood types flying in buying up land our house was right next to this big parcel owned by a producer sy palmer he did flying angels on tv he really wanted our land so he could build riding stables and he paid us seventyfive thousand we couldnt believe it then we found out we needed to buy another house or pay lots of taxes so we used the seventyfive to make a down payment on a bigger place lived in that fixed it up sold it for three hundred thousand we couldnt believe how well we were doing then i got pregnant her glance at travis was full of tenderness and torment he continued to roll the can the doctors knew something was wrong even before he was born but at first he didnt seem that different then i knew i had to be in a big city near a hospital with rehab facilities we thought for sure best had gone back east so we moved back made a down payment on a landside house on rambla pacifica and opened the store tom figured all his old surfing buddies would give us business and they did so we sold the landside house and bought the place in la costa talking about their financial climb had calmed her thats it anyone can go over our tax records with a finetooth comb we never sold dope or chased money it came to us when lowell gave us that bag we were shocked out of our minds kept it in a closet for months just sitting there then i told tom what good is this doing just sitting here and greg was already calling us telling us about the opportunities in aspen after we moved there things just happened have you maintained contact with greg fowler i havent what about tom no answer he lives down in mexico now doesnt he gwen silence near mexico city nothing gwen no a small village near the coast far from mexico city i dont even know the name still running dope huh no she said charter fishing toms been down there hasnt he brings back a nice catch of corbina or albacore so whats the address i dont know greg only told tom hes still officially a fugitive please dont get him in trouble hes really a good guy tom didnt give you the address no he was supposed drumming the table he was supposed to what meet us in mexico city with a van then we were going to drive down together the tickets were supposed to be at the gate i bought them myself made sure we had special boarding help but they said it had all been canceled that tom canceled them why would he do that why i used her desk phone to call milos home number and was pleased when the answering machine picked up detective sturgis its dr delaware i just had a long talk with mrs shea no at her shop yes i know about the airport thats where i know but i figured she gave me what i think is useful information maybe youll think so too no i dont think do you want to speak to her when okay no i dont think so no hes not already in mexico some fishing village she claims she doesnt know where and im inclined to believe what no no i dont think so okay see you then hanging up i shrugged i feel a little stupid saying this but youre not planning to leave town are you she hadnt taken her eyes off me since i picked up the phone when are they coming to speak to me soon there are other people theyre talking to your names on some kind of airport watch list if you try to leave the country theyll confiscate your passport doesnt matter she said im staying here whats my choice i gave a last smile to travis and headed up the coast thinking about twentyone years of pretending accepting a payoff and pretending it was a big tip feeding doris reingolds greenfelt habit and convincing themselves it was charity five thousand dollars in a paper bag once theyd been able to reduce it in their minds to a rich mans trifle the rest had been easy gwen was a mix of callousness and breakability waffling resisting struggling to paint herself out of any criminal conspiracy yet my instinct was that over all shed been truthful if she and tom were killers they wouldnt have tolerated doris reingolds putting the touch on them all this time i was driving faster than usual before i knew it i passed latigo shores and escondido beach and came to paradise cove where karen had been picked up on the highway by someone in a red ferrari lowell asking for a pretty one to set up the tables and chairs app or a lackey picking her up private party before the big one lowell and app and trafficant had the producer worn a mustache back then nothing nasty friday night shed been in a good mood the next morning but something had gone very bad the next day make it a goodlooking one felix barnard was no sherlock but hed managed to put enough together to merit his own payoff and a finale at the adventure inn app sitting there talking to me about deals playing with me he was lowells patron powerful enough to be ordering lowell around i recalled his explosive reaction to my intrusion then the cold cruel way hed fired his receptionist allowing me in when i told him what it was about sounding me out assessing the threat talking about mellorsmullinss violent nature the script definitely a diversion which wasnt to say mellors hadnt written it app with years of experience weaving and darting in hollywood had he bought my biography story maybe he hadnt tried to restrain me or harm me hadnt even kept my card waiting for me to get back to him on the deal i pressed down on the gas pedal forging into rural malibu this far up there were no lights on the road the highway darkened and twisted i kept picturing karen getting into the sleek red car with golden expectations playing with lucy and puck the next morning until gwen had had doris the experienced mother take over doris putting the kids to bed then sneaking out to frolic returning later to discover lucy gone she runs out to look for her finds her sleepwalking babbling men hurting girl powerful men mopping up the evidence of murder in a motel owned by some guys from reno the advent group now i knew why the name was familiar the other outfit sharing the twentieth floor with apps production company advent ventures app keeping mellors on a financial leash in order to control him and use him first the idiot job at the production company then moving him into the motel job literary critic to brothel manager lowell would have appreciated it i could imagine apps spiel think about it denny i know the job is below you but its just shorttime and all you have to do is look in on the dump once in a while maybe even pick up some material how about a series based on a motel all these crazy characters drifting in and out we can pitch it to the networks dont feel pressure to make a decision right now think about it and let me know come up to the house well look at the ocean and break some bread everything falling into place but still gwen had admitted to nothing more than seeing karen step into the crowd with her hors doeuvres tray and lowells payoff could be construed as a generous tip i heard milos voice superego by way of the lapd no evidence i tried to call him again that night and the next morning no answer at home and the desk officer at westside division was unhelpful all this information and nowhere to go lucy wasnt focusing on karen so that bought some time but i wasnt sure last nights intimidation would keep gwen shea in town and without her what did i really have id keep trying to find milo in the meantime id run off the tension i was changing into shorts and a tshirt when my service called with dr wendy embrey on the line trying to keep the irritation out of my voice i said hi wendy hi hows lucretia doing off the case she had no privileges shes fine well thats good it was an odd case i never really felt i had a handle on it in what way the suicide attempt she was so adamant about not trying to kill herself but she seemed so coherent so no subsequent psychosis or major depression none good anyway say hello to her for me i still think about her will do wendy actually i was calling you about something else this is awkward and dont feel obligated to answer but have you had any trouble getting paid for treating her im fine with that oh hmm i know this is tacky but i think i told you woodbridge is in a major financial bind the staffs under a lot of pressure not to take on any nonpaying cases im under special pressure since its my first year there probationary status lucy had no insurance and no clear ability to pay strict hospital policy is to take care of the crisis then transfer them over to county i didnt do that because i liked her and because her brother told me hed handle it but the hospital just notified me that a bill they sent to his company was returned unopened and he hasnt returned any of their calls none of mine either have you been in contact with him hes been tied up i said their brother peter odd a couple of days ago oh god im so sorry for bringing it up goodbye i ran and had breakfast on the news one of the bogettes a sunkencheeked twentyish harpy named stasha was granting an interview to a breathlessly eager reporter her hair was cropped to the skin and she wore a goathair vest and a necklace of animal fangs jobe is god tattoo just above her left eyebrow her mouth twisted constantly and her eyes pursued the camera the reporter was a blond woman in her late twenties with conspicuous hair she said so youre saying the police have bungled the investigation so badly that jobe shwandt deserves a new trial but surely surely jobe lives said stasha surely the truth will spawn its own certain becertitude the rest of her speech succumbed to bleeps i turned off the set the phone rang hey milo finally just saw one of your girls on the tube spent all night following those hags around town el monte san gabriel south pasadena glendale burbank they drive slowly use their turn signals make full stops whered they go nowhere just cruising pulling over to the curb waiting then pulling out again goddamn game final stop was for burgers and fries at an allnight grease palace in san fernando one of them comes up to me in the parking lot and offers me a pepsi after spitting on it and inviting me to mate with pigs then she told me where theyd be going next want a fucking road map clown fun join the blue army see the world anyway that was some message you left me on ms shea what you tailed her then interrogated her it just kind of happened ill bet he said grumbling hopefully she wont sue you think she was on the level i told him why i did if app and lowell are so ready to bump people off he said whyd they let the sheas live several possibilities i said if gwen was being truthful she and tom dont really know much and each year the sheas kept the secret and didnt hit on lowell for extra money would have reassured them also by now the sheas are as invested in the status quo as lowell and app respectable business people the fact that they took money to withhold information on a girl who ended up murdered wouldnt do much for their civic image and if doris ever found out they held back money from her shed blow her stack and probably try to incriminate them as it is she resents their success lovely folks he said the type who pretends not to smell the gas chambers okay so now we know for sure sanctum was the last place karen was seen but no proof of any crime i know not without a body so far lucys dreams been panning out milo so the body might very well be right there after all these years i can see them stashing her there short term alex but why would they be stupid enough to leave her arrogance im sure lowell sees himself as above the law and when you get down to it its a pretty safe place whod think to look for her there even if they did with all that land whod know where to look a sick feeling hit me oh boy what my meeting with app yesterday if he goes checking and finds out my biography story is bogus hell start to suspect something if the body is still up at lowells it could get moved pretty soon dont scourge yourself i dont see that it makes any difference even if no one touches the body we cant not even close to grounds for a warrant and after all these years theres probably no body to speak of animals get hold of bones scatter them if apps smart hell sit tight and not attract attention to the place maybe but in the past he hasnt sat things out he and lowell eliminate people who get in the way so why havent they bumped off the sheas and doris answer theyre discriminating if gwens story is even true dont forget all youve got to connect app is the ferrari anyone could have been driving it but lucy remembers someone ordering lowell around app would have been in a position to do that so would trafficant and now that youve tossed mellors into the heap weve got four bad guys so lets not start thinking of the dream as gospel okay i said but its maddening getting so close and not being able to grab it join the club anyway let me look into mr app i gave him the producers century city office at the time of the party his home was in malibu i said on the beach side no doubt i called lucy no answer i got in the seville and headed south to topanga canyon just a quick look to see if any cars other than lowells were parked in front of the lodge house then id turn back or maybe if it seemed right another visit to the old man checking to see how he was coping with his loss at worst hed curse me and kick me out if he was taking one of his long naps id try to cajole nova into another walk into the forest lacy trees when i came to the intersection at old topanga road i had to stop for an oncoming truck as i waited to turn left i noticed a car parked in the lot of the market across the road blue colt a young woman behind the wheel when the truck passed i uturned and pulled over next to it lucy looked out the window shocked then she smiled we both got out of our cars she had on a plaid shirt jeans and hiking boots her hair was pulled back in a bun hi she said hi she looked back at her car guiltily on the seat were an empty coffee cup and a donut not much of a lunch i said i youll probably think its stupid but ive decided to go up there and face him not stupid i said but the timing couldnt be worse in the last two days ive learned things that indicate karen best did disappear at the sanctum party and your father paid some people to keep quiet about it other men were involved too other people may have died because they knew about it the color left her face in patches why havent you told me any of this ive tried to call you several times oh ive been out with ken no just driving around by myself he had to fly up to the home office hes been good to me but ive been happy for the peace and quiet even though all i do is think about puck biting her lip she crossed her arms and hugged herself i stepped closer she moved back the hardest part was the funeral seeing them throw the dirt over him the funerals what crystallized things for me the way he showed up in that horrid white suit with his bimbo making a show of himself like the whole thing was a big performance even at a time like that he couldnt be decent it brought home to me how he keeps doing rotten things and getting away with them its time someone stood up to him im sorry for not consulting you first but i finally need to do something for myself the way i see it youve always been pretty independent no she said just alone and now im going up there please dont try to stop me dr delaware whats the worst he can do try to run me down in his wheelchair sic his bimbo on me lucy and what are you doing here she smiled you were going up yourself werent you lucy these people are dangerous who are they what are their names the main guy is probably a film producer named curtis app i described the way hed looked twentyone years ago that doesnt sound familiar she said so maybe he was the one with his back to me but who was the one with the mustache there are at least two possibilities trafficant or another writer named denton mellors big lightskinned black man he had a mustache though it was skimpy like trafficants and blond he was one of those murdered possibly because he knew what had happened to karen no she said the man i saw was definitely white and the mustache was thick and dark your dream may be accurate in some respects but not in others she turned and opened her car door i held her wrist i met with app yesterday gave him a phony story about doing a biography of lowell he may find out i was lying and get nervous he or his henchmen could be up there right now no theyre not no ones gone in or out of the place all day ive been watching the entry from before daybreak youve been staking the place out not intentionally i was sitting there building up my courage i came down here to get some coffee and use the ladies room i was just about to head back how can you be sure no one spotted you no one did believe me no one even came close i was the one doing the watching you sat from daybreak till now i know you think im being stupid but i need to stand up to him and get him out of my life once and for all i understand that but this just isnt the time it has to be im sorry youre a wonderful man i trust you more than anyone you and milo but this is something thats been building up my whole life i cant put it off any longer just a little while longer lucy till when youve got no evidence on karens death the police will never have a case till we know its safe its safe now theres no one up there besides my going up there wont look funny to anyone he wanted to meet with me whats the big deal about a daughter meeting her father lucy please she patted my shoulder the patient doing things for herself thats therapeutic progress right my only therapeutic goal right now is to keep you safe ill be fine the prodigal daughter returned maybe i cant solve any crimes but i can try for personal justice what kind of justice my voice was sharp she stared at me and laughed no no im not going to play dirty harriet search me for weapons if you like i just need to see him to show myself i dont need him she got into the colt maybe im making a mistake but at least itll be mine the car started i have to do it now she said i may never have the guts again she pulled out of the lot i waited until she was out of sight then i followed her she drove slowly and i had to hang back when i reached the honeysuckle at the mouth of sanctums entry road she was nowhere in sight i began the upward crawl a speedwalker could have beaten me to the double gates lucy had left them open the second pair of gates was unlatched too a few more bumps up the shaded path then the trees parted and i saw the big lodge house brown as the trunks of the bristlecone pines that nestled it the colt was parked nose out as far as possible from lowells jeep and mercedes no other vehicles in sight the front door to the house was shut and i figured shed already gone in but then she appeared from around the back of her car taking something out of the trunk no nothing in her hands no pocket bulges her mouth opened as i pulled up i said think of it as an extended house call expecting anger but she stared past me blank and focused at the same time hypnotic when she put a hand to her mouth i thought shed lost her nerve and i felt relieved yet sad then she walked quickly to the house stomping up the wide porch stairs i was next to her as she knocked hard on the front door no one answered she tapped her foot and knocked harder cmon cmon cmon i looked through the dusty windows the big front room was unlit and uninhabited lucy began pounding the door with both hands when there was still no response she dashed off the porch and stood in front of the house taking in its bulk walking toward the right side of the building her steps were fast and deliberate scuffing the dust another brief pause then she continued toward the back toward the high thicket that rose behind the house like some great green tide i found her staring at the overgrowth back there she whispered a voice above us said whats going on nova framed by a secondstory window her face grayed by a screen hi i said taking lucys icy hand we knocked but no one answered a finger poked the screen the expression above it was hard to gauge so you decided to come lucys fingers dug into my hand sure she said we were in the neighborhood and decided to pop in is there a problem with that nova tented the screen with her fingertips no not unless daddys got one she gave a strange laugh come around the front she was waiting for us holding a glass of lemonade the copper in her hair shone like electric wire he wasnt in any great mood when he went to bed but ill tell him youre here ill tell him myself said lucy walking past her into the front room taking in the stuffed heads the shabby furniture the emptiness staring at the log walls nova seemed amused nothing nurturant about her why had she chosen to care for a feeble cruel man kindred souls just like trafficant and mellors what was her particular brand of cruelty lucy made her way toward the staircase moving slowly and cautiously like a trapper on ice passing under the steps then continuing toward the back room nova put her hands on her hips and watched rubbing one foot against the other she wet her lips with her tongue and glanced at me her eyes returned to lucy and satisfaction filled them lucys discomfiture turned her on lucy looked up at the ceiling then the floor then back to the walls stopping short arms straight at her sides her face frozen she stared at the lefthand door nova said thats right daddys back there dear despite her smile tension in her voice competition mock sibling rivalry wanting lucy to come here certain it would destroy her i took lucys elbow she shook her head and moved her arm out of my grasp twenty feet from the room i covered the distance with her the door was pine once heavily varnished the finish cracked flaking like dandruff she sucked in breath and opened it as we stepped into a big dark booklined room a sulfurous smell hit us not unlike the stench of the er at woodbridge a hospital bed was in the center cranked to a semiupright position lowells wheelchair was folded in a corner lowell reclined under the covers his hair greasy and limp his long arms resting on the blanket white and blueveined below frayed gray undershirt sleeves his chin was coated with white stubble his eyes unfocused it was pm but he hadnt awakened fully he turned toward us with obvious effort then turned away and closed his eyes lucys hand found its way back into mine so sweaty it slithered in my grasp her shoulders twitched then began shaking i followed her eyes as they reconnoitered landing on the pine bookshelves that sheathed three of the walls a door in the righthand corner was open exposing a small bathroom the other centered between the windows led outside bolted lucys gaze lingered on it then moved on books and piles of magazines and newspapers littered the floor atop a stack of new yorkers was an aluminum tray laden with dirty dishes curling bread crusts congealed eggs cornflakes swimming in milk that looked bluish in the mean grainy light an empty bedpan sat on a stack of old paris reviews packages of adultsize disposable diapers were piled high on a tottering mountain of assorted periodicals a cardboard box next to the diapers was filled with empty whiskey bottles a tower of dixie cups and an old black rotary telephone the phones cord snaking into the jumble and vanishing the shakes had moved down to lucys fingers and i felt her knuckles slap against mine nova was nowhere in sight but i felt her presence an icy current lowell moaned and moved his head from side to side his eyes had closed lucy didnt move then she began scanning the room again the filthy windows the door to the back back to the log walls repeating the circuit staying this time on the door wideeyed this was where shed slept the night of the party the room shed left sleepwalking her hand was shaking so badly i could barely hold on to it lowells eyes opened and he flipped his face at us seeing us for the first time he let out a deep pitiful angry noise and began the long excruciating process of sitting up no hoists above the bed he hadnt availed himself of conveniences not even an electric wheelchair and i wondered why cursing he slid and heaved and finally propped his upper body high enough to rest his back against the pillows his chest was caved in his shoulders knobby and narrow the flair of the white suit and the panama hat seemed a distant joke the last couple of days had knocked him low grief lucy watched him the way you watch a repulsive but fascinating insect make its way up a wall he laughed she turned away and hugged herself so he said hoarsely several moments of throat clearing he gave a look of distaste rotated his lips and spat a wad of phlegm at the log wall it missed and landed on the floor coughing and grinning he expelled another wad lucy looked ill but she didnt move lowell watched her intently his fingers scratched the sheets as he continued to pull himself up trying to move his head in an upward arc pain stopped him so he said again his voice had cleared a bit cute he said very cute what is said lucy straining for a light tone you he chortled as if shed set him up for a punch line he looked her up and down none of the lasciviousness hed shown with nova cold precise as if taking the measure of a piece of furniture play tennis he said she shook her head those are tennis players legs even through those dungarees i can see them play anything another headshake of course not he said no appetite for games he rubbed his eyes and stretched his arms laughing some more so what can i offer you marylittle lamb he said alcohol percodan demerol morphine endorphins or is alleged truth the dope youre shooting what kind of stories should i tell you to help you lubricate your mental deadbolt is this a monumental moment for you lucy remained silent no stories what then lucy looked at the rear door lowell shouted wordlessly and slapped the bedsheet ah the spectacle here to goggle at my groanery my little serpents tooth barge in with your brain mechanic in tow so you can listen to the thrumthrum and imagine my torment grinning laughing yes im in pain girl sacramental sizzling batteryacid synaptic joy maybe youll know it too one day and then youll understand what a fucking hero i am to be sitting here smelling like shit and looking like a gehennaleaseholder knowing the only fuckdamn reason you pranced your little tennis butt in here is to drink up my misery so you can say youve had a tall frosty revenge cocktail at the expense of the best lucy kept staring at the door ho said lowell the silent treatment just like when you were a baby how would you know said lucy lowell guffawed very loud his shrunken body seemed to grow with each expulsion laughter energized him turning him demonic and lively and bringing color to his face the opening movement of the guilt sonata dont waste your quarter notes lass ive soloed with the best of the sin symphonies lucy began circling the room moving as freely as the clutter would allow your silence said lowell is not artillery its an empty knapsack you were a mute baby with skinny legs no cries no tears not a yawp deadmute as an anencephalic accident unlike the other one peterpeter morphomorto poison eater he howled professionally it was rent a studio down the block or strangle the little snotrat he closed his eyes you on the other hand kept your lips glued as if your tonsils were treasure the eyes opened a bony finger shot out accompanied by a hoarse laugh you wouldnt shit either har anus on strike weeks at a time quite a style quite a style take all hold in give nothing i thought you were abnormal your mother assured me you werent and poured mineral oil down your aphasic little gullet still walking lucy mustered a smile of her own is that why you ran scared at having an abnormal baby lowell chuckled but there was anger in it run did i no no no no no i was invited to vacate the premises menstrually shrill banshee byebye from mawmaw and a claw at the face mother kicked you out lucys turn to laugh a big tough guy like you lowell looked at her as if in a new light sucking in breath he wiggled his thick eyebrows and stuck his finger in his mouth he kept it in there probing and scraping and breathing roughly pulling it out he examined a fingernail mother he said was a blindered bujwhacked neurally corseted parlorbound stumplet with the textbook vision of a suburban storm trooper middleaged at twentythree old at twentyfour tapioca libido her sheer puddingness turned me into a rebellious adolescent she wouldnt couldntlearn how to be she had nothing to live for but rules and rot lucys hands clenched as she turned for a moment i thought shed pounce on him then she shook her head and put one hand in her pocket and laughed her hips angled forward a lounging pose as staged as novas god she said youre pathetic terminally blocked blah blah blah hiding behind all that bad joyce lowell paled smiled lost the smile fished for it and finally found it but it had lost its cruel luster and his grizzled jaw seemed to weaken joyce he said know him well do you mademoiselle sophomore i met the dwent paris clerk face no lips womans hips limesuck limesuck limesuck bloody gud that fucking irish lechery for talk with no conclusion but lets get back to lovely mother she died a virgin and you genuflect to her daily the truth is you know as much about her as you do about prostate clog but you defend her because thats your script well believe what you will shutter your limited mind to your hearts contempt he wheezed and inflated his voice whether or not you know it youve come here to learn if you fail to do so its your lowered expectation not mine the truth constipata she invited me to leave because she couldnt tolerate a bit of in flagrante delicious lucy pretended to remain aloof but he was talking loudly and his voice made her flinch he rubbed his hands together and looked at me a sad sick salacious succulent tale braintrust perfect for you turning quickly to lucy after you stretched her womb she lost whatever feeble interest shed ever had in the doublebacked beast but like the old song says her sister will oh did she little sister kate one of those yawning vaginas the exact color of bubblegum so who was i to play brakeman to fate her sister did so i did her sister oh yes oh yes smile she bucked and buckled that one did scratched and caromed and screamed like a stuck sow at the moment of truce pointing to his groin remembering it almost convinces me something dingled once upon a spine i kept a close watch on lucy she was staring in his direction but not at him anger shot through her slender frame like an injection of starch sisterly love said lowell mawmaw found us sang her ode to virtue and i creeped off tailtucked he tried to shrug and managed only a shoulder tic banished to the horrors of paris reprobate kate parceled off to california then mother caught herself something postnatal and fatal and suddenly i was called back to be a father he aimed his thumb at the ground and mockfrowned illsuited for the care of a mewling snotjack and a notone anally blocked normal infant i had the wisdom to relinquish parental privilege to fornikate by then she was fucking some pansy jew journalist gleeful bellowing lucy was standing on the balls of her feet i could see moisture in her eyes i was thinking of my dead father lowell said why fight it girl you need me do i given your insistence upon projecting an air of injured chastity id say so really dear enough bad theater let us slash pretenses throat and allow it to bleed out richly into the gutter the permanenthymen act wont work with me i know about the summer you spent with your heels in the air looking into the bilesooted eyes of roxbury coons quite disappointing i must say to rut is nature to rut for money commerce but to rut niggers for money and let some boss nigger pocket the profits how sheepheaded girl i shall assign a collie to herd you lucys fists opened and her knees bent i held her by the arms whispering lets get out she shook her head violently ah the selfesteemer plies his craft said lowell dispensing turds of wisdom as you try to convince her shes okay lucy let her arms fall she stepped away from me right up to the edge of the bed stretching her arms as wide as she could she stared him in the face exposing herself shock therapy or the death of hope lowell turned to me shes not okay shes planets from okay back to lucy want to know how i learned all about your moorish mooring darling brother petey no interrogation necessary lovely filthy truths emerge when a wretch craves his needle toof toof ah yes yet another betrayal daughter not to worry disillusionment builds character stick with me and youll be granite did you kill him said lucy did you give him that overdose that surprised lowell but he rebounded with a snort noo he said softly he did a fine job of that himself my error was kindness giving him cash when i knew what hed do with it hed come up here in this room lie on the floor rolling around begging and vomiting a craftsman of cowardice and evidently you stupid girl are his apprentice him said lucy me thats some parental report card is that what siggie fraud here told you that you can blame your shitlife on me that you have some right to happiness shouting and spraying spit his words pushing him forward youre not meant to be happy theres no grand plan your happiness doesnt mean two buckets of sour pus not to you thats for sure not to anyone god whatever he is looks down on you sees your misery scratches his balls cackles and pisses steaming buckets on your head his condomate satan stops buggering tiny animals just long enough to add to the torrent the raison dêtre isnt happiness you styoopid nin its being existence inherence it doesnt matter what happens or doesnt or who else is fuck the consequences you occur i remembered novas little speech someone had paid attention during class he glared at lucy breathing hard seized by sudden wet rumbling coughs he sucked in air started to tilt back on the bed and forced himself upright again didnt know you were religious said lucy nearly breathless herself get to know me said lowell youll learn lots of things she looked at him then sat on the bed hard enough to make him bounce pinching sheet between thumb and forefinger she rubbed the fabric what kinds of things will i learn daddy she said in a small voice after a seconds hesitation he said how to create how to be a cathedral how to piss from the heavens lucy smiled and played with the sheets some more be god in six easy lessons no it wont be easy youll change my diapers wipe my armpits and powder my thighs fetch my papers in your mouth get down on your knees and acquire an attention span learn what a good book is and how to tell it from crap learn how to whore for your own good how to rid yourself of redbugs like that curlyhaired leech over there how to finally stop bingepurging on selfpity he shook a finger at her ill teach you more in one day than all the marrowsuck schools full of eighthwit arsenods taught you in what are you twentysix years he leaned forward and touched her arm his fingers looked like crab legs on her plaid sleeve she didnt move you have no choice said lowell softly as is youre nothing she studied his pale twisted hand then her eyes moved back to the rear door she gazed into his eyes for a long time nothing she said sadly the quintessense of it angelpie she hung her head nothing she repeated he patted her hand she sighed and seemed to grow small my fear for her rose like floodwater lowell giggled and traced a line from her wrist to her knuckles she shuddered but remained still lowell clucked his tongue cheerfully she was breathing deeply eyes closed i got ready to pull her away from this place lowell said welcome to reality well do everything to make your stay as interesting as possible lucy looked in his eyes again nothing she said lowell nodded smiled and stroked her hand lucy smiled back peeled his fingers off and stood walking to the rear door she tried to slide the bolt it was rusted and stuck but she freed it lowells head craned his body warping as he strained to watch her fresh air he said dont bother sweetness is a lie your senses are despots get used to stale im going out for a stroll she said in a flat voice daddy to think no need to its not your strong suit you finish your homework and then you can play pay close attention and ill turn you into something interesting youll endure sounds pretty faustian daddy something new in her voice punchline satisfaction lowell heard it right away his face lost tone the bones softening the skin giving way sit down lucy stared sit down lucy smiled and waved bye daddy its been educational she threw the door open green filled the doorway and sunlight shocked the room lowell squinted as lucy looked out at the green tide then he sprang forward groping for a hold on nothingness his lower body was leaden and it anchored him to the bed he cursed lucy god the devil nice property youve got daddy theres someone i need to look for out there a terrible comprehension took hold of lowell a preliminary death he pitched harder fell forward flopping face down on the mattress lying there face pressed against the sheets he labored to breathe as he watched lucy disappear his eyes met mine his were bottomless and terrified i glanced at the black phone and considered ripping it out of the wall but there had to be other extensions in the house why remind him of the instrument as i left i heard him howling like a child for nova at first i thought lucy had slipped into the forest then i heard footsteps along the side of the house returning to her car good when i caught up with her she didnt acknowledge me how many sessions would it take to unravel what shed just been through we reached the colt but instead of opening the drivers door she went to the back and opened the trunk personal justice finally pushed too far i ran over just as she pulled a shovel out of the trunk and put it over her shoulder brand new the price tag still looped to the handle bearing it like a rifle she headed back toward the house i blocked her she passed around me i blocked her again come on lucy she walked away once more i caught up i felt like screaming this is nuts what i said was dont let him get to you lucy nothing maybe so well see we were hurrying alongside the house now hell call his friends theyll come after you she ignored me i took hold of her arm she shook me off listen to me lucy he wont do anything he doesnt do anything he just talks thats his game talk talk talk hes still dangerous hes nothing furious smile nothing we came to the dirt patch behind the building womens lingerie flapping on the line the back door was closed nova had heeded lowells cries nodding as if in response to a suggestion lucy forged forward into the green low shrubs and tender shoots shadowed by the tree canopy gave way quickly to dense ferns creeping vines brambles and broadleafed things that looked to be some kind of giant lily lucy used her hands to clear the way and when that didnt work she began hacking with the shovel the tool proved a poor machete and soon she was breathing hard and grunting with anger why dont you give me that this isnt your problem she said chopping if you really think theres danger dont put yourself in it i dont want you in it either i understand what im getting into she touched my hand briefly then resumed poking through the brush my choices were drive back to pch and try to reach milo carry her out bodily or stick with her and try to get her out as quickly as possible physical coercion would probably destroy our therapeutic relationship but i could stand that if it meant saving her life but if she resisted it might prove difficult even ugly maybe the best thing was to stay with her even if she found the gravesite shed learn soon that exhumation with one shovel was beyond her physical capabilities and the thought of her out here alone scared the hell out of me maybe i was overestimating the danger lowell was a monster but in his own sick way hed been reaching out to her would he sentence her to death shed gone only a few yards but the vegetation had closed over her like a trapdoor and i could barely make out her plaid shirt i looked over my shoulder the house was obscured too no visible pathway but as i followed lucys footsteps a troughlike depression in the earth became evident longburied trail she was moving as surely and quickly as the brush would allow knowing where she was going guided by a dream i clawed my way through the vegetation and got right behind her the plants were taller the treetops thicker and soon there was more green than blue in the sky things slithered and scampered all around us but other than a suddenly vibrating leaf or tendril i saw nothing move from time to time i heard the broomsweep of wings flapping in panic but the birds stayed out of sight too the growth became junglethick lucy swung the shovel like an ax sweat running down her face in sooty streams her chin set her eyes hard and clear i took over and got us through faster we came to the first of the small cabins a fallendown roofless thing nearly hidden by emerald clouds lucy barely looked at it tears were diluting the sweat tracks and her blouse was sodden i wanted to say something comforting but shed just been raped by words a second cabin appeared a few minutes later just a loose pile of logs managing to support a tar roof shiny black wasplike things buzzed through holes in the tarpaper swooping in then jetting out like tiny dive bombers lucy stopped stared shook her head we kept going our silent trudge took us past three more cabins gnats and chiggers were having fun with our faces the sudden takeoff of a huge brown bird nearly stopped my heart i managed to catch a glimpse of the creature as it forged up through the treetops big square head and fivefoot wingspread horned owl the silence that followed was unsettling lucy didnt seem to notice pinpoints of blood pocked her face where the bugs had gotten her and her palms were raw from wrestling with vines give your hands a rest she said no but she complied getting through wasnt easy even with my pushuptightened arms hers had to be numb i ripped and sliced wondering how much grace time we had knowing we were leaving an obvious trail for anyone who followed even if you find her i said huffing after all this time she wont look like a person there may be nothing left at all animals carry off bones i know i learned that at the trial the trough deepened and i had to fight for balance lucy was looking up at the trees something lacy trees of all kinds were everywhere an untidy colonnade rising through the undergrowth it was twoforty the sun had peaked and was falling behind us dancing through holes in the overgrowth a tiny brilliant mirror a new sound more of the groundwater a trickle that recalled the one id heard driving up the kind of moisture that hastens decomposition even if you find her what will you do take something back with me they can do tests and prove its her thatll be evidence something i heard something snap behind me and stopped lucy had heard it too and she peered at the forest behind us silence she shrugged and wiped her face with her sleeve it was hard to gauge how far we were from the lodge house i tasted my own sweat and felt it sting my eyes we started walking again coming upon a knotted mass of thick ivylike vines with coils as hard as glass it refused to yield to the shovel lucy threw herself at it yanking and tearing her hands wet with blood i pulled her away and inspected the plant despite its monstrous head its root base was relatively small petrified a twofoot clump of burl i chopped at the shoot right above the root dust and insects flew and i could hear more animals fleeing in the distance my biceps were pumped and my shoulders throbbed finally i was able to sever enough tendrils to pull back the clump and let us pass on the other side of the vine things were different as if wed entered a new chamber of a great green palace the air cooler the trees all the same species coast redwoods great repeating roan columns spaced closely their top growth a black fringe not the threehundredfoot monsters of the north but still huge at a third that height only a scatter of ferns grew in their shadows the ground was gray as barbecue dust mounded with leaves and bark shards through the fringe the sun was a speck of mica the fringe lace lucy began weaving through the mammoth trunks heading toward something light a patch of day that enlarged as we ran toward it she stepped into it and spread her arms as if gathering the heat and clarity we were in an open area bounded by hillside and the same kind of mesquite id seen on the highway beyond the hills higher mountains before us a field of high feathery wild grass split by dozens of silver snakes narrow streams a mesh of them thin and sinuous as map lines the water sound diffuse now delicate i followed lucy as she made her way through grass stepping in the soft ground between the streams down to a mossy clearing centered in it a pond brackish a hundred feet wide its surface coated by a peacolored scum of algae bubbling in spots skimmed by water boatmen the globular leaves of hyacinth floated peacefully dragonflies took off and landed on the near bank was another cabin identical to the others rotted black its roof a fuzz of lichen a decaying door dangling from one hinge something green running nearly the width of the door i ran over metal a plaque probably once bronze grooves engraving i rubbed away grime until calligraphic letters showed themselves inspiration i pushed the door aside and entered the floor was black too ripe as peat oddly sweetsmelling through empty window casements i could see the flat green water of the pond these log walls were perforated with disease remnants of furniture in one corner a small metal desk completely rusted and legless blotched with green and teeming with grubs and beetles something on the desktop i flicked away insects and humus and revealed the blacklacquer keys of a manual typewriter a bit more scraping produced a goldleaf royal logo next to the desk a leather chair had been reduced to a few curling scraps of dermis and a handful of hammered nailheads on the ground near the desk three metal loops attached to a rusted spine rings from a looseleaf notebook something else copperish with a green patina i kneeled something crawled up my leg and i slapped it away the patina was moss not copper gold a gold bulletshaped tube with a whitegold clip the cap of a fountain pen etched in the head mbl i pocketed it and kicked at the loose fragrant dirt nothing else in the cabin lucy hadnt followed me in through the window hole i saw her make her way to the waters edge and stare across the pond two trees on the far bank giant lush weeping willows their surface roots worming into the pond branches of knifeblade goldengreen leaves looping to the ground then bending and resuming in a relentless horizontal growth sentries diamonds of light shone through the wispy foliage a babyblue network ethereal as lace i ran out of the cabin lucys eyes were fixed on a spot between the trees a bare sunken area she took the shovel from me and began circling the pond clockwise awkward almost hesitant toeing along the bank inches from the waters edge her eyes closed and she slipped before i could catch her one leg went into the water up to the ankle she pulled it out her jeans were soaked she shook her leg and kept walking stopped in the bare spot tears dripping down her cheeks cradling the shovel like a baby inspiration lowells private spot burying karen here for company he needed company the adulation of fans and disciples and when that dried up the worship of young women send me someone goodlooking had other women been buried here my initial thought upon hearing the dream was that hed molested lucy thered been more than a nuance of sexuality in his approach to her just now comments about her legs and her toilet training flaunting his infidelity with her aunt yet i couldnt shake the feeling that with lucy he was after something different stick with me and ill show you the world kid body failing fame withered he wanted a family hed stopped coming here a long time ago no more inspiration lucy stood up without a word she began digging she wouldnt let me help her the first foot of soil was forgiving but after that she hit compressed clay and cried out in frustration i wrested the shovel from her each second weighed on me as i excavated a hole six feet long and three feet deep getting in the pit and pitching out dirt like a manic paid by the shovelful my arms felt leaden and detached from my body no signs of any bones the smallest chip and id yank her the hell out of here even without progress id give it five more minutes she got in and said my turn but when i shook my head she didnt argue tears had washed her face clean the sun was sinking and the pond had grayed it had been over an hour since wed come up but the day seemed timeless each shovelful mixed with the blood rush in my head i dug and dug till my breath grew short and harsh then i heard something else another voice a womans from across the pond both of us turned nova was standing near inspiration a man had one arm around her waist his other hand held a pistol to her head she looked frightened to death the mans fingers touched one of her breasts and spidered their way up in a manner that couldnt be accidental i pushed lucy down and ducked the mans gun arm snapped as if he was throwing the weapon the shot knocked loose a chunk of dirt a yard from my right hand no marksman but we had no cover trapped i crouched low in the pit keeping my hand on lucys back her mouth was open but her breathing was silent no sounds i raised my head for a peek the man put the gun back to novas head and prodded her with one knee the two of them slowdanced around the pond till they got within fifteen feet of us her left cheek was scraped raw and her left eye was swelling i ducked and peeked ducked and peeked finally seeing his face his right hand gripped her narrow waist manicured nails the jeans were pressed his sweatshirt said sausalito he looked like an executive hanging loose exactly what he was christopher graydonjones youve made some nice progress he said pity we dont have more spades well get to work well need it a good deal deeper to fit all of you go on will you shes still his daughter i said when he called you he didnt expect you to kill her no i suppose not he gave a splitsecond smile that raised one corner of his mouth actually he had this tart call and look what happened to her expectations are so seldom met nova moved and he kneed her hard in the back true i said you wanted to be a sculptor his lips drew back and he did something with his free hand that made nova cry out though there is a continuity i said molding form shaping limbs bigtime power needs thats what got you into trouble with karen isnt it he dug his fingers into novas middle she gasped and shivered and a wet stain spread at her groin please she said start digging or ill kill this bit of fuzz right now and make you chop up her body with the dull edge of that spade i picked up the shovel he backed out of swinging range nova was nearly limp straining his grip aiming the gun at lucy he shoved down on novas shoulder forcing her to her knees then prone her face in the dirt she ate some gagged managed to turn her head to the side graydonjones put his foot on her spine trophy hunter but his eyes were jumpy come come faster faster or ill have to finish both these tarts i jammed the shovel in the clay pulling it out was like towing a barge my whole upper body felt encased in concrete the lace pattern through the willows was pewtercolored now i managed to dig he said not that it matters but i didnt get into trouble with karen karen did it to herself drugs i said stopping dont slack off yes yes drugs what else dont you watch your publicservice commercials i wasnt even the one to give them to her who was the shovel hit the ground again i pretended to dig deep but got only a few grains of soil on my blade he was too far away to notice his gaze leveling off at my elbows if i stroked rapidly and grunted a lot that might pass for a while who gave her the drugs i said faking another hard chop app no answer one of his big hands caressed novas rear you were just along for the party i saw lucy from a corner of my eye sitting knees up frozen powerless again yes a party there was no crime said graydonjones she was the life of it coming on to all of us crawling up in our laps telling us she was going to be a film star and live in beverly hills what kind of drugs did app give her whats the difference grass hash quaaludes it was the ludes that got to her no tolerance out like a light he looked down at nova then his gaze shifted to lucy what are you staring at make yourself useful dig with your handsgo on lucy got down on all fours and began scooping up clay i said two parties then friday night and saturday he blinked with surprise covered it with a laugh the police know too is that so that sounds right out of a telly script go on dig i faked some more so she came on to you all saucy talk and meaningful glances quite a piece a virgin though youd never have known it she didnt stay one saturday night did she chop grunt oh he said are we being politically correct are we saying a saucy little piece who crawls up on your lap and puts her tongue in your ear doesnt want it we treated her like a lady illdeserved she was totally stoned unbuttoning her blouse singing jefferson airplane songs then she vomited all over me his mouth twitched but i cleaned her up anyway dressed her and combed her hair curt even put makeup on her are you slacking ms daughter get those hands working lucy scooped and tossed dirt her eyes were dry and her thoughts were impossible to read novas cheek was squashed against the earth her swollen eye totally shut her lip split i breathed conspicuously and gave him another few shovel strokes so what went wrong what do you think she didnt wake up but how did you find out i didnt answer he put the gun to novas head i remembered it said lucy you graydonjones was amused what were you back then a fetus lucy started to say something i shook my head at her the old idiot told you said graydonjones fucking bloody fool well as usual hes screwed up giggles youve missed the spot completely letting his gaze coast over us toward the larger of the willows lucy made a soft catlike sound i said who was at the party besides you and app and lowell not lowell he said thankfully he was always such a bore friday night he had her on his lap sad tales of the writers lonely life but saturday he was too busy for that caligula in his toga so whyd he get involved in burying her because hes such a kind man laughter he dropped in to pick up some papers and found me trying to revive her and panic panic panic all that bloodandgore verse turns out he had softboiled guts did he drop in alone or was he with mellors and trafficant how big of a private party was shut up i want you finished well before dark i pantomimed more effort so the party was right over there glancing across the pond he said nothing far from the madding crowd i said far from the meddling crud graydonjones pushed his foot on nova her eyes had stopped moving and her jaw was being pushed down in an unnatural position the scars compressing i said apps got a good thing going sits on the beach and you do the dirty work wrong he said you do the dirty work aiming the gun at the center of my nose i kept on faking moving dirt from place to place lucy had caught on and was doing the same her hair was caked into dreadlocks the hole was at least five feet deep i wondered how much longer wed be able to avoid the next foot graydonjones must have been thinking the same thing he grabbed nova by the back of her collar and dragged her closer to the pit the gun moved back and forth from her head to lucy and me nickelplated automatic plenty of bullets for everyone nova tried to shield her face her shut eye was purplish ballooning and the gun barrel had made red circles on her temple graydonjones stopped six feet from the rim letting her drop again and putting his foot on the back of her neck it wouldnt take much pressure to snap her cervical vertebrae he looked down bloody hell playing games are we training the gun on lucy he started to squeeze the trigger i dove to push her away but she was up screaming throwing a clump of hard dirt at him direct hit on his chest the gun fired somewhere up in the air nova seized the moment to arch her back and grab his foot that diverted his gaze downward as he kicked at her and tried to tighten his grip on the gun i drew the shovel back like a javelin and fired it at his legs blade first as hard as my sandbag arms could muster the tip slammed into his left shin and he yelled in pain and surprise nova managed to break free graydonjones aimed at her she ran toward inspiration as i vaulted out of the hole i threw myself on him as we went down together i felt the gun pinned between our chests digging into my sternum the arm holding it twisted in an unnatural way i slammed the other down as he tried to bite my nose he was out of shape but adrenaline had powered him too and he pitched and rolled managing to slide the gun arm out then something came from the left in a brownwhite blur striking him hard in the cheek quick as a snakebite his head whiplashed another blow and his eyes rolled back he went loose i twisted the gun from his fingers lucys muddy sneaker kicked him again unconscious he started to drool then vomit i jumped free of the trickle of filth standing over him i trained the automatic on his head his sausalito sweatshirt a putrid mess breathing but not moving the left side of his head muddy starting to balloon i was panting so was lucy she reached down toward graydonjones then stopped herself i put my arm around her she looked over at the larger willow the shovel lay on the ground not far from graydonjones you okay i said she held her chest and nodded movement across the pond nova had made her way into the tall grass and was running toward the forest the tints in her hair bright as fruit among the green stalks call the police i shouted she gave no indication she heard i needed binding thought of something i gave the gun to lucy the way she took it told me shed never held one before he probably wont stir but dont get any closer keep it aimed at his head and watch him ill be back in a few minutes taking the shovel i followed novas flight into the forest running hard until i came to the knotted viney plant that had blocked our way bent back now and trodden graydonjones following the path wed laid out for him chopping off several long tendrils i ran back and trussed him in a loose hogtie he was breathing fine and his neck pulse was strong and regular hed have a badly bruised shin a monster headache maybe a concussion but hed survive we left him there and returned to the lodge lowells jeep was still there but the mercedes was gone a brown van with a rental sticker sat between lucys car and the seville the doors were unlocked and i looked inside rental form made out to mr hacker cash transaction in back were shovels and a pickax a hacksaw a spool of rope and several boxes of heavyduty garbage bags the keys were under the drivers seat and i pocketed them fresh tire tracks and oil spots traced the mercedes exit we went inside the house lowell was in bed eyes closed breathing very shallowly and slowly ghostly white two halves of an ampule glinted from the floor just under the bed i found the hypodermic needle a few feet away half concealed by the yellowed corners of an old new york times book review a fresh red dot in the crook of his left arm lucy was behind me at the doorway i heard her walk away i picked up the old black phone and dialed sheriffs and technicians swarmed lowell stayed asleep and he seemed to have lost even more color one of the deputies opined he doesnt look too good paramedics came a half hour later and carted him away milo was still out of the office but i asked for del hardy and he arrived right after the first carful of deputies i hadnt seen him in a while his hair had turned almost completely gray and hed gotten heavier his arrival rescued lucy and me from the kneejerk suspicions of cops who didnt know us as it was we were stuck answering questions till after midnight del came over how you guys doing owe you another guitar oh yeah no time how about dinner i can always eat he asked lucy if she was okay then he walked off to drink coffee with a sheriffs homicide investigator people kept heading back toward the forest lucyd been back there an hour ago pinpointing the spot as technicians created a stringandpost perimeter now the two of us were sitting on folding chairs in front of the seville lucy was covered with a blanket shed managed to eat half a peanut butter and jelly sandwich at someone shouted bones milo showed soon after he looked at us and shook his head doctor and patient perfect match and i set it up he bent and kissed lucys cheek she held his head and kissed him back when she let go he shook my hand and squeezed it del filled me in over the computer sorry i missed the cutting of the cake but i was obstructing a helicopter whose apps leaving town howd you know i didnt i was watching his office all day followed him to lunch at mortons then over to bijan to buy a ninethousanddollar leather jacket then back to his office but instead of getting off at his floor he continued up to the heliport blades whirring the whole bit he tried the indignant citizen bit claimed it was just a backandforth to santa barbara tennis with some other shitbag producer but his stretch limo was packed up with vuitton luggage and his chauffeur was carrying paperwork for a private charter to lisbon out of the imperial terminal he smiled big guy the chauffeur but very low pain threshold anyway apps not going anywhere for the time being got a suite at county jail what charge i said he gave a wide malicious grin traffic tickets idiot ran up four thousand bucks worth last year alone mostly outside clubs and restaurants and violations of neighborhood permits traffic warrants wont keep him in very long hold on hold on when i frisked him i found a nice little chunk of a white powdery substance another chunk on the chauffeur then i called in a k unit and the dogs went crazy were talking half of one of the vuittons crammed with coke negotiable currency for an extended vacation i said so even if graydonjones ran into trouble here hed be long gone best laid plans only vacation hes gonna get for a while is at good old club dread to lucy i hear youre quite a kick boxer she shrugged under the blanket and forced a smile the things you learn in therapy christopher graydonjones his head bandaged whispered earnestly to his lawyer i sat on the other side of the oneway mirror with milo lucy and an assistant deputy district attorney named leah schwartz she was a very goodlooking woman tiny around thirty with a cloud of blond kinky hair gigantic blue eyes and the sometimes graceless manner of a very bright high school student shed been interviewing lucy and me for most of two days writing down detailed notes and using a tape recorder she was writing now sitting apart from the three of us the little receiver shed worn in her ear glimmered in the lap of her black skirt milo still wore his i said any luck yet with app headshake the cocaine in the producers luggage had proved to be only a small part of his stash twenty times as much had turned up in a vault in his broad beach home sparking the interest of men in suits another task force milo had groaned leah said the circus is in town she found out soon after that the federal government had been looking into apps dealings for a while believing the advent group and its subsidiary businesses including enterprise insurance to be major conduits for money laundering milod filled in the details yesterday over coffee and crullers as we waited outside leah schwartzs office while she finished a phone conversation with her boss how long have they suspected him i said long time so why didnt they move on him hey he said its the government they could give a shit about crime control what theyre into is getting precise appraisal of his holdings so they can confiscate everything under the rico statutes better racket than parking meters so what happens now he weasels out on karen so they can line their coffers that assumes theres something to weasel out on alex thank god for the dope because karens death is still not a homicide what about the bones no evidence of foul play all the neck bones we found were intact and what graydonjones described to you at the pit was an accidental od hes credible when he told you he was holding all the cards no reason to lie fact is attempted murder on you and lucys a lot more trouble for him than karen but we cant tie that in with app it doesnt make sense i said if karen had died accidentally they could have left her on the grounds for someone else to discover some bad publicity but by then ods were no big deal every week another rock star was collapsing there would have been nothing to connect the body to them no need to pay anyone off i dont buy it milo were talking nasty guys partying with a naive young woman graydonjones said she was a virgin friday night but not saturday he and app gave her drugs and it got out of hand maybe but with the bone fragments weve managed to pull up youll never prove it it is definitely her by the way we found enough teeth to match got confirmation from the odontologist this morning have you told sherrell yet yeah i went over in person early this morning to his food bank howd he take it like it had just been a matter of time then he thanked me and went back to unpacking ricearoni poor guy i called his son this morning he started sobbing then hung up he ran his hand over his face if it ever goes to trial i said app and graydonjones will make her sound like a whore it probably wont alex with everything else going on an accidental od wont prioritize what about two bona fide homicides mellors and felix barnard he took a bite of cruller and wiped his lips i could hear leah schwartzs voice through her office door rising in pitch same problem said milo without some sort of evidentiary chain linking mellors and barnard to karen all weve got are two unrelated shootings only link to app is he owned the motel and half of the insurance company that graydonjones runs so far neither of them are talking why not make them think youve got more than you do then try to wedge them apart i said after a year dealing with shwandt and his girls they should be nondairy creamer for you leah schwartz came out of her office flushed and hoteyed the three of us walked out into the hall politicians she said they should all be drawn and quartered weve got a couple of days to turn something up or the best girls case goes to the bottom of the list meaning no indictments and the dea gets to play supermarket sweep milo said couple of days we talking to the hour i can probably wangle fifty hours if we get on some kind of track well he got up and stretched rome was built in two days right she laughed up to then id never seen her smile we were fifteen hours into that edict now graydonjones still had his hand cupped over his lawyers ear he was in jail blues that nearly matched the hue of the attorneys suit the lawyer was a lanky prematurely whitehaired handball player named jeff stratton everyone knew about the handball because each time he showed up at amhe announced hed just gotten off the courts and pulled some kind of injury he pushed his chair away from graydonjones and waved a finger ready a microphone on our side of the mirror amplified his voice leah schwartz put the bug back in her ear she and milo went in and sat around the table facing stratton and graydonjones i turned on my hand mike leah schwartz said so jeff well hear what you have to say said stratton but we wont respond it had taken an hour to get that far leah said detective sturgis milo said mr graydonjones from your résumé you seem like an intelligent guy hold on said stratton amiably is this going to get personal leah said of course jeff doesnt it always she looked at her watch listen im really pressed if we cant plow through this quickly lets just forget it and well let your client take his chance with not knowing whats going on until pretrial discovery mellow out lee said stratton every white hair was in place flowing over his ears his tie was printed with golf clubs he wore a wrist bandage no need for sarcasm or egregious vituperativeness leah looked at milo try to watch your vituperativeness detective for all our sakes milo frowned at her go on she said impatiently stratton smiled graydonjones maintained a deerintheheadlights expression okay said milo placing both hands on the table they covered a good part of it stratton tried not to stare at them okay mr um graydonjones like i said youve got an impressive résumé people in the know say youre a real insurance demon so were a little puzzled as to why you keep letting curtis app call the shots graydonjones glanced at stratton stratton shook his head graydonjones said nothing leah looked at her watch graydonjones looked up at the ceiling i said go for it into the mike milo said hes blaming everything on you friend including the drugs he says youre the one got him into dope you were a big user during the seventies you corrupted him he also says it was your idea to launder dope through advent and enterprise and that you interfaced with narcotics dealers in england and france and holland and sold them insurance policies that helped them organize their money laundering bloody lies said graydonjones that was just a contract like any other i had no idea who they were curt sent them stratton touched his hand and he stopped talking milo said im just telling you what app says he also claims he had nothing to do with karen bests death that he wasnt even present when she died and that you and terry trafficant and joachim spretzel strangled her oh bloody bullshit spretzel was a faggot and trafficant wasnt even another touch from stratton trafficant wasnt even there said milo no answer okay let me finish apps story he and the three of you were partying with karen he left to urinate and when he came back she was dead in your arms and the rest of you confessed to killing her he says hold on pulling a piece of paper out of his pocket he held it out of everyones view um um um here we go he says the only reason he got involved in covering up her death was that he was worried someone had seen karen with him and that you threatened to expose his drug usage to his wife and to tell her hed been fooling around with karen and some other young girls he panicked because hed been doping and drinking and thought hed be criminally liable and when m bayard lowell and denton mellors came in shortly after unexpectedly and lowell said karen should be buried and forgotten about he went along with it hes willing to pleabargain to aiding and abetting and a suspended sentence in exchange for testifying against you in karen bests homicide hes also willing to trade information on your drug peddling in return for reduction of his drug charges he put the paper back in his pocket graydonjones said bullshit he never said any of that call his lawyer said milo to stratton see if he takes your call stratton said maybe i will leah looked at her watch bloody lies said graydonjones i have to say apps story makes sense mr graydonjones said leah you were the one who drove up to sanctum with all those tools and garbage bags you were the one who attempted to murder three people so they wouldnt excavate karen bests grave if you had nothing to hide about karen best why risk all that because curt told me stratton said my client has nothing further to say i whispered let it ride milo yawned leah crossed her legs graydonjones shook his head suddenly he laughed all on me lovely lovely so what now counselor do i defend myself or keep that low profile and allow these arseholes to railroad me stratton said i need to conference with my client leah looked at her watch and clucked last one she said collecting her things five minutes later she and milo were back in the room stratton nodded at graydonjones graydonjones was looking at leah not him stratton said chris graydonjones said first off its all bloody lies i didnt strangle her no one did weve got bones said milo cervical vertebrae that show evidence of i dont care what the fuck youve got no one strangled her no one she was hit he hit her in the jaw demonstrating an uppercut in the bloody jaw he said who hit her said milo curt curt why because she wouldnt put out he wanted her and she wouldnt so he slammed her under her jaw and she fell back and hit her head and then he did her then we couldnt wake her up i was there you wont find me making up stories and denying that we were partying the three of us which three curt me and her trafficant was entertaining his own fan club mellors was tagging after lowell as usual bloody sycophant what about spretzel i dont know i told you he was a faggot probably chasing boys ah said milo yes i was with her but i never hurt her i did nothing other than make a little time with her what kind of time said leah kissykissy gropegrope she was on my lap the old trousers rubadub i was the one she liked my mustache i had one back then and my accent she said it reminded her of mick jagger she would have put out for me it made curt jealous touching his mouth he spoke through his fingers he was used to tarts easy lays slip em the ludes and you can slip em anything else he always said she wasnt easy she was a virgin for gods sake to leah schwartz dont look at me like that you want the truth im giving it to you thats the way things were back then free love no viruses people doing their own thing ill take your word for it said leah inspecting her nails that inflamed him what were you doing back then she looked up from her nails and smiled going to school fourth grade graydonjones shut his mouth is that it said milo thats your story its the truth curt got all pissed because she wouldnt climb off my lap into his when he tried to put his tongue in her mouth she turned her head and said yuck just like that yuck like shed tasted something bad so he bopped her and she fell back it all happened in one second ill swear to it in court chris said stratton to leah i want it clear that my clients statement by no means represents a formal offer to testify leah shrugged milo leaned forward so thats your story thats what my client just said said stratton then ill ask your client what i asked mr app this morning if you had nothing to do with killing karen why get involved in the coverup graydonjones chewed his lip his hands played with one another a full minute passed then another milo sat back leah looked at her watch and got up to milo win some lose some graydonjones said i did it because curt supported me supported you how said leah emotionally financially the day before that bloody party he promised to buy six of my sculptures and to commission a huge atrium piece for his insurance company i was a bleeding pauper i hadnt sold anything since arriving from england if you were an artist youd understand curt offered to open up a whole new area of opportunity for me i thought he was a true patron it wasnt as if he intended to kill her she blew him off and he hit her one of those stupid things and nothing i did would bring her back i figured why should he be ruined because of something stupid like that you did it for a job said milo not a job graydonjoness voice was strangled a career leah looked at milo im sorry sir thats a little hard to believe id never go to court with that but its true dropping his head all right all right there was one more thing though its no big issue whats that said leah the dope the quaaludes he gave her they were mine prescription for nerves i was working mad hours at the foundry my biorhythms were off bull i said into the mike just for sleep huh said milo smiling and shaking his head graydonjones flinched all right for sex too the chicks loved it no big crime as i said i had a prescription and you shared your prescription drugs with karen she didnt protest she wanted to try wanted to try everything except doing curt god he was pissed after he hit her i said what the bloody hell did you do that for and he said dont get all righteous with me and started to unzip his trousers then he when she didnt wake up i panicked tried to leave he said youve got a problem chris she was in your lap when it happened you were holding her she was stoned on your dope telling me if she was found theyd learn she was on ludes and it could be traced to me he said as far as the law was concerned i was every bit as guilty as he and you believed that said leah i didnt know american law i was a fucking starving limey just off the boat did you consult an attorney right said graydonjones and expose the whole thing we buried her for gods sake it was over i said to the mike ask him why he stopped sculpting milo said howd you get from art to the business world curt offered me a job at enterprise get paid to learn as marlon brando would say an offer too good to refuse he also offered you sculpting commissions why didnt you take them graydonjones looked away stratton said i fail to see what it all goes to the heart of the matter jeff said leah namely your clients credibility graydonjones said something unintelligible whats that said leah i lost interest in what art all the pretentiousness the bullshit business is the ultimate art talking fast to conceal the real reason hed blocked and app had been ready to exploit it just as he had with lowell one night of deception rewarded by twenty years of comfort and status success the ultimate dope just as it was for gwen and tom shea uneasy alliances held together by sin and guilt it had taken a dream to blow them down graydonjones was talking to leahs stoic face dont you see curt reversed the entire bloody thing in order to shaft me all i did was furnish the ludes he hit her take a closer look at those bones youll find something on her jaw believe me i was there hes the killer not me hes killed other people hold on said stratton sharply ive got to prove myself jeff just hold on chris to us another conference please and make sure there are no open mikes anywhere leah said i cant promise ill be here when youre finished she and milo came out as stratton turned his back on the mirror and directed graydonjones to do the same time for the little girls room she left milo chewed two wads of gum and tried to blow bubbles i counted my fingers several dozen times from the other side of the glass stratton waved and mouthed come back in milo switched on the mike and entered the room wheres lee said stratton come on this isnt some shoplifting case milo shrugged maybe shes powdering her nose she didnt tell me how professional stratton looked at his own watch well give her a minute big of him i said to his ear bug milo smiled leah returned i crooked a thumb toward the glass strattons getting antsy id keep working the time bit she grinned at me i need your little voice in my ear to tell me how to do my job no seriously its been useful we should probably do more inhouse shrinking on the big cases problem is youd probably charge too much and most of the other das would feel threatened pressing freshly glossed lips together she asked lucy still holding up holding up fine i just hope you crack him like an egg said leah over easy she fluffed her hair then she stepped into the interrogation room stratton said hey lee for a minute i thought youd given it all up for a life of joyful abandon okay lets finish up she said if you have something to say mr graydonjones out with it otherwise well just work with what weve got stratton said before we go any further id like some definite quid pro quo puleeze you dont care about getting the big fish lee this case jeff they all seem pretty big graydonjones cursed under his breath whats that sir said leah silence you have a comment mr graydonjones feel free to make it glance at her watch stratton said my clients willing to offer you information that could clear up two additional homicides bona fide homicides not involuntary manslaughter which is the most youll get out of the best girl and you know it you dont want to hear about it fine shrug well hear jeff what we wont do is put a price tag on the merchandise until weve had a chance to examine it believe me said stratton this is good leah smiled i always believe defense attorneys milo said my mortgage is assumable my porsche is paid for and the checks in the mail stratton shot him a hard look leahs smile got wider and she put her hand over it another peek at her watch even though id suggested it i found it an annoying mannerism she sighed and got up stratton said fine listen and evaluate im sure youre smart enough to see it for what it is leah said thats me ms smart and clasped her briefcase she sat down graydonjones looked at stratton the way a baby looks at its mother just after it receives its first shot stratton said give me a commitment that if the informations good youll go to bat for my client going to bat for your clients your job jeff if mr graydonjoness information proves useful it will be taken very seriously even in this day and age we like to clear bona fide homicides its more than useful said stratton believe me but i think its important you realize the scope of what were talking about qualitatively the information mr graydonjones is in possession of in addition to being revelatory is fourplus exculpatory of whom mr graydonjones what he has to tell you goes to the crux of the matter and relates to karen best as well motivation two homicides that are the conceptual fruit of the karen best incident and point a strong finger at original guilt in karen bests death what were talking about is the fact that someone else and not mr graydonjones undertook to further these two denton mellors aka darnel mullins and felix barnard said milo in a bored voice graydonjoness eyes bugged stratton blinked very fast yeah we know about those counselor said milo old curt lays that on you too chris oh no said graydonjones holding out his hands as if scooping air oh bloody fuck no no no this is no bloody way bullshit i can prove i was out of town the day denny shot the private eye curt paid him thirty thousand dollars to do it recorded it as payment for a screenplay denny never wrote thirty grand he showed me the money mellors showed it to you said milo no no curt he showed it to me and told me what it was for said denny was more than happy to do it denny was a closet thug always had been where did this conversation take place said milo at his house in malibu no no his other one bel air he used to have a place on st cloud now hes in holmby hills on baroda was anyone else present during this conversation of course not he invited me for lunch out by the pool his fucking terriers pissing all over then he pulls out an envelope and shows me the money has me count it and tells me about some private eye asking around about karen hed been paying him off for a year putting him on the books to cover it and giving him odd jobs now the bastard has gotten greedy and wants more so he can buy a house somewhere so now denny is going to kill him at some motel curt owns he owns all sorts of things hes all over like an octopus why did he tell you this so id be part of it just as hed made me part of karens murd death and to frighten me it worked believe me scared the shit out of me i caught the first plane out of the country back to england thats how i can prove i wasnt there when it happened i have my old passport look at the date on the bleeding thing and compare it to the date of barnards murder how long did you stay away said milo two weeks whered you go to my mothers in manchester curt found me sent me a newspaper clipping about barnards murder then he had denny killed a few months later by whom i dont know then how do you know app was behind it because he sent me another clipping on denny clear warning hes a monster bestowing favors then yanking them away sounds like he kept bestowing them on you said milo career and all that yes but i never knew why never knew if it would end i knew i couldnt escape him so i stayed put kept my mouth shut did my job earned every bleeding penny of that salary but now i see why he really kept me around whys that isnt it obvious as a scapegoat if things ever came to light hed have someone to dump it all on scapegoat said milo it was you drove up there in that van with a hacksaw and plastic bags graydonjones froze then his body tilted toward milo stratton reached out to restrain him graydonjones waved him off you dont understand he said twentyone years ive lived in terror of the man thats why i did the things i did i was scared thirty hours left on the clock wed had dim sum at a barnlike place on hill street and it hadnt settled well i sat alone in that same observation room no one had cleaned the glass since graydonjoness session and it was fogged with a distillation of sweat and fear curtis apps counsel was an older man named macilhenny fat and slovenly with the eyes of a sleepy snake and a customtailored gray suit that looked cheap on him hed managed to get app out of jail clothes despite the white cashmere vneck and the black swiss cotton shirt the producer looked weak and insubstantial just a few days in jail had wiped out years of malibu tan leah was inside with them along with her boss a grim deputy da named stan bleichert macilhenny grunted and app lifted a piece of paper and began to read my name is curtis roger app and i am about to offer into the record a statement prepared by myself under no duress or coercion under the guidance of my attorney landis j macilhenny esquire of the law firm of macilhenny bellows caville and shrier mr macilhenny is present with me for moral support during these trying times he cleared his throat flirted briefly with the camera for a moment i thought hed call for the makeup girl he said i am not nor have i ever been a murderer nor do i condone the act of murder however i am in possession of information that came my way by means of no criminal activity on my part that if pursued competently could lead to the criminal prosecution of another individual andor individuals for violation of california state penal code firstdegree murder i am willing to offer such information in return for compassionate consideration of my current status including immediate release from prison under reasonable bail to my family and loved ones and in return for reduction of present and pending charges folding the paper looking up bleichert addressed macilhenny okay its on the record now lets talk reality sure said macilhenny his voice was a bullfrog croak and his eyebrows tangoed when he talked reality is mr app is a prominent member of the business community and theres no rational reason to confine him hes a flight risk land he was apprehended just about to board a helicopter with a connecting flight to tsk tsk said macilhenny very gently not apprehended surprised at that point in time mr app was aware of no criminal investigation of any sort surely youre not saying that absent such information he wasnt free to travel at will like any other united states citizen with his money hes a flight risk land macilhenny patted his melon paunch so youre saying that mr apps wealth allows you to discriminate against him im saying hes a flight risk land bleicherts face was round and grim and pinched and he had a fiveoclock shadow his navy suit really was cheap well harumphed macilhenny well pursue that with the appropriate authorities be my guest macilhenny turned to leah hello young lady ucla class of around five years ago six i lectured to your class admissibility of evidence you sat right up in front wore blue jeans leah smiled bleichert said were all impressed with the mr memory bit land now is your client going to poop or get off the pot macilhenny put one hand to his mouth in mock horror the other shielded leahs eyes tsk tsk my client is willing to read a prepared statement no questioning not at this time thats not very forthcoming thats reality bleichert looked at leah nothing visible passed between them he said read at your own risk release on bail special holding at lompoc thats still prison its a country club no said macilhenny my client already belongs to a country club he knows the difference leah said with everything your clients charged with hes lucky to see fresh air and why should we bargain with him when hes already lied to us trying to palm off karen best on trafficant we know from other sources that trafficant had no involvement in that tsk tsk said macilhenny there are sources and there are sources through it all app sat looking bored the inanimate calm of the true psychopath bleichert said transfer to lompoc and thats it its quite a story said macilhenny firstrate drama sell it to the movies macilhenny smiled and pointed a finger at app app smiled and took out another paper after clearing his throat he began i became acquainted with the writerartist morris bayard lowell hereafter to be referred to as lowell or buck at a party in new york in the summer of the party i believe to have been at the greenwich village townhouse of mason upstone editor of the manhattan book review though i cant be sure lowell and i struck up a conversation during which i told him i greatly admired his work subsequent to that lowell and i began a friendly relationship that culminated in my optioning a book of his a collection of poems entitled command shed the light for development as a motion picture in addition to the advance payment for this option i advanced him money to purchase land in topanga canyon to develop a personal residence and to build an artists and writers retreat he called sanctum i did these things because even though lowell had experienced a long hiatus in creative output his previous accomplishments in literature and art led me to believe he would regain his creative powers and resume his place as a major american writer sniff he touched his nose unfortunately this was not to happen command shed the light received highly excoriative reviews and was a commercial failure rattling the paper as part of my relationship with lowell i also became acquainted with various artists and writers among these was a british sculptor christopher graydonjones whom i aided in attaining employment in an insurance company in which i am a substantial shareholder and whom i believed at the time to be a major talent and of excellent personal character likewise a writer denton mellors whose true name i have since learned was darnel mullins an africanamerican novelist for whom i found employment in the business affairs office of my motion picture production company and when he proved to lack skills in that area as a manager of several motor inns that i own throat clearing i might add that i am also a substantial contributor to the united negro college fund macilhenny arched an eyebrow and handed him a glass of water he drank and read another individual i met through lowell was a writer named terrence trafficant trafficant had spent time in prison and wrote about his experiences in a prison diary entitled from hunger to rage lowell took trafficant in as a protégé helped him get paroled and aided in getting the diary published it became a bestseller at lowells urging i read said book and optioned it for development into a motion picture advancing money to terrence trafficant staring at the camera as if trying to convince it of something sniff i was to find out subsequently that i had been defrauded by both mr lowell and mr trafficant in that command shed the light had been written not by mr lowell but by mr trafficant and passed off by mr lowell to the artistic and literary community and to the public at large as an original work i learned this in conversation with mr trafficant who showed me his original handwritten notes for the book and gave them to me for safekeeping in exchange for a sum of money i remain in possession of said notes and am willing to offer them as evidence in the prosecution of mr lowell for the murder of mr trafficant a crime i have personal knowledge of because mr lowell confessed it to me several days after the deed when i confronted him with the evidence of his plagiarism and fraud deep breath thats all i have to say at this time macilhenny smiled bleichert frowned leah said so you want to trade lowell for everything youve done app folded the paper all weve got on lowell said leah is your word for it and the notes said macilhenny if theyre authentic and even if they are all they prove is fraud on a dead victim so big deal a murdered victim i havent heard any evidence of murder except mr apps sayso would a body help depending on whose it is tsk tsk young lady lets not be coy bleichert said whose corpus land speaking theoretically lets say mr trafficants where is it macilhenny smiled and shook his head withholding information on a homicide case land macilhenny looked down at his chest rolls his breasts were as big as a strippers i have no personal information stan all my conversations with mr app have remained on a strictly theoretical basis is this body theoretical too said leah macilhenny winked but ignored her im offering you a gift stan wrapped and ribboned this could be your biggest case internationally acclaimed author major fraud plagiarism bloodshed were talking time magazine cover and you write the true crime book leah said as opposed to your client the piker with multiple homicides and enough dope to stuff half the noses in hollywood my client never won the pulitzer your client murdered more than one person tsk tsk macilhenny laughed softly slander and libel wheres your proof ive got eyewitness testimony tainted witness long history of drug abuse and your own case against him for attempted murder gives him an obvious motive to lie his word against my clients biggest case of the year said leah does mr app get to buy the film option macilhenny gave her a pitying look mr app will no longer be engaged in the motion picture business when the dust clears mr app will be retiring when the dust clears she said i see dust storms on the horizon tornadoes macilhenny turned away from her and back to bleichert app remained silent and motionless youre offering squat land said bleichert on the contrary im offering you fame and fortune and the chance to put an icon on trial in return for dropping all charges on a couple of diddly cases you dont stand a chance of proving if you think were so weak why bargain macilhenny pulled shirt fabric out of a fold of flesh in the interests of justice and efficiency mr app is no youngster every day spent away from hearth and home wears on him severely he recognizes he has certain personal problems due to chemical dependency he is willing to undergo medical and psychiatric treatment for these problems as well as to offer his considerable talents to the community in exchange for no jail time beyond whats been served and no fullcourt attempt to employ the confiscatory powers of the rico statutes betty ford and community service for multiple murder and dope laundering said leah when do you take this act to vegas bleichert said nothing she tried not to look at him but failed macilhenny was looking at him too there has to be some time served said bleichert but i can conceive of its being at lompoc or somewhere like that as far as rico you know thats not our bailiwick ive already talked to the dea stan and theyre willing to go along with partial confiscation in return for some valuable information about foreign narcotics commerce currently in my clients possession the hangups these alleged homicides they dont want to be put in an awkward position like going easy on a multiple murderer said leah bleichert raised an eyebrow at her she crossed her legs and looked away macilhenny allowed himself a tiny smile bleichert said some jail time i mean it land macilhenny glanced at app i suppose we can live with that at a federal facility protective custody so what happens on mellors and barnard said leah looking at macilhenny but adressing bleichert talk about being in an awkward position especially when lowells case hits the fan well never be able to keep it quiet the minute his attorney finds out about the deal and squawks well come across softer on crime than the aclu tsk tsk shes got a point said bleichert come on stan said macilhenny what kind of crime are we talking about a scumbag private eye blackmailer and the scumbag motel manager who killed him weigh that against the chance to try lowell afroamerican scumbag motel manager said leah trading black life for white life cant you just see the naacp having fun with that and lets not forget lowells victim was no choirboy either is anyone going to care what an old man did twenty years ago theres a substantial difference young lady sure someone elses clientll be facing the heat bleichert chewed his lip app looked at him first interest hed shown in the proceedings bleichert said i hear everything youre saying land but she raises a valid consideration talking about leah as if she wasnt there macilhenny thought for a while there could be other evidence stan theoretically like what audiotapes terrence trafficant telling his story leah said theoretical she looked disgusted macilhenny shrugged pounds of flesh shivered its been a long time memories fade clean out an attic no telling what youll find malibu attic said leah or the one in holmby hills heres my offer said bleichert take it or leave it mr app confesses to his involvement in karen best felix barnard and denton mellors involuntary manslaughter on best conspiracysecond on barnard because mellors was the shooter and straight second degree on mellors all sentences to run concurrently if we avoid a trial stan stan hold on land if we avoid a trial and if lowell is convicted of first degree because of information provided by mr app mr apps sentences are suspended leahs huge eyes were hot skillets macilhenny pretended to deliberate just one thing stan said leah by all accounts barnard was premeditated we could go for conspiracy one and by the same token straight one on bleichert shushed her with a short angry hand movement macilhenny said what do you mean by confession written sworn all the details no evasion of questions full acknowledgment of complicity like in church said app softly macilhennys eyebrows sank what about the dope if you can work it out with the feds total walk said bleichert but only if he admits guilt in writing and only if his information leads directly to lowells conviction and no ownrecognizance he stays put what i said before about lompoc stands and ill grant you the protective custody hell ill put him on a cellblock with exsenators leah cracked her knuckles bleichert said why dont you go get all the files lee so we know what to ask mr app she stomped out of the room and walked right past me just as the door to the hall slammed macilhenny said pretty girl app and macilhenny conferred with the sound off and app started dictating to the lawyer during the break bleichert returned to his office and leah schwartz to hers before she left she said going to wait here till milo gets here well be careful hang around here too long youll need to be disinfected she slammed the door and app heard it through the glass and jumped his fear had always been there hiding just beneath the cashmere macilhenny patted his shoulder and app resumed dictating twenty minutes later milo still hadnt come back from accompanying lucy and i wondered why a half hour after that macilhenny stopped writing bleichert ran his finger down the center of the page speedreading then a slower perusal he put it down it says nothing in here about who shot mr mellors a guy named jeffries said app as if it didnt matter leopold jeffries he got killed himself five years ago check the police files what did you have to do with mr jeffriess death app smiled nothing at all the police shot him in the middle of a robbery leopold earl jeffries check it out calm again bleichert read the confession again this is okay for a start putting it in his pocket now fill me in on trafficant app looked at macilhenny the fat lawyer sucked his cheeks there are tapes said app at my house in lake arrowhead feel free to get them without a warrant theyre in the basement behind one of the refrigerators one of them said bleichert writing i have two basement refrigerators at arrowhead for parties two subzeros behind the one on the right is a wall safe the tapes are in there ill get you the combination theyve got terry trafficant telling me everything i taped him because i thought one day it might be historically significant terry got fed up with lowells manipulation and looked to me as someone he could trust i paid him every penny of his option money i also paid him for a screenplay he did every penny in return for all his future royalties said leah that too said app he got the better end of the deal i havent earned a thing in years what kind of screenplay said bleichert not really a full script just a summary of some horror flick friday the thirteenth type of thing women getting chopped up by a maniac title the bride the treatment id read trafficants title stolen from a dead mans novel for the petty thrill the allure of crime had never left him i thought app was saying with a few changes more character arc it had potential if terry hadnt disappeared i probably would have produced it hooray for hollywood said bleichert so far i dont know much more than when i came in app wore a meditative look macilhenny handed his client water and app sipped delicately putting the glass down he said the key to all of it is lowells creative block he went into a massive block years ago thirty years ago just couldnt break out of it maybe because of his drinking or maybe hed just said all he had to say but trafficant didnt know that he spent most of his youth in prison found lowells old stuff and read it had no idea what was going on in the outside world then he ended up in some sort of creative writing program the prison was experimenting with and got the idea he could write so he wrote to lowell stroked lowells ego the two of them started a correspondence trafficant started writing poems and keeping a diary he sent it to lowell lowell was impressed and started working for trafficants parole pausing thats the part the public knows the truth is lowell and trafficant cut a deal back when trafficant was still in prison lowell hatched the whole thing telling trafficant poetry was a financial loser in the book business it was almost impossible to get published except for a few famous poets like him lowell promised to agitate until trafficant got early parole meanwhile hed also be editing trafficants poems then submit them for publication under his own name trafficant would get the money and lowell would also get the diary published under trafficants name and trafficant went along with this what did he have to bargain with a loser behind bars lowell was offering him freedom lots of money possible fame if the diary hit big so he wouldnt get credit for the poems he could live with that he was a con used to deals how much money did lowell get for the poems a hundred and fifty thousand advance against royalties lowell took fifty for himself lowells agent got fifteen the retreat sanctum was started as a way to transfer the rest of the eightyfive thou to trafficant sounds like you were in on it from the beginning said bleichert i helped finance the retreat because i believed in lowell idealism thats right bleichert said to macilhenny so far the tone of this is very selfserving macilhenny said be frank curt this old nose tells me theyre operating in good faith app hesitated macilhenny patted him all right the producer said i used the retreat too to launder money nothing big some friends of mine kids people in the industry were bringing marijuana up from mexico we didnt consider it really a drug back then everyone smoked he picked something out of his sweater bleichert moved his head impatiently i hope theres more plenty said app lowell was hoping the poems he stole from trafficant would put him back in the spotlight they did but in the wrong way all the critics hated them and the book bombed meanwhile trafficants book became a fu a bestseller he chuckled wanting everyone else to join in no one did i remembered the enraged letter trafficant had written to the village voice in support of lowell mustering the only real passion a psychopath can ever develop selfdefense what made lowell think trafficant would keep quiet about the deal lowell was desperate and naive most arty types are ive dealt with them for thirty years take my word for it and the fact that the book failed protected lowell why would trafficant want to claim authorship of a turkey especially with his other book doing so well but lowell wasnt even thinking in those terms at the beginning he was obsessed with his place in history freaking out that his reputation was rotting he used to sit in that cabin on his property all day trying to produce but nothing came he kept drinking and doping to forget and it only made matters worse howd the failure of the poetry book affect him he drank himself unconscious then came out of it saying it was terrys work anyway terry had no talent was just a slick criminal whod taken advantage of him meanwhile terrys doing interviews with the new york times and selling a thousand books a week lowell stopped talking to him and terry knew it was only a matter of time before hed be leaving sanctum thats when he transferred his royalties to me for safekeeping for all his tough talk he was still a con had no idea how to cope with the world so he came to me and you taped him for his protection bleichert grunted irony said app its the key to a good story line lowells name on that book of poems was supposed to buy success but it didnt trafficant became the darling of the literary set you could package it as a comedy and sell it to cable bleichert said so trafficant spilled his guts to you because he was worried about making it in the outside world that and he wanted to talk cons always do no selfcontrol never met one yet who could keep a secret know lots of cons do you app folded his hands across his sweater i meet all sorts of people i still havent heard any details about murder said bleichert app smiled lowell killed terry two days after the best girls accident things finally came to a head because lowell was shaken up by what had happened ready to close down the retreat and still pissed at terry he ordered terry off the premises terry cursed him out and threatened to go public with the whole book scam when terry turned his back lowell hit him on the head with a whisky bottle kept hitting him then he panicked called me blubbering i went over and we buried trafficant clapping his hands once and with that said bleichert you were able to buy lowells secrecy on karen best forever keeping quiet about that was in lowells interest too his reputation was lousy enough without someone dying at his party wheres trafficant buried right underneath lowells writing cabin inspiration he called it thats where he killed him the floor was dirt they just dug down whos they lowell denny mellors chris graydonjones why mellors he was a weeny and id say that if he was white he hated being black as a matter of fact denied it he thought if he just kept writing and kissing ass hed be rich and famous anyway thats where terry is i dont know if the cabins still standing but i can find the spot right near the pond not far from karen best said bleichert app didnt answer any other bodies we should know about not to my knowledge youd have to ask lowell hes the creative one did you know that he published his first book while in college everyone told him he was a genius fatal error what was believing his own reviews now can we get the ball rolling on transferring me to a decent place so youve been collecting mr trafficants royalties all these years after the first few years it was chicken feed nothings come in for the last five how much chicken feed id have to check probably not more than a hundred and fifty thousand all told and mr trafficants advance payment for his book seven thousand dollars he blew it all in a crap game the same day he cashed the check thats why he was so uptight when lowell threatened to kick him out here he was a bestseller eightyfive gs dropped in his bank account and he had no idea how to handle it now can you get me to a decent place well work on it mr app meantime can i have my own food brought in the crap here is loaded with fat and grease i have my own chef he could bleichert reread the confession and his notes of apps recitation the door from the hallway opened and a stocky black jail deputy came into the observation room da bleichert he said scanning my consultants badge i pointed at the glass they in the middle of something just finishing up he looked through the oneway bleichert was still reading app and macilhenny sat in silence hmm said the deputy then he knocked yeah said bleichert annoyed the deputy went in sorry to bother you sir but ive got an urgent message bleichert was annoyed from who im busy a detective sturgis what does he want he said to tell you in private sir okay hold on to macilhenny and app one sec he came out of the room closed the door and tapped his foot okay whats so damned urgent the deputy looked at me bleichert walked to a far corner well away from me the deputy followed and whispered something in his ear as he listened bleicherts sour face lightened ill be damned everything okay with lucy i said bleichert ignored me to the deputy youre sure thats what the man said how long ago hour or so and this is definitely confirmed thats what he said sir well ill be damnedunreal goddammit okay thanks the deputy left and bleichert stood thinking then he returned to the interrogation room so said app can we start the paperwork sure said bleichert weve got lots of paperwork big smile app said i eat a highcarbohydrate lowfat diet good for you hard voice macilhenny said stan bleichert opened his jacket and hooked his thumbs in his belt loops bit of a new development gentlemen ive just been informed that mr lowell passed away this afternoon massive stroke so all deals are null and void and well be filing that confession as evidence against mr app app went white as his sweater macilhenny shoved his bulk out of the chair charged forward waving his hands as if warding off hornets now see here bleichert whistled and collected his papers this is unconscionab not at all land we negotiated in good faith you yourself said so no accounting for acts of god guess god didnt approve of the deal macilhenny tottered with rage now you just no you just land all bets are off and this stays on the record waving the confession always put it in writing said bleichert grinning i learned that watching the peoples court no funeral cremation took place at the morticians college across the street from the county morgue the ashes sat on a shelf until ken came forward and picked up the urn he asked lucy if she wanted to accompany him when he tossed it off the malibu pier she said shed pass she was experiencing a grief of sorts i guess he didnt have a good life she said the ocean was blue and lazy yesterday a sea lion had walked out of the surf ignoring spikes rage and begging for food before waddling back in today no signs of life on the beach not even birds no he didnt i said i guess i should feel sorry for him i wish i could feel something other than relief right now relief makes sense yes the way he spoke to me after his words graydonjoness gun seemed almost silly thats how i got the courage she stared at the water i suppose he was a prisoner as much as anyone fate biology whatever im a part of him genetically that troubles you i suppose im worried some of him is in me if i ever have kids if you ever have kids theyll be great how can you be so sure because youre a kind caring person he elevated selfishness to an art form lucy no one would ever accuse you of being selfish you almost lost your life because youre not selfish whatever so i guess its over my acquiescent smile was a lie her mourning of puck had been cut short prematurely i still didnt understand why shed put her head in the oven still didnt know if the bogettes or anyone else were out to get her maybe with the dream out of her head we could find the missing pieces so she said touching her purse guess i really dont have anything to talk about right now tired very why dont you go home and catch up on your rest think i will only thing is ken wants to go places and i dont want to hurt his feelings what kinds of places palm springs san diego driving around hes a nice guy but but you want to be alone i said i dont want to reject him but this is terrible i know but sometimes hes cloying wanting too much too fast what should i do explain to him that you need some time alone he should understand yes she said he should milo called later that day thought id give you some bits and pieces lowells mercedes was left in the longterm lot at burbank airport so ms nova probably flew the coop cant blame her were lifting prints from the house tomorrow see if we can find out who she is we can live without her testimony but it wouldnt hurt to have it so we can add an assaultwithintenttokill to graydonjoness trouble we did locate doris reingold at her sons in tacoma police up there are watching her till she comes down next week and gwen sheas lawyer called to let us know tom phoned her from mexico hanging out with his buddy midlife crisis casting off responsibilities supposedly he begged gwen for forgiveness promised to fly back tomorrow all three of them are being treated as material witnesses no charges the major good news is that graydonjones is sticking to his guns on app asshole finally figured out you cant share a sleeping bag with a cobra apps lawyer is screaming and yelling trying to void apps confession the da says theres a betterthaneven chance itll be ruled admissible major good news number two is that the feds are finishing up their bookkeeping on mr a and hes got close to twenty mil in assets that can be snatched so all in all hes in trouble still in prison languishing no pesto and arugula oh sure and for dessert they can move him into general pop find him a fourhundredpound roommate named bubba see what cooks up then the next day i received a package from englewood new jersey inside was a blue binder containing two hundred neatly typed photocopied pages taped to the front cover was a piece of white stationery with winston mullins md on the letterhead a handwritten note read this is darnels book hope you like it wm i read half clunky in places but talent and grace shone through in others the story line a young man half white half black makes his way through the academic and literary worlds trying to define his identity through a series of jobs and sexual dalliances expletives but no violence the bride in question art i put the binder down and called lucy no one home she probably hadnt the heart to disappoint ken or maybe shed held her resolve and had gone away for some solitude either way id wait we had our work laid out for us that evening as i was playing guitar and waiting for robin and spike to come home my service called in with an emergency message from wendy embrey now what dr delaware sure put her on click hello hello wendy hows lucretia fine but youve seen her recently yesterday this may be nothing but i just got off the phone with a woman i think you should talk to i know there are two sides to every story especially with this kind of thing but after listening to what she said i strongly advise you to call her whos the woman she told me i reached her through her father hes the head of the real estate company i was trying to collect not important anyway i gave her your name said you might call just in case i cant reach her give me a summary of what she told you she did which might explain a few things yes i said feeling cold it might i hung up and punched numbers frantically then i scrawled a note to robin and ran out to the seville lights shone from the second story of the house on rockingham avenue kens taurus was in the driveway but no one answered the bell i ran around to the side gate locked i climbed over he was out on the terrace slumped in a chair head down half a vodka bottle on the table along with a glass full of melting ice when i got ten feet away he looked up groggily then as if a button had been pushed he sat up mechanically doctor evening ken he looked at the bottle and pushed it away little nightcap evening cap his voice wasnt slurred but the words were coming out too carefully his hair was mussed his glen plaid buttondown shirt wrinkled to what do i owe the pleasure just dropped by to see how lucys doing oh shes not here where is she dunno out out driving yeah i guess he sat up straighter tried to fingercomb his hair any idea when shell be back nope sorry ill be sure to tell her you stopped by everything okay well i said sitting im not sure thats why im here he moved his chair back the wrought iron grated on the flagstone he looked up at the second story youre sure shes not here ken of course his faced changed turning piggish suddenly his hand moved toward the bottle mine got there first and put it out of reach listen he said i dont know what this is about but im bushed doc all this crap weve been going through a guy deserves some r and r right we you and lucy exactly i dont know what your problem is but maybe youd better get out of here and come back when you have an appointment are you making her appointments now ken no she listen he stood and smoothed his pants and smiled i know lucy likes you but this is my place and i want some privacy so crooking a finger at the gate your place i said thought it was the companys thats right now i just spoke to your second exwife kelly she told me you havent worked for the company for over a year she told me the company belongs to her father and that since the divorce youve been persona non grata there thats why the companys insurance doesnt cover you thats why youve got an answering machine instead of a secretary she also told me you stole computer records and thats how you get addresses of places to crash along with lots of other things oh boy he said backing toward the doors to the house its a divorce case you believe her youre as stupid as she is i know i said there are two sides to every story but kelly says there are court records that document your drinking and your violence not just to her you beat up your first wife too and she says its also public record that you threatened your fatherinlaw and tried to run him down with your car that you put your older girl jessica in the hospital with a broken jaw an accident she he shook his head got in the way of what your fist same way kelly did when you ruptured her spleen all accidents ken as a matter of fact yes theyre all accidentprone runs in the family ken wheres lucy is she locked in her room because you convinced her she needed to be for her own safety he slumped gave me a helpless look then he grabbed the glass and threw it at me i ducked but there was no need he was way off get the hell off my property or what youll call the police lucys up there and im going to get her he spread his arms and blocked the door dont mess with me asshole you have no idea oh yes i do thats the point i know exactly what youre capable of after your fatherinlaw fired you you started flying down here not to get to know lucy and puck but to get rid of them so you could have total access to the trust fund lucys share of the interest is twelve thousand a year at a conservative five percent return that means a principal of almost a quarter million times four sibs is a million bucks you contacted puck first learned about his heroin habit and fed it learned from him about lucys sleep patterns and her daily routines the way she came home ate dinner and nodded off watching pbs with a glass of apple juice you started harassing her with hangup calls stole a key to her apartment from puck checked it out fooled with her underwear that was the fun part he cursed a few days later you let yourself in and put something in the juice something with shortterm effects she mentioned feeling drugged a couple of times after she went under you came back turned on the oven and stuck her head in then you played hero waiting long enough for the sedative to wear off calling the paramedics and driving her to the hospital adding the note and the rat shit a few days later just in case her anxiety level wasnt high enough the plan was to get her out of there and under your control and milo and i played into it perfectly though if we hadnt i imagine you would have found a way to volunteer instant family huh he pressed himself against the doors planting his feet fists clenching and unclenching sweating alcohol and his gingery cologne you couldnt kill her outright i said because two young sibs dying that close together all that money at stake might have tipped someone off like milo the key was to get close to lucy so you could choose the time and make it look like an accident poor sleepwalking girl takes a tumble down the stairs puck made it easy for you with his addiction he never went to new mexico by the time you made that call imitating his voice he was dead you didnt even have to be a good mimic embrey didnt know what he sounded like and when you called your father to tell him lucy had tried to commit suicide you spoke to his assistant but lucy couldnt stop worrying about puck so you went with her and discovered the body mr hero again puck never stood you up he showed for that appointment though ill bet it wasnt dinner it was a dope gift unusually strong stuff he was probably shooting up before you closed the door dead a few seconds later howm i doing so far okay he said fighting to sound cool i think youre a little confused but come on in well talk about it two sibs down one to go did jo really fall off that mountain or was that your maiden voyage in family planning he shook his head as if i were being silly then twisting the handle he hurled himself through the door and tried to slam it on me i pushed his weight worked in his favor but his middle was exposed through the door crack and i shot my fist forward and knocked the wind out of him my followup didnt land solidly because hed stumbled and fallen back forcing the door open i dove on top of him pinning him a woman behind me said get up you idiot or ill kill you stunned i obeyed ken came up swinging and i warded off his clumsy drunken blows turn around a slender form orangelit by a chandelier dimmed low holding an automatic a lot bigger than the one graydonjones had brought to the pit looking comfortable with it as she came closer stand still asshole said nova ken took a blind swing at my head i pushed his hand away and he fought to regain his balance nova said cut it out dont waste your energy he said goddamn asshole later clean yourself up look at you youre a mess he wiped his lip fix your shirt he stuffed it into his waistband she had clear authority the kind that imprints early the scars young for a face lift but not for patching old injuries clean yourself up she said take an upper then come back and give me a hand he complied big sis i said hi jo silence that same smug smile id seen at sanctum one pair against the other i said what are we talking about here going for the gold in sibling rivalry she chuckled you have no idea must have been tough i said daddy leaving your mother for their mother then she got so depressed she escaped to europe and left you behind with him of all people you and ken end up locked in a dinky little cabin while the other two get to stay in the big house free psychoanalysis she said sit down on that couch on your hands keep your butt on your hands such gratitude i saved your life gee thanks she laughed what have you done for me today meaning it a part of him genetically raising selfishness to an art form i thought of the way shed tended her father absorbing his sexual comments changing his diapers jocasta turning his oedipal joke against him secretly lowell so estranged from his own child that he didnt recognize her the scars remnants of the fall down the mountain new face nova new person anyone with you when you fell off that cliff no answer wouldnt have been ken would it he tends to damage women how can you be sure he didnt push you a toilet flushed ken came out of the guest bedroom with his hair slicked like a country kids on sunday nova said ill take care of him you get her shes out like a light ill have to carry her so he touched his lower back and grimaced do it he left and climbed the stairs i said hes really the walking wounded isnt he hes a dear the gun hadnt moved and she was just out of reach dangerous business being a member of your family then again thatll work to your advantage only two slices of the pie if you and he dont kill each other first she smiled i said yeah youre probably right you and kenny will find a nice quiet place get all cozy and give in to what youve been wanting to do for such a long time what you wanted to do to daddy changing diapers a poor substitute for the real thing isnt it cutie she was tough and she knew what i was doing but her eyes wavered for just a fraction of a second her grip on the gun must have loosened too because when i chopped down hard at her wrist she cried out and the weapon fell to the carpet she was a strong woman full of rage but there are few women who can handle even a small man physically thats part of rape and battering and a lot of the tension between the sexes this time it worked out for the best milo said cant talk long got a promising suspect on the copycats roofer who was working at the courthouse during the trial does he have a dog big surly mutt he said gleefully arent you glad you werent the poor clown who had to give him an enema howd you get on to him one of the bailiffs gave us the lead says the guy used to sit in on afternoon sessions doodle and write things down always had a weird feeling about him asshole lives in orange county and has a bunch of duis peeping toms and a fiveyearold attempted rape conviction santa ana says their first interview was encouraging im sitting in on the next one in half an hour so it had nothing to do with the bogettes not necessarily bailiff thinks he saw the asshole talking to some of the girls a couple of times shitbag denies any connection to them but his room was full of their press clippings and a videotape of a tv interview with the head harpy stasha plus sundry other toys that and the bailiffs sayso is enough for us to pull those hags in for questioning and sweat them bigtime were asking for a pretty inclusive warrant before we come knocking my bet is we find weapons and dope at that ranch should be able to put em away for something good luck either way i like this bastard for shannon and nicolette santa ana found a hoop earring that might have been nicolettes as well as receipts for three storage lockers in long beach be interesting to see what the scrote finds worth storing forensics still going over his place with their vacuum cleaners itll be awhile before all the fibers are analyzed anyway i wanted you to know appreciate it i can always use a little good news yeah something else we finally idd ms novas prints sorry to shatter your shrinks intuition but shes not the sister what the real jocasta lowell was printed when she was a student at berkeley busted at a demonstration and again after her body was shipped back from nepal so theres no doubt ken was there with her by the way so maybe he did push her off but our nasty girls a piece of work named julie beth claypool nude dancer druggie biker babe badcheck artist string of arrests back to when she was sixteen wrote poetry in stir ken met her in rehab couple of years ago love at first bite she pushes him around i said still in shock i wouldnt doubt it sfpd says shes been known to go for the whips and chains the scars i said god i missed the boat completely using the oedipal wedge to throw her off balance maybe i wanted her to flinch so badly i imagined it my heart was hurling itself against my chest wall id broken out in a cold sweat talk about operating on false premises i said whatd you tell her exactly that she wanted to screw ken the way shed wanted to screw daddy well he said sfpd says she comes from a real shitty family suspected incest brothers and dad back to when she was real little oh man the same old story in this case lucky for you yeah maybe i should buy a lottery ticket lucy said are peaches okay ive already got pears the woman next to her said put them in honey those old people the fruits good for them they were standing at one of a series of long tables piled high with groceries along with a dozen other people sorting canned goods and boxes of rice and beans and cereal the church of the outstretched hands hub was a rundown warehouse men and women of all ages and colors working side by side quietly and cheerfully putting together boxes for delivery and loading them into a couple of old pickups out in back there were other places like it all over the city newspapers especially those in the coldweather zones love to portray la as a balkanized smogblinded armed camp with no more substance than a sitcom and no more altruism than a politician its not any closer to the truth than a lot of the other stuff in the papers sherrell best was packing along with his parishioners distinguishable as the leader only because he had to break to take frequent phone calls he came over to us this is a wonderful person lucy blushed saint lucretia the kind of good shes created has to come from a beautiful soul dr delaware i know please said lucy placing a packet of cookies into the box wonderful said best can i steal the good doctor from you for a second lucy only if you bring him back he took me into a cubbyhole office and closed a particleboard door that didnt cut out much of the noise on the wall were some of the same type of biblical pictures hed had in his kitchen i just wanted to thank you for all youve done he said it was my pleas it was exceptional the way you stuck by her shes blessed to have met you and so am i he gave me a troubled look what is it reverend you know for a time i thought if i ever found what happened id take the law into my own hands the bible exhorts against revenge but it also permits the blood redeemer his due there were times i thought id do something terrible my faith was lacking tears filled his eyes i could have been a better father i could have given her money so she didnt need to stop i said putting a hand on his shoulder im no solomon but i know the difference between a good father and a bad one he cried some more softly then snapped out of it drying his eyes he took my hand in both of his how selfish of me so much work to be done always hunger i returned to the packing line lucys hands moved like a weavers at a loom she was trying to smile but her mouth wouldnt cooperate thanks for coming she said guess ill be seeing you at the beach tomorrow here too i said i think ill stick around for a while
