anne perry slaves of obsession we are invited to dine with mr and mrs alberton hester said in reply to monks questioning gaze across the breakfast table they are friends of callandras she was to go as well but has been called to scotland unexpectedly i suppose you would like to accept anyway he deduced watching her face he usually read her emotions quickly sometimes with startling accuracy at others misunderstanding entirely on this occasion he was correct yes i would callandra said they are charming and interesting and have a very beautiful home mrs alberton is half italian and apparently mr alberton has traveled quite a lot as well then i suppose we had better go short notice isnt it he said less than graciously it was short notice indeed but hester was not disposed to find unnecessary fault with something which promised to be interesting and possibly even the beginning of a new friendship she did not have many friends the nature of her work as a nurse had meant that her friendships were frequently of a fleeting nature she had not been involved with any gripping cause for quite some little time even monks cases while financially rewarding had over the last four months of spring and early summer been most uninteresting and he had not sought her assistance or in most of them her opinion she did not mind that robberies were tedious largely motivated by greed and she did not know the people concerned good she said with a smile folding up the letter i shall write back immediately saying that we shall be delighted his answering look was wry only very slightly sarcastic they arrived at the alberton house in tavistock square just before halfpast seven it was as callandra had said handsome although hester would not have thought it worth remarking on however she changed her mind as soon as they were in the hallway which was dominated by a curving staircase at the half turn of which was an enormous stainedglass window with the evening sun behind it it was truly beautiful and hester found herself staring at it when she should have been paying attention to the butler who had admitted them and watching where she was going the withdrawing room also was unusual there was less furniture in it than was customary and the colors were paler and warmer giving an illusion of light even though in fact the long windows which overlooked the garden faced the eastern sky the shadows were already lengthening although it would not be dark until after ten oclock at this time so shortly after midsummer hesters first impression of judith alberton was that she was an extraordinarily beautiful woman she was taller than average but with a slender neck and shoulders which made more apparent the lush curves of her figure and lent it a delicacy it might otherwise not have possessed her face when looked at more closely was totally wrong for conventional fashion her nose was straight and quite prominent her cheekbones very high her mouth too large and her chin definitely short her eyes were slanted and of a golden autumn shade the whole impression was both generous and passionate the longer one looked at her the lovelier she seemed hester liked her immediately how do you do judith said warmly i am so pleased you have come it was kind of you on so hasty an invitation but lady callandra spoke of you with such affection i did not wish to wait she smiled at monk her eyes lit with a flare of interest as she regarded his dark face with its lean bones and broadbridged nose but it was hester to whom she addressed her attention may i introduce my husband the man who came forward was pleasing rather than handsome far more ordinary than she was but his features were regular and there was both strength and charm in them how do you do mrs monk he said with a smile but when courtesy was met he turned immediately to monk behind her searching his countenance steadily for a moment before holding out his hand in welcome and then turning aside so the rest of the company could be introduced there were three other people in the room one was a man in his midforties his dark hair thinning a little hester noticed first his wide smile and spontaneous handshake he had a natural confidence as if he were sure enough of himself and his beliefs that he had no need to thrust them upon anyone else he was happy to listen to others it was a quality she could not help but like his name was robert casbolt and he was introduced not only as albertons business partner and friend since youth but also judiths cousin the other man present was american as one could hardly help being aware that country had in the last few months slipped tragically into a state of civil war there had not as yet been anything more serious than a few ugly skirmishes but open violence seemed increasingly probable with every fresh bulletin that arrived across the atlantic war seemed more and more likely mr breeland is from the union alberton said courteously but there was no warmth in his voice hester looked at breeland as she acknowledged the introduction he appeared to be in his early thirties tall and very straight with square shoulders and the upright stance of a soldier his features were regular his expression polite but severely controlled as if he felt he must be constantly on guard against any slip or relaxation of awareness the last person was the albertons daughter merrit she was about sixteen with all the charm the passion and the vulnerability of her years she was fairer than her mother and had not the beauty but she had a similar strength of will in her face and less ability to hide her emotions she allowed herself to be introduced politely enough but she did not make any attempt to pretend more than courtesy the preliminary conversation was on matters as simple as the weather the increase in traffic on the streets and the crowds drawn by a nearby exhibition hester wondered why callandra had thought she and monk might find these people congenial but perhaps she was merely fond of them and had discovered in them a kindness breeland and merrit moved a little apart talking earnestly monk casbolt and judith alberton discussed the latest play and hester fell into conversation with daniel alberton lady callandra told me you spent nearly two years out in the crimea he said with great interest he smiled apologetically i am not going to ask you the usual questions about miss nightingale you must find that tedious by now she was a very remarkable person hester said i could not criticize anyone for seeking to know more about her his smile widened you must have said that so many times you were prepared for it she found herself relaxing he was unexpectedly pleasant to converse with frankness was always so much easier than continued courtesy yes i admit i was it is unoriginal he finished for her yes perhaps what i wanted to say was unoriginal also but i shall say it anyway because i do want to know he frowned very slightly drawing his brows together his eyes were clear blue you must have exercised a great deal of courage out there both physical and moral especially when you were actually close to the battlefield you must have made decisions which altered other peoples lives perhaps saved them or lost them that was true she remembered with a jolt just how desperate it had been how remote it was from this quiet summer evening in an elegant london withdrawing room where the shade of a gown mattered the cut of a sleeve war disease shattered bodies the heat and flies or the terrible cold all could have been on another planet with no connection to this world at all except a common language and yet no words could ever explain one to the other she nodded do you not find it extraordinarily difficult to adjust from that life to this he asked his voice was soft but edged with a surprising intensity how much had callandra told judith alberton or her husband would hester embarrass her with the albertons in future if she were to be honest probably not callandra had never been a woman to run from the truth well i came back burning with determination to reform all our hospitals here at home she said ruefully as you can see i did not succeed for several reasons the chief among them was that no one would believe i had the faintest idea what i was talking about women dont understand medicine at all and nurses in particular are for rolling bandages sweeping and mopping floors carrying coal and slops and generally doing as they are told she allowed her bitterness to show it did not take me long to be dismissed having to earn my way by caring for private patients there was admiration as well as laughter in his eyes was that not very hard for you he asked very she agreed but i met my husband shortly after i came home we were i was going to say friends but that is not true adversaries in a common cause would describe it far better did lady callandra tell you that he is a private agent of enquiry there was no surprise in his face certainly nothing like alarm in high society gentlemen owned land or were in the army or politics they did not work in the sense of being employed trade was equally unacceptable but whatever family background judith alberton came from her husband showed no dismay that his guest should be little better than a policeman an occupation fit only for the least desirable element yes he admitted readily she told me she found some of his adventures quite fascinating but she did not give me any details i presumed they might be confidential they are she agreed i would not discuss them either only to say that they have prevented me from missing any sense of excitement or decision that i felt in the crimea and for the most part my share in them has not required the physical privation or the personal danger of nursing in wartime and the horror or the pity he asked quietly it has not sheltered me from those she admitted except for a matter of numbers and i am not sure one feels any less for one person if he or she is in desperate trouble than one does for many quite it was robert casbolt who spoke he came up just behind alberton putting a companionable hand on his friends shoulder and regarding hester with interest there is just so much the emotions can take and one gives all one has i imagine from what i have just overheard you are a remarkable woman mrs monk i am delighted daniel thought to invite you and your husband to dine you will enliven our usual conversation greatly and i for one am looking forward to it he lowered his voice conspiratorially no doubt we shall hear more of it over dinnerit is totally inescapable these daysbut i have had more than sufficient of the war in america and its issues albertons face lightened so have i but i would wager you a good carriage and pair that breeland will regale us again with the virtues of the union before the third course has been served second casbolt amended he grinned at hester a broad shining expression he is a very earnest young man mrs monk and fanatically convinced of the moral rightness of his cause to him the union of the united states is a divine entity and the confederate desire to secede the work of the devil any further comment was cut short by the necessity of removing to the dining room where dinner was ready to be served monk found the house pleasing although he was not certain why it was something to do with warmth of color and simplicity of proportion he had spent the earlier part of the evening talking with casbolt and judith alberton with the occasional comment from lyman breeland who seemed to find light conversation tedious breeland was too well mannered to show it overtly but monk at least knew that he was bored he wondered why breeland had come at all it excited monks curiosity looking around the room including himself and hester it seemed an oddly disparate group of people breeland appeared to be in his early thirties a year or two younger than hester the rest of them must have been in their middle to later forties apart from merrit alberton why had she chosen to attend this dinner when she could surely have been in the company of other young girls if not at a party yet he saw in her no sign of tedium or impatience was she remarkably well mannered or was there something which drew her here by choice the answer came at the end of the soup course and as the fish was served where do you live in america mr breeland hester asked innocently our home is in connecticut maam he replied ignoring his food and gazing at her steadily but at present we are in washington of course people are coming in from all over the northern part of the union to gather to the cause as no doubt you know he raised his level eyebrows very slightly casbolt and alberton glanced at each other and away again we are fighting for the survival of an ideal of freedom and liberty for all men breeland continued emphatically volunteers are pouring in from every town and city and from the farms even far inland and to the west merrits face was suddenly alight she looked for a moment at breeland her eyes shining then back to hester when they win there will be no more slavery she proclaimed all men will be free to come and go as they choose to call no man master it will be one of the greatest and noblest steps mankind has taken and they will do it even at the cost of their lives their homes whatever it takes war is usually at that cost miss alberton hester answered quietly whatever the cause of it but this is different merrits voice rose urgently she leaned forward a little over the exquisite china and silver the light from the chandeliers gleaming on her pale shoulders this is true nobility and sacrifice for a great ideal it is a struggle to preserve those liberties for which america was founded if you really understood it all mrs monk you would be as passionate in its defense as the union supporters are unless of course you believe in slavery there was no anger in her just bewilderment that anyone should do such a thing no i dont believe in slavery hester said fiercely she looked neither to right nor left to see what other peoples feelings might be i find the whole idea abhorrent merrit relaxed and her face flooded with a beautiful smile an instant warmth radiated from her then you will understand completely dont you agree we should do all we can to help such a cause when other men are willing to give their lives again her eyes flickered momentarily to breeland and he smiled back at her a faint flush of pleasure in his cheeks and he looked away again perhaps selfconsciously as if guarding his emotion hester was more guarded i certainly agree we should fight against slavery but i am not sure that this is the way to do it i confess i dont know sufficient about the issue to make a judgment it is simple enough merrit replied when you cut away the political quarrels and the matters of land and money and are left with nothing but the morality she waved her hand and without realizing it blocked the way of the footman trying to serve the entree it is a matter of being honest again the lovely smile transformed her face if you were to ask mr breeland he would explain the matter to you so you would be able to see it with such clarity you would burn to fight the cause with all your heart monk looked across to see how daniel alberton felt about this intense loyalty in his daughter to a war five thousand miles away there was a weariness in his hosts face which told of many such discussions and no resolution newspapers in london carried many stories about mr lincoln the new president and of jefferson davis who had been elected president of the provisional government of the confederate states of america those states that had broken away from the union one by one over the last several months for a long time many had hoped to avoid outright war while others actively encouraged it but with the bombardment of fort sumter by the confederates and its subsequent surrender on april president lincoln had asked for seventyfive thousand volunteers to serve for a period of three months and proposed a blockade of all confederate ports newspapers suggested that the south had called for a hundred and fifty thousand volunteers america was now at war what was far less obvious was the nature of the issues at stake to some like merrit it was simply about slavery in reality it appeared to monk to have at least as much to do with land economics and the right of the south to secede from a union it no longer wished to be part of indeed much sympathy in britain lay with the south although the motives for that were also mixed and perhaps suspect albertons patient tones came with an effort which for an instant was naked in his face there are many causes my dear and some of them conflict with each other there are no ends i know of which justify dishonorable means one must consider there is nothing which justifies slavery she said hotly cutting across him with no thought for the respect she owed him especially in company too many people use sophistries to defend not risking themselves or what they own in a fight judiths hand tightened on her silver fork and she glanced at her husband breeland smiled a flush of irritation crossed casbolts face and too many people rush in to espouse one cause alberton replied without taking a moment to weigh what their partisanship might cost another cause equally just and equally in need of their help and perhaps as deserving of their loyalty it was apparent it was no philosophical argument something of immediate and highly personal importance was at stake one had only to glance at lyman breelands stiff shoulders and unsmiling face at the high color in merrits cheeks at daniel albertons very evident impatience to know that this time merrit did not reply but her temper flared very visibly she was in many ways still not much more than a child but her emotion ran so deep that monk found the situation on the verge of embarrassment the entree plates were removed and cherry pie and cream were served they ate in silence judith alberton made some pleasant remark about a musical recital she had been to hester expressed an interest monk knew she did not feel she did not care for sentimental ballads and he wondered looking at judiths remarkable face if his hostess really did either it seemed a taste at odds with the strength of her features casbolt caught monks eye and smiled as if secretly amused gradually the conversation began again gentle and well mannered with an occasional shaft of wit the pie was succeeded by fresh grapes apricots and pears then by cheese light gleamed on silver crystal and white linen now and then there was laughter monk found himself wondering why breeland had been invited discreetly he studied the man his expression the tensions in his body the way he listened to the conversation as if intent upon interpreting from it some deeper meaning and waiting his chance to intercede with something of his own yet it never came half a dozen times monk saw him draw breath and then fail to speak he looked at merrit when she was speaking and there was a momentary softness in his eyes but he scrupulously avoided leaning close to her or making any other gesture which might appear intimate whether to guard her feelings or his own he was polite with judith alberton but there was no warmth in him as if he were not at ease with her considering her remarkable beauty monk did not find that difficult to understand men could be intimidated by such a woman become selfconscious and prefer to remain silent rather than to speak and risk sounding less than as clever or as amusing as they would have desired he was probably ten years younger than she and monk had begun to suspect he was in love with her daughter without her approval casbolt showed no such lack of ease his affection for judith was apparent but then as cousins they had probably known each other all their lives indeed he made several references often in jest to events in the past they had shared some of which had seemed disasters at the time but had now receded into memory and no longer hurt the pain or laughter shared made a unique bond between them they spoke of summer visits to italy when the three of themshe casbolt and her brother cesarehad walked the golden hills of tuscany found gentle and idiosyncratic pieces of statuary that predated the rise of rome and speculated on the people who might have made them judith laughed with pleasure and monk thought he saw a shadow of pain as well he glanced at hester and knew she had seen it also casbolts voice held it too the knowledge of something too deep ever to be forgotten and yet which could be shared because they had endured it together he she and daniel alberton nothing overt was said during the entire course of the meal and certainly nothing remotely offensive but monk formed the opinion that casbolt did not much like breeland perhaps it was no more than a dissimilarity in temperament casbolt was a sophisticated man of wide experience and charm he was at ease with people and conversation came naturally to him breeland was an idealist who could not forget his beliefs or allow himself to laugh while he knew others were suffering even for the space of a dinner perhaps it was a certain strangeness being far away from his home at a time of such trial and among strangers and obviously he could not help responding to merrits youth and her charm monk had some sympathy with him he had once been as passionate about great causes brimming with zeal over injustices that affected thousands perhaps millions now he felt such heat only over individuals he had tried too often to affect the course of law or nature and tasted failure learning the strength of the opposition he still tried hard and grieved bitterly the anger seized up inside him but he could also lay it aside for a space and fill his heart and mind with the sweet and the beautiful as well he had learned how to pace his battlesat least sometimesand to savor the moments of respite the last course was almost completed when the butler came to speak to daniel alberton excuse me sir he said in little above a whisper mr philo trace has called shall i tell him you are engaged or do you wish to see him breeland swiveled around his body stiff his expression so tightly controlled as to be almost frozen merrit was far less careful to hide her feelings the color rose hot in her cheeks and she glared at her father as if she believed he were about to do something monstrous casbolt glanced at the others in apology but his face was alive with interest monk had the fleeting impression that casbolt actually cared what he thought then he dismissed it as ridiculous why should he albertons expression made it plain that he had not expected the caller for a moment he was taken aback he looked at judith questioningly by all means she said with a faint smile i suppose you had better ask him to come in alberton instructed the butler explain to him that we are at dinner and if he cares to join us for fruit then he is very welcome there was an uncomfortable silence while the butler retreated and then returned ushering in a slender darkhaired man with a sensitive mercurial face the type whose expression conveyed emotion and yet perhaps hid his true feelings he was handsome as if charm came easily and yet there was something elusive about him and private monk judged him to be perhaps ten years older than breeland and the moment he spoke it was apparent he came from one of those southern states which had recently seceded from the union and with whom the union was now at war how do you do monk replied when they were introduced after the butler had brought another chair and discreetly set an additional place at the table im truly sorry trace said with some embarrassment i seem to have the wrong evening i certainly did not intend to intrude he looked for a moment at breeland and it was clear they already knew each other the animosity between them crackled in the air thats quite all right mr trace judith said with a smile would you care for a little fruit or a pastry his eyes lingered on her with pleasure and a certain earnestness thank you maam that is most generous of you mr and mrs monk are friends of lady callandra daviot i cannot remember whether you met her or not judith continued no i didnt but you told me something of her a most interesting lady he sat down on the chair which had been drawn up for him he regarded hester with pleasant curiosity are you connected with the army also maam indeed she is casbolt said enthusiastically she has had a remarkable career with florence nightingale i am sure you must have heard of her naturally trace smiled at hester im afraid in america these days we are obliged to concern ourselves with all aspects of war as i daresay you know but i am sure it is not what you wish to discuss over dinner isnt that what you have come about mr trace merrit asked her voice cold you did not call socially you admitted as much when you had mistaken the evening trace blushed i dont know how i came to do that i have already apologized miss alberton im sure i dont know either merrit said i can only think you were worried in case mr breeland might at last persuade my father of the justice of his cause and you should find yourself without the purchase you expected it was a challenge and she made no concession to courtesy her passionate conviction rang in her voice so sincerely it almost robbed it of rudeness casbolt shook his head he looked at merrit patiently you know better than that my dear however profound your convictions you understand your father better than to think he would go back on his word for anyone i hope mr trace knows that also if he doesnt he soon will he looked across at monk we must apologize to you sir and to you he said including hester for an instant this must all seem inexplicably heated to you i daresay no one explained to you daniel and i are dealers and shippers among other things guns of good quality are in great demand with the united states at war as it regrettably is men from both the union and the confederacy are scouring europe and buying up everything they can most of the available weapons are quite possibly inferior as likely to blow up in the faces of the men who use them as to do any damage to the enemy some of them have aims so bad you would be lucky to hit the broad side of a barn at twenty paces do you know anything about guns sir nothing at all monk said truthfully if he ever had such knowledge it had gone with the coach accident five years ago which had robbed him of all memory before that time he could not recall ever having fired a gun however casbolts explanation made clear the turbulence of emotions monk had felt in the room the presence of both breeland and trace and the bitter emotion between them it had nothing to do with merrit alberton or any of the family casbolts face lit with enthusiasm the best modern gunsay for example the p last years modelis built of a total of sixtyone parts including screws and so on it weighs only eight pounds and fourteen and a half ounces without bayonet and the barrel is rifled of course and thirtynine inches long it is accurate over at least nine hundred yardswell over half a mile judith looked at him with a slightly reproving smile of course he apologized glancing at hester then at monk again im sorry please tell us something of your business if it is not all confidential his expression held an interest so sharp it was difficult to imagine it was affected purely for the sake of mere politeness monk had never been asked such a question in the society of a dinner party normally it was the last thing people wished to speak of because he was present to investigate something which had caused them recent pain and in all likelihood was still doing so crime not only brought fear bereavement and inevitably suspicion it ripped from quiet lives the decent masks of secrecy everyone put over all manner of smaller sins and weaknesses robert judith said urgently i think you are asking mr monk to tell us about peoples tragedies casbolt looked wideeyed and not in the least put out am i what a shame how can i circumvent that i really would like to hear something of mr monks fascinating occupation he was still smiling but there was a determination in his voice he sat back from the table a little picking up a small bunch of a dozen or so green grapes in his fingers tell me do you spend a lot of time on robberies missing jewels and so on it was a far safer subject than guns or slavery monk saw the interest flicker in judiths face in spite of her awareness that the subject was possibly not one a polite society would pursue daniel alberton also seemed relieved his fingers stopped twisting the fruit knife he held mrs monk says that her involvement in your cases has replaced the exhilaration the horror and the responsibility she felt on the battlefield casbolt prompted they can hardly be affairs of finding the lost silver saltcellar or the missing greatniece of lady soandso they were all waiting for monk to tell them something dramatic and entertaining which had nothing whatever to do with their own lives or the tensions which lay between them even hester was looking at him smiling no he agreed taking a peach off the dish there are a few of that order but every so often there is a murder which falls to me rather than to the police good heavens judith said involuntarily why usually because the police suspect the wrong person monk replied in your opinion casbolt said quickly monk met his eyes there was banter in casbolts voice but his look was level unflickering and highly intelligent monk was certain this remark at least was not made idly to relieve the previous embarrassment between breeland and trace yes in my belief he answered with the weight he thought it deserved i have been seriously wrong at times but only for a while i was once convinced a famous man was innocent and worked very hard to prove him so only to find in the end that he was horribly and coldbloodedly guilty merrit did not wish to be interested but in spite of herself she was did you manage to put right your mistake what happened to him she asked ignoring the grapes on her plate he was hanged monk said without pleasure she stared at him a shadow flickering in her eyes there was something in his manner she did not understand not the words but the emotion werent you pleased how could he explain to her the anger he had felt at the loss of the woman who had been killed and that revenge which was all that a hanging was brought nothing back justice as the law contained it was necessary but there was no joy in it he looked at the soft lines of her face she had barely outgrown the roundness of childhood and she was so certain she was right about the american war so burning with indignation love and consuming idealism no he said needing to be honest to himself whether she understood or not i am pleased the truth was known i am pleased he had to answer for his crime but i regretted his destruction he was a clever man greatly gifted but his arrogance was monstrous in the end he thought everyone else should serve his talents it consumed his compassion and his judgment even his honor how tragic judith said softly im glad robert asked you your answer is better than i had expected she glanced at her husband whose expression confirmed her own thank you my dear casbolt flashed her a sudden smile then turned back to monk tell us how did you catch him if he was clever then you must have been even cleverer monk answered a trifle smugly he made mistakesold cases old enemies i uncovered them it is a matter of understanding loyalties and betrayals of watching everything and never giving up hounding him breeland asked with distaste no monk replied sharply seeking the truth whether it is what you want it to be or not even if it is what you dread most and cuts deepest at what you want to believe never lie never twist it never run away and never give up he was surprised at the vehemence with which he meant what he said he heard it in his voice and it startled him he saw the agreement in hesters face and felt himself color he had not realized her respect mattered so much to him he had never intended to be so vulnerable merrit was staring at him with a sudden interest as if in a space of moments he had metamorphosed into a man she could like and she did not know how to deal with the change there you are casbolt said with evident pleasure i knew you had invited a most interesting man my dear he said to judith are you ever defeated mr monk do you ever retire from the fray and concede to the villain monk smiled back a trifle wolfishly now the passion was gone they were fencing to entertain not yet ive come close a few times ive feared my own client was guilty or that the person i was employed to protect might be and i have wanted to let go just walk away and pretend i did not know the truth and did you alberton asked he was leaning forward a little across the table his plate ignored his eyes intent upon monks face no but sometimes i liked the villain better than the victim monk answered honestly judith was surprised really when you understood the crime you had more sympathy with the murderer than the person he killed once or twice there was a woman whose child was systematically molested i liked her far better than the man she killed for it oh she sucked in her breath sharply her face blanched with pain poor creature trace looked at her his eyes wide then at merrit was he guilty oh yes and a victim himself a judith started then understanding her eyes filled with pity oh i see breeland pushed his chair back from the table and rose slowly to his feet i am sure mr monks adventures are fascinating and i regret having to excuse myself so early but since mr trace has called on what is apparently business i feel i should either stay and argue my cause over his or withdraw and retain your goodwill by not allowing this most agreeable evening to descend into acrimony he lifted his chin a little higher he was angry and selfconscious but would yield his convictions to no one and since you already know every reason why the union is fighting to preserve the nation we have founded in freedom against a confederacy which would encircle us in slavery and i have argued it with every reason and every emotion in my power i shall thank you for your hospitality and wish you good night he inclined his head stiffly in something less than a bow mrs alberton miss alberton he looked at daniel coldly sir ladies and gentlemen he said including everyone else then he turned on his heel and left im so sorry trace repeated that was the last thing i meant to have happen he turned from judith to daniel alberton please believe me sir i never doubted your word i did not know breeland was here of course you didnt alberton agreed rising to his feet also perhaps if the rest of you will excuse us we shall be able to conclude our business quite quickly it seems unfortunate and unnecessary now that mr trace is here for me to require him to come again tomorrow he looked apologetically to hester and monk i daresay it is my fault casbolt looked at trace and shrugged very slightly it was i who last spoke to you about it i may have given the wrong date if i did i am sorry it was most careless of me he turned to judith then to monk and hester it is quite all right monk said quickly and he meant it the friction between trace and breeland was more interesting than a blander party might have been but of course he could not say so thank you casbolt said warmly shall you and i remain here while the ladies retire to the withdrawing room and daniel and mr trace conduct their business by all means monk accepted casbolt looked at the port bottle nestling in its basket and the sparkling glasses waiting for it and grinned broadly judith led hester and merrit through to the withdrawing room again the curtains were still open and the last of the evening light still bathed the tops of the trees in a warm apricot glow an aspen shimmered as the sunset breeze turned its leaves glittering one moment smooth the next i am so sorry for the intrusion of this miserable war in america judith said ruefully it seems we cant escape from it at the moment merrit stood very straight her shoulders squared staring out of the long windows at the roses across the lawn i dont think it is morally right that we should try to im sorry if you feel that it is bad manners to say so but i honestly dont believe mrs monk is someone who would use manners as an excuse to run away from the truth she turned her head to stare at hester she went to the crimea to care for our soldiers who were sick and injured when she could have stayed here at home and been comfortable and said it was none of her business if you had been alive at the time wouldnt you have campaigned with wilberforce to end the slave trade through britain and on the high seas there was a challenge directed at hester but in spite of the ring in her voice her eyes were bright as if she knew the answer please heaven i hope so hester said vehemently that we even entered into it was one of the blackest pages in all our history to buy and sell human beings is inexcusable merrit gave her a beautiful smile then turned to her mother i knew it why cant papa see that how can he be there in his study actually proposing to sell guns to the confederacy the slave states because he gave his word to mr trace before mr breeland came here judith replied now please sit down and dont place mrs monk in the middle of our difficulties it is quite unfair taking merrits obedience for granted she turned to hester sometimes i wish my husband were in a different business i am not sure if there is anything entirely without contention even if you were to sell tin baths or turnips i daresay there would be someone on your doorstep declaring your demands were unrighteous or prejudicial to somebody elses livelihood but armaments arouse more emotions than most other things and seem to depend upon so many reverses of fortune that cannot be foreseen do they hester was surprised i would have thought governments at least could see the probability of war long before it became inevitable oh usually but there are times when it comes right out of nowhere at all judith replied naturally my husband and mr casbolt as well study the affairs of the world very closely but there are events that take everyone by surprise the third chinese war just last year was a perfect example hester had no knowledge of it and it must have been clear in her face judith laughed it was all part of the opium wars we have with the chinese every so often but this one took everybody by surprise although how the second chinese war began was the most absurd apparently there was a schooner called arrow built and owned by the chinese although it had once been registered in british hong kong anyway the chinese authorities boarded the arrow and arrested some of the crew who were also chinese we decided that we had been insulted what hester said in amazement i mean i beg your pardon precisely judith agreed wryly we took offense and used it as a pretext to start a minor war the french discovered that a french missionary had been executed by the chinese a few months before that so they joined in as well when the war finished various treaties were signed and we felt it safe to resume business with the chinese as usual she grimaced then quite unexpectedly the third chinese war broke out does it affect armament sales hester asked surely only to the advantage at least for the british judith shook her head very slightly depends upon whom you were selling to in this instance not if you were selling to the chinese with whom we were going through a period of good relations oh i see then perhaps we should be more careful to whom we sell guns merrit said fiercely instead of just to the highest bidder judith looked for a moment as if she were about to argue then changed her mind hester formed the opinion that her hostess had had some variation of this conversation several times before and on each of them failed to make any difference it was eminently none of hesters business and better left alone yet the impulse in her which so often monk told her was arbitrary and opinionated formed the words on her lips to whom should we sell guns she asked with outward candor apart from the unionists in america of course merrit was impervious to sarcasm she was too idealistic to see any moderation to a cause where there is no oppression involved she said without hesitation where people are fighting for their freedom who would you have sold them to in the indian mutiny merrit stared at her the indians hester answered for her but perhaps if you had seen what they had done with them the massacres of women and children you might have felt confused at the least i know i am merrit looked suddenly very young the gaslight on her cheeks emphasized their soft curve almost childlike and the fair hair where it curled on her neck hester felt a surge of tenderness towards her remembering how ardent she had been at that age how full of fire to better the world and sure that she knew how without the faintest idea of the multitudinous layers of passion and pain intertwined with each other and the conflicting beliefs all so reasonable if taken alone if innocence were not reborn with each generation what hope was there that wrongs would ever be fought against i am not happy about the morality of it either she said contritely i would rather have something relatively uncomplicated like medicine peoples lives are still in your hands you can still make mistakes terrible ones but you have no doubt as to what you are trying to do even if you dont know how to do it merrit smiled tentatively she recognized an olive branch and took it arent you afraid sometimes she asked softly often and of all sorts of things merrit stood still in the fading light only the very top of the aspen beyond her still caught the sun she was fingering a rather heavy watch which had been tucked down her bosom and now she had taken it out she caught hesters eyes on it and the color deepened in her cheeks lyman gave it to me mr breeland she explained avoiding her mothers gaze i know it doesnt really complement this dress but i intend to keep it with me always to the devil with fashion she lifted her chin a little ready to defy any criticism judith opened her mouth then changed her mind perhaps you could wear it on your skirt hester suggested it looks like a watch for use as much as ornament merrits face lightened thats a good idea i should have thought of that i tend to wear a useful watch rather than a pretty one hester said one i cannot really see defeats the purpose merrit walked over to the chair opposite hester and sat down i have the most tremendous admiration for people who dedicate themselves to the care of others she said earnestly would it be intrusive or troublesome of me to ask you to tell us a little more about your experiences actually it was something hester was very willing to leave behind her when there was nothing she could accomplish and no one to persuade however it would have been ungracious to refuse so she spent the next hour answering merrits eager questions and waiting for judith to lead the conversation in another path but judith seemed to be just as interested and her silence was one of deep attention when trace had completed his business with alberton he took his leave and alberton returned to the dining room glanced at casbolt then seeing a slight nod invited him and monk to find more comfortable seats not in the withdrawing room with the ladies but in the library i owe you an apology mr monk alberton said almost before they had made themselves comfortable i have certainly enjoyed your company this evening and that of your wife who is a most remarkable woman but i invited you here because we need your help well principally i do but casbolt is involved as well i am sorry for misleading you in such a way but the matter is very delicate and in spite of lady callandras high opinion of youwhich by the way was given as a friend not professionallyi preferred to form my own judgment monk felt a moments resentment mostly on hesters behalf then realized that he might well have done the same thing himself were he in albertons position he hoped it was nothing to do with guns or a choice between philo trace and lyman breeland he found trace the more agreeable man but he believed in breelands cause far more he did not feel as passionately as hester but the idea of slavery repelled him i accept your apology he said with a slightly sardonic smile now if you can tell me the matter that troubles you i will make my judgment as to whether i can help you with itor wish to well taken mr monk alberton said ruefully he made light of it but monk could see the tension underlying his words his body was rigid a tiny muscle ticked in his jaw his voice was not quite even monk felt a stab of guilt for his levity the man was neither arrogant nor indifferent his selfcontrol all evening had been an act of courage are you facing some kind of threat he asked quietly tell me what it is and if i can help you i will the flicker of a smile crossed albertons face the problem is very simple to explain mr monk as you know casbolt and i are partners in the business of shipping sometimes timber but mostly machinery and armaments i imagine after the conversation of our other dinner guest that much is obvious he did not look at casbolt while he spoke but fixed his gaze unwaveringly on monk what you cannot know is that some ten years ago i was introduced to a young man named alexander gilmer he was charming very beautiful to look at and a trifle eccentric in his style of living he was also ill and had been earning his way as an artists model as i said he was of striking appearance his employer had abandoned him gilmer said because he had refused him sexual favors at that time he was desperate i paid his debts as a matter of compassion he took a deep breath but his eyes did not waver casbolt did not attempt to interrupt he seemed content that alberton should tell the story nevertheless alberton went on his voice even lower the poor man died in very tragic circumstances he drew in his breath and let it out in a sigh he had tried to get more work as a model but each time with less respectable people he was somewhat naive i think he expected a standard of morality that did not exist in the circles in which he moved he was misunderstood men thought he was offering sexual favors and when he refused they became angry and put him out on the street i suppose rejection very often produces such emotions he stopped his face filled with pity this time it was casbolt who took up the thread his voice earnest you see mr monk poor gilmer whom i also helped financially on one occasion was found dead several months ago in a house known for male prostitution whether they merely sheltered him out of compassion or if he worked there is not known but it made any money passed to him whether a gift or a payment fall under suspicion yes i see that monk could visualize the picture very clearly he was not sure precisely how much he believed but it was probably irrelevant someone has discovered proof of this gift of yours and wishes you to continue it only to them a flicker crossed albertons face it is not quite as simple as that but that is the substance of it it is not money they wish if it were i could be tempted to protect my family although i realize that once you have paid there is no end to it it also appears to be an admission that there is something to hide monk added hearing the edge of contempt in his own voice blackmail was a crime he loathed above any other kind of theft it was not just the extortion of money it was a form of torture longdrawnout and deliberate he had known it to drive people to their deaths ill do all i can to help he added quickly alberton looked at him the payment they want is one i cannot give casbolt nodded very slightly but there was anger and pain in his face he watched monk intently monk waited they want me to pay them in gun sales alberton explained to baskin and company a firm which i know is merely a front for another which sells directly to pirates operating in the mediterranean his hands were clenched into fists till his knuckles shone white what you may not know mr monk is that my wife is half italian he glanced momentarily at casbolt i think you heard mention of it at dinner her brother and his wife and children were murdered while at sea off the coast of sicily by pirates you will understand why it would be impossible for me to sell them guns in those circumstances yes yes of course i do monk said with feeling it is never good to pay blackmail but this is doubly impossible if you give me all the information you have i will do everything i can to find out who is threatening you and deal with it i may be able to find proof that your gift was no more than compassion then they will have no weapon left alternatively there may be the same weapon to use against them i assume you would be willing for me to do that alberton drew in his breath yes casbolt said without hesitation certainly forgive me but it was to form some judgment of your willingness to pursue a difficult and even dangerous case to the conclusion to fight for justice when all seemed stacked against you that i asked you so much about yourself earlier in the evening before you knew the reason why i also wished to see if you had the vision to see a cause greater than satisfying the letter of the law monk smiled a trifle twistedly he also took few men at their word now if you would tell me how they got in touch with you and everything you know about alexander gilmer both his life and his death he replied i will begin tomorrow morning if they get in touch with you again delay them tell them you need to make arrangements and are in the process of doing so thank you for the first time since he had mentioned the subject alberton relaxed a little i am deeply obliged now we must discuss the financial arrangements casbolt reached out his hand thank you monk i think we now have room to hope monk had described the case to hester on their way home from the albertons house she was entirely at one with him about his acceptance she found blackmail as abhorrent as he did and apart from that she had liked judith alberton and was distressed to think of the amount of embarrassment and pain that might be caused to the family were scandal to be created over the circumstances of albertons help to alexander gilmer monk set out early to go to little sutton street in clerkenwell where alberton had told him gilmer had died it was only eight oclock as he walked rapidly towards tottenham court road to find a hansom but the streets were full of all kinds of traffic cabs carts wagons drays costermongers barrows peddlers selling everything from matches and bootlaces to ham sandwiches and lemonade a running patterer stood on the corner with a small crowd around him while he chanted a rough doggerel verse about the latest political scandal and caused roars of laughter someone threw him a coin and it flashed for a moment in the sun before he caught it the musical call of a rag and bone man sounded above the noise of hooves and the rumble of wheels over the rough road harness clinked as a brewers dray went by laden with giant barrels the air was heavy with the smells of dust horse sweat and manure monk glanced at a newsboys headlines but there was nothing about america the last he had heard was the rumor that the real invasion of the confederate states was not to take place until the autumn of this year back in midapril president lincoln had proclaimed a naval blockade of the confederate coast right from south carolina to texas then later extended it to include virginia and north carolina fortifications had been begun to protect washington today was tuesday the twentyfifth of june if anything had happened since then more than the occasional skirmish news of it had not yet reached england that took roughly from twelve days to three weeks depending upon the weather and how far it had to travel overland first he saw an empty hansom and waved his arm shouting above the general noise when the driver pulled the horse up monk gave him the address of the clerkenwell police station he had already considered how he intended to begin he did not suppose either alberton or casbolt was lying to him although clients certainly had in the past and no doubt would again but even the bestintentioned people frequently make mistakes omit important facts or simply see an incomplete picture and interpret it through their own hopes and fears the cab arrived at the police station monk alighted paid the fare and went in even five years after the accident and with so much of a new life built he still felt a surge of anxiety the unknown returning to remind him of those things he had discovered about himself right from the beginning he had had flashes of familiarity moments of recollection which vanished before he could place them most of what he knew was from evidence and deduction he had left his native northumberland for london and begun his career as a merchant banker working for a man who had been his friend and mentor until his ruin for a crime of which he was innocent although monk had been unable to help him prove it that had been the force which had driven monk into the police and away from the world of finance too many discoveries had made it evident that he had been a brilliant policeman but with a ruthless streak even cruel at times juniors had been afraid of his tongue which had been too quick to criticize to mock the weaker and the less confident it was something he disliked and of which he could at last admit even if only to himself he was ashamed a quick temper was one thing to demand high standards of courage and honesty was good but to ask of a man more than his ability to give was not only pointless it was cruel and in the end destructive every time he went into an unfamiliar police station he was aware of the possibility that he would meet another reflection of himself he would not like he dreaded recognition but he refused to let it shackle him he went in through the door and up to the desk the sergeant was a tall man middleaged with thin hair there was no expression in his face but polite interest monk breathed a sigh of relief mornin sir the sergeant said pleasantly what can i do to help you good morning monk replied i need some information about an incident that happened in your area some months ago a friend of mine is threatened with involvement in a scandal before i undertake to protect him if i can i should like to be certain of the facts all i am looking for is what is recorded he smiled but from an unimpeachable source the sergeants polite skepticism was replaced by a certain understanding i see sir and which particular incident would that be a look crossed his eyes as if he might already have a good idea at least of its nature if not specifically which occasion monk smiled apologetically the death of alexander gilmer in little sutton street i am sure you will have records of it and someone who knows the truth it was at times like these he missed the authority he used to have when he could simply have demanded the papers well sir the records are here sure enough but they wont be open to the public like im sure youll understand that mr im sorry monk william monk monk interest flared in the sergeants eyes would you be the mr monk as worked on the carlyon case monk was startled yes that was a few years ago now terrible thing the sergeant said gravely well i spect since you used to be one of us like we could tell you all we know ill find sergeant walters as was on the case and he disappeared for several minutes leaving monk to look around at the various wanted posters on the walls relieved that the sergeant knew of him only since the accident sergeant walters was a thin dark man with an enthusiastic manner he took monk to a small chaotic room with books and papers piled everywhere and cleared a chair by lifting everything off it and putting it all on the floor he invited monk to sit down then perched on the windowsill the only other space available right he said with a smile what do you wanter know about gilmer poor devil everything you know monk said or as much as you have time and inclination to tell me ah well walters settled himself more comfortably it seemed he often sat on the sill this was apparently the normal state of the room how he found anything was a miracle monk leaned back hopefully walters stared at the ceiling about twentynine when he died tubercular thin haunted sort of look to his face but good features not surprised artists wanted to paint him thats what he did you know yes i suppose you do know he seemed to be waiting for confirmation monk nodded i was told that only saw him when he was dead walters went on he spoke quite casually but his eyes never left monks face and monk formed the very clear impression that he was being measured and nothing about him taken for granted he could imagine walters writing notes on him the moment he was gone and adding them to the file on gilmer and that walters would know exactly where in this chaos the file was monk already knew the name of the artist from casbolt but he did not say so fellow called fitzalan walters went on when monk did not speak quite famous found gilmer in edinburgh or somewhere up that way brought him down here and took him in paid him a lot then grew tired of him for whatever reason and threw him out he waited to see monks reaction to this piece of information monk said nothing keeping his expression bland walters understood and smiled it was a measuring of wits of professionalism and now they both acknowledged it he drifted from one artist to another walters said with a little shake of his head downhill all the time be all right for a while then he seemed to quarrel and get thrown out again couldve left of his own choice of course but since he had nowhere to go and his health was getting worse seems unlikely monk tried to imagine the young man alone far from home and increasingly ill why would he keep provoking such disagreements he could not afford it and he must have known that was he a man of ungoverned temper had he become an unusable model the ravages of his disease spoiling his looks or were the relationships those of lovers or by then simply user and used and when the user grew bored the used was discarded for someone else it was a sad and ugly picture whichever of these answers was true how did he die he asked walters watched him very steadily his eyes almost unblinking doctor said it was consumption he replied but hed been knocked around pretty badly as well not exactly murder not technically but morally i reckon it was id find a way to beat the daylights out of any man who treated a dog like that mand been used i dont care what he did to get by or what his nature was under the calm of his manner there was an anger so hot he dared not let it go but monk saw it behind his eyes and in the rigid set of his shoulders and in his arms where the fingers were stiff on the windowsill knuckles white he had found walters instantly agreeable now he liked him the more did you ever get anybody for it he asked although he knew the answer no but i havent stopped looking walters replied if you find anybody in your help for your friend id be obliged he looked at monk curiously now trying to assess where his loyalties lay and exactly what sort of friend he had monk himself was not sure the blackmail letter alberton had shown him was comparatively innocuous it was awkwardly worded made up from pieces cut from newspapers and pasted onto a sheet of very ordinary paper one might buy at any stationers it had stated that the payments could be interpreted as purchase of several forms and in light of the way in which gilmer had died public knowledge of it would ruin albertons standing in society no suggestion had been made that either alberton or casbolt was responsible for gilmers death possibly the blackmailer was afraid they could prove themselves elsewhere at the time more likely such a threat was unnecessary he thought he could obtain what he wanted without going so far if i find out monk promised i shall be happy to assist you to dispense justice i gather it was a male brothel where he was found thats right walters agreed and before you ask me what he was doing there ill tell you that i dont know the owner said he took pity on him and fetched him in off the streets an act of charity there was no irony in his eyes and his look dared monk to differ could be true gilmer poor devil was in little state to be any use as a worker and he had neither strength nor money to be a client assuming he was that way inclined which no one seems to know weve just got it down officially as death by natural causes but we all know damned well that someone beat him pretty badly too could have had them for assault if the poor sod hadnt died anyway any idea who it was that beat him monk asked hearing the edge in his own voice privately even if you couldnt prove it ideas walters said darkly not much more clients in places like that dont leave their names on a list some of them have some pretty sordid tastes that they cant exercise at home and arent keen to have known think it was a client sure of it why your friend one of them the sneer in walterss voice was too bitter to hide he says not if you tell me when gilmer died exactly i may be able to ascertain where my friend was walters took out his notebook and rifled through it between eight and midnight on september twentyeighth last year is your friend being blackmailed over gilmers death no over having given him some money which is open to misinterpretation nobody gave him much poor devil walters shrugged got himself into debt pretty badly thought it might have been one of his creditors beat him to teach him to pay up more promptly we went and interviewed the man we suspected he smiled showing his teeth it was more of a snarl although there was definitely pleasure in it somewhat vigorously he added but he said gilmer had paid everything he owed didnt believe that for a moment but the bastard could unarguably prove where he was all that night he spent it in jail only time i was sorry to see him there do you know how much it was monk enquired he knew exactly how much alberton had said he gave gilmer no why walters said quickly do you know something about it monk smiled at him i might how much was it told you i dont know but it was over fifty pounds alberton had paid sixtyfive monk was unreasonably pleased he realized only now how profoundly he had wanted to find alberton honest that answer you walters was staring at him no monk said quickly it confirms what i thought my friend claimed to have paid it it looks as if he did why compassion monk said immediately are you thinking it was for services rendered id like to meet the boy that commands that much walters grinned his eyes opened wide looks like a good man caught in an unpleasant situation it does doesnt it monk agreed thank you for your help walters straightened up hope it turns out to be true he said pleasantly id like to think someone helped him whatever he was did you know of him when he was alive monk rose slowly also no learned the rest when we were looking into his death got too much to do to investigate prostitution if they arent causing a public nuisance he shrugged anyway most of the time the powers that be would rather we didnt draw attention to it and theyd certainly rather we didnt take names and addresses he did not need to explain what he meant but let me know if you find out who did that to him will you i will monk promised picking his way through the piles of papers to the door because id like you to meet up with him and because i owe it to you it was early afternoon and far too hot to be comfortable when monk reached the large house in kensington which was lawrence fitzalans studio the midsummer sun beat on the pavements shimmering back in waves that made the vision dance the gutters were dry and the unswept manure was pungent in the air the maid who answered the door was remarkably pretty and monk wondered if fitzalan painted her as well he had already decided how he would approach the artist and had no compunction whatever in lying perhaps based quite unfairly on walterss anger he had formed a dislike of fitzalan good afternoon he said as charmingly as he could and he knew that was very effective indeed he had used it often enough i should very much like to have a portrait painted of my wife and so i have naturally come to the finest artist i know of may i make an appointment to see mr fitzalan at his earliest convenience unfortunately i am in london only a short while before returning to rome for a month or two she looked at him with interest with his dark hair and lean face he filled her idea of a mysterious italian very well she invited him into an ornate hall in which were several expensive pieces of statuary and went to tell her master of the visitor fitzalan was a flamboyant man with a high sense of his own talent which monk could see having glanced at the canvases in his studio was very real five were turned face out in various places hung or stacked so they were well displayed although to the casual eye they appeared to be placed with no regard the draftsmanship was excellent the play of light and shade dramatic the faces arresting in spite of himself monk found his eye going to them instead of to fitzalan you are an art lover fitzalan said with satisfaction monk could imagine him playing this scene with every visitor always the slight surprise in his voice as though the world were peopled with philistines monk forced himself to meet fitzalans gaze the artist was not tall but he was a big man broadshouldered in his fifties and now running to paunch his gingerish hair had faded but there was still plenty of it and he wore it affectedly long it was a proud face strongfeatured selfindulgent it galled monk to flatter him but it was necessary if he were to remain long enough to learn what he wanted to yes i apologize for my discourtesy but your paintings took my eye regardless of my intention to be civil forgive me fitzalan was pleased you are forgiven my dear sir he said expansively you wish for a portrait of your wife rather more than that actually a friend of mine saw a very remarkable painting of a young man done by you monk replied making himself smile disarmingly but he was unable to purchase it because the owner very naturally would not sell i wondered if you had any others of the same subject i might tell him of he is very anxious to possess one in fact it is something of an obsession with him fitzalan appeared suitably flattered he tried to hide it but monk had assumed that his hunger for praise was far from filled even by the fame he already enjoyed ah he said standing still as if thinking hard only the brilliance of his eyes and the slight smile giving him away let me see not certain which young man that might be i paint anyone whose face intrigues me regardless of who they are he was watching monks reaction cant be bothered to paint pretty pictures to make famous men look better than they do he said it with pride art that is the master not fame or money or being liked posterity wont give a damn who the subject was only how they were on canvas how they spoke to the soul of the man who looked at them decades latercenturies maybe monk agreed with him it was an acute and honest perceptionbut it galled him to say so of course that is what divides the artist from the journeyman can you describe the subject fitzalan asked basking in the praise fairhaired thinfaced with a spiritual air almost haunted monk replied trying to visualize how gilmer must have looked in the earliest days of his modeling before his health deteriorated ah fitzalan said quickly think i know who you mean ive got a couple upstairs been keeping those against the day when theyd be appreciated for what they are monk controlled his anger with difficulty he coughed raising his hand to his face to conceal the revulsion he felt for a man who could speak so casually about a youth he had known and used and whom he must have heard was dead excuse me he apologized then continued i should like very much to see them fitzalan was already going to the door leading the way back into the hall past a naked marble adonis and up the stairs to a larger room obviously used for storage he went without hesitation to two canvases concealed by other later ones and turned them so monk could see and admire and much as it cut him he did admire them they were brilliant the face that stared out from the colored oils was passionate sensitive already shadowed by some vision beyond the pedestrian needs of life perhaps even at this time he had known he was consumptive and would not have long to savor the joys or the grief he then knew had they been the sweeter for that the more poignant fitzalan had caught all that was precious and swift to pass in the eyes the lips the almost translucent pallor of the skin it was a disturbing painting it flashed through monks mind to ask alberton for the price of it as his reward it hurt him to think he would never see it again after these few moments it was a reminder of the sweetness of life never to waste or disregard a moment of its gift you like it fitzalan said unnecessarily monk could not have denied it whatever sins lay in the soul of the painter the picture was superb he recalled his purpose who is he it was not difficult to ask it seemed the only natural thing to do just a vagrant fitzalan replied a young man i saw in the street and took in for a while wonderful face isnt it monk turned away from fitzalan in order to hide his own emotion he could not afford to have his loathing show yes what happened to him no idea fitzalan said with slight surprise nobody else will paint him like that i assure you he was consumptive that look wont be there anymore thats what is so valuable the moment the knowledge of mortality its universal the perception of life and death its a hundred and fifty guineas tell your friend that was half the price of a good house fitzalan certainly did not underestimate his own worth even so monk found ideas racing through his mind as to how he might acquire the picture he would never have that sort of money to spend in such a way he would probably never have it at all he might be able to bargain down a good deal but still not into his financial possibilities was there some trade he would profoundly have liked to force fitzalan into it twist him until something hurt enough for him to be glad to give up the picture in exchange for relief ill tell him he said between his teeth thank you monk spent the rest of that day and the next two as well tracing gilmers fairly rapid decline from one artist to another each of lesser skill than the last until finally he was destitute and on the street in each case he had seemingly quarreled and left in some anger no one had wished him well or given him any assistance in the end roughly the middle of the previous summer he had been taken in by the master of a male brothel yeah poor devil he said to monk on is last legs e were thin as a rake an pale as death i could see as e were dyin his scarred face was pinched with pity as he sat in the overstuffed chair in his crowded parlor he was an extraordinarily ugly man with a humpbacked misshapen body but with beautiful hands who or what he might have been in other circumstances monk would never know but it crossed his mind to wonder had he been drawn to this or taken it up out of greed he chose to think it was the former did he tell you anything about himself monk enquired the man looked at him narrowly monk had not asked his name a bit he answered whats it to you did he work for you when e was well enough which werent often monk could understand it but he was still disappointed e did the laundry the man said wryly wot was you thinking to his amazement monk was blushing the man laughed e werent o that nature he said firmly yer can turn boys but is age its arder an beside that the way e looked like death an coughed blood no oned fancy im anyway whether you believe it or not i took im in because i was sorry for im i could see it wouldnt be for long ed bin ard enough used as it was any idea who knocked him around monk tried to keep the anger out of his voice and failed the man looked at him with a slight squint why wot yer goin ter do about it there was no point in being less than honest the man had already seen his feelings depends upon who it is he replied there are several people who would be happy to make life very difficult for whoever it was startin wi you eh no im not the first im several steps along the line he quarreled with many of the artists he worked for was it one of them i reckon so the man nodded slowly but e didnt rightly quarrel with them the first one just got bored and threw him out found it more profitable ter paint women for a while the second couldnt afford to keep him the third and fourth both asked favors of him like wot i sellat an igh price e werent willingthats why they threw im out an by then e were losing is looks an e got iller an iller was it one of them the man sized up monk carefully the dark face the lean bones broadbridged nose unblinking eyes why yer gonna kill im nothing so quick monk replied theres a police sergeant who would like to exact a slow vengeance through the law an youd tell im so e could i would if i were sure it was the right one customer o mine took a fancy to im an werent minded ter take no fer an answer id ave ad im beat ter within an inch of is life meself but i cant afford ter get a name fer that an ill be out o business an all me boys wi me name garson dalgetty a gent but a right sod underneath it told me ed ruin me if i laid an and on im and e could thank you ill not say where i got this information but i want a favor in return yeah why dont that surprise me none because youre not a fool wots yer favor monk grinned not your trade i want to know if gilmer told you of anyone giving him money to pay his debts and i mean giving not paying the man was surprised so you know about that do yer the man who gave it told me i wondered if it was the truth oh yeah very generous e were he rocked a little in his red chair i never asked why but e kept it up till gilmer come ere an after stopped when e died monk realized with a jolt what the man had said he went on incurring debts medicine poor sod i couldnt afford that who was it yer said yer knew i do but do you the mans ugly face lit with bitter amusement blackmail is it no i dont gilmer would never tell me an i never asked who did know god and the devil how do i know dont suppose it would be that ard ter find out if yer put yer mind ter it i never wanted ter monk stayed a little longer then thanked the man and took his leave choosing not to look to either the right or the left as he went out he had found compassion in the man and he wanted to know nothing of his trade the man had been perfectly correct in saying that it would not be difficult to trace the payments now that monk knew they were made regularly it took him the rest of that day and required no skills beyond ordinary knowledge of banking and common sense any number of other people could have done the same he also wrote a note to sergeant walters telling him the name of the man he was seeking was garson dalgetty leaving clerkenwell he wondered why alberton had not mentioned that he had made gilmer an allowance of five guineas a month it was not an enormous amount it would get him a little extra food enough sherry and laudanum to ease his worst distress no more it was an act of charity nothing to be ashamed of very much the opposite but was it all it seemed he did not bother to trace any gift made by casbolt albertons gift was enough for his purposes if he found no blackmailer in that he could go back to casbolt again the next thing he would do was trace the gun dealers through whom alberton was requested to make the payment but before that he would report to alberton as he had promised the evening went far from the way monk had planned he arrived at the house in tavistock square and was received immediately alberton looked anxious and tired as if some negotiations of his own had not been easy thank you for coming monk he said with a brief smile welcoming him into the library do sit down would you like a glass of whisky or something else he gestured to the crystalandsilver tantalus on a side table monk was seldom treated as if he were a social equal even in the most delicate cases he had found that the more embarrassed people were by their need the less did they wish to unbend to those whose help they asked alberton was a pleasant exception nevertheless he declined wishing not only to keep a totally clear head but also to be seen to alberton did not take anything either it seemed the invitation was purely hospitable not a desire to excuse indulging himself monk began to tell him briefly what he had learned of gilmer and his life and death he was giving an account of his visit to fitzalan when the butler knocked on the door im sorry to disturb you sir he apologized but mr breeland is here again and very insistent shall i ask him to wait sir or or have one of the footmen show him out i am afraid it could prove most unpleasant and bearing in mind that he has been a guest alberton looked at monk im sorry he said bleakly this is a very awkward situation you met young breeland the other evening as you must have observed he is fanatical in his cause and cannot see any other point of view i am afraid he will wait until i do speak to him and to tell you the truth i would rather my daughter did not meet with him again as she may do if i do not see him straightaway there was tenderness and exasperation in his face she is very young and full of ideals she is rather like he is she can see the justice of only one cause and nothing at all of any other by all means see him monk agreed rising to his feet i can very easily wait i really have little to say anyway i came because you asked me to report regardless alberton smiled briefly actually i think that was rather more robert than i but i can see his purpose one can feel helpless out of control if one has no idea what is happening all the same i should be obliged if you would remain while i see breeland if you would another presence here may calm his excess a trifle i really thought i had made myself plain before he turned to the butler who was still waiting patiently yes hallows ask mr breeland to come in yes sir hallows withdrew obediently but for an instant before he masked it his opinion of breelands importunity was clear in his face monk imagined hallows would wait well within call lyman breeland appeared a moment later as if he had been on the butlers heels he was dressed very formally in a dark highbuttoned suit and wellcut boots with a fine polish he was quite clearly disconcerted to see monk present alberton observed it mr monk is my guest he said coolly he has no interest in armaments and is not a rival for anything you would wish but i have told you before mr breeland the guns that interest you are already sold no they are not breeland interrupted him you are in negotiation you have not been paid and believe me sir i know that the union has its ways of gaining information you have been given a deposit but the rebels are short of funds and you may be fortunate to see the second half of your price possibly alberton said with a distinct chill but i have no reason to suppose those i deal with are not men of honor and whether they are or not it is not your concern i have the money in full breeland said tell philo trace to produce the same see if he can i have given my word sir and i do not withdraw it alberton replied his face set in hard lines his anger unmistakable you are conniving at slavery breelands voice rose his body was stiff his shoulders high how can any civilized man do that or have you passed beyond civilization into decadence do you no longer care where your comforts come from or who pays for them alberton was white to the lips i dont set myself up as a judge of men or of nations he said quietly perhaps i should maybe i should require every prospective purchaser to justify himself before me and account for every shot he will take with any gun i sell him and since that is manifestly preposterous then perhaps i should not sell guns at all you are reducing the argument to absurdity breeland countered splashes of pink in his cheeks the moral difference between the attacker and the defender is clear enough to any man so is the difference between the slave owner and the man who would free everyone only a sophist of the utmost hypocrisy would argue differently i could argue that the confederate who wishes to set up his own government according to his belief in what is right has more justification to his cause than the unionist who would oblige him to remain in a union he no longer wishes alberton replied but that is not the issue as you well know trace came to me before you did and i agreed to sell him armaments i do not break my word that is the point mr breeland and the only point trace has not misled me or deceived me in any way that would cause me to renege on my commitment to him i have no guns to sell you that is the sum of the situation give trace back his deposit breeland challenged him tell him you are no slaver or are you insults offend me alberton said grimly his face dark they do not change my mind i agreed to see you because i was afraid you would not leave my house until i had there is nothing more for us to discuss good evening sir breeland did not move his face was pale his hands clenched at his sides but before he could find the words to retaliate the door opened behind him and merrit alberton came in her gown was deep pink her fair hair elaborately coiled but now in some disarray her cheeks were flushed and her eyes brilliant she ignored monk glanced only briefly at breeland but deliberately stood close beside him she addressed her father what you are doing is immoral you have made a mistake in offering the guns to the confederates you would never have thought of doing it were they rebels against england her voice was rising higher and sharper all the time in her indignation if we still had slavery here would you sell guns to slave traders so they could shoot at our army and navy even our men and women in their own homes because we wanted all people to be free would you that is hardly a comparison merrit yes it is the rebels keep slaves she was shaking with emotion they buy men and women and children and use them like animals how could you sell guns to people like that have you no morality at all is it just money is that it almost unconsciously she was moving even closer to breeland who was watching with an almost impassive face merrit alberton began but she cut him off theres no argument can justify what you are doing i am so ashamed of you i can hardly bear it he made a gesture of helplessness merrit it is not so simple as again she refused to listen she still seemed unaware of monks presence her voice rose even more shrilly as her outrage drove her on yes it is you are selling guns to people who keep slaves and they are at war with their countrymen who want to prevent that and set the slaves free she flung her arm out furiously money its all about money and its pure evil i dont know how you my own father can even try to justify it let alone be part of it you are selling death to people who will use it in the worst possible cause breeland moved as if to put his hand on her arm at last albertons temper gave way merrit be quiet you dont know what you are talking about leave us alone i wont i cant she protested i do know what i am talking about lyman has told me and so do you thats the worst of it you know and still you are prepared to do it she took a step towards him ignoring monk and breeland her face crumpled brows drawn down please papa please for the sake of all the enslaved for the sake of justice and freedom above all for your own sake sell the guns to the union not to the rebels just say you cant support slavery you wont even lose any money lyman can pay you the whole amount its not about money albertons voice was also louder now and sharp with hurt for gods sake merrit you know me better than that he ignored breeland as if he had not been present i gave my word to trace and i wont break it i dont agree with slavery any more than you do but i dont agree with the unions forcing the south to remain part of it under their government either if they dont want to there are lots of different kinds of freedom theres freedom from hunger and the bondage of poverty as well as the sort of slavery youre talking about theres sophistry she said her face flooding with color youre happy enough to live here and make your own way you arent standing for parliament to try to change our lives to stop hunger and oppression youre a hypocrite it was the worst word she could think of and the bitterness of it was in her eyes and her voice breeland stared coldly at alberton it seemed at last he understood that he would not change his mind if all that merrit had said did not affect him there was nothing else for him to add i am sorry that you have seen fit to act against us sir he said stiffly but we shall prevail nevertheless we shall obtain what we need in order to win whatever sacrifice it requires of us and whatever the cost and with only a glance at merrit as if knowing she would understand he turned on his heel and strode out they heard his footsteps move sharply across the wooden floor of the hall merrit stared at her father her eyes hot and wretched i hate everything you stand for she said furiously i despise it so much i am ashamed that i live under your roof or that you paid for the food in my mouth and the clothes on my back and she too ran out her feet light and rapid heels clattering across the floor and up the stairs alberton looked at monk i am profoundly sorry monk he said miserably i had no idea you would be subjected to such unpleasantness i can only apologize before he could add anything further judith alberton appeared at the door she looked a little pale and quite obviously she had overheard at least the last part of the argument she glanced at monk embarrassed then at her husband i am afraid she is in love with mr breeland she said awkwardly or she thinks she is she watched alberton with anxiety it may take a little while daniel but she will think better of this shell be sorry she spoke so she faltered uncertain what word she could use monk took the opportunity to excuse himself he had said all he had meant to about his enquiry the albertons should be permitted privacy in which to resolve their difficulties i shall keep you informed of everything else i hear he promised thank you alberton said warmly holding out his hand i i am very sorry for this unpleasantness i am afraid emotions run very high in this american affair i think we have barely seen the beginning of it monk feared he was correct but he said no more wishing them good night and allowing the butler to show him out he woke confused wondering for a moment where he was struggling to separate the persistent noise from the last shreds of his dream he sat up quickly it was daylight but shadowy and thin the noise continued hester was awake who can it be she asked anxiously sitting upright her hair falling around her shoulders its quarter to four monk climbed out of bed and grasped his dressing gown he put it on hastily and went through to the front of the house where the knocking was now louder and more persistent he had not bothered with boots or trousers whoever it was seemed so desperate they were determined to wake someone even if it meant disturbing the entire neighborhood monk fumbled for a moment with the lock and then opened the door robert casbolt stood on the step in the thin dawn light his face unshaven his hair rumpled come in monk stepped back holding the door wide casbolt obeyed without hesitation and began speaking even before he was over the threshold im sorry to disturb you in such a frantic manner but im terribly afraid something irreparable may have happened his words stumbled as if he could barely control his tongue judithmrs alberton sent me a note she is beside herself with worry daniel left shortly after you did and he has not returned she said breeland was there yesterday evening and was very angry indeed even threatening she is terrified that im sorry he brushed his hand across his face as if to clear his vision and steady himself what is worse is that merrit has disappeared too he stared at monk with horror in his eyes she seems to have gone straight up to her room after the quarrel with her father judith assumed she would stay there in temper and probably not come down until morning monk did not interrupt but when she was unable to sleep with anxiety over daniel casbolt went on she went to merrits roomand found her gone she was nowhere in the house and her maid looked and said a bag and some of her clothes were gone a costume and at least two blouses and her hairbrush and combs for gods sake monk help me look for them please monk tried to collect his thoughts and form some clear plan as to what to do first casbolt seemed close to the edge of hysteria his voice was erratic and his body so tense his hands clenched and unclenched as if stillness were unbearable has mrs alberton called the police monk asked casbolt shook his head very slightly no that was the first thing i suggested but she was afraid if merrit has gone to breeland that she would be involved in scandal and it would ruin her she he took a deep breath honestly monk i think she is afraid breeland has done daniel some harm apparently when he left the house he was in a terrible rage and said that he would win one way or another that is true monk agreed i was there when he said it he remembered with a chill the passion in breelands voice it was the fire of the artist who creates from nothing a great vision for the world the explorer who ventures into the unknown and opens the way for lesser men the inventor the thinker the martyr who dies rather than deny the light he has seen and the fanatic who sees any act justified by the cause he serves casbolt was right to be afraid of breeland so was judith alberton yes of course ill come with you he answered ill go and dress and tell my wife ill be five minutes or less thank you thank you very much monk nodded then went hastily back to the bedroom hester was sitting up with a shawl around her who is it she asked before he had closed the door casbolt he answered taking off his dressing gown and putting on his shirt alberton went out shortly after i left and hasnt come home and merrit is missing it looks as if she might have gone after breeland stupid child can i help no thank you he fastened his shirt with clumsy fingers moving too hastily then reached for his trousers be careful what you say to her hester warned he would have been delighted to put merrit alberton over his knee and spank her until she was obliged to eat off the mantelpiece for a week it must have shown in his face because hester stood up quickly and came to him william she is young and full of ideals the harder you argue with her the more stubborn she will be fight with her and shell do the last thing she really wants to rather than be seen to give in plead for her help her understanding earn her mercy and shell be reasonable how do you know because i was sixteen once she said a trifle tartly he grinned and in love it is a natural state of affairs was he a gun buyer for a foreign army he put his jacket on there was no time to shave no actually he was a vicar she replied a vicar you in love with a vicar i was sixteen there was warm color in her cheeks he smiled and kissed her quickly feeling her respond after only an instants hesitation be careful she whispered breeland may be i know and before she could add anything further he went out and back to where casbolt was standing near the door impatiently casbolts carriage was waiting outside in the street and he climbed in ahead of monk shouting at the driver sitting huddled on the box the summer dawn was hardly cold but too chilly to wait in and the man had been woken barely halfway through his sleep the carriage lurched forward and reached a good speed within moments it was altogether fourteen minutes since casbolt had interrupted monks dream where are we going monk asked as they rolled over the cobbles and were flung together by the swerve around a corner breelands rooms casbolt answered breathlessly i nearly went straight there without you but for the cost of a street or so out of my way i could have you with me i dont know what we should find there it may need more than one of us and i formed the opinion you are a good man to have beside me in a scrapif it should come to that god knows what is in merrits mind she must have lost all sense of everything she hardly knows the man he he gasped as they were bumped again and the carriage swerved the other way this time throwing him half on top of monk he could be anything he went on the mans a fanatic prepared to sacrifice everything and everybody to his damned cause hes madder than any of our own military men and god help us they are insane enough his voice was rising with a wild note in it look at some of their antics in the crimea any price to be a heroglory of victory blood and bodies all over the place and for what fame an idea medals and a footnote in history they were clattering through a leafy square the trees making a temporary darkness damn breeland and his idiotic ideals he said in an explosion of fury he has no business preaching to a sixteenyearold girl who thinks everyone else is as noble and as uncomplicated as she is there was a startling venom in his voice a passion so deep it broke through his control and was raw in the air in the broadening light as they careered through the dawn streets monk wished there were some help he could offer but he knew that what casbolt said was true he deplored fatuous words so he remained silent suddenly the carriage drew up casbolt glanced out to make sure it was not a crossroads apparently recognized where he was and all but threw himself out monk followed after him as he strode across the pavement to a doorway opened it abruptly and went inside it was merely the outer entrance to a set of apartments and the night doorman was sitting comfortably half asleep in a chair in the hallway breelands rooms casbolt said loudly as the man started awake yes sir he scrambled to his feet fishing for his cap and setting it crookedly on his head but mr breeland int ere es gorn sir gone casbolt looked staggered he was here last night what do you mean gone where to when will he be back e wont be back sir the doorman shook his head es gorn for good paid up an took is bags not that e ad but the one when casbolt demanded what time did he go was he alone the doorman squinted i dunno sir bout alfpast eleven or summink like that were before midnight anyway was he alone casbolt persisted his body was shaking and his face was white a fine sweat on his brow no sir the doorman was definitely frightened now there were a young lady wif im very pretty fair air much as i could see of it she ad a bag wif er as well he swallowed was they elopin his breath caught in his throat and he coughed convulsively probably casbolt replied the pain naked in his voice the doorman controlled his coughing are you er father i dint know i swear ter gawd godfather casbolt replied her father may have come looking for her as well was there anyone else here the doorman screwed up his face there were a message for mr breeland but it just come wi a reglar lad took it up ter mr breeland personal an went orff again an there were someone after that too but i only just saw the back of im as e went up what time was the message casbolt said desperation rising in his voice jus afore e went orff the doorman was now thoroughly alarmed i gave mr breeland a knock an e answered the door the lad give im the message wouldnt trust me ter do it sounds as ed bin paid ter give it personal like i said an wouldnt take no for an answer about halfpast eleven monk interrupted yeah or a bit later anyway mr breeland came out jus minutes arter that wi is things in is bag and the young lady arter im and paid me wot e owes for me ter give the landlord an orff e goes an er wif im may we see his rooms casbolt asked it may tell us something although i have little hope course if yer want the doorman was more than amenable and started leading the way have you any idea what was in the note monk asked keeping pace with him any idea at all how did he look when he read it pleased surprised angry distressed pleased the doorman said immediately oh e were right pleased is face lit up an e thanked the lad give im sixpence he was clear the extravagance spoke volumes about his pleasure an in a terrible urry ter be gorn e were but did he give you any idea where to casbolt urged so agitated he moved his weight from one foot to the other unable to keep still no jus said as e ad ter urry be very quick an e were out in ten minutes e were he came to the door of breelands room and opened it stepping back to allow them in casbolt went straight past him and turned around slowly staring monk followed the room seemed stripped of all personal belongings he saw only a little crockery a bowl for water a ewer and a pile of towels there was a bible and a few scraps of waste paper on the dressing table there was nothing left to indicate who had occupied the room only a few hours before casbolt went straight to the dressing table rifling through then around pulling out the drawers he yanked the bedclothes back right to the mattress his actions growing wilder as he found not a thing beyond the landlords few furnishings theres nothing here monk said quietly casbolt swore fury and desperation sharppitched in his voice theres no point in staying monk cut across him where else can we look if breelands gone and merrit is with him perhaps alberton went after them both where would they be most likely to head casbolt put his hands up to cover his face then his body stiffened and he stared at monk wideeyed the note merrit was with him so it couldnt have been from her he was pleased by itvery pleased the only thing he cares about is the damned guns it must be to do with them he was moving towards the door already where monk went after him out into the hallway if hes held merrit to ransom then the warehouse thats where the guns are casbolt called racing to the front door and out into the street its on tooley street he shouted to the driver and pulled the door open scrambling in a stride ahead of monk the carriage lurched forward and picked up speed throwing monk hard on the seat it was moments before he was upright and had regained his balance they rode in silence each consumed by fear of what they would find it was clear daylight now and a few laborers were on their way to work they passed wagons going to the vegetable market at covent garden or others like it it was all a familiar blur they crossed the river at london bridge the water already busy with barges the smell of damp and salt coming in with the tide the light was hard a brittle reflection off the shifting surface they turned right then pulled up sharply outside high double wooden gates casbolt leapt out and ran across to them he threw his weight against them and they swung wide no lock or bar holding them monk followed and burst into the warehouse yard for an instant in the cold morning light he thought it was empty the warehouse doors were closed the windows blind the cobbles were splattered with mud clear tracks leading in several directions as if something heavy had turned there were fresh horse droppings then he saw them dark awkward mounds casbolt stood paralyzed monk walked across his stomach cold his legs shaking there were two bodies lying close to each other a third a little distance away perhaps nine or ten feet they were all in strangely contorted positions as if they had been on the ground when someone had passed a broom handle under their knees and over their arms their hands and ankles were tied preventing them from moving and they were gagged the first two were strangers monk walked over to the third his stomach sick it was daniel alberton he like the others had been shot through the head monk stared down in horror at alberton until the sound of casbolt choking brought him abruptly to the realization that they must act he turned around to see casbolt was haggard apparently incapable of moving he looked as if he might faint monk went over to him he took him by the shoulders forcing him to turn away his body under monks hands was rigid and yet curiously without balance as if the slightest blow would knock him over we we should do something casbolt said hoarsely stumbling and leaning heavily on monk get someone oh god this is he could not complete the sentence sit down monk ordered half easing him to the ground ill look around and see what i can when youre fit to you go for the police mmerrit casbolt stammered i dont think theres anyone else here monk answered im going to look stay where you are casbolt did not reply he seemed too stunned to move unaided monk turned back and walked across the cobbled yard to the bodies of the two men lying close to each other the nearest one was strongly built thickset and although it was hard to tell in his doubledup position monk guessed he was of lessthanaverage height his head and what was left of his face were covered with blood the hair still visible was light brown with no gray in it he could have been in his thirties monk swallowed hard and moved to the next body this second man seemed older his hair was sprinkled with gray his body leaner his hands gnarled his clothes had been pulled away from his shoulders at the back and there was an almost bloodless cut on his skin below and to the side of his neck it was tshaped it must have been made after death monk walked back to the first man and looked more carefully he found the same thing on his shoulder half obscured by the way he had fallen although there was so little bleeding this cut also must have been made after his heart had stopped it was a curious savage thing to do to a dead man was there great hatred behind it or some other bitter purpose it had to matter or why would anyone waste time remaining here to do it surely after such a murder one would escape as quickly as possible at first monk had been too appalled to touch the flesh to see if it was still warm he must do it now he glanced across at casbolt who was sitting on the ground staring at him he bent and touched the dead mans hand it was growing cold he touched the shoulder under the jacket and shirt there was still a trace of warmth in the flesh they must have been killed two or three hours ago at perhaps about two in the morning alberton must have arrived not long after midnight the other two must be the watchmen normally employed the relief would be coming soon he could hear the sound of carts in the street beyond the gates and now and then voices the world was awakening and beginning its day he stood up and walked over to where daniel alberton lay curled over in the same grotesque position the shooting here had been neater more of his face was recognizable the same tshaped mark was cut into his shoulder monk was startled at how angry he felt and how grieved he realized only now how much he had liked the man he had not expected such a sense of loss he understood why casbolt was so shattered he could barely move or speak they had been lifelong friends nevertheless he must make casbolt get mastery of himself and go to find the nearest constable on duty and have him fetch a senior officer and the mortuary wagon for the bodies he turned and began to walk back he was almost up to casbolt when his foot kicked something solid in the mud over the cobbles at first he thought it was a stone and he barely glanced at it but a gleam of light caught his eye and he bent to look it was metal yellow and shining he picked it up and brushed off the caked mud it was a mans watch round and simple with engraving on the back what is it casbolt asked looking up at him monk hesitated the name on the watch was lyman breeland and the date was june he put it back exactly where it had been what is it casbolt repeated his voice rising what have you got breelands gold watch monk said quietly he wished he could offer more compassion but nothing he said would alter the horror of it and they needed to act you had better gather your strength and go and fetch the police he looked closely at casbolts white face to judge if he was up to it theres bound to be a constable on the beat somewhere near here ask there are people about someonell know the guns casbolt cried staggering to his feet swaying for a moment then going at a shambling run towards the great double wooden doors of the warehouse monk followed after him and had almost caught up with him when casbolt yanked at the handle and it swung open within the visible part of the warehouse there was nothing at all no boxes crates or anything else theyre gone casbolt said hes taken them every last one and all the ammunition six thousand rifled muskets and above half a million cartridges to go with them everything breeland wanted and five hundred more besides go and find the police monk told him steadily we cant do anything here its not just robbery its triple murder casbolts jaw fell good god do you think i give a damn about the guns i just wanted to know if it was he who did this theyll hang him he turned and walked away stifflegged a little awkwardly when he was out of the yard and the main gate closed monk began again to examine the whole place this time more closely he did not go back to the bodies the sight of them beyond all human help sickened him and he did not feel there was anything he could learn from them instead he looked closely at the ground he began at the entrance it being the one place any vehicle must have come the yard was cobbled but there was a definite film of mud dust smudges of soot from nearby factory chimneys and the dried remnants of old manure with care it was possible to trace the most recent wheel tracks of at least two heavy carts coming in probably backing around and turning so their horses faced the exit and the wagons were tail to the warehouse doors he paced out roughly where the horses would have stood possibly for as long as two hours to load six thousand guns twenty to a box and all the ammunition even using the warehouse crane it would have been an immense task that would explain what the men were doing for the two hours between midnight and their deathsthey had been forced to load the guns and ammunition first he found fresh manure squashed flat by at least two sets of wheels would they have left any carts outside waiting no they would draw attention they might be remembered they would have brought them all in at the same time and had them wait idle in the yard it was large enough obviously breeland had had accomplices ready and only waiting for the word who had the message come from what had it said that they were ready wagons obtained even a ship standing by to take them out on the morning tide the police would look into that monk had no idea when the river tides were they changed slightly every day he walked all around the yard and then the inside of the warehouse but he found nothing more that told him anything beyond what was already obvious someone had brought at least two wagons more probably four sometime last night after dark probably about midnight and killed the guards and alberton and taken the guns one of them had been lyman breeland who had dropped his watch during the physical exertion of loading the cases of guns it was conceivable it had been in some other exertion a fight between his own men or with the guards or even with alberton the varieties of possibility did not alter the facts that mattered daniel alberton was dead the guns were gone so was breeland and it appeared as if merrit had gone with him whether or not she had had any idea what he planned if she was now with him willingly or as a hostage there was also no way to tell monk heard wheels stop outside and the yard gate opened a very tall thin policeman came in his limbs gangling his expression at once curious and sad his face was long and narrow and looked as if by nature it was more suited to comedy than this present stark death he was followed by an older more stolid constable and behind him an ashenfaced casbolt shivering as if with cold although it was now broad daylight and the air mild lanyon the policeman introduced himself he looked monk up and down with interest you found the bodies sir along with mr casbolt here yes we had cause to believe something was wrong monk explained mrs alberton called mr casbolt because her husband and daughter had not returned home he knew the procedure what they would need to know and why he had been in similar positions himself often enough trying to get the facts that mattered from shocked and bereaved people trying to weed out the truth from emotion preconceptions threads of half observations confusion and fear and he knew the difficulties of witnesses who say too much the shock that makes one need to talk to try to convey everything one has seen or heard to make sense of it long before there is any to use words as a bridge simply not to feel drowned by the horror i see lanyon still regarded monk closely mr casbolt says you used to be in the police yourself sir is that right so lanyon had never heard of him he was not sure whether he was pleased or not it meant they started without preconceptions now but what about later if he heard monks reputation yes not for five years he said aloud for the first time lanyon gazed around his eyes ending inevitably on the crumpled bodies twenty yards away best look at them he said quietly surgeons on his way do you know when mr alberton was last seen alive late yesterday evening his wife says he left home then it will be easy enough to confirm with the servants they were walking towards the bodies of the two guards they stopped in front of them and lanyon bent down monk could not avoid looking again there was a peculiar obscenity in the grotesqueness of their positions the sun was high enough to shed warmth into the yard there were one or two small flies buzzing one settled in the blood monk found himself almost sick with rage lanyon made a little growling sound in his throat he did not touch anything very odd he said softly looks more like a sort of execution than an ordinary murder doesnt it no man sits like that because he wants to he reached out his hand and touched the skin at the side of the nearest mans neck half under the collar monk knew he was testing the temperature and that he would come to the same conclusion he had earlier he also knew he would find the tshaped incision well lanyon said with an indrawn breath as he uncovered the cut definitely an execution of sorts he looked up at monk and the guns were all taken mr casbolt said thats right the warehouse is empty lanyon stood up brushing his hands down the sides of his trousers and stamping his feet a little as if he were cold or cramped and they were the bestquality gunsenfield p rifled musketsand a good supply of ammunition to go with them that right thats what i was told monk agreed i didnt see them well check therell be records and daytime staff the constable will keep them outside for the moment and the new watch if there is one he glanced at the bodies again the night shift cant tell us poor devils he led the way over to where alberton lay again he bent down and looked closely monk remained silent he was aware of the constable and casbolt in the distance examining the warehouse itself the doors the tracks in the thin film of mud crisscrossing where the wagons had backed and turned where they must have loaded the cases of guns lanyon interrupted his thoughts what does t stand for he said biting his lip t for thief t for traitor perhaps he stood up frowning his long face full of anger and sadness he was a plain man but there was something likable in him that dominated ones impression this mr breeland who wanted to buy the guns is american that right yes from the union lanyon scratched his chin we heard the union army executes its soldiers something like this when it has to very nasty cant see the need for it myself ordinary firing squad seems good enough to me i suppose they have their reasons why didnt mr alberton sell him the guns was he a southern sympathizer do you know i dont think so monk answered hed just committed himself to sell them to the southern buyer and he wouldnt go back on his word i dont believe for him there is any question of ideological difference between the sides just his own honor in keeping a promise he found that oddly difficult to say he saw alberton alive in his mind and then the crumpled figure on the ground its face almost unrecognizable well it cost him dear lanyon said quietly sir the constable called out i got summink ere lanyon turned the constable was holding up the watch lanyon walked over monk close behind him he took the watch from the constable and looked at it carefully the name in script was very clear to read looks like someone found this already he said glancing at monk i did i cleared the name then put it back and i presume you would have told us lanyon observed with a sharp glance he had very clear pale blue eyes his hair was straight and tended to stick out yes if you hadnt retrieved it yourselves i assumed you would lanyon said nothing he took a piece of chalk out of his pocket and marked the cobbles then gave the watch to the constable telling him to look after it not that it matters much where it was he remarked except that it cant have been there long monk pointed out if it had been in a corner it might have lain there for days lanyon eyed him curiously you doubt it was breeland no monk was honest we went to his rooms hes cleared everything out almost an hour or less before they must have come here judging by how long it would take to load the crates and how long since the men were killed yes mr casbolt told me thats what brought you here and it seems miss alberton has disappeared from home as well he did not add any conclusion yes casbolt moved forward sergeant mrs alberton doesnt yet know anything except that her daughter is missing she doesnt know about he gestured towards the bodies but did not look at them may we may monk and i go and tell her rather than i mean he swallowed convulsively can you leave her at least until tomorrow she will find this she will be devastated they were devoted both her husband and her daughter and by a man who had been a guest in her home lanyon hesitated only a moment yes sir i know of no reason why not poor lady it looks pretty plain this was a robbery carried out in a particularly vicious manner he shook his head though why they did this to them i dont know seems as if breeland felt hed been betrayed but from what you say the confederate got there first maybe there was something in the deal we dont know about well look into it but it doesnt make any difference to the murders people get cheated in business every day yes mr casbolt you and mr monk go and tell mrs alberton the news and stay there and look after her but i shall need to speak to you again later in the day thank you casbolt said with profound emotion outside in the street monk turned to him i dont know why you said i should go with you but you should tell mrs alberton alone youre her cousin i am almost a stranger and anyway i would be more use here than anywhere else he had already stopped as he spoke casbolts carriage was still waiting the driver peering anxiously up and down the street was busy with laborers dockers and other workmen arriving for their duties a cart laden with bricks passed one way a heavy wagon of coal the other casbolt shook his head impatiently we cant help daniel now his voice was hoarse his eyes looked as if he had seen hell and the image of it was stamped on him forever we must think of judith and of merrit the police may believe she went willingly with breeland or they may think she is a hostage he shook his head minutely but if they have already left england there is nothing they can do america is consumed in its own civil war there will be little or no point in anyone here making representations to washington to have breeland deported to face a charge of triple murder he will be the hero of the hour he has just taken the union enough guns to arm nearly five regiments they will simply refuse to believe he obtained them by murder he licked dry lips and there is still the matter of the blackmail please come with me see what judith would like isnt that the least we can do yes monk said softly more moved than he wished to be he dreaded going to tell judith alberton that her husband was dead he had been filled with relief that this time it was not his task he understood only too well why lanyon was willing to allow casbolt to do it and now it was inescapable he could alter nothing about what had happened but casbolt was right he might be able to help with merrit in a way the police could not and it was impossible to refuse it did not even seriously occur to him to try they rode in silence from the warehouse through the morning streets away from the heavy industrial area with its traffic and smoke the grimestained shirts and cravats of men in grays and browns moving towards other yards factories and offices still without speaking they entered the smarter city streets with men in dark suits traders clerks and paperboys calling the morning news too soon they arrived at tavistock square monk was not ready yet to face judith but he knew delaying would not help he got out of the carriage behind casbolt and followed him up the steps the front door opened before casbolt could touch the bell the butler palefaced ushered them in mrs alberton is in the withdrawing room sir he said to casbolt barely acknowledging monks presence he must have seen from casbolts face the nature of the news he brought shall i fetch her maid sir yes please casbolts voice was little above a whisper i am afraid the news is terrible you might also send word for dr gray yes sir is there anything else i can do i could use a brandy and i daresay mr monk could also it has been the worst morning of my life did you find mr alberton sir yes i am afraid he is dead the butler drew in his breath and swayed for a moment then regained his selfcontrol was it the american gentleman sir over the guns it looks like it but say nothing to anyone yet now i must go and he got no further judith opened the withdrawing room door and stood staring at them she read in casbolts agonized face what she must already have dreaded he stepped forward as if to catch her should she fall but with an effort so intense it was plain to see she steadied herself and remained upright is he dead casbolt seemed to be beyond words he merely nodded she breathed out very slowly her face ashen and merrit her voice cracked no sign of her he took her by the arm gently but almost supporting her weight there is no reason to suppose any harm has come to her he said clearly that is why i brought monk he may be able to help us come in and sit down hallows will send for dr gray and bring us some brandy please come in he turned her as he spoke half leading her into the room and monk followed after closing the door he felt like an intruder in an intensely private grief casbolt was family perhaps all she had left now they had known each other since childhood monk was an outsider judith stood in the middle of the floor and it was not until casbolt guided her to a chair that she finally sank into it she looked devastated holloweyed her skin bloodless but she did not weep what happened she asked looking at casbolt as if to lose sight of him would somehow be to abandon all help or hope we dont know he answered daniel and the two guards at the warehouse were shot it was probably very quick there will have been no pain he did not say anything about the extraordinary positions they had been in or the tshaped cuts in their flesh monk was glad he would not have told her either if she did not ever have to know so much the better if it became public it would be later when she was stronger and the guns and ammunition were all gone casbolt added breeland she whispered searching his face he was sitting close to her and she reached toward him instinctively it looks like it he replied we went to his rooms first looking for him he went on for merrit really and he was gone all his belongings everything he received a message and packed and left within a matter of minutes according to the doorman and merrit there was terror in her voice in her eyes the slender hands clenched in her lap he reached out and rested his fingers over hers we dont know she was at his rooms and left with him judith started to rock sideways shaking her head in denial she wouldnt she cant have known she would never of course not he said softly tightening his hand on hers she wont have had the faintest idea of what he intended to do and it may be he will never tell her dont think the worst there is no occasion to merrit is young full of hotheaded ideals and she was certainly swept off her feet by breeland but she is still at heart the girl you know and she loved her father in spite of the stupid quarrel what will he do to her there was agony in her eyes shell ask him how he got the guns she knows her father refused to sell them to him hell lie casbolt said simply hell say daniel changed his mind after all or that he stole them she wouldnt mind that because she believes the cause is above ordinary morality but she wouldnt ever countenance violence his voice rang with conviction and for a moment there was a flicker of hope in judiths face for the first time she turned to monk he obviously had allies monk said to her someone came to his rooms with a message he could not have moved the guns by himself there must have been at least two of them more likely three he did not mention the forced help at gunpoint he believed had been the case merrit may have been looked after by someone else during that time could she swallowed and took a moment to regain her composure could she just have eloped with breeland and neither of them had anything to do with the the guns she could not bring herself to say murder could that have been the blackmailer casbolt was startled he glanced questioningly at monk and then back at judith he didnt tell me she said quickly daniel did i knew there was something wrong and i asked him i dont believe he ever kept secrets from me the tears welled in her eyes and spilled over casbolt looked wretched and helpless he was gaunt with shock and exhaustion himself suddenly monk felt an overwhelming sympathy for him he had lost his closest friend and with the theft of the guns also a great deal of money he had seen the bodies themselves in all their grotesque horror and now he had to try to support the widow who had lost not only her husband but also her child it would be days before she even thought of her share of the financial loss if she ever did im sorry you had to know casbolt found his voice it was all very silly daniel befriended the young man because the poor creature was ill and alone he paid his bills nothing more i know she said quickly it is just a matter of reputation he went on he wanted to protect you from the distress but he would never have sold guns to the blackmailers because of where they would be used his eyes were gentle full of understood pain after all her brother had been his cousin and friend also and i dont believe he would have paid anything he added bitterly once you pay a blackmailer you have tacitly admitted that you have something to hide it never stops thats why i brought mr monk now perhaps we could still use his help he left it hanging for her to answer yes she said shaking yes i suppose we still need to find them im afraid i i hardly thought of it she turned to monk ill do whatever you want mrs alberton he promised but now id like to go with the police and see whats happening in their investigation that is the first thing to know yes again the hope flashed in her eyes maybe merrit she did not dare to put it into words it was plain in casbolts face that he held no such illusion but he could not bring himself to tell her so yes he added nodding to monk ill stay here you should see what lanyon has found go with him please consider yourself still on retainer to do that help us in any way you can make your own judgments anything at all just keep us informed please of course monk rose to his feet and excused himself he was immensely relieved to escape the house of tragedy judiths grief was painful to be so close to even though he would carry the knowledge of it with him wherever he went even so to involve himself in some physical action was a kind of relief and he strode towards gower street where he could find a hansom and go back to the warehouse from there he would start to look for lanyon he began in tooley street with the constable who had been posted outside the warehouse gates and was perfectly willing to tell him that lanyon had questioned people closely then he set off in the direction of hayes dock which was the closest point on the river with a crane at hand from which they could transfer the guns to barges of course it was possible they could have gone instead to the railway terminus or across london bridge back to the north side of the river but movement by water seemed the obvious choice and monk followed the policemans directions to the dock although he did not expect to find lanyon still there the place bustled with life now teeming with carts and wagons laden with all kinds of goods the shops were open for business and men and women carried bundles in and out they seemed to be of every possible nature groceries ships supplies ropes candles clothes for all weather both on land and at sea he walked quickly along the waterfront traveling south downriver gulls wheeled and circled their harsh cries clear above the sound of the incoming tide against the stones the wash of passing barges lighters and the occasional heavier ship and the shouts of men to each other as they worked at loading and hauling the smells of salt fish and tar were thick in his nostrils and with them came sudden memory of the distant past of being a boy on the quayside in northumberland there he was by the sea not a river looking out at an endless horizon a small stone pier and hearing the lilt of country voices then it was gone again and he was at hayes dock and the tall thin figure of lanyon was unmistakable his straight fairish hair standing up like a brush in the wind he was talking to a heavyset man with a dark grimy face and hands almost black monk knew without asking that he was a coal backer carrying sacks up the twentyfoot ladders from the holds of ships across as many as half a dozen barges to the shore and up or down more ladders depending on the tide and the loading of the ship it was a backbreaking job usually a man was past doing it anymore by the time he was forty often injury had taken its toll long before that monk could not remember how he knew it was another of the many things lost in the past but that was irrelevant now lanyon saw him and beckoned him over then resumed his questioning of the coal backer you finished at nine yesterday evening and you slept on the deck of that barge there under the awning he smiled as if he were repeating the words to clarify them sright the coal backer agreed drunk i was an me ol woman gave me an ard time of it always goin on she is never gives it a rest an the kids screamin an wailin i jus kipped down ere but i werent so tired i din ear them comin in an loadin them boxes an the like dozens of em there were went on fer an hour or more crate arter crate there was an nobody said a bleedin word not like normal folks wot talks ter each other jus back an forard back an forard with them damn great crates must a bin lead in em by the way they staggered around he shook his head gloomily any idea what time that was lanyon pressed nah ceptin it were black dark so this time o the year reckon it were between midnight an about four lanyon glanced at monk to make sure he was listening wy the coal backer asked running a filthy hand across his cheek and sniffing was they stolen probably lanyon conceded well theyre long gorn nah the man said flatly be tother side o the river past the isle o dogs be now yerve no chance o getting em back wot was they damn eavy wotever they was did the barge go up the river or down lanyon asked the man looked at him as if he were halfwitted down o course ter the pool mos like or could a bin farver ter soufend fer all i knows barges were passing them all the time on the water men called to each other the cry of gulls mixed with the rattle of chains and creak of winches how many men did you see lanyon persisted dunno two i reckon look i were tryin ter get a spot o kip a little peace i dint look at em if folks wanna shift stuff around alf the night int none o my business did you hear them say anything at all monk interrupted like wot the coal backer looked at him with surprise i said they didnt talk said nuffin nothing at all monk insisted the mans face tightened and monk knew he would now stick to his story true or not did you notice what height they were he asked instead the man thought for a moment or two making monk and lanyon wait yeah one of em were shortish the other were taller an thin very straight e stood like e ad a crick in is back but worked real ard the bit i saw he amended made enough noise clankin around lanyon thanked him and turned to walk back towards the road along the river edge monk kept level with him are you sure it was the wagon from the warehouse he asked yes lanyon said without hesitation not many people about in the middle of the night but a few and i sent men in other directions as well searched around in other yards just in case they moved them only a short way not likely but dont want to overlook anything he stepped off the curb to avoid a pile of ropes they passed horsleydown new stairs and ahead of them close together were four more wharfs before they had to bear almost a quarter of a mile inland to go around st saviours dock then back to the rivers edge and bermondsey wall and more wharfs the tower of london was sharp graywhite on the far bank a little behind them the sun was bright in patches on the water thin films of mist and smoke clouding here and there ahead of them lay the pool of london thick with forests of masts strings of barges moved slowly with the tide so heavy laden the water seemed to lap at their gunwales behind them were the dark diseaseinfested crumbling buildings of jacobs island a misnamed slum which had suffered two major outbreaks of cholera in the last decade in which thousands had died the smell of sewage and rotting wood filled the air what do you know about breeland lanyon asked increasing his stride a little as if he could escape the oppression of the place even though they were following the curve of the river into rotherhithe and what lay ahead was no better very little monk answered i saw him twice both times at albertons house he seemed to be obsessed with the union cause but i hadnt thought of him as a man to resort to this kind of violence did he mention anyone else any friends or allies no no one at all monk had been trying to remember that himself i thought he was here alone simply to arrange purchaseas was the man from the confederacy philo trace but alberton had already promised the guns to trace yes and trace had paid a half deposit that was why alberton said he couldnt go back on the deal but breeland kept trying yes he didnt seem to be able to accept the idea that for alberton it was also a matter of honor he was something of a fanatic should he have been able to foresee that breeland was so closely poised to violence that a final refusal would break his frail links with decency even perhaps sanity had preventing this been his moral task even though it was not the one for which he had been hired lanyon seemed to be deep in thought his narrow face tight with concentration they walked quickly it was half a mile around the dock and they had to avoid bales and crates piles of rope chains rusty tin men heaving loads from the towering wharf buildings across to where barges lay riding the slurping water bumping and scraping sides as the wash of a passing boat caught them the dockers were men of all ages and types it was labor anyone could do if his strength permitted it it surprised monk that he knew that somewhere in the past he had been to places like this he knew the different sorts of men as he saw them the bankrupt master butchers or bakers grocers or publicans lawyers or government clerks who had been suspended or discharged servants without references pensioners almsmen old soldiers or sailors gentlemen on hard times refugees from poland and other mideuropean countries and the usual fair share of thieves it must have been very well planned lanyon interrupted his thoughts everything worked to time the question is did he stage the quarrel just to keep himself informed about albertons movements and whether or not the guns had already gone did he know perfectly well that alberton wouldnt change his mind that had not even occurred to monk he had assumed the quarrels were as spontaneous as they had seemed breelands indignation had sounded entirely genuine could any man act so superbly breeland had not struck him as a man with sufficient imagination to simulate anything lanyon was waiting for an answer looking sideways at monk curiously it was certainly planned monk admitted reluctantly he must have had men ready to help with a wagon they must have known the river and where to hire a barge perhaps that was the message he received which made him leave his lodgings and go that night i had wondered where merrit alberton fitted in if it was her leaving home that precipitated it lanyon grunted id like to know her part in it too how much idea had she as to the kind of man breeland really is what is she nowlover or hostage shes sixteen monk replied not knowing really what he meant lanyon did not answer they were back at the waters edge on both sides of the river tall chimneys spewed out black smoke which drifted upwards staining the air massive sheds had wheels vaulting up through their roofs like the paddles of unimaginably huge steamers monk remembered from somewhere in the past that the london docks could take about five hundred ships the tobacco warehouses alone covered five acres he could smell the tobacco now along with tar sulfur the saltiness of the tide the stench of hides the fragrance of coffee all around were the noises of labor and trade shouts clanging of metal on metal scrape of wood on stone the slap of water and whine of wind a man passed them his face dyed blue with the indigo he unloaded behind him was a black man with a fancy waistcoat such as a ships mate might wear a fat man with long gray hair curling on his collar carried a brasstipped rule dripping spirit there was a stack of casks a dozen yards away he had been probing them to test their content he was a gaugerthat was his work a whiff of spice was sharp and sweet for a moment then monk and lanyon were negotiating their way around a stack of cork then yellow bins of sulfur and leadcolored copper ore somewhere twenty yards away sailors were singing as they worked keeping time lanyon stopped a brassbuttoned customs officer and explained who he was without reference to monk yes sir the customs man said helpfully wot was it about then a triple murder and robbery from a warehouse in tooley street last night lanyon said succinctly we think the goods were loaded onto a barge and sent downriver probably got this far about one or two in the morning the customs man bit his lip dubiously dunno meself but yer best chanced be to ask the watermen or mebbe even river finders they often work by night as well lookin fer bodies an the like never tell what the riverll fetch up not lookin fer bodies too are yer no lanyon said grimly we have all the bodies we need i was going to try the watermen and river finders i thought you would know of any ships bound for america from the pool especially any that might have gone this morning there was a wry expression on his lugubrious face as if he were aware of the irony of it the customs man shrugged well if there was i reckon your murderer and thief is long gone with it i know lanyon agreed itll do me no good i just have to be sure he may have accomplices here it took more than one man to do what was done last night if any englishman helped him i want to catch the swine and see him hang for it the american might be able to find some justification although not in my book but not our men theyll have done it for money well come with me into my office an ill see the customs man offered i think the princess maude might have gone on the early tide and she was bound that way but id ave ter check lanyon and monk followed obediently and found that two ships had left bound for new york that morning it took them until early afternoon to question the dockers sackmakers and ballast heavers before being satisfied that albertons guns had not gone on either vessel with a feeling of heavy disappointment they went to the ship aground for a late lunch what in hells name did he do with them then lanyon said angrily he must intend to ship them home theres no other use he would have for them he must have taken them further down monk said biting into a thick slice of beef and onion pie not a freighter something fast and light especially for this where theres no decent mooring along limehouse or the isle of dogs not for something to sail the atlantic with a load of guns greenwich maybe blackwall gravesend anywhere down the estuary for that matter monk frowned would he take a barge that far i know its late june but we can still get rough weather i think hed get it into a decent ship and up anchor as soon as possible wouldnt you yes lanyon agreed taking a long draft from his ale the room around them was packed with dockers and river men of one sort or another all eating drinking and talking the heat was oppressive and the smells thick in the throat i suppose that leaves us nothing to do but try the watermen and the finders watermen first anyone working last night might have seen something therell have been someone around there always is its just a matter of finding him like looking for a needle in a haystack customs man had a good point why bother because breeland didnt do it alone monk replied finishing the last of his pie and he certainly didnt bring a barge over from washington lanyon shot him a wry glance humor in his thin face he finished his meal as well and they stood up to leave it took them the rest of that afternoon and into the evening to work their way as far as deptford to the south of the river and the isle of dogs to the north going back and forth in the small ferryboats used by the watermen questioning all the time the following morning they started again and finally crossed from the west india port basin in blackhurst just beyond the isle of dogs over the blackwall reach to bugsbys marshes on the bend of the river beyond greenwich aint nuffin ere gents the waterman said dolefully shaking his head as he pulled on the oars yer must a bin mistook jus marsh bog an the like he fixed monk with a critical sorrowful eye having already examined his wellcut jacket clean hands and boots that fit him perfectly yer int from round ere oo tol yer there was anyfink worth yer goin ter the bugsby fer im from right around here lanyon said sharply born and raised in lewisham then yer oughter ave more sense the waterman said unequivocally ill wait for yer an take yer back less yer wanter change yer mind right now alf fare lanyon smiled were you out on the river the night before last wot of it do some nights some days why he leaned on the oars for a minute waiting till a barge went past leaving them rocking gently in its wake lanyon kept his smile half friendly half rueful as if he were an amateur experimenting at his job and hoping for a little help three men were murdered up on tooley street beyond rotherhithe a shipload of guns was stolen and brought in a barge downriver dont know how far down beyond this anyway we think they may have been loaded on board a fast light ship somewhere about here bound for america if they were you would have seen them the watermans eyes widened as he started to pull again a ship for america i never saw no ship anchored ere mind it could a bin around the point opposite the victoria docks still id a thought id see the masts like monk felt disappointment unreasonably bitter how far down the river could they go there were no watermen in the estuary unlikely to be anyone at all around before dawn although if breeland had gone that far negotiating a heavily laden barge through the pool of london at night along limehouse reach around the isle of dogs and past greenwich it would have been well into the early morning by then and full daylight by the time he reached anything like open water did you see anything he pressed aware of how the urgency in him was making his voice harsh saw a barge come down ere big black thing it were low in the water the man replied too low if yer ask me lookin fer trouble i dunno why fellas take risks like that better ter ire another barge than risk losin the lot greed thats wot it is seen some o the wrecks ter prove it ask some o them finders more men drowned through greed than anyfink else lanyon stiffened a heavyladen barge thats right went on down the river but i never saw no ship how close were you to it lanyon pressed leaning forward now his face eager gulls wheeled and circled overhead the heavy mud smell of the water was thick in the air the low marshes lay ahead of them twenty yards the waterman replied reckon they ad yer guns what did you notice tell me everything its the men im after they murdered three englishmen to get what they took one of them anyway was a good man with a wife and daughter the other two were decent enough worked hard and honestly now describe that barge do you wanter go ter the marshes or not not tell me about the barge the waterman sighed and leaned on his oars letting the boat drift gently the tide was on the turn and he could afford to allow the slack current to carry him he was concentrating trying to picture the barge in his mind again well it were very low in the water piled igh wi cargo he began couldnt see what it were cos it were covered over it werent proper light but there was streaks in the sky like so i could make out the shape of it plain an o course it ad riding lights on it he was watching lanyon two men i saw could a bin more but i jus saw two at any time i think one were tall an thin i eard im yell at the other one an e werent from round ere mind i got proper cloth ears wen it comes ter speech i dunno a geordie from a cornishman neither lanyon nor monk interrupted him but they glanced at each other for an instant then back at the waterman sitting slumped over his oars his eyes half closed the boat continued to drift very gently in the slack water i don remember the other one sayin much tall one seemed ter be in charge like givin the orders lanyon could not contain himself did you see his face the waterman looked surprised his eyes suddenly opened very wide and he stared past lanyon at the river beyond noi never saw is face clear it were still afore dawn they must a come down the river pretty good if they was from north o rotherithe but e ad a pistol in is belt i can see that clear as if e were in front o me now an e ad blood on is hands smeared like blood lanyon said sharply are you sure course im sure the waterman replied his eyes steady his face set grimly i saw it red wen e passed under the riding light an summink dark on is shirt an trousers splattered i never took no thought ter it then he rubbed his hand across his face yer reckon it were im as killed your three men in tooley street then yes lanyon said quietly i do thank you you have been extremely helpful now i need to find out where the barge went back to whose it is and what happened to the other man someone took it back up the river again never seen it come back but then i were gorn ome by then mebbe lanyon smiled well go back too if you please ive no desire to get out at bugsbys marshes it looks disgusting the waterman grinned although his face was still pale and his hands were clenched tight on the oars told yer just one more thing monk said quietly as the man leaned his weight on the oars to turn the boat the tide was beginning to run the other way and suddenly he needed to put his back into it monk could almost feel the pull on his own muscles as he watched whats that did you see any sign of a woman a young girl or she could even have been dressed as a boy perhaps the waterman was startled a woman no i never seen a woman on one o them barges what would a woman be doing out ere a hostage perhaps or maybe willingly going to board the seagoing ship farther down the river i never saw er but then them barges as cabins sort o she could a bin below gawd elp er wish id a known id a done summink he shook his head theres river police his expression betrayed that that would have been a last resort but in times of extremity he would have abandoned his own principles and turned to them lanyon shrugged ruefully monk said nothing but settled in his seat for the journey back to blackwall and then eventually to the city to tell mrs alberton that breeland had got away and there was nothing he and lanyon or anyone else could do about it monk arrived at tavistock square early in the evening he was not surprised to find casbolt there and in truth he was relieved to see him it was easier to tell him such bare facts as he had simply because his emotion could not possibly be as deep or his bereavement as dreadful as judiths he was shown into the withdrawing room immediately casbolt was standing by the empty hearth the fireplace now covered with a delicate tapestry screen he looked pale as if his composure cost him great effort judith alberton stood by the window as if she had been gazing out at the roses just the other side of the glass but she turned as monk came in the hope in her face twisted inside him with pity and with guilt because he could do nothing to help he brought no news that was of any comfort the atmosphere was electric as if the air even inside the room were waiting for thunder she stared at him as if to guess from his face what he would say trying to guard herself from pain and yet she could not let go of all hope he cleared his throat they put the guns on a barge and took them downriver as far as greenwich they must have had a ship waiting and loaded them there he looked at judith not at casbolt but he was acutely conscious of him watching hanging on every word there was no sign of merrit he added dropping his voice still further the last witness we spoke to a waterman near greenwich saw two men one tall and upright with an accent he couldnt place and a shorter heavier man but no woman sergeant lanyon who is in charge wont give up but the best we can hope for is that he finds the barge owner and proves his complicity he could prosecute him as an accomplice he thought of adding something about there being no evidence that merrit had come to any harm then knew it would be stupid nothing would have been easier than to take merrit along and dump her body as soon as they were clear of the estuary judith must surely have thought of that too if not now then she would soon in the long days ahead i see she whispered thank you for coming to tell me that it cannot have been easy casbolt moved toward her judith his face was gray twisted with pity she held up her hand quite gently but as if to keep him from coming any closer monk wondered whether if he touched her she would not be able to keep her control sympathy might be more than she could bear perhaps any emotion would be too much she walked forward very slowly to monk even in this state of distress she was remarkably beautiful and quite unlike any other woman he had ever seen with that large mouth she should have been plain but it was sensuous quick to smile in the past now tightly controlled on the edge of tears speaking all her vulnerability her high slanted cheekbones caught the light mr monk where do you believe lyman breeland has gone to america with the guns he said instantly he had no doubt of it at all and my daughter with him he was not so certain but it was the only possible answer to give her she kept her composure willingly do you believe he had no idea there were all sorts of possibilities most of them ugly i dont know but none of the people we spoke to saw anything of a struggle she swallowed with an effort she may also have been taken with him as a hostage may she not i cannot believe she would have had any willing part in her fathers death even if she did not disapprove of stealing the guns she is hotheaded and very young her voice cracked and nearly broke she does not think things through to the end but there is no malice in her she would never condone murder she forced herself to use the word and the pain of it was sharp in her voice of anyone judith casbolt protested again his agony for her naked in his face please dont torture yourself there is no way we can know what happened of course merrit would not willingly have any part in it in violence she almost certainly knows nothing of it and she is obviously in love with breeland he was standing very close to her now but he refrained from making any attempt to touch her no matter how slightly people do many extraordinary things when they are in love men and women will sacrifice anything at all for the person they care for his voice was husky as if he spoke through continual fear so intense it had become physical if breeland loves her he will never harm her no matter what else he may do you must believe that the most evil man can still be capable of love breeland is obsessed with winning his war he has lost all sight of the morality you and i would hold a necessity of civilized life but he may still treat the woman he loves with tenderness and consideration and even give his life to protect her at last he did touch her gently with trembling hands please do not fear he will harm her she has chosen to go with him she almost certainly has no idea what he has done he will keep it from her for her sake she will never know perhaps when she reaches america she may even write and tell you she is well and safe please dont despair she turned to him at last the very faintest smile on her lips my dear robert you have been a strength to me as you always have and i love you for it i trust you as i do no one else at all but i must do what i believe to be right please do not try to dissuade me i am quite determined i shall value you even more if that were possible if you could support me but regardless i must do this you have already done a great deal for us and were the situation not so desperate i would ask no more but my child is in a danger from which i can do nothing to protect her at the very best she has eloped with the man who murdered her father and he may or may not wish her harm but he is an evil man and even if he believes he loves her he cannot be the man she would wish judith casbolt began to protest she ignored him perhaps she did not even hear at worst he has no care for her and simply took advantage of her love for him to take her with him as hostage and if he fears the british police will pursue him he will use her to effect his escape when she is no longer of use to him he he may kill her also casbolt drew in his breath in a gasp monk did not argue it was true and it would be cruelty to allow her to doubt it and then have to gather her courage to face it again mr monk will you go to america and do everything you can to bring merrit back home by force if persuasion will not move her judith that is most casbolt tried again difficult she said for him but without moving her eyes from monks face i know but i must ask you to do everything that can be done i will pay all i have which is considerable to see her free of breeland and back home casbolt tightened his fingers on her arm judith even if mr monk were to succeed and bring her back willingly or unwillingly he is a man and traveling with him would compromise her so she would be effectively ruined in england if you i have thought of that she put her hand over his curling her fingers to tighten the pressure very slightly mr monk has a brave and most unusual wife we have already met her and heard something of her experience on the battlefields of the crimea she could not lack the courage the spirit or the practical ability to go to america with him and help him persuade merrit to return once merrit knows what breeland is she will need all the help we can give her casbolt closed his eyes the muscles clenched in his jaw a nerve jumping on his temple when he spoke his voice was only just audible and what if she already knows judith have you thought of that what if she loves breeland enough to forgive him it is possible to love enough to forgive anything she stared at him her eyes wide do you want her brought home even then he asked believe me if i could find any way not to have to say this to you and still care for you be honest to your happiness i would but merrit may not be as free to return to england as you think her lips trembled for a moment but she did not look away from him if she had any willing part in her fathers death however indirectly then she must come back here and answer for it loving breeland or believing in the union cause is no excuse she turned again to monk but she did not move from casbolts side or release herself from his arm i will pay passage for you and your wife to america and all expenses while you are there and whatever your charge is for your time and your skill if you will do all within your power to bring my daughter back if you are able to arrest lyman breeland as well and bring him to stand trial for the murder of my husband and the two men who died with him then so much the better justice requires that but i am not seeking vengeance i want my daughter safe and free of breeland and if she does not wish to come he asked her voice was low and soft bring her anyway i do not believe that when she realizes the full truth she will wish to remain with him i know her better sometimes than she knows herself i carried her in my own body and gave birth to her i have watched her and loved her since she first drew breath she is full of passions and dreams undisciplined too quick to judge and sometimes very foolish but she is not dishonorable she is looking for a dream to follow to give herself to but this is not it please mr monk bring her back and if she answers to the law mrs alberton he asked he had to know i do not believe she is guilty of any evil only perhaps of stupidity and momentary selfishness she answered but if she is guilty of those then she must answer there is no happiness in running away judith you dont know what you are saying casbolt protested let monk go after breeland by all means the man should swing on the end of a rope but not merrit once she is here you cannot protect her from whatever the law may do please reconsider what it may mean for her you speak as if you think her guilty she returned hurt now and angry with him no he shook his head denying it no of course not but the law is not always fair or right think of what she might suffer before you do anything so hasty she looked at monk her eyes wide pleading i shall ask my wife he replied if she is willing we will go and see if we can find merrit and if we can we shall learn the truth from her of what happened and how much she knew will you trust me to make my own decision as to whether she would be best served by coming home or remaining in america with breeland or alone she cannot do either she said desperately her voice at last beginning to crack she is sixteen what can she do alone finish up in the streets she went with breeland unmarried to him her hand tightened on casbolts still holding her what decent man would care for her breeland is at best a murderer at worst a kidnapper as well bring her back mr monk or or if she is guilty take her to ireland somewhere where she is not known and i will go and join her there i will come for her casbolts fingers clenched so tightly on hers she winced but he did not speak he stared at monk beseeching him for a better answer but there was none i will speak to my wife monk promised again i shall return tomorrow with her answer i i wish i could have brought you something better it was an idle thing to say and he knew it but he meant it so fiercely the words were spoken before he weighed their emptiness she nodded the tears at last spilling down her cheeks he said nothing more but turned and took his leave going out into the summer night with his head already full of plans hester had scarcely seen monk over the last two days he had come home late and exhausted too worn out even to eat and had washed and gone to bed almost straightaway he had risen early eaten a solitary breakfast of tea and toast and been gone again before eight he had told her nothing except that he had no hope of catching up with breeland who must be far out into the atlantic by now she could do little to help except not ask questions he could not answer and keep the kettle singing softly on the hob when he came home from judith albertons a little after nine oclock on the second evening she knew immediately that something vital had changed he was still whitefaced with distress and so weary he moved slowly as if his body ached his mouth was dry and his first glance after greeting her was at the kettle he sat down and loosed his bootlaces and was obviously waiting to talk impatiently his eyes followed her as she made him tea urging her to hurry and yet he did not begin until she brought the pot cup and milk on a tray whatever he had to say was not simple nor unmixed good or bad she found herself hurrying for her own sake as much as his he began by telling her about following the trail of evidence down the river as far as greenwich and the inevitable conclusion that the guilty had escaped the purpose of stealing the guns was to get them to america why would breeland waste even an hour but she knew from his face the urgency in his voice in spite of his words that there was something else something further to say she waited impatiently he was looking at her as if trying to weigh in his mind her reactions what is it she demanded what else mrs alberton wants us to go to america and do everything we can to bring merrit homeregardless of the circumstancesor her own wishes us who is us she said instantly his smile was tired wry you and me you and me she was incredulous go to america even as she said it she could see a glimmer of sense tiny a spark of light in the darkness if i find her he explained if i can persuade her to come back or must bring her by force i shall need help from someone else and i shall need someone to chaperon her i cant arrive in england alone with her he was watching her as if he could read not just her words but her thoughts and the emotions which lay deeper than that perhaps what she refused to think the idea was overwhelming even with the reasoning that sounded so eminently sensible to america across the atlantic to a country already in armed conflict with itself no word of pitched battles had reached england but without a miracle it would be only a matter of time before it became war yet she also saw in his eyes that he had made his own decision already not in his mind perhaps but deeper than that he had thought of plans ways to persuade her was it for the adventure of it the challenge for a sense of justice of anger for daniel alberton for the arrogance of breeland or out of a misplaced guilt because it was daniel alberton who had asked him to help and he had failed it hardly mattered that it had been breeland and not the blackmailer who had ruined him or was it pity for judith alberton who in one dreadful night had lost everything she loved most it was for judith that hester answered all right but are you sure merrit didnt have anything to do with it even unwittingly i think she was very deeply in love with breeland she thought of him as some kind of warrior saint she frowned i suppose you are sure it was breeland it couldnt possibly have been the blackmailer could it after all the price of his silence was guns no he lowered his eyes as if protecting some inner hurt i found breelands watch in the warehouse yard it couldnt have been there long there was just a little mud on it near where the cart tracks were it would have been seen by anyone in daylight and picked up and since alberton refused to sell him the guns he would have no legitimate reason to be in the yard she felt a dizzy sort of coldness sweep through her breelands watch she repeated his words what does it look like look like he was puzzled a watch a round gold watch that you wear on a chain how do you know it was his she persisted knowing argument was futile but still compelled to try because it had his name on it and the date what date a flicker of impatience crossed his face he was too tired and too hurt for quibbles what does it matter what date she insisted he was staring at her his shoulders sagged with exhaustion and disappointment june why why are you making an issue over it hester she had to tell him it was not something she could conceal allow him to go to america unknowing it wasnt breeland who dropped it she said very quietly he gave it to merrit for a keepsake she showed it to me the evening we had dinner there she said she would never let it out of her sight he looked at her as if he barely comprehended what she was saying im sorry she added but she must have been there whether it was willingly or not another thought occurred to her unless he took the watch from her and dropped it himself on purpose why on earth would he do that but she saw in his eyes that he had thought of the answer before she said it to incriminate her so we wouldnt go after him a sort of warning that he had her with him a hostage he sat silently turning it over in his mind she waited there was no point in detailing the possibilities he could think of them all as well as she could perhaps better she poured more tea for both of them well steeped and now not quite so hot mrs alberton knows he might hold her hostage he said at last she wants us to try anyway and if she went willingly she asked it had to be faced she knows merrit is hotheaded and idealistic and acts before she thinks but she doesnt believe that in any circumstances whatever she would condone murder now he was looking at her searching her eyes to read in them if she agreed i hope shes right she answered you dont think so he said quickly i dont know but what else could any woman say of her own child do you want me to refuse no the answer slipped out before she had time to weigh it surprising her more than it did him no she repeated if it were me i think i would rather have the truth than live with hope of the best and fear of the worst all my life if i loved someone i would like to think i would have the faith to put it to the test anyway it doesnt matter what i think or you its what mrs alberton wants she wants us to go to america and bring merrit back willingly or unwillingly and breeland too if we can she was startled breeland too yes hes guilty of triple murder he should stand trial and answer for it thats all in spite of herself there was a lift of desperate sarcasm in her voice just that he smiled his eyes wide and steady just that shall we she took a deep breath yes we shall the following day sunday june hester packed the few things it would be necessary for them to take almost entirely clothes and toiletries monk returned to tavistock square to give judith alberton their answer it was a sort of relief to know that at least it was the one she wished he found her alone in the study not concealing the fact that she had been waiting for him she was wearing black unrelieved by any ornament and it accentuated the pallor of her skin but her hair still had the same warmth of color and the sun streaming through the window caught the brightness of it she wished him good morning with the usual formal phrases but her eyes never left his and the question was in them betraying her emotion i spoke to my wife he said as soon as she had resumed her seat and he had sat opposite the desk she is willing to go and to do all we can to bring merrit back here he saw her relax almost smile but she was concerned that merrit may be implicated in the crime he went on even by association and that it may after all not be what you wish to happen that would be beyond our control i know that mr monk she said levelly i believe in her innocence i am prepared to take that risk and i am perfectly aware that i am taking it for her as well as for myself she bit her lip her hands on the desktop were slender whiteknuckled she wore no jewelry but her wedding ring if she were older perhaps i would not but she is still a child in spite of her opinion to the contrary and i am prepared to live with the fact that she may hate me for it i have thought about it all night and i believe absolutely that in spite of the risks of coming back to england the dangers if she remains in america with breeland are greater and there will be no one else to fight for her there she lowered her eyes from his apart from that she must face what breeland has done and if she had a part in it however small or unintended she must face that also one cannot build happiness upon lies as terrible as this there was nothing for him to say he could not argue and even to agree seemed somehow impertinent as if he were qualified to share in her pain that would belittle it then we shall go as soon as arrangements can be made he replied my wife is already packing cases i am very grateful mr monk she smiled at him faintly i have the money here and the name of the steamship company i am afraid it is in liverpool that is where they sail most frequently for new york every wednesday to be precise it will require haste to catch the next ship since this is sunday but it can be done and i beg you not to delay in the hope that you would accept i telegraphed the steamship company yesterday reserving a cabin for you she bit her lip i can have it canceled we shall go tomorrow morning he promised thank you i also have money for your use while in america i do not know how long it will take you to accomplish your task but there should be sufficient for a month it is all i can supply at such short notice my husbands affairs are naturally not disposed of yet i have sold some jewelry of my own a month should be more than enough he said quickly i hope we shall find her long before that and either she will be eager to come home if she was not aware of breelands acts or if he is holding her against her will or if she is not then we shall have to take her as soon as possible in case breeland finds a way to make it more difficult for us whatever the circumstances these will be adequate funds good she passed a large bundle of money across the desk there was no hesitation in her as if it had not crossed her mind that he would be anything but honest i should sign a receipt for this mrs alberton he prompted oh oh yes of course she reached for a piece of notepaper and picked up a pen she dipped it in the inkwell and wrote then passed the paper to him to sign he did so then gave it back she blotted it and put it away in the top drawer of the desk without glancing at it he could have written anything there was a knock on the door and a moment later it opened yes she said with a frown mr trace is here maam the butler said anxiously he is eager to speak to mr monk her brow smoothed out the mention of traces name seemed not to displease her ask him to come in she requested then turned to monk i trust you are agreeable of course he was curious that trace should still be in touch with the alberton household since the guns were now gone and he must be aware of it trace came in a moment later noticing monk but only just his attention was entirely upon judith the distress in his face was too palpable to be feigned he did not ask her how she was or express sympathy but it was naked to read in his face with its dark eyes and curious sensitive asymmetry monk was startled by it when trace spoke his words were ordinary no more than the formalities anyone might have offered good morning mrs alberton i am very sorry to intrude on you especially now but i am most concerned not to miss mr monk mr casbolt told me of your intention to employ him to go after breeland and i intend to go also this time he looked at monk for a moment as if to ascertain that he had accepted the task he was apparently satisfied judith was startled do you it was not so much after breeland but to bring back my daughter that i wish mr monk to go but of course if he could bring him back also that would be most desirable i will help any way i can trace said intently his voice charged with emotion breeland deserves to hang but of course that is far less important than saving miss alberton from him or from further grief he stood slender and very straight a little selfconscious of his hands as if he were not quite sure what to do with them he sought her company and yet he was not comfortable in it it was at that moment watching the tension in him the earnestness in his face hearing the edge to his voice that monk realized philo trace was in love with judith possibly his offer had very little to do with the guns monk was not sure if he wanted him along or not he would rather have had complete autonomy he was used to working alone or with someone who was junior to him and whom he knew on the other hand trace was american and might still have friends in washington certainly he would know the land and would be familiar with transport by both train and ship more important still he would know the manners and customs of the people and be able to facilitate events where monk might find it impossible he studied the man as he stood in the sunlit room his face turned to judith waiting for her decision not monks he looked more of a poet than a soldier but there was a selfdiscipline in him under the charm and the grace of his slender body suggested a very considerable strength thank you judith accepted for my part i should be very grateful but you must counsel with mr monk whether you join with him or not i have given him the freedom to do as he thinks best and i think that is the only circumstance in which he could undertake such a task trace looked at monk the question in his eyes i fully intend to go sir he said gravely whether i go with you or just behind you is a matter for your choice but you will need me that i swear you think we speak the same language and so you will be able to make yourself understood that is only partly true a shadow of humor crossed his face sad and selfmocking i have discovered that to my cost over here we use the same words but we dont always mean the same things by them you dont know america the state we are in at the present you cant understand the issues a sudden uncontrollable pain pulled at his lips no one does least of all ourselves we see our way of life dying we dont understand change frightens us and because we are frightened we are angry and we make bad judgments a civil war is a terrible thing sitting here in this quiet sunlit withdrawing room bright and furnished with the proceeds of munitions monk was acutely aware that he had never seen war at all at least not as far as he remembered he knew poverty violence a little of disease a great deal about crime but war as a madness that consumed nations leaving nothing untouched was unknown to him he made the decision instantly thank you mr trace with the provision that it is agreed i make my own judgments and that i am free to take your advice or to leave it i should welcome your company and such assistance as you are willing to give trace relaxed a little of the weariness easing from his face good he said succinctly then we shall leave tomorrow morning in case i do not see you at the station or on the train we shall meet at the steamship company offices in water street in liverpool the next sailing is on the first tide wednesday morning i promise i shall not let you down sir monk and hester set out for the euston square station in the morning it was a strange feeling and for hester it brought back memories of leaving seven years before to go to the crimea also not knowing what she was facing what the land would be like the climate the taste and smell of the air then it had also been with a mission filling her mind she had been so much younger in a dozen ways not just her face and her body but immeasurably so in experience and understanding of people and of how events and circumstances can change one she had been certain of far more convinced she understood herself now she knew enough to have some grasp of the magnitude of what she did not know and of how easy it was to make mistakes particularly when you were convinced you had it right she had no idea what waited for them in washington she did not know if they had any chance of succeeding in bringing merrit alberton back to england the only things she was certain of were that they could not refuse to try and most important of all this time she was going with monk not alone she was no longer young enough to be sure about much she had learned by experience her own fallibility but sitting in the train as it belched steam and lurched forward out of the vast arching canopy of the station she knew she had a sense of companionship that was different from every other journey she and monk might quarrel over all sorts of things great and trifling and frequently did their tastes and views differed but she knew as deeply as she knew anything at all that he would never willfully hurt her and that his loyalty was absolute as the steam from the engine drifted past the window and they emerged into daylight she found she was smiling what is it he asked looking across at her they were passing gray rooftops narrow streets with back alleys facing each other grimy and cramped she did not want to sound sentimental it would certainly not be good for him to tell him the truth she must say something sensible and convincing he could read her far too well to believe any hasty evasion i think it is a good thing mr trace is coming also i am sure he will be here even though we havent seen him do you think we should tell him about the watch no he said immediately i would rather wait until we hear from merrit what her account is of that night she frowned do you believe breeland could have taken it from her and dropped it deliberately that would be a very cold and terrible thing to do it would be effective he answered his face registering his contempt it would be an excellent warning that he will stop at nothing if we pursue him except that he did not know we were aware he had given it to her she argued the police would see only his name on it judith would not tell them especially if she knew it had been found no but she would know he answered his lips thinning bitterly that is all he needs he didnt count on her courage to send someone privately or on her resolve to face the truth whatever it is they were coming to the outskirts of the city now great open stretches of field spread out in the morning light trees rested like billowing clouds of green over the grass it was going to be a long day and two nights in a strange bed before they embarked on the atlantic crossing and landed again on an unknown shore she wondered fleetingly how she had had the courage or the lunacy to do it before and alone they arrived late in liverpool and it was as they were following the porter along the platform towards the way out that they saw philo trace he came striding over to them his face lighting up with relief he greeted them warmly and they went together to find a hansom directing it to a modest hotel not very far from the waterfront where they could spend the time before sailing judith alberton had telegraphed the shipping office as she had said and their berths were reserved for them it was a ship largely crowded with emigrants hoping to make a new life for themselves in america many were looking to travel west beyond the war into the open plains or even to the great rocky mountains there they could find refuge for their religious beliefs or wide lands where they could hack from the wilderness farms and homesteads they could not aspire to in england the ship was scheduled to pick up more passengers from queenstown in ireland halfstarved men and women fleeing the poverty that followed the potato famine willing to go anywhere to work at anything to make a life for their families it was a strange sensation to be at sea again the smell of the closed air of a cabin brought back to hester the troopships to the crimea more sharply than the pitch and roll of the deck the sounds of the sea of erratic waves and the wind she heard the cries of seamen one to another the creaking of timber the squawking of chickens and the squeal of pigs troubled her because she knew they were kept to be eaten as they drew farther and farther away from land and provisions became stale and short the wind was against them off the coast of ireland it would be a long crossing they were in a firstclass cabin with tiny bunks a single small basin a chamber pot to be emptied out of the porthole a small desk and a chair clothes were to be hung on a hook behind the door monk said nothing but watching his face hearing the tension in his voice she knew he found it almost unbearably oppressive she was not surprised when he went up on the deck as often as he could even when the weather was rough and the seas drove hard in their faces and cold in spite of it being early july thank heaven they had not had to travel steerage where men women and children had no more than a few square feet each and could not take a pace without bumping into someone else if a person were sick or distressed there was no privacy fellowship good temper and compassion were necessities of survival the crossing took just a day under two weeks and they landed in new york on monday july hester was fascinated new york was unlike any city she had previously seen raw teeming with life a multitude of tongues spoken laughter shouting and already the hand of war shadowing it a brittleness in the air there were recruitment posters on the walls and soldiers in a wild array of uniforms in the streets there seemed to be copies of every kind of military dress from europe and the near east even french zouaves looking like turks with enormous baggy trousers bright sashes around their waists and turbans or scarlet fezes with huge tassels hanging to the shoulder the starspangled banner flew from every hotel and church they passed and was echoed in miniature on the trappings of the omnibus horses and in rosettes on private carriages business seemed poor and the snatches of talk she overheard were of prizefights food prices local gossip and scandal politics and secession she was startled to hear suggestions that even new york itself might secede from the union or new jersey she monk and philo trace took the first available train south to washington it was crowded with soldiers in both blue and gray the same chaos of uniform prevailing here how they were meant to know one another on the battlefield hester could not imagine and the thought troubled her but she did not speak it aloud memory crowded in on her as she saw the young faces of the men tense frightened and trying desperately to hide it each in his own way some talked too much voices loud and jerky laughing at nothing a paperthin veneer of bravado others sat silently eyes filled with thoughts of home of an unknown battle ahead and perhaps death she was horrified to see how many of them had no canteens of water and carried weapons that were so old or in such a state of disrepair that they posed more danger to the men who fired them than to any enemy they were of such variety that no quartermaster could be expected to obtain ammunition for all of them they were all muzzleloaders but smoothbore not rifled some were old flintlock muskets which misfired much more often and were far less accurate than the new precision weapons that breeland had stolen hester found herself sick with anticipation of the blind slaughter which would follow if the war came to a pitched battle from the snatches of desperate youthful boasting she heard or the passion to preserve the union it could not be far away she overheard snatches of conversation during the times she stood up and stretched her back and legs a thin young redheaded man wearing a highland kilt was leaning up against the partition speaking with a freshfaced youth in gray breeches and jacket well drive those rebels right out of it the kilted youth said ardently theres no way on earth were gonna let america break up im tellin ye one nation under god thats us home by harvest i reckon the other youth said with a slow shy smile he saw hester and straightened up pardon me maam he made room for her to pass and she thanked him her heart lurching to think what he was going into so innocently from his lean body workhardened hands and threadbare clothes he clearly knew poverty and labor well but he had no conception of the carnage of battle it was something no sane person could create in the imagination she smiled back at him looking into his blue eyes for a moment then moved on you all right maam he called after her perhaps he had seen the shadow of what she knew and recognized its hurt she forced herself to sound cheerful yes thank you just stiff on the way back she passed an older man chewing on the stem of an unlit clay pipe got to go he said gravely to the bearded man opposite him way i see it theres no choice if you believe in america youve got to believe in it for everyone not just white men int right to buy an sell human beings thats the long an the short of it the other man shook his head doubtfully got cousins in the south they int bad people if all the negroes suddenly got free where are they gonna go whos gonna look after em anybody thought o that then what are you doin here the first man took the pipe out of his mouth its war the other said simply if theyre gonna fight us we gotta fight them besides i believe in the union thats what america is isnt it a union hester continued back to her seat oppressed by the sense of confusion and conflict in the air they stopped in baltimore and more people got on board as they pulled out she was sitting by the window having changed places with monk for a while they both looked out at the passing countryside opposite them philo trace sat growing more and more tense the lines in his face etched more deeply and his hands clenched together one moment moving as if to do something then knitting around each other again looking through the window hester saw for the first time pickets guarding the railroad tracks occasionally to begin with then more and more frequently she saw beyond them the pale spread of army camps they increased in both size and density as the train moved south it had been hot in new york as they approached washington the heat became suffocating clothes stuck to the skin the air seemed thick and damp heavy to breathe as they pulled into washington itself the wasteland around the outskirts was covered with tents groups of men marching and drilling whitecovered wagons and all manner of guns and carts drawn up the fever of war was only too bitterly apparent they drew into the depot and at last it was time to alight unload cases and begin to look for accommodation for such time as they would be in the city breeland will be here all right trace said with assurance the confederate armies are only about two days march away to the south we should stay at the willard if we can or at least go there to dine its the best place to pick up the news and hear all the gossip he smiled with painful amusement i think youll hate the noise most english people do but we havent time to indulge in dislikes senators diplomats traders adventurers all meet thereand their wives the place is usually full of women and even children too an evening there and ill know where breeland is i promise you hester was fascinated with the city even more than new york had been it was unlike any she had seen before it was apparently designed with a grand vision one day to cover the whole of the land from the bladensburg river to the potomac but at present there were huge tracts of bare grass and scrub between outlying shanty villages before they reached the wide unpaved main thoroughfares this is pennsylvania avenue trace said sitting in the trap beside hester watching her face monk rode with his back towards them his expression a curious mixture of thought and suspense as if he were trying to plan for their mission here but his attention was constantly being taken by what he saw around him and indeed it was highly distracting on one side the buildings were truly magnificent great marble structures that would have graced any capital in the world on the other were huddled lodging houses cheap markets and workshops and now and then bare spaces unoccupied altogether geese and hogs wandered around with total disregard for the traffic and every so often one of the hogs would get down and roll in the deep ruts left by carriage wheels after rain had turned the street into mire there was no rain or mud now and their movement caused clouds of thick dust that choked the lungs and settled on everything far ahead of them the capitol looked at first glance like some splendid ruin from greece or rome surrounded by the wreckage of the past closer it was clear that the opposite was true it was still in the process of being built the dome had yet to be constructed and pillars blocks and statues stood amid the rubble the timber and the workers huts and the incomplete flights of steps hester wanted to say something appropriate but all words escaped her there seemed to be flies everywhere it had not occurred to her in england or even on the ship that america would feel like somewhere tropical the clammy air like a hot wet flannel wrapping they reached the willard and after a great deal of persuasion from trace were shown to two rooms hester was exhausted and overwhelmingly relieved to be for a few moments at least in private away from the noise the dust and the unfamiliar voices the heat was inescapable even here but at least she was out of the glare of the sun then she looked across at monk and saw the doubt in his face he stood very still in the center of the small room his jacket crumpled his hair sticking to his forehead she was suddenly aware of the ridiculousness of their situation it was a moment either to laugh or to cry she smiled at him he hesitated searching her eyes then slowly he smiled back and then sat down on the other side of the bed at last he began to laugh and reached over and took her in his arms falling back with her kissing her over and over again they were tired and dirty totally confused and far from home and they must not allow it to matter if they even once looked at it seriously they would be crippled from trying they met philo trace again at breakfast the following morning it was an enormous meal it put even the english country house breakfast to shame here as well as the usual ham eggs sausages and potatoes were fried oysters steak and onions and blancmange this was apparently the first of five meals to be served through the day all of equal enormity hester accepted two eggs lightly poached some excellent strawberries toast with preserves which she found far too sweet and coffee which was the best she had ever tasted philo trace looked tired his face was marked with lines of fatigue and distress there were shadows around his dark eyes and his nostrils were pinched but he was immaculately shaved and dressed and obviously he intended to make no parade of the emotions which must torment him as he saw too closely his country lurch from the oratory of war to the reality of it the hotel dining room was full mainly of men several army officers among them but there were a considerable number of women more than there would have been in a similar establishment in england hester noticed with surprise that several of the men had long flowing hair which they wore loose resting over their collars very few were cleanshaven trace leaned forward a little speaking softly ive already made a few enquiries the army left two days ago on the sixteenth going south towards manassas his voice cracked a little he could not keep the pain from it general beauregard is camped near there with the confederate forces and macdowell has gone to meet him a shadow covered his eyes i expect they have breelands guns with them or i suppose i should say mr albertons guns his food sat on his plate ignored he did not say whether he had held any hope of stopping the arms from reaching the union forces hester thought him blind to reality if he had but sometimes one cannot bear to look and blindness is a necessity for a while all around them the dining room hummed with the babble of talk now and then rising in excitement or anger the air was clouded with tobacco smoke and even at halfpast eight in the morning clammily hot we cant stop that monk spoke with calm practicality we are here to find merrit alberton and take her home there was surprising compassion in his voice but if you wish to leave us and join your own people no one will ask you to remain here it may even be dangerous for you trace shrugged very slightly there are still plenty of southerners about probably every man you see here with long hair comes from the south the slave states as they refer to them there was bitterness in him now its a fashion the north doesnt follow hester liked him but she had wondered many times during the journey how he could espouse something she considered an abomination by any standards an offense against natural justice she did not wish to know his answer in case she despised him for it so she had not asked she heard the suppressed anger in him now as he gave it regardless most of them have never even seen a plantation let alone thought about how it worked i havent seen many myself he gave a harsh little laugh jerky as if he had caught his breath most of us in the south are small farmers working our own land you can go for dozens of miles and thats all youll see but its the cotton and the tobacco that we live on thats what we sell to the north and its what they work in their factories and ship abroad he stopped suddenly lowering his head and pushing his hand across his brow forcing his hair back so hard it must have hurt i dont really know what this war is all about why we have to be at each others throats why cant they just leave us alone of course there are bad slave owners men who beat their field slaves and their house slaves and nothing happens to them even if they kill them but theres poverty in the north as well and nobody fights about that some of the industrial cities are full of starving shivering men and womenand childrenwith nobody to take them in or feed them no one gives a damn at least a plantation owner cares for his slaves for economic reasons if not common decency neither monk nor hester interrupted him they glanced at each other but it was understood trace was speaking as much to himself as to them he was a man overwhelmed by circumstances he could neither understand nor control he was no longer even sure what he believed in only that he was losing what he loved and it was rapidly growing too late to have any effect on the horror that was increasing in pace from hour to hour hester was passionately sorry for him in the two weeks she had known him on the ship and the train to washington she had observed him in moments of solitude when there seemed a loneliness which wrapped around him like a blanket and at other times when he had had a quick empathy with other passengers also facing the unknown and trying to find the courage to do it with grace and not frighten or burden their families even further by adding to their fears aboard ship there had been one gauntfaced irishwoman with four children who struggled to comfort them and behave as if she knew exactly what she would do when they landed in a strange country without friends or a place to live and alone staring over the endless expanse of water her face had shown her terror naked it was trace who had gone and stood silently with his arm around her thin shoulders not offering platitudes simply sharing the moment and its understanding now hester could think of nothing to say to him as he faced the ruin of his country and tried to put it into words for two english people who had come on a single and possibly futile mission but who could return to peace and safety afterwards even if they had to explain failure to judith alberton we cant know what were doing trace said slowly now looking up at monk there has to be a better way legislation might take years but the legacy of war will never go away you cant change it monk replied simply but his face showed the complexity of his feelings and trace saw it and smiled very slightly i know i would be better employed addressing what we came for he acknowledged ill say it before you do we must find breelands family theyll still be here and merrit alberton will be with them he did not add if she is still alive but the thought was in the quick pulling down of his lips and it was easy to read because it was in hesters mind as well and she knew it was in monks where do we begin monk asked he glanced around the huge dining room where all the tables were full crowds of people had been coming and going all the time they had been there we must be discreet if they hear that english people are asking for them they may leave or at worst get rid of merrit traces expression tightened i know he said quietly thats why i propose to do the asking myself its what i came for at least its part of it youll also need help leaving here with her we may be able to go north but maybe not i can guide you south through richmond and charleston it will depend upon what happens in the next few days monk hated being dependent on someone else and hester read it in his face but there was no alternative and to refuse would be childish and risk even less chance of success perhaps trace was aware of that too again the ghost of a smile lit his expression learn what you can about the army he suggested movements equipment numbers morale the more we know the better we can judge which way to go when we have merrit and breeland if possible there will be plenty of war correspondents from british newspapers no one will think it odd he shrugged minutely and a shred of humor filled his eyes in this war you are neutral at least in theory in fact monk added i may wish to see breeland hang from the nearest tree but i dont tar the entire union with the same brush or the slave owners of the south traces eyes were wide or them either monk smiled back and rose to his feet the last of his breakfast unfinished come on he said to hester we are going to research a brilliant and perceptive article for the illustrated london news they spent the rest of the day moving from one place in the city to another listening to people observing those in the streets and in the foyer of the hotel seeing their anxiety sensing the frenzy in the air a few were openly afraid as if they expected the confederate armies to invade washington itself but the vast majority seemed certain of victory and had hardly any perception of what the cost would be even if they won every battle monk listened to complaints about the overwhelming presence of the army everywhere the upheaval to the city and especially the offensive odor of the drains which could not cope with the sudden influx of people and overriding everything there were the political arguments about how the issue of slavery had changed into the issue of preserving the union itself hester saw the men and women in the street especially the women who had sent their sons and husbands and brothers to the battlefront imagining glory and with only the faintest notion of what their injuries could be what horror they would be part of which would change who they were forever the amputated limbs the scarred faces and bodies would be only the outward wounds the inner ones they would not have the words to share and would be too confused and ashamed to try she had seen it before in the crimea it was one of the universals of war that it bound friend and foe together and set them apart from all those who had not experienced it however deep the loyalties that tied them twice she spoke to women in the hotel and tried to tell them how much linen they would need for bandages which simple things for keeping injured men clean like lye and vinegar and rough wine but they did not understand the scale of it the sheer number of men who would be wounded or how quickly someone can bleed to death from a shattered limb once she tried to say something about disease the way typhoid cholera and dysentery can spread through the closely packed men in an army camp like fire through a dry forest but she met only incomprehension and in one case deep offense they were good people honest compassionate and utterly blind it had been the same in england the agonizing frustration was not new to her or the rage of helplessness she did not know why it should hurt more the second time thousands of miles from home among a people who were in many ways so different from her own and whose pain she would not stay to see perhaps it was because the first time she had been ignorant herself not seeing ahead not even imagining what was to come this time she knew the reality had already bruised her once and she was still tender from it still raw in places she could not reach to heal by evening trace had already managed to find breelands parents and contrived that he and hester and monk should dine in the same place it was forced but by ten oclock they were in a small group talking and by five minutes past they were introduced how do you do hester replied first to hedley breeland an imposing man with stiff white hair and a gaze so direct it was almost discomfiting then to his wife a woman of warmer demeanor but who stood close to him and regarded him with obvious pride happy to meet you maam hedley breeland said courteously youve come at an unfortunate time they say the weather is always oppressive in washington in midsummer and right now we have problems which i daresay youve heard of even over in england she was not sure if some of that was intended as a criticism of their choice of time there was nothing in his face to mitigate the brusqueness of it mrs breeland stepped in we just wish we could make you more welcome but all our attentions are taken up with the fighting lord knows weve done everything we could to avoid it but theres no accommodating slavery its just plain wrong she smiled at hester apologetically its not just about slavery her husband corrected its about the union you cant expect foreigners to understand that but we must be truthful a flicker of annoyance crossed mrs breelands face and vanished immediately hester could not help wondering what her true feelings were what emotions filled her life of which perhaps her husband had no idea our son has just become engaged to marry an english girl mrs breeland went on and very charming she is all the courage in the world to just pack up and come out here with him all alone because her father was against it hester felt a surge of relief that merrit was here and apparently had come willingly the girl could not possibly know the truth hester felt monk stiffen beside her and tightened her hand on his arm warningly she knew a fine man when she saw him hedley breeland said with a lift of his chin she couldnt do better for herself in any country on gods green earth and she had the sense to know it fine girl is your son here hester asked disingenuously i should be delighted to meet this girl i do admire courage so much we can lose all we value in life without it breeland stared at her as if he had become aware of her existence for the first time but was now uncertain whether it pleased him or not she realized she had said something he considered vaguely unseemly perhaps breeland did not think women should express opinions on such a subject she had to force herself to think of judith alberton and bite her tongue not to tell him what she felt about the quiet courage of women the world over who bore pain oppression and unhappiness without complaint she could not contain herself entirely not all courage is obvious mr breeland she said in a small tight voice very often it consists of hiding a wound rather than showing it i cant say i understand you maam he said dismissively im afraid my son is at the battlefront where all good soldiers belong at a time like this how brave monk said in an unreadable voice but hester knew it was his coldest irony and that he was thinking of the grotesque bodies shot to death in the tooley street warehouse yard there was music laughter and the clink of glasses around them women with bare shoulders drifted by magnolia blossoms caught up in their gowns and wafting a sweet perfume it seemed to be the fashion to wear real flowers surely his fiancee is here with you hester said quickly she hoped before breeland would wonder about monks remark of course breeland replied turning to her but she is very keen to do her duty also you should be proud of her maam she has a clear vision of right and wrong and a hunger to fight for freedom for all men i admire that greatly all men are brothers and should treat each other so he made it a statement and looked to monk as if he expected to be challenged on it a wave of panic passed through hester burning her cheeks as she thought of all the answers monk might make to thatmost of them with razorcruel sarcasm but instead monk smiled perhaps a trifle wolfishly of course they should he said softly and i can see that you are doing everything within your power to make sure that they do thats right sir breeland agreed ah theres merrit miss alberton my sons fiancee he turned and they could see merrit coming towards them she was dressed in wide skirts pinched into a tiny waist and a softly draped bodice decorated with gardenias she looked flushed with excitement and quite lovely brothers hester said very softly to monk hypocrites cain and abel he replied under his breath hester swallowed her snort of abrupt laughter and turned it into a cough just as merrit saw them and stopped for an instant her face registered only shock there was a brief moment while she struggled to remember from where she recognized them then it came and she walked forward her smile uncertain but her head high hester had thought she knew how she would feel when she saw merrit again now it all vanished and she struggled to read in the girls face whether it was brazen defiance which lit her expression or if she had no idea what had happened in the warehouse yard certainly there was no fear in her at all and no apology breeland introduced them and there was a brief instant when they were all uncertain whether to acknowledge past acquaintance or not merrit drew in her breath and then did not speak hester glanced at monk good evening miss alberton he said with a slight smile just enough to be courteous mr breeland speaks very highly of you it was ambiguous committing him to nothing she blushed it obviously pleased her she looked very young for all the womanly curves of her body and the romantic gown hester could see the child in her it did not take much imagination to put her back in the schoolroom with her hair down her back a pinafore on and ink on her fingers in a wild moment hester longed for any escape from the truth any answer but the dead bodies in the warehouse yard and lyman breeland on his way to manassas with the union armyand daniel albertons guns they were talking and she had not heard monk answered for her somehow she stumbled through the rest of the conversation until they excused themselves and moved on to speak to someone else later that night trace came to monk and hesters room his face grave his dark eyes hollow and deep lines from nose to mouth accentuating his weariness have you made your decision he asked looking at each of them in turn hester knew what he meant she turned to monk who was standing near the window which opened over the rooftops it was close to midnight and still stiflingly hot the sounds of the city drifted up in the air along with the smell of flowers dust and tobacco smoke and the overtaxed drains that everyone complained about monk answered softly aware of other open windows we dont think she knows of her fathers death he answered we plan to tell her and what we do after that depends upon her reaction she may not believe you trace warned glancing at hester and back to monk again she certainly wont believe it was breeland hester thought of the watch she remembered merrits pride in it and how her fingers had caressed its shining surface i think we can persuade her she said grimly but i dont know what she will do when she realizes at all costs we must keep them apart monk was watching trace if he can breeland may hold her as hostage he wont go back to england without a fight his voice made it half a question hester knew he was trying to judge what stomach trace had for a confrontation and the violence that might go with it he could not have been disappointed in the reaction trace smiled and for the first time hester did not see in him the gentle man who had such pity for the irishwoman on the ship or who behaved with such charm at judith albertons dinner table nor the person who grieved for the conflict that engulfed his people she saw instead the naval officer who went to england to buy guns for war and who had beaten lyman breeland to the purchase id dearly love to take him back to face a court and answer for daniel albertons death he spoke in little above a whisper but his words were sharp and clear as steel daniel was a good man an honorable man and breeland could have taken the guns without killing him that was a barbarity that war doesnt excuse he killed out of hate because alberton refused to go back on his word to me i say we go after him unless it costs us merrit to do that well tell her tomorrow monk promised how trace asked weve thought of that monk relaxed a little and came farther into the room away from the window the battle is going to come soon perhaps as soon as tomorrow the women are preparing some sort of ambulances for the wounded hester has more experience of field surgery than anyone else here is likely to she will offer to help he saw traces look of skepticism he smiled tightly i couldnt stop her even if i didnt think it a good idea believe me neither could you trace looked uncertain but it is a good idea monk continued she can easily scrape a reacquaintance with merrit who will want to help as well they are two englishwomen caught up in the same circumstances far from home and with the same beliefs on slavery and nursing the wounded trace was still dubious are you sure he said to hester positive she answered succinctly have you ever seen a battle no he looked suddenly vulnerable as if she had unwittingly obliged him to face the reality of the coming war at last ill start in the morning she said simply trace stood up god be with you good night maam it was as uncomplicated as monk had said for hester to join the efforts of the many women trying to assemble some help for the one assistant army surgeon to each regiment and to convey supplies nearer the battlefield which was going to be almost thirty miles away a little questioning frequently interrupted by her own overwhelming sense of urgency to help what she knew was coming far better than these optimistic goodhearted and innocent women and at last she found herself in a yard with merrit alberton they were handing up rolls of linen into a cart which would serve to carry the wounded back to the nearest place where they could set up a field hospital it was dirty and exhaustingly hot the air seemed too thick to breathe clogging the lungs as if it were warm water it was a moment before merrit recognized her at first she was just another pair of arms another woman with hair tied back sleeves rolled up and skirts scuffed and stained with dirt from the unpaved streets mrs monk youre staying to help us her expression softened im so glad she pushed her hair out of her eyes with a dusty hand i hear you have experience that will be invaluable to us we are grateful she took a bundle of suppliesbandages splints a few small bottles of spiritsfrom hester well need far more than this hester said avoiding the truth for a moment although perhaps she spoke about a reality that mattered more they were hopelessly unprepared they had never seen war only dreamed it thought of great issues causes to be fought for without the faintest idea of what the cost would be well need far more vinegar and wine lint brandy more linen to make pads to stop bleeding wine merrit asked dubiously as a restorative we have enough for that for a hundred men you may have a thousand badly wounded or more merrit drew in her breath to argue then perhaps she remembered something of the conversation at the dinner table in london her face pinched with recognition that hester knew the enormity of what they were facing there was no point in saying this was different from the crimea certain things were always the same hester could not put off her mission any longer for a few moments they were alone as the other women moved away to begin a different task there was another reason i wanted to speak to you she said hating what she was about to do the pain she would cause and the judgments she must make there was no shadow of premonition in merrits face which was beaded with perspiration a smear of dust on her cheek time was short war overshadowed murder and would soon sweep it away but for every person bereaved their own loss was unique your father was killed the night you left home hester said quietly there was no way to make it kinder or blunt the edge of it nor could she afford to she monk and trace would decide their actions upon what hester judged to be merrits complicity in the crime merrit stood still as if she had not understood the words her face blank im sorry hester said slowly he was murdered in the yard of his warehouse in tooley street murdered merrit struggled for sense in what seemed incomprehensible what do you mean hester stared at her watching every shadow of emotion in her face every trace of pain confusion and grief it was grossly intrusive but if they were to keep their promises to judith alberton she had no choice he was tied up and shot she said clearly so were the two guards then the whole shipment of guns and ammunition was takenstolen merrit looked stupefied as if a friend had struck her so hard she was breathless gasping to fill her lungs her knees wobbled and she sank back and sat awkwardly on the wheel of the cart behind her still staring at hester wideeyed with horror hester could not afford to show pity not yet who who did it merrit said hoarsely philo trace because papa sold the guns to lyman after all she let out a long groan of misery and rage her hands clenched tight only with difficulty did hester restrain herself from bending to her she would have sworn to anyone to monk or to judith that merrit believed what she was saying but she must test it further this chance would never come again lyman breelands watch was found in the yard she went on the one he gave you and you swore you would never let out of your sight merrits hand unclenched and flew to her breast pocket but it was instinctive not thought because the moment after she remembered i changed my dress she said in a whisper i put it down the watch was found in the mud in the yard hester said again and there was no money paid for the guns they were stolen no thats impossible merrit stood up quickly staggering a little philo trace must have done it and i dont know what happened to the money but lyman bought the guns i was there he would never never steal and and to think he would murder is monstrous it couldnt be true and it isnt her belief was not a matter of will it was absolute shining in her face there was anger in her and grief but nothing that looked like guilt hester could not disbelieve her there was no judgment to make no weighing of evidence one way or another breeland must have taken the watch himself and left it in the yard either by mistake or intentionally but why there was a clatter of hooves and a moment later voices raised hurry get those wagons the battle will be tomorrow for certain at manassas we must get there by dawn hester responded without hesitating even an instant for thought there was only one thing to do now breeland merrit the questions of hostage or murderer must all wait there were men who the next day would be wounded and the tide of war drowned everything else horror filled her familiar as an old nightmare and she answered as she always had were coming hester and merrit left washington and set out on the journey towards bull run the immediacy of war overtook even personal tragedy and perhaps merrit at least found it easier for a few hours to think of the small practical difference she could make to the scores of men who would be wounded rather than fill her mind with what had happened in the warehouse yard in london they traveled at the best speed they could make out through the streets and then the strange open patches where one day the city might stretch across the long bridge over the river to the now almost deserted camps in alexandria the men here were those wounded in earlier skirmishes to the south and west and the numerous sick with fevers typhoid and the dysentery that plagued all such groups of people where there were no sanitary arrangements here it was even worse than it might have been in a cooler climate or among men with military training these were raw recruits with no knowledge of how to take the smallest precautions against disease lice or poisoning from spoiled or contaminated food and water each man was responsible for cooking his own provisions which were given him in bulk most of them had no idea how to ration them so they lasted and very little notion of how to cook hester passed through trying not to stop and recognize everything there was so much needless suffering and the stench of it assailed her as they joggled over the rough track in the stifling heat choked by the dust of those ahead of them she heard the groans of distress and fury mounted inside her at the agony she could picture in her mind as vividly as if scutari and the dying there were only yesterday she was clenched up inside all her muscles locked tight her body aching from the tension of it her mind trying not to picture it and failing merrit sat beside her in silence whatever her thoughts were she did not voice them she was whitefaced her eyes on the road even though it was hester who drove the cart she might have been thinking of the battlefield ahead wondering and fearful of what they would find whether they had supplies remotely fit for the task whether her own courage would be good enough her nerve steady her knowledge adequate or she might have been remembering her furious parting with her father and the things she had said to him which could not now be taken back it was too late to say she was sorry that she had not really meant it or even that for all their differences she loved him and that her love was far greater it was lifelong part of who she was or perhaps she was thinking of her mother and the grief that must now be consuming her or maybe she wondered what had happened in the warehouse yard and what had been lyman breelands part in it that was assuming she did not know and hester could not believe she did the noonday heat was almost unbearable it was over ninety even in the shade what it was in the glare of the dustchoked road could not even be guessed they drove all day stopping only as was necessary to rest the horse and allow the animal to cool itself in the shade of roadside trees and to take a little water they had to watch carefully that neither it nor they drank too much they did not speak except of the other traffic bent on the same errand as themselves or how much longer the journey would be and where they would finally settle once merrit looked as if she were going to broach the subject of breelands honor again she stood on a patch of withered grass swatting away the tiny black thunder flies that irritated all the time but at the last minute she changed her mind and spoke of the outcome of the battle instead i suppose the union will win it was not quite a question what happens to the wounded of the side that loses there was no point in indulging in euphemisms the truth would be apparent within hours to be prepared for it at least reduced the paralysis of shock if not the horror it depends how fast the battle travels hester replied with cavalry it moves on and leaves them they help each other as they can with infantry it goes only as fast as a man can run everyone does his best to stagger away to carry others to find wagons or carts or anything else to move those who cant walk merrit swallowed other wagons were passing along the road dust swirling up behind them and the dead she asked memory washed over hester with such power for a moment that her vision blurred and a wave of grief and nausea engulfed her she was back in the crimea stumbling across the floor of the valley strewn with bodies of the dead and dying after the massacre of the light brigade the earth trampled and soaked with blood the smell of blood in the air clogging her nose and throat the sounds of agony all around her she was helpless with the enormity of it she could feel the tears running down her face again and the hysteria and despair mrs monk merrits voice brought her back to the dust and sweat of the moment to virginia and to the battle yet to happen yes im sorry what happens to the dead merrits voice shook now as if she knew the answer in her heart sometimes theyre buried hester said huskily you do if you can but the living are always more important merrit turned away and went to fetch the horse there were no more questions to which she wanted to know the answers except the simple practical ones of how to harness a horse of which she had no idea they reached the small town of centreville at dusk it was no more than a stone church a hotel and a few houses lying between five and six miles from bull run creek and henry hill beyond it hester was exhausted and certainly aware of how dirty she was and she knew merrit must feel the same only she would be far less accustomed to it but the girl had a fever of enthusiasm for the union cause to spur her on and if she wondered about lyman breeland even for a moment it did not show in the deliberation with which she greeted the other women who had come to share in the work and offer their help also or the few men from the army who were detailed off for medical duties they had already turned the church into a hospital and other buildings also and seen their first casualties from earlier brief engagements the last of those who could be moved were being put into ambulances to be taken to fairfax station seven miles away and from there to alexandria a tall slender woman with dark hair seemed to be in charge there was a moment when she and hester came facetoface having given conflicting orders on the storage of supplies and who are you may i ask the woman said abruptly hester monk i nursed in the crimea with florence nightingale i thought i could be of help the anger in the womans face melted away thank you she said simply general macdowells men have been scouting the battlefield all day i think they will probably attack about dawn they cannot all be here yet but they will be by then or soon after thats if they are to attack at first light hester said quietly we had better get our rest so we have our strength to do what is necessary then do you think the woman stopped there was a moments blank fear in her face as she realized the reality was only hours away then her courage reasserted itself and the determination was back there was only the slightest tremor in her voice when she continued we cannot rest until we are certain we have done all we can our men will be marching through the night how can they have confidence in us if they find us asleep post a watch hester said simply idealism has its place and morale but common sense is what will keep us going we will need all our strength tomorrow believe me we will have to be working long after the battle itself is won or lost for us that is only the beginning even the longest battle is very short compared with the aftermath the woman hesitated merrit came into the room her face white her hair straggling out of its pins she had tied it back with a torn kerchief she looked dizzy with exhaustion we need rest hester said tired people make mistakes and our errors could cost soldiers their lives whats your name emma theres nothing more we can do now we have lint adhesive plasters bandages brandy canteens of water and instruments to hand now we need the strength to use them and a steady hand emma conceded and in weary gratitude they ate a little drank from the water canteens and settled in for what was left of the short night hester lay next to merrit and knew that she was not asleep after a little while she heard her crying quietly she did not touch her merrit needed to weep and privacy was best hester hoped if anyone else were awake and heard her they would take it for fear and leave her to conquer it without the embarrassment of being noticed monk and trace also heard word that battle was bound to commence on sunday the twentyfirst of july and that the last of the volunteers and supplies had gone out to centreville and the other tiny settlements near manassas junction ready to do all they could to help they were in the street just outside the willard hotel people were shouting a man ran out of the foyer waving his hat in the air two women clung to each other sobbing damnation trace said vehemently now theres no chance of getting breeland before the fighting itll be the devils own job to find him he could be wounded and taken back to one of the field hospitals or even evacuated back here there was never any chance of getting him before the battle monk said realistically chaos is our friend not our enemy and if hes injured well just have to leave him behind if hes killed it hardly matters except it will be harder to blacken the name of a man who died fighting for his beliefs whatever they were trace stared at him youre a pragmatic devil arent you our nation is about to tear itself apart and you can be as cold as one of your english summers monk smiled at him a wry baring of the teeth better than this suffocation he retorted ill recover from a cold in the head faster than from malaria trace sighed and smiled back but his expression was shaky too close to weeping a man careered by on horseback shouting something unintelligible sending up a cloud of dust monk stiffened our best chance of getting breeland is if we can find him in the battlefield and take him by force as if we were confederates capturing a union officer no one will think anything odd of it and from the fancy dress party of uniforms youve got no one will know who anybody else is anyway you could probably be joined by ancient greeks and romans without causing a stir from what ive seen youve already got scots with kilts french zouaves in every color of the rainbow not to mention sashes around the waist and everything on their heads from a turban to a fez they were supposed to be in gray trace said with a shake of his head and the union in blue god what a mess well be shooting friends and foes alike monk wished desperately that he could offer any comfort if it had been england fighting its own he would not know how to bear it there was nothing good or hopeful to say nothing to ease the terrible truth to try would be to show that he did not understandor worse that he did not care they took horsesthere were no more carts or carriages to be hiredand rode through the night towards manassas stopping only for a short while to rest the knowledge of what lay ahead prevented anything but the most fitful sleep by early sunday morning just before dawn they passed columns of troops marching at double speed others at a full run monk was horrified to see their sweating bodies stumbling along some with haggard faces gasping for breath in air already hot and clinging in the throat thick with tiny flies some men even threw away their blankets and haversacks and the roadside was strewn with dropped equipment later as the sky paled in the east and they got closer to the little river known as bull run there were exhausted men tripped or fallen and simply lying trying to regather some strength before they should be called upon to load their weapons and charge the enemy many of them had taken off their boots and socks and their feet were rubbed raw and bleeding monk had heard at least one officer trying to get the men to slow down but they were constantly pressed forward by those behind and had no choice but to keep moving he could see disaster closing in on them as inevitably as the heat of the coming day monk started as he heard the sharp report of a thirtypounder gun firing three rounds and he judged it to be on the side of the river he was on and aimed across to the other close to a beautiful doublearched stone bridge which took the main turnpike over the bull run it was the signal for the battle to begin he looked at trace beside him sitting half slumped in the saddle his legs covered with dust his horses flanks sweating this would be the first pitched battle between the union and the confederacy the die was cast forever no more skirmishesthis was war irrevocable monk searched traces features and saw no anger no hatred no excitement only an inner exhaustion of the emotions and a sense that somehow he had failed to grasp the vital thing which could have prevented this and now it was too late again monk tried to imagine how he would feel if this were england if these rolling hills and valleys dotted with copses of trees and small settlements were the older greener hillsides he was familiar with it was northumberland he saw in his mind the sweep of the high bare moors heathercovered in late summer the winddriven clouds the farms huddled in the lea stone walls dividing the fields stone bridges like the one crossing the creek below them the long line of the coast and the bright water beyond if it were his own land at war with itself it would wound him so the pain would never heal behind them more men were drawing up and being mustered into formation ready to attack there were carts and wagons rigged up as ambulances they had passed pointedroofed tents that would serve as field hospitals and seen men and women whitefaced trying to think of anything more they could do to be ready for the wounded to monk it had an air of farce about it could these tens of thousands of men really be waiting to slaughter each other men who were of the same blood and the same language who had created a country out of the wilderness founded on the same ideals the tension was gathering men were on the move as they had been since reveille had been sounded at two in the morning but in the dark few had been able to gather themselves their weapons and equipment and form into any sort of order hester waited in an agony of suspense as she heard the gunfire in the distance merrit kept glancing towards the door of the church where they were waiting for the first wounded nine oclock passed a few men were brought in half carried half supported the military surgeon took out a ball from one mans shoulder anothers leg now and then word came of the fighting cant take the stone bridge one wounded man gasped his hand clutching his other arm blood streaming through his fingers rebels have got a hell of a force there hester judged him to be about twenty his face gray with exhaustion eyes wide and fixed the surgeon was busy with someone else come and well bind that up for you she said gently taking him by the other arm and guiding him to a chair where she could reach him easily get me water she said over her shoulder to merrit and some for him to drink too theres thousands of them the man went on staring at hester our boys are dying all over the ground they are you can smell blood in the air i stood on someones he could not finish hester knew what he meant she had walked on battlefields where dismembered bodies lay frozen in a last horror human beings torn or blown apart she had wanted never to see it again never to allow it back into her mind she turned away from his face and found her hands shaking as she cut his sleeve off and exposed the flesh of the wound it was mangled and bleeding heavily but as far as she could judge the bone was untouched and it was certainly not arterial bleeding or he would not still be alive let alone able to have staggered to the church the main thing was to keep the wound clean and remove the shot she had seen gangrene too often the smell was one she could never forget it was worse than death a living necrosis itll be all right she meant to say it strongly reassuringly soothe away his fear but her voice was wobbly as if she herself were terrified her hands worked automatically they had done it so many times before probing delicately with tweezers trying not to hurt and knowing that it was agony searching to find the little piece of metal that had caused such damage to living tissue trying to be certain she had it all some of them fragmented leaving behind poisonous shards she had to work quickly for pain or shock which could kill and before too much blood was lost but equally she had to be sure and while she was working her mind was caught in a web of nightmare memory until she could hear the rats feet as if they were around her again scuttering on the floor their fat bodies plopping off the walls their squeaking to each other she could smell the human waste feel its texture under her feet on the boards overrun with it from men too weak to move bodies emaciated from starvation and dysentery or cholera she could see their faces holloweyed knowing they were dying hear their voices as they spoke of what they loved tried to tell each other it was worth it joked about the tomorrows they knew would never come denied the rage they had so much cause so much right to feel at their betrayal by ignorance and stupidity she could remember some of them individually a fairhaired lieutenant who had lost a leg and died of gangrene a welsh boy who had loved his home and his dog and talked of them until others told him to be quiet and teased him about it he had died of cholera there were others countless men who had perished one way or another most of them had been brave hiding their horror and their fear some had been shamed into silence to others it came naturally she had felt for all of them she had thought that the present her love for monk all the causes and the issues there were to fight now the puzzles the people who filled her life had healed the past over in forgetting but the dust the blood the smell of canvas and wine and vinegar the knowledge of pain had brought it back again with a vividness that left her shaking bewildered more drenched with horror than those new to it like merrit who had barely guessed at what was to come the sweat was running down hesters body inside her clothes and turning cold even in the suffocating airless heat she was terrified she could not cope not again she had done her share of this seen too much already she found the shot and drew it out it came followed by a gush of blood for an instant she froze she could not bear to watch one more person die this was not her war it was all monumentally stupid a terrible madness risen from the darkness of hell it must be stopped she should rush outside now and scream at them until they put away the guns and saw the humanity in all their faces every one the sameness not the difference saw their own reflections in the enemys eyes and knew themselves in it all but as her mind was racing her fingers were stitching the wound reaching for bandages pads binding it up testing that the dressing was not too tight calling for a little wine to mix with the water she heard herself comforting the man telling him what to do now how to look after the wound and to get it dressed again when he reached alexandria or wherever he would be shipped she heard his voice replying steadier than before stronger she watched him climb to his feet and stagger away supported by an orderly turning to smile before he left the tent more wounded were brought in she helped fetch roll bandages hold instruments and bottles carry things lift people speak to them ease their fear or their pain news came in of the battle much of it meant little to hester or to merrit neither of whom knew the area but whether it was good or ill was easily read on the faces of those who did some time after eleven the surgeon came in whitefaced his uniform blouse covered with blood he stopped abruptly when he saw hester what the hell are you doing he demanded his voice sliding up close to hysteria she stood up from the man whose wound she had just finished binding she turned towards the surgeon and saw the fear in his eyes he was not more than thirty and she knew that nothing in his life had prepared him for this im a nurse she said steadily ive seen war before gunshot wounds he asked yes more rebel troops have arrived on matthews hill he said watching her there are a lot more wounded coming in weve got to get them out of here she nodded he did not know what to say he was foundering in circumstances beyond his skill or imagination he was grateful for any help at all even from a woman he did not question it an hour later a man with a badly shattered arm told them with a smile through his agony that sherman had crossed the bull run river and the rebels were pulling back to henry hill there was a cheer mostly through gritted teeth from the other wounded men hester glanced across at merrit the front of her dress wrinkled and smeared with blood and saw her smile the girls eyes brightened for a moment and then she turned back to pass more bandages to the surgeon who had barely taken time to look up at the news during the next hour the wounded grew fewer the surgeon relaxed a trifle and sat down for a few moments taking time for a drink of water and wiping his hand across his brow he smiled ruefully at merrit who had been working most closely with him looks like were doing well he said with a lift in his voice well drive them back theyll know theyve had a battle maybe theyll think better of it eh merrit pushed her hair off her brow and repositioned a few of her pins its a hard price to pay though isnt it hester could still hear the gunfire cannon and rifles in the distance she felt a sickness creeping through her she wanted to escape to find some way of refusing to believe to feel anymore to be involved in it at all she understood very clearly why people go mad sometimes it is the only way to survive the unbearable when all other flight has been cut off when the body cannot remove itself and emotions cannot be deadened then the mind simply refuses to accept reality she walked away a moment before speaking if she waited too long she might not do it at all what the surgeon turned to her his voice incredulous she heard her answer hollowly as if it were someone else speaking disembodied they are still fighting cant you hear the gunfire yes it seems farther away i think he replied our boys are doing well hardly any wounded and those are slight it means the wounded havent been brought she corrected him or there are too many dead the fighting is too heavy for anyone to leave and care for them she saw the denial in his face we must go and do what we can it was definitely fear she saw in his eyes perhaps not of injury or death to himself more probably of other peoples pain and of his own inability to help she knew exactly what it was like it churned in her own stomach and made her feel sick and weak the only thing that would be worse was the hell of living with failure afterwards she had seen it in men who believed themselves cowards truly or falsely she turned towards the door we need to take water bandages instruments all we can carry she did not try to persuade him it was not a time for many words she was going he could follow or not outside she met a soldier who was climbing into a bloodspattered ambulance where are you going she asked sudley church he replied its about eight miles away nearer where the fighting is now wait hester ordered were coming and she ran back inside to get merrit the surgeon was still busy trying to evacuate the last of the wounded merrit came with her carrying as many canteens as she could manage they scrambled up into the ambulance and set out the eight miles to sudley the heat was like a furnace the glare of the sun hurt the eyes clouds of dust and gunpowder marked easily where the fighting was densest on a rise beyond the river whose course was well marked by the trees along the banks it took them over an hour and hester got off at least a mile before the hospital carrying half a dozen canteens and setting out to reach the men still lying where they had fallen she passed broken carts and wagons a few wounded horses but there was very little cavalry there were shattered weapons lying in the grass she saw one which had obviously exploded its owner was dead a couple of yards away his face blackened the ground dark with blood beside him others lay wounded she swore blindly at the ignorance and incompetence which had sent young men into battle with guns that were so old and illmade they slaughtered the users the irony brought tears of helplessness to her eyes was she really sure it would be better if they fired properly and killed whoever was in their sights instead guns were created to kill to maim cripple disfigure cause pain and fear it was their purpose the firing ahead was very heavy the sound of grape and canister being shot from cannon screamed through the air she could clearly see the lines of men bluegray against the parched grass half obscured by dust and gun smoke battle standards were high above them hanging limply in the hot air it must be after three oclock sudley church was a few hundred yards away she passed more shattered carts guns bodies of the dead the ground was red with blood one man was lying half propped against a caisson his abdomen ripped open and his intestines bulging out over his torn and bloody thighs incredibly his eyes were open he was alive this was what she hated most worse than the dead those still in agony and horror watching their own blood pour away knowing they were dying and helpless to do anything about it she wanted to walk on pretend she had not seen wipe it out of her memory but of course she could not it would have been easier to put a bullet through his head and stop the pain she bent down in front of him there aint nothin you can do for me maam he said through dry lips theres plenty o fellows further on you first she answered softly then she lowered her eyes to his dreadful wound and the hands clenched over it as if they could actually do something perhaps she could it seemed to be the outer flesh which was torn his actual organs looked undamaged she could barely see for the dirt and blood she put down the canteens of water and took out the first roll of bandages she poured water onto a pad and a little wine and began to unclench his hands and wash the dirt off the pale flesh of his intestine she tried in her mind to separate it from the live man watching her to think only of tiny detail of the little grains of earth sand the oozes of blood to keep it all clean and try to place it where it should be in the cavity of his body for a few moments she was even unaware of the heat burning her skin the sweat dripping on her face under her arms and down the hollow between her breasts she moved as quickly as she could time was short he needed to be carried from here to sudley church and then fairfax or alexandria she refused to think of failure that he might die here in the heat and sound of gunfire before she was even finished she refused to think of the other men within a stones throw of her who were in as much pain perhaps dying as she knelt here simply because there was no one to help them she could do only one thing at a time if she were to do it well enough for it to matter she was nearly finished another moment the gunfire in the distance was growing heavier she was aware of people passing her of voices and cries and the bump of a cart over the dry ruts of the ground she looked up at the mans face sick with dread that he might already be dead and that she had been laboring blindly refusing to see the truth the sweat was cold on her skin for an instant then hot he was staring back at her his eyes were sunken in his head with shock and the sweat was dry on his cheeks but he was definitely alive she smiled at him placing a clean cloth over the awful wound she had nothing with her with which to stitch it she picked up the canteen she had been using and moistened a new cloth and held it to his lips after a moment she gently washed his face it served no real purpose except to comfort and perhaps to give some kind of dignity a shred of hope an acknowledgment that he was still there and his feelings mattered urgent and individual now we need someone to move you she told him youll be all right a surgeon will sew and bandage it itll take a while to heal but it will just keep it clean all the time yes maam his voice was faint his mouth dry thank you he trailed off but his meaning was in his eyes not that she needed it the reward was in the doing and in the hope there was a little less horror and if he was lucky another life not destroyed she stood up awkwardly her muscles locked for a moment a trifle dizzy in the heat then she looked around for someone to help them there was a soldier with a broken arm another with blood splattered down his chest but apparently still able to walk after a moment she saw merrit on her way back from sudley church dirty bloodstained staggering along under a weight of water canteens she stooped every now and then to help the wounded or to look at someone and see whether he was already dead and beyond her power to aid hester told the man not to move under any circumstance and picking up her skirts she ran and stumbled across the rough turf to merrit calling out as she went merrit turned her face twisted with fear and exhaustion then she recognized hester and came to her at a run jumping over the rough tussocks of grass briefly hester told her about the man with the abdominal injury and the necessity of finding some kind of transport to take him and any other wounded they could carry to the church yes merrit said with a gulp yes ill she stopped there was panic barely concealed in her eyes all the brave words were absurd now irrelevances from another life nothing could have prepared her for the reality hester could see that she wanted to say so to deny the things she had said before she needed hester to know what she felt to acknowledge the difference of everything hester smiled at her a tiny rueful gesture there was no time to waste in explanations of how they felt the wounded came first and there was going to be no second or third go and get help hester repeated merrit dropped most of the canteens squared her shoulders and turned to obey tripping on the rough ground straightening up again then moving a little faster hester picked up the canteens and walked towards the battle tending others who were wounded seeing more and more of the dead beyond the bull run the firing never stopped and the air was thick with dust and gun smoke the heat was searing parching the mouth burning the skin finally she headed back towards the church it was a small building surrounded by farmhouses about half a mile from bull run and had become the principal depot for the union wounded the seats from the body of the church had been removed and placed outside many men were propped up awkwardly lying under trees and makeshift shelters others were in the open in the full glare of the sun some had no wounds but were suffering from the heat and dehydration all around men were groaning and crying out for help some less hurt tried to assist the two or three orderlies struggling to make order out of the chaos as hester approached the door the surgeon scarletfronted came out and dropped an arm on the pile of amputated and mangled flesh against the wall and without even seeing her turned and went back in again an ambulance came jolting over the rough ground with more wounded hester pushed open the wooden door inside the church floor had been covered over with the blankets that could be spared hay from a nearby field had been scattered in loose heaps for men to rest on there were several buckets of water some fresh others red with blood in the center of the room was the operating table instruments laid out on a board between two chairs next to it there were pools of blood making the floor slippery and dried blood darkening the smell caught in her throat in the heat it was almost choking she swallowed her nausea and began to work all the sweltering afternoon the battle went on over henry hill at first it looked to monk and breeland as if the union troops would take it it would be a crushing blow to the confederacy perhaps it would even be enough to end the open conflict then they could return to diplomacy maybe even agree that such bloodshed was too high a price to force union on a people who were prepared to die rather than accept it but by late afternoon the confederate troops were reinforced and henry hill stood against everything macdowell could throw at it henry house itself seemed unreachable crouching in a patch of scrub on the side of matthews hill and looking across the stream that he had been told was called youngs branch monk could see confederate troops holding the crown of the hill union men had been charging it again and again flags held high in the swirls of dust and gun smoke amid the trees and had been repulsed each time there were soldiers as close as twenty yards away the roar of cannon was deafening there was a constant crackle of muskets and every now and then the whine of a bullet and the spurt of dust as it hit the ground one had grazed monks arm tearing his shirt and drawing scarlet blood the sting of it shocked him slight as it was compared with the agony of others im going to find that bastard trace shouted over the din i dont give a damn what the outcome of this battle is hes not getting away with it he gave a bitter shrug unless hes dead then the devil will have beaten me to him but if gods on my side ill get to him first he shaded his eyes and stared from where he knelt across youngs branch and over to henry hill union lines stretched as far as chinn ridge to the right and all the way to henry hill to the left the wind changed a little sending the smoke across the fighting a cannonball screamed past them and scythed through the trees shearing away some branches and leaving them hanging monk wondered briefly why trace did not join the battle himself why was he so determined above all else to pursue breeland he seemed obsessive about it out of balance monk did not fight it was not his war he had no feeling for either side over the other the issue of slavery did not give him a moments thought he was irrevocably against it but he could appreciate the confederacy view that the economic oppression of the north was in actuality no better for the poor one changed deeply rooted institutions slowly but violence was not the answer neither did he understand the passion for union above all else these things were intellectual arguments to him what he felt was the reality of men maimed crippled bleeding to death here on these dusty hillsides he saw no difference between union and confederate they were all equally flesh and blood passion dreams and fears for the first time he understood something of what hester must feel as she worked with friend and foe without difference seeing only the person he hardly dared think of hester he looked at the wounded and the dying all around him and had no idea how to help them horror made him feel sick his hands shook his legs almost failed to support him he was dizzy with revulsion as his mind drowned in the abomination of it how did she keep her head bear all the pain the dreadful mutilation of bodies she had a strength beyond his power to imagine philo trace was scanning the hill ahead perhaps trying to recognize a uniform or battle colors to know where breeland might be would you go into that to look for him monk shouted yes trace answered without turning his eyes wrinkled up against the sun any southerner can fight for the confederacy and our right to decide our own fate im the only one who can take breeland back to england and show everyone what he is what a union gun buyer will do to get arms monk said nothing he could understand and it frightened him he had seen crime and poverty before individual hatred and injustice this was on a scale of enormity a national madness from which there was no escape no rational core where one could find healing or even respite over on henry hill men were killing and dying and neither side appeared to gain trace set off down the slope towards chinn ridge monk turned back there were wounded men on the ground covered in blood and dust limbs crooked lying side by side with the dead carts were overturned wood splintered gun barrels cracked and pointing to the sky wheels were tilted at crazy angles monk did what he could to help but he had no knowledge no skills to call on he did not know how to set a bone how to stop bleeding who could be moved and who would be harmed if he were moved the heat burned the skin and clogged the throat sweat stinging the eyes and wet fabric rubbed the skin raw over his bulletgrazed arm the glare of the sun was merciless flies were everywhere time and again he scrambled down the bank to the stream and filled canteens carrying them back amid a rain of gunfire to hold them up for the wounded he carried men where he knew they should be taken to the field hospitals doing what they could to stanch bleeding pad wounds splint bones there on the grass of the hillside he saw merrit at about halfpast four also carrying water stopping where the wounded were capable of drinking her skirts were torn and she looked exhausted almost sleepwalking her face was ashen her eyes filled with horror he was not certain if she even recognized him together they helped into a cart a man with a badly broken leg and another man with a crushed hand two more with heavily bleeding chest wounds and monk pulled the cart over the rough ground straining his shoulders feeling his muscles ache the bullet graze on his arm seemed to have stopped bleeding there were no horses around loose and unhurt themselves there was something in him that hated seeing an animal hurt even more than a man they had not chosen to fight they were creatures with no part in war but he knew better than to say so perhaps half the men in the battle had no will in it either no decision not driven by fear or someone elses idealism he got the cart to within twenty yards of the field hospital at sudley church he could go no farther he and merrit helped the men out and leaning on each other they staggered the last little distance the shooting sounded closer behind them as if the rebels had held henry hill and were coming down towards them inside the church he saw hester he recognized the set of her shoulders instantly square a little thin the cotton of her dress pulling tight as she moved quickly deftly her hair was scraped back poking out of its pins and a tiny strand fell down her back her skirts were filthy and several smears and splatters of blood showed even from the back his heart lurched his eyes stung with tears of pride and so powerful an admiration welled up in him that for seconds he saw only her the rest of the room was a dark cloud over the periphery of his vision there need not have been other people wounded men a man standing still uniform blue or gray another woman on her knees hester had a saw in her hand and was cutting through the bone of a mans forearm moving quickly with no hesitation no time for weighing or judging she must have done all that before she set the blade to the flesh there was light wet blood everywhere on pads and bandages on the floor in pools and spatters staining her hands scarlet and forming a dark stain on the thighs of the mans uniform his face was gray as if he were already dead she went on working the useless arm what was left of it fell to the floor and she began stanching the wound binding a loose flap of skin over it holding a pad hard so hard it compressed the vessels all the time she did not speak monk watched her tense face lips pressed together sweat running down her brow and standing out on her lip once she brushed a hair out of her eyes using the back of her wrist when she was finished and the bleeding had stopped she took a piece of cloth and dipped it into wine and held it to the mans mouth very gently his eyelids fluttered she gave him a few drops more he opened his eyes turned to focus on her face and drifted into unconsciousness again monk had no idea whether the man would live or not he did not know whether hester knew he looked at her face and could not read it in her she was beyond exhaustion not only of body but of spirit she was hardly even aware that anyone else was there let alone that it was he yet he was overwhelmed with the knowledge that he had never seen another woman so beautiful physically she was totally familiar he knew every part of her had held her touched her but the soul of her was something apart amazing and unexplored a thing that filled him with awe and it frightened him because he knew the dark regions within himself and felt he would never be worthy of what he saw in her he also knew that he would never measure or touch the end of his hunger that she would love him equally that he would be worthy of it unclouded and whole hester turned and saw him and the moment broke her eyes met his long enough for understanding and a flood of relief she spoke his name smiling then began to work again he did what he could to help increasingly aware with every moment that he had no skill he did not even know the names of the instruments she needed or the types of bandages and the blood and pain horrified him how did anyone deal with this day after day for weeks years and cling to sanity he went out again back to the battlefield and found to his quickening fear that it had moved closer it was after five in the afternoon and the union forces had not taken henry hillfar from it the rebels were streaming down the slope and hard fighting was now backing towards where he stood clouds of dust obscured the details he went back into the church the battles coming this way he said sharply we must get these men out the surgeon was there now ashenfaced moving as in a dream dont panic he said crossly it just looks closer than it is come and see it yourself man monk retorted hearing his own voice rise almost out of control the rebels are coming this way the union troops are in retreat dont be ridiculous the surgeon shouted at him if you cant keep from hysterics get out of here thats an order mister get out of our way monk went outside again shaking with anger and shame was he panicking in front of hester who was so calm in this inferno of horror he must steady himself his legs were shaking the sweat poured off his body that was heat it was like an oven no it was not panic not in him but the union forces were in complete disarray running towards him throwing weapons and cartridge belts aside hurling away anything that cumbered their flight blind terror galvanized their legs monk turned on his heel and charged back into the church theyre in retreat he yelled theyre all making for the road to washington get the wounded and get out of here everyone that can walk do it hester turned to stare at him her eyes steady questioning it was only an instant before she believed him out she ordered merrit you stay with me her eyes were still on monks she had not forgotten why they had come there was a volley of shots close outside as if it were the spur he was needing the surgeon moved at last he pushed past her and ran to the door the others following on his heels outside they stopped abruptly a small detachment of rebel cavalry was twenty yards away and approaching fast a bullet whined past hester and slammed into the church wall sending splinters flying one grazed her hand and she gasped involuntarily putting it to her lips to stop the blood the rebels stopped and the surgeon stepped forward to speak to the officer this is a field hospital he said his voice shaking will you give us safe conduct to evacuate our wounded the officer shook his head get them out the best you can but i cant give you any promise he looked him up and down and youre coming with us back to manassas junction the surgeon pleaded but the rebels would brook no argument and ten minutes later they were gone and the surgeon with them leaving monk hester merrit and the two orderlies to help the wounded they were carrying men into the carts and about to begin the journey back towards centreville and washington when a union cavalry officer rode up his arm in a sling across his chest his tunic dark with blood youll have to go west he shouted you cant go by the turnpike the bridge over cub run river is blocked theres a cart turned over on it and there are civilians all over the place sightseers out from washington to watch the battle picnic hampers an all now theyre overrun and nothing can get through not even ambulances he waved his good arm youll have to go that way he swung his horse around and headed off picking up speed and disappearing into the dust and smoke has the union really lost hester said miserably monk was standing close to her he could give his reply quietly enough in the momentary lull that even merrit could barely hear him this battle by the look of it i dont know whats going to happen along the road he could hardly believe what the cavalryman had said who on gods earth would look at this voluntarily but the shock he had expected to see in hesters face was not there he stared puzzled why did it not horrify her she read his thoughts it happened in the crimea as well she said with a sad lopsided grimace i dont know what it is a failure of the imagination some people cannot think themselves into anyone elses pain if they dont feel it themselves then it isnt real then she started to move again picking up what few belongings were most important and passing around the canteens of water to anyone who could carry them the firing was growing closer all the time but it was very sporadic now merrit was standing frozen with dismay in the distance they could hear the strange high rebel yell on the wind wheres trace hester said urgently monk made the decision in the instant even as he spoke hes gone into the battle hes hellbent on finding breeland whatever happens well have to go south if we are to get out take merrit with us it will be hard but i think trying to find our way through the chaos here and get breeland out through his own people will be next to impossible her voice caught for a moment go that way she looked towards the gunfire but even as she protested he could see in her face that she understood the reason behind his words will we be able to find trace he thought for a moment of lying was it his responsibility to comfort her show strength and hope regardless of the truth they had never told each other what was comfortable in fact they had spent the first year or two of their acquaintance being as abrupt as brutally honest as possible to do less now would be like a denial of what was precious between them a terrible condescension as if by marrying him at last she had forfeited his friendship i have no idea he said with a smile which was a little wild more than a little crooked a flash of humorand of fearin her eyes answered him he turned knowing absolutely that she would follow and bring merrit with her dragging her if she must but surely she would come willingly towards breeland the battle had become a total flight with men running and scrambling any way they knew how away from the field and towards the turnpike back to washington come hesters voice interrupted him and he felt her hand on his sleeve and winced she glanced at it nothing he said quickly a scratch she shut her eyes tightly for a moment william how could they let it come to this i thought we were the only ones so so arrogantly stupid apparently not poor devils he answered now she was no longer pulling at him it was he who turned to go taking her hand and half dragging her until she stopped looking and tore her attention away together the three of them went against the tide towards the stilladvancing confederate troops always looking for philo trace in his pale jacket and trousers against the blues and grays which were now covered in blood and dirt and barely distinguishable in the clouds of dust rising around everyone twice monk called out the name of breelands regiment to fleeing union troops the first time he was ignored the second someone waved a frantic arm and they turned and went as well as they could judge in the direction indicated the ground was littered with bodies most of them beyond all human help but the decency of burial once they heard someone crying out and hester stopped almost pulling monk off his feet a man lay with both legs shattered unable to move to help himself hester stared at him monk knew she was horrified and at the same time trying to judge what she could do to help himor if he was dying anyway monk longed to keep on going to not even look at the pain the welling blood and the despair in the mans face and at the same time as all of him shrank from it he knew he would have lost something irrevocably beautiful if hester had been willing to leave he would not have loved her less but the burning admiration would have dimmed the tears were streaming down merrits white exhausted face she had moved into that realm of nightmare where even movement was hardly real hester bent down to the man and started talking to him quietly in a level cool voice her fingers trying to move the torn and mangled cloth out of the wounds so she could see what had happened to the bone monk went to find guns fallen when fleeing men had hurled them aside he got two broke off the splintered stocks and returned with the long metal barrels and gave them to her well at last theyre good for something she said bitterly and with cloth torn from her skirt she padded the wounds and tied the barrels on tightly as splints monk held the man in his arms and gently tilted the one water bottle they had brought to his lips helping him drink thank you the man whispered hoarsely thank you we cant move you hester apologized i know maam it was too late to think of such a thing the confederate soldiers were on them long muskets were pointed then lowered when it was realized they were unarmed the wounded man was lifted up and they did not see what happened to him he was a prisoner of war but he was alive and who are you a confederate officer demanded monk told the exact truth ignoring merrit we have come to arrest a union officer and take him back to england to stand trial for murder merrit burst into denial but her words were choked with tears and there was nowhere for her to run she could not go back through the confusion of the fleeing union army she had no idea what to expect in washington no one had her only loyalty was to breeland and he was somewhere ahead of her and regardless of his reasons monk was doing all he could to find him the confederate officer thought for a moment turned and asked a man a few yards away then looked back at monk his eyes wide you must surely want him badly to come out here now or didnt you all know about this we knew monk said grimly he was a gun buyer for the north negotiating for six thousand firstclass rifles with half a million rounds of ammunition the dealer and his men were murdered and the shipment stolen for the north instead of the south i dont imagine you would be that fond of him either the officer stared at him horror in his tired face smeared with gun smoke and blood oh sweet jesus he said almost under his breath his eyes distant on the carnage of the field i hope you find him and when you do hang him high try that way he pointed with an arm monk only now noticed was bandaged and heavily seeping blood the other arm held his rifle they thanked him and moved on as directed through the dust and smoke monk ahead hester a yard behind him holding merrit by one hand half pulling her along in case in her stupefied horror she should stop and be lost they found trace first he was easier to recognize because of his white shirt and pale trousers unlike any of the uniforms he carried a pistol and monk had also picked one up from one of the dead it was quieter here on the bank on the far side of bull run the dead were everywhere on the ground it was still hot the air motionless monk could hear the flies buzzing and smell the dust cordite and blood half an hour later they found breeland dazed holding one arm crookedly as if his shoulder were dislocated still unwilling or unable to believe the battle was over and his men had fled he was seeking to help the wounded and bewildered to know how he was surrounded by confederate troops but he did not seem to realize it most of them simply passed him perhaps they mistook him for a field surgeon he no longer carried a gun and offered them no threat trace stood squarely the pistol in his hand pointing at breelands chest lyman merrit lunged forward hester had her by the hand and the impetus of her movement almost overbalanced them both dragging merrit to her knees get up trace said bitterly hell be all right he gestured to the man on the ground then jerked his hand at hester shell stop the bleeding then youre coming with us trace breeland seemed startled to see him he had not yet looked at merrit traces voice was pitched sharp on the edge of losing control his face smeared with dust and blood rivulets of sweat running down his cheeks did you think i would just let you go he demanded after all that did you think any of us would let you walk away is that your great cause he sounded on the edge of hysteria and the gun in his hand was shaking for a terrible moment monk was afraid he was going to shoot breeland right there breeland was nonplussed he stared at the gun in traces hand then up at his face what are you talking about he asked merrit swung around to hester defiance in every angle of her body and justification monk kept his gun level pointing at breeland get up he ordered now let hester tend to the soldier now slowly breeland obeyed automatically cradling his injured arm he did not reach for any weapon himself he still appeared totally confused monk was not sure if it was their questions or more probably that for him the inconceivable had happened the union had lost the battle but worse far worse they had panicked and run away that was not within his belief of the possible men of the great cause could not do that we found daniel albertons body and those of the guards monk said between his clenched teeth remembering what he had seen even though it was dwarfed by the slaughter around him now still there was a moral gulf between war and murder even if there was no physical one different kinds of men committed one from those who were caught up in the other even if the death was much the same breeland frowned at them and for the first time he looked at merrit and a rush of shame added to the confusion papa was murdered she said with difficulty forcing the words out she was too drained of emotion to weep they think you did it because they found your watch in the warehouse yard i told them you didnt but they dont believe me breeland was incredulous he looked at each of them in turn as if expecting at least one to deny it no one spoke no eye wavered you came for that his voice cracked into a squeak you came all the way over here he flung his good arm out to this because you think i murdered alberton what did you expect us to do trace said bitterly just count it as the fortune of war and forget about it he rubbed the back of his hand across his face wiping the sweat out of his eyes three men are dead not to mention six thousand guns stolen your precious union might justify that for you it doesnt to anyone else breeland shook his head i didnt kill alberton i bought the guns fairly and paid for them inexplicably completely unreasonably it was not the lie that infuriated monk it was the fact that breeland had never once touched merrit or offered her any compassion her father was dead and he was concerned only that they believed he was guilty of it were going back to england he stated you are coming with us to stand trial i cant im needed here breeland was angry as if they were being stupid you can come back with us to england to trial or i can execute you here and now trace said with a level almost flat voice and well take merrit to stand trial alone she can tell england what noble men the union soldiers are they shoot unarmed englishmen in the back of the head and leave their daughters to take the blame thats a lie breeland moved forward at last his face filled with anger trace kept the gun aimed at him then come and prove it i dont mind if you doubt ill shoot you he did not need to add the rest it was wild and glittering in his face and even breeland in his indignant dismay could not have misunderstood he stepped back a little and turned to face the creek and the way back towards the road to washington youll not succeed he said with a very slight smile gone almost before it was seen nobodys making it back that way traces contempt was like a lash your good union citizens crowded out for a sunday afternoons entertainment to watch the battle and theyre blocking the roads were going south through the confederate lines to richmond and then charleston no one will help you there in fact if they learn what youve done youll be lucky to make it all the way to the sea if you really think you can show a british court you are innocent youd be very wise to come easily and say nothing to anyone else northerners arent very popular in the confederacy right now breeland took one last aching look after the remnant of his men the clouds of dust showing their retreating route and his resistance collapsed he took a deep breath and followed after monk hester and merrit walked together a little apart from him as if to support each other trace came behind still holding the gun it took them that evening and the next day to reach richmond they traveled partly by trains begging rides where they could amid the wounded passing back from the battlefront however unlike the union troops the southerners were elated with victory and several spoke of it being the end of the war perhaps now the northerners would leave them alone and allow them to live as they chose as a separate nation hester saw in their faces a bewilderment as to why there should have been any fighting anyway among some there were jokes a kind of relief that they had been pushed to the final measure and not been found wanting breelands bruised and dislocated shoulder had been wrenched back into place and was now in a sling it must have been painful but it was not an injury that needed any further treatment his other cuts were minor most of the blood on his clothes was other peoples from when he had been trying to help the wounded monk had found him a fresh jacket not for cleanliness but in order not to give away his union loyalty like all of them he was exhausted but perhaps more than they he was heartsick he could hardly be otherwise several times hester glanced sideways at him as they rode south the sun picked out the tiny lines in his skin which were dirt ingrained and deepened by weariness his muscles seemed locked tight as if were she to touch him they would be hard his hands were clenched on his legs surprisingly large hands very strong she could see anger in him but not fear his thoughts were far away he was struggling with something within himself and they had no part in it she watched merrit who also was little aware of the lovely country through which they passed with its heavy shade trees and small rural communities they saw few men working in the fields and those they did see were white merrit could think only of breeland she did not interrupt his thoughts but she watched him with tense anxiety her face almost bloodless hester knew that in spite of her own horror and exhaustion the girl was trying to imagine herself into his sense of confusion and shame because of the way the battle had turned his beloved union not only had lost but had done so with dishonor he must feel his beliefs threatened what was there one could say to a man suffering such pain wisely she did not try hester looked also at philo trace she judged him to be almost ten years older than breeland and in the harsh sunlight tired and grimed with dust and gun smoke still the lines of his face were deeper than breelands and there were far more of them from nose to mouth and around the eyes it was a more mobile face more marked by character both laughter and pain there was not the same smoothness to it the intense control it was a private face but there was no timidity in it there was something in breelands features that frightened her it was not a presence so much as an absence something human and vulnerable she could not see or reach was it that which merrit admired or was it simply not there yet because he was younger time and experience would write it in the future or did hester imagine it all because she knew he had killed daniel alberton for the guns as coldly as if he were she had been going to think an animal but she could not have killed an animal without horror they rode in silence except for the necessary words for convenience and understanding there was nothing else to say no one seemed to wish to bridge the gulf between them with monk there was no need to speak she knew they felt similarly and the lack of words between them was companionable nearer richmond they passed large plantations and it was here that they saw black men laboring in the fields backs bent working in teams like patient animals white men kept control walking up and down watching once she saw an overseer raise a long whip and bring it down across a black mans shoulders with a sharp crack he staggered but made no cry hester felt sick it was a very slight thingit might happen dozens of times a day somewhere or otherbut it was a sign of something deeply alien to all she accepted suddenly this was a different land she was among people who practiced a way of life she could never tolerate and she found herself staring at philo trace with new thoughts she had liked him he was gentle he had humor and kindness imagination a love of beauty and a generosity of spirit how could he fight so hard to maintain a culture that did this she saw the flush on his cheeks under her gaze there are four million slaves in the south he said quietly if they revolt it will become a slaughterhouse breeland turned and stared at him with unutterable contempt he did not bother to speak merrits expression mirrored his exactly the color in traces cheeks deepened america is a rich country he went on steadily refusing to be silenced towns are springing up all over especially in the north theres industry and prosperity not if you are a colored person merrit snapped trace did not look at her a brief contemptuous smile curled her lips we export all kinds of things trace went on manufactured goods from the north where industrialists grow rich not on slave labor breeland spoke at last we profit on what we make with our own hands out of cotton trace said quietly more than half our nations exports are cotton did you know that cotton grown in the south and that doesnt count sugar rice and tobacco who do you think plants tends and picks the tobacco for your cigars breeland breeland drew in his breath sharply as if to speak then let it out again trace turned away and looked across the lovely gentle countryside there was grief and guilt in his face a love for something that was beautiful and terrible and that he feared to lose perhaps he also expected to lose it if not for everyone at least for himself they went by train first from richmond down through weldon and goldsboro to the coastal port of wilmington in north carolina from there they went inland again to florence and finally to charleston in south carolina where just over three months before the first shot of the war had been fired to start the bombardment of fort sumter monk and hester remained with breeland and merrit while trace went to make arrangements for passage to england the trip south had been tense and exhausting breeland had made no attempt to escape nor had merrit tried to help him but hester and monk were both aware that only extreme watchfulness could assure that it did not happen it was necessary for them to take turns in keeping awake with a loaded pistol always to hand once breeland glanced at hester with a look of disdain in his eyes until he considered her face more carefully and the contempt was replaced with the knowledge that she had seen more death than he had he was no longer certain that she would not shoot perhaps not to kill but certainly to cause extreme and disabling pain after that he made no attempt to escape from her vigil there was much talk in charleston of the blockade that mr lincoln had declared along the entire coastline of the south right from virginia around to texas they speculated as to whether it would succeed and there was talk of gunrunning through the bahamas or other such neutral islands but on the second day trace returned to say he had found passage and they would leave with the tide the following evening the journey back across the atlantic took only thirteen days and they seemed to have a fair wind almost all the way in every physical aspect it was a pleasure to walk on the deck in the sun with a blue sky around them and a vivid blue sea in every direction unbroken to the horizon merrit was barely recognizable as the girl she had been before the battle and its loss the determination was still there and the passion but a joy in her had been destroyed at least for a time the heroism of reality had been nothing like that of her dreams if she had also seen a vulnerability in breeland even a flaw she was too loyal to betray it even in the meeting of a glance emotionally however it was quite different when breeland had recovered from his exhaustion of body and the pain in his shoulder was considerably eased he demanded to speak with monk the cabin arrangements had been made so that trace could keep a reasonable watch upon breeland no more was necessary since escape was obviously impossible breeland refused to say anything except if monk should see him alone monk would have refused him but his own curiosity was piqued and he was moved in spite of himself by an urgency in breeland as if what he wished to impart was not merely the expected justification of his actions or an offer of some bargain in exchange for his freedom they stood on the deck a little apart from the other passengers of whom there were far fewer than on the outward voyage there were no return immigrants no one coming back from the new world to the old hoping for better opportunities greater freedoms it seemed either no one wished to or if they did they were unable to flee the war what is it monk asked a little ungraciously staring at breeland as he leaned over the rail watching the blue water churn away to the side and behind them breeland did not move or turn to face him mrs monk told merrit that my watch was found in the warehouse yard where daniel alberton was killed he said it was monk replied i found it myself i gave it to merrit for a keepsake he was still staring at the water how gallant of you monk said sarcastically not particularly breeland was dismissive it was a good watch given to me by my grandfather as a gift on my graduation i intended to marry merrit i thought then that i would be free to do so i meant how gallant of you to mention the fact now that it has been found at the scene of her fathers murder monk corrected him breeland turned slowly his face cold contempt in his gray eyes you cant possibly imagine she could have murdered her fathershot him apparently that is despicable even philo trace would not stoop to suggesting that no i dont believe it monk agreed i think you did with her there either helping you or as a hostage he smiled grimly although i did consider the possibility that you were alone and you dropped the watch there on purpose knowing we knew she had it in order to stop us from following you breeland was startled you thought id do that in gods name he stopped abruptly shaking his head his eyes wide you have no idea have you your mind your aspirations are so so low you think of abominations you have no concept of the nobility of the struggle for the freedom of others i pity you monk was surprised he was not angrier but there was a cold passion in breelands face too alien to stir such a familiar emotion in him we have different ideas of nobility he replied quite calmly i saw nothing to admire in the three dead bodies in the warehouse yard bound hand and foot and shot in the back of the head whose freedom were they limiting apart from yours to steal the guns they werent willing to sell you breeland frowned i did not kill alberton i never saw him again after i left the evening you were there it seemed to puzzle him he sent me a message that night that he had changed his mind and was willing to sell the guns to me after all at the full price and he would have his agent shearer deliver them to me at the railway station i was to tell no one because he believed trace would be annoyed when he found out and might even become violent his lips twisted into a slight sneer tragically he was right only he could not have counted on you being such a fool as to believe trace except that trace has been paying much attention to mrs alberton and she was easily flattered or had you not noticed that either perhaps like a lot of englishmen you have too much of a vested interest in the continuation of slavery to want the rebels to lose it was meant as an insult and said as such this time monk was angry startlingly so there was something in the suggestion that judith alberton had at best turned a blind eye to her husbands murder which filled him with a cold rage the remark about slavery was perhaps well founded and mattered not at all he despised slavery as much as breeland did his muscles tensed with the desire to hit breeland as hard as he could it took a great effort to use only words as weapons i have no interest in slavery he said icily perhaps you had not noticed it but we got rid of it in england a long time ago generations before you were suddenly moved to take it up although we do buy slavepicked cotton from you actually millions of dollars worth of it and tobacco too perhaps we shouldnt thats not breeland began his face a dull red the issue monk cut in his eyebrows raised no it isnt the issue is that alberton refused to sell you the guns you wanted so you murdered him and stole them what for or how noble the cause is irrelevant he could not resist sneering how brave fury and humiliation flared in breelands face i did not kill alberton he forced the words between his teeth standing upright from the rail now and facing monk the wind tugging at his hair i had no need toeven if you believe i was capable of it he sold me the guns ask shearer why dont you ask him was it conceivable for the first time monk actually considered the possibility that breeland might not be guilty breeland saw the wavering in his eyes not much of a policeman are you he said contemptuously monk was stung he knew he had allowed himself to be read so merrit gave the watch to trace who just happened to go and murder alberton minutes after someone took the guns from the warehouse yard and trace left the watch there he said in feigned amazement and unfortunately this shearer unknown to alberton or casbolt took the guns to you then took the money you paid him and disappeared he shrugged or alternately merrit gave the watch to shearer perhaps and he murdered his employer and took the guns to you his motive would be clear enough the money but why did merrit do that she did do that didnt she you have no idea where she was while you were conducting this elusive business with the vanishing mr shearer breeland drew in his breath sharply but he had no answers and the confusion in his face betrayed him he looked away at the blue water again no she was with me at the time but shell swear i bought the guns fairly from shearer and i never went anywhere near tooley street ask her of course monk did ask her although he was almost certain what she would say nothing that had happened in washington or on the battlefield or on the journey through the south to the ship had altered her devotion to breeland or the fierce defensive compassion she had for him in his armys defeat she watched him in the bitterness of his knowledge and the ache to help was naked in her face he could never have doubted her what breeland felt for her was far harder to read he was gentle with her but the wound to his pride was too raw for anyone to touch perhaps least of all the woman he loved and to whom he had spoken so fiercely of the greatness of the cause and the victory they would win he would not be the first or the last man to boast overmuch of his courage or honor but he seemed to find it harder than most to accommodate himself to a setback great or small there was no flexibility in him no capacity to mock himself or step even for an instant outside his consuming passion monk was uncertain whether he admired breeland or not perhaps it was only such men who achieved the great changes in governments or nations it might be the price of such mighty gains hester had no doubt about it she thought him innately selfish and she said so perhaps merrit understands him monk suggested to her as they walked together on the deck as the dying sun splashed across the ruffled water spilling color like fire over the blue words or gestures are not always necessary rubbish she dismissed the argument narrowing her eyes against the light and staring seawards of course they arent but a look is or a touch something shes feeling for both of them now sharing his pain and loving him desperately but what about her pain its her father whos dead not his shes not a soldier william any more than you are her eyes were very gentle searching his for the wound she could heal maybe he doesnt have nightmares about the battlefield about sudley church and the men we couldnt help but she does her lips were soft full of pain so do i perhaps we should but we need someone to hold on to maybe hes already said all he can to her he answered moving closer and putting his arm around her her face in the beautiful light was quite suddenly full of anger her eyes wide shell die of loneliness when she realizes at last that he isnt going to give her anything of himself hes always going to love the union first because its easier it doesnt ask anything back it asks everything back he protested his time his career even his life she looked at him steadily but not his laughter or his patience or generosity to forget himself for a little while she explained or think of something that perhaps doesnt interest him especially it wont ever ask him to listen instead of speaking to change his mind before hes ready to to walk a little more slowly or reconsider some of his judgments let somebody else be the hero without making a grand gesture of it he knew what she meant hell always do it on his terms she finished quietly it was like a damnation are you sure he killed alberton he asked her it was several minutes before she replied the sky was darkening and the color across the water no longer had the same heat in it the depth of the sky was indigo shadow limitless so beautiful its briefness ached inside her no matter that there would be dusk tomorrow night and the night after and after that none of them would ever be long enough and soon she would see them not across the water but over city roofs i dont know she said at last no other answer makes any sense but im not certain the ship docked at bristol and monk disembarked first leaving the others behind in traces care he went straight to the nearest police station and told them who he was and of his association with lanyon regarding the murders in tooley street which crimes had been well reported in the newspapers he told them he had brought lyman breeland back also merrit alberton and proposed to take them to london by train the police were duly impressed and offered to send a constable with them for assistance and to make sure the prisoners did not escape during the journey monk noted the use of the plural with a twinge of distress but not surprise thank you he accepted it was not willingly that he included another personit robbed him of some of his autonomybut he would require official help and it would be idiotic to risk losing all they had gained for a matter of pride and the right to make choices which probably would not make the slightest difference in the end as it was the journey was uneventful the bristol police had telegraphed ahead and lanyon was at the railway station to meet them seeing the crowds monk was relieved it might have proved very difficult to keep breeland from breaking away without help had either he or trace brandished a pistol they might well have been overpowered by some member of the public brave enough to attempt it and innocent enough to have believed breeland a victim of kidnap whether the fact that they still held merrit would have restrained him was not something on which monk would have wished to rely breeland might have justified to himself that the union cause was of greater importance than the life of one woman whoever it was he might even have convinced himself that yielding her up was his sacrifice as much as anyone elses or alternatively he could have chosen to assume she would not be charged with anything still less found guilty might that be because she was innocent or was it a fair price to pay because she too was guilty now it did not matter because lanyon was there with two constables and breeland was taken in charge and handcuffed and you miss alberton lanyon said grimly his long face wearing an expression of puzzlement and regret the light died out of merrits eyes and her shoulders drooped monk realized that at least for a while her emotions had been centered on breeland and she had allowed herself to forget her own jeopardy now it was back and real breeland moved his shoulders as if had he been free he would have touched her reassured her in some way but he was already handcuffed it was hester who put her arm around the girl we shall do all we can to get you the best help she said clearly we will go first to your mother and tell her you are alive and quite well at the moment she does not even know that merrit closed her eyes tears seeping from under the lids so close to home courage was harder to find the pain sharper until now her thoughts had all been upon breeland perhaps she had not even considered her mother but with familiar english voices around her the sights and smells of home the adventure was over and the long quiet payment for it had begun she tried to speak to thank hester but she could not do it and still keep control of herself she chose silence over lanyons shoulder monk could see a knot of people gathering glancing towards them with curiosity their faces were ugly prying ready for anger lanyon saw his gaze he looked apologetic wed better go he said hastily before they guess who you are theres a lot of bad feeling about feeling hester asked not immediately grasping what he was afraid of lanyon lowered his voice his brows drawn down in the newspapers maam theres been a good deal said about mr albertons death and foreigners coming over here and seducing young women into murder and the like i think we should leave here as quickly as we can he was very careful not to look behind him as he spoke but already monk could see the crowd thickening and faces growing uglier one or two people were quite openly staring now they seemed to be moving closer thats appalling hester was angry a flush spreading up her cheeks nobodys even been charged yet let alone tried we cant fight from here monk said sharply he could hear his own voice rising as he thought of how quickly the situation could become violent he was afraid for hester her indignation could make her careless of her own safety and a mob would distinguish little between their victim and someone who chose to protect him lanyon said exactly the same you come now quickly he ordered looking at breeland dont get any fancy ideas of causing a riot and hoping youll get away in it you wont youll just get beaten like as not and miss alberton along with you breeland hesitated a moment as if he actually weighed such a plan in his mind then looked at merrits white face and the misery in her eyes and abandoned the idea as if surrendering he lowered his head a fraction and walked obediently between lanyon and the constable merrit followed a few paces behind with the second constable leaving monk hester and philo trace on the platform we must go to mrs alberton trace said anxiously she will be distracted with worry i wish to heaven there were something we could do to clear merrit of this crime surely we can prevent her from being charged his words were positive but his voice belied them he looked at monk as if he hoped for help beyond his own power to conceive surely they wouldnt really think he trailed off he turned to hester as if to say more then saw her face they all knew merrit was in love with breeland and loyal that alone would have forbidden her from abandoning him whatever the truth of the murder she would see excusing herself as betrayal which was to her a sin of even greater evil than the original crime perhaps too late she would regret it but in any foreseeable future she would not separate herself from breeland or her fate from his well go straightaway monk agreed they were tired after the long train journey in the oppressive heat of early august hester was acutely aware of being stained with smuts from the engine fires and that at least the lower foot of her traveling dress was grimed with dust not to mention creased but she did not demur it was also nearly seven in the evening and hardly the hour to make unannounced calls upon anyone that too was irrelevant without further discussion they piled their cases upon the porters wagon and made for the exit and the nearest cab to take them to tavistock square judith alberton received them without even a pretense of formality unconsciously it was philo trace to whom she looked first we have merrit he responded his eyes softening as they met hers she is very tired and much distressed by all that has happened but she is unhurt and quite well her face flooded with relief but she hesitated as if reading her thoughts he answered she is not married to breeland and she knew nothing of her fathers death but then you cannot have imagined that she did no no of course not she gazed straight back at him as if to emphasize her words she was waiting for something else something so far unsaid she recollected herself and that monk and hester were still awaiting her acknowledgment she flushed slightly turning to them i cannot say how grateful i am to you for your courage and skill in bringing back my daughter i confess i thought i was asking the impossible ii hope you sustained no injury i cannot believe there was no hardship i i wish there were some way i could reward you more than in words or money because what you have done is greater than either we succeeded this far monk said simply that is a very considerable reward in itself i dont wish to sound graceless mrs alberton but would you accept that we did it because we also believed it to be important and not take upon yourself an additional burden of gratitude hester found herself smiling with a warmth of pride it was a generous speech and she knew it was said spontaneously she reached out her hand and placed it very lightly on his arm avoiding his gaze and moved half a step closer to him she knew he was aware of her by the slightest warmth up his cheek judith alberton was smiling also but the fear had not left her eyes she must have been far more aware than they of what the newspapers had written thank you please come and sit down are you hungry have you had any rest since you arrived they accepted gratefully without telling her exactly how arduous the journey had been they were partway through an excellent dinner when robert casbolt arrived coming straight into the dining room without waiting for the footman to announce him he glanced at the assembled company around the table but his eyes rested on judith she looked up at him without surprise as if he frequently appeared in such a way hester saw the glint of anger in traces expression masked the moment later but she thought she understood it if casbolt saw it also he gave no sign she is safe and well judith said in answer to his unspoken question something in him darkened and he could not hide the foreboding in it where is she judiths mouth tightened the police have arrested her and of course breeland they have breeland he was startled for the first time he looked fully at monk but still ignored philo trace you brought him back i commend you how did you persuade him at gunpoint monk said dryly casbolt made no attempt to hide his admiration that is truly remarkable i apologize for underestimating you i admit i had little hope you could succeed he seemed overwhelmed he pulled out one of the empty chairs and sat down he waved away the footmans offer of food or wine with a smile not taking his eyes from monk please tell me what happened i am most eager to know he did not ask judiths permission but perhaps he already understood that she would care even more than he monk began to recount their adventures condensing the tale as much as he could but frequently both casbolt and judith interrupted him asking for more detail and offering praise or expressing alarm at their danger judith particularly was distressed at the plight of the american people caught up in a terrible war it seemed there were vivid fragmented reports of the battle at bull run in the newspaper already they said the slaughter had been fearful monk said as little as he could about it while still making sense of the account judith grew more tense with every few moments her face softened once when monk very briefly spoke of merrits helping to prepare the ambulances for the wounded it must have been terrible beyond words she said huskily yes he did not offer to tell her of it and watching his face the brightness of the smooth burned skin over his cheeks hester knew it was his own pain he could not relive not judiths he was sparing she had seen how the horror had overwhelmed him how the helplessness to do anything in the face of such enormity had robbed him of his belief in himself she had experienced it herself the first time she had seen battle and for her it was not so total because she had at least some medical knowledge and a function in being there she could lose herself in the individual she could affect even if not save it was not always the success that made it bearable it was the ability to try she had seen it in him and understood but it was too raw too powerful to be touched even by her or perhaps especially by her some wounds have to heal alone or they do not heal at all did breeland not go to the battlefield after all casbolt asked incredulously yes it was there we found him and he came with you casbolt frowned in incomprehension why he did not have to surely i cannot believe his own people would give him up to answer english law the union lost monk answered offering no explanation beyond that simple sentence he said nothing of the slaughter the panic as if the men he had been defending from the shame of it were people he knew he did not look at either trace or hester or give them time to interrupt we went south through the confederate lines to richmond and then charleston no one hindered us judiths eyes were wide with fierce admiration even in these tragic circumstances hester could not help thinking what a beautiful woman she was she was not surprised that philo trace was drawn to judith she would have found it harder to understand were he not but the police have arrested merrit judith said to casbolt they found breelands watch in the warehouse yard i know he said quickly i was there when monk picked it up he seemed puzzled judith lowered her voice breeland gave it to merrit as a keepsake i knew that but i hoped the police would not however dorothea parfitt told them in all innocence i imagine but it cannot be taken back merrit showed it to her boasting a little as girls will her composure cracked and she had to struggle to regain it casbolt put his arm around her shoulders pulling her a little closer to him his face was full of pain and the strength of his emotion was for a moment completely unguarded breeland is despicable he said softly he must have taken it back from her and dropped it there himself even accidentally or with the intention of trying to stop us from pursuing him for the harm it could do her either way judith i swear we will fight him we shall obtain the finest lawyers there are and a queens counsel to defend merrit if we cannot prevent it from coming to that he turned to monk is it conceivable breeland will exonerate her does he have any love towards her at all any honor after all he is a grown man she is little more than a child and she could never in her life have imagined stealing guns for any cause of her own hester knew what monk would say before he spoke she even glanced at trace and saw the shadow in his face also no monk answered bluntly he denies he ever killed mr alberton or stole anything he ignored their disbelief and continued he says mr alberton changed his mind about selling him the guns and sent him a message to that effect he says he bought them quite legally and paid a man named shearer for them what casbolt jerked his head up judith stared at monk incredulously and he says he has no idea who murdered the men in the warehouse yard monk continued but he suggests it might have been trace out of revenge for not having been able to purchase the guns preposterous casbolt could keep silent no longer thats totally absurd no one would believe it he turned to judith did you receive any money no she said decisively who is shearer anyway where is he monk asked her i dont know where he is she admitted there has been no money paid for the gunsexcept i believe the money mr trace paid in the beginning casbolt swung around to philo trace you paid the first half deposit on the whole shipment did you not you know i did sir did you ever receive any part of it refunded because you were not to make the purchase after all no not a cent traces voice was tight and low as if he was embarrassed for judith although it was in no way her fault casbolt looked at monk that should answer your questions if you still have any i dont know what he has done to merrit to persuade her of his innocence or else to coerce her into swearing a lie to protect him but she is only sixteen a child certainly far too young to have her word taken seriously regarding a man she is obviously obsessed with he bit his lip his expression softening to momentary distress do you think he may have threatened her again monk answered honestly no it is my opinion she believes he is innocent i dont know why it may be no more than that she cannot bear to think of his guilt there is little more bitter than disillusion and we can make ourselves believe what we need to however preposterous at least for a while we call it loyalty or faith or whatever virtue counts most highly to us and fits the need casbolt glanced across at judith then down at the polished surface of the table with its silver and flowers there seems no way in which we can protect her from hurt the best we can do will be to save her from being implicated in breelands guilt in law the story about our agent shearer is absurd obviously breeland organized the stealing of the guns whether he was there in person or not we must distance her from that he looked at judith his face softening again his voice gentle will you call pilbeam to handle it for you if you would rather i can take care of it make sure the best possible barrister represents merrit there is no need for you to do anything her eyes softened thank you robert she said quickly reaching up and taking his hand i dont know how i would have endured these past terrible weeks without your kindness you have not spared yourself in the slightest and i know you must be nearly as deeply grieved as i am daniel was your friend for even more years than he was my husband he would be nearly as grateful to you as i am for your tireless care casbolt colored in an oddly selfconscious way showing a vulnerability that startled monk i dont believe merrit will consent to be represented separately from breeland hester said urgently and certainly she will not allow him to sacrifice himself for her in any way at all she is far more disposed to see it as the measure of her love to suffer with him no matter how innocent she is in fact but that is casbolt began then seeing her face fell silent perhaps he knew merrit well enough to realize the truth of hesters words he turned to monk but again it was hester who spoke we know sir oliver rathbone quite well he is the best barrister in london he can defend her if anyone can judith turned to her quickly hope flaring in her eyes would he she may not be willing to be of any help to herself will he not refuse in the circumstances she bit her lip i will pay him whatever his price if that is the question please mrs monk if there is anything you can do to prevail upon him i will sell the house the jewelry i have everything to save my daughter that wouldnt be necessary hester said softly it will not be money that matters to him although i will tell him how much you care it will be a question of finding a way to separate merrit from breelands guilt try them separately casbolt could not keep from interrupting his body was locked with tension his eyes hollow it is transparently unjust to charge them as if they were of one mind and one responsibility surely a decent barrister could persuade a jury of that there was an edge of desperation in his voice a sharp high note close to panic of course monk said quickly before he could say more and judith would know his fear we shall tell him all the circumstances and if he is willing to take the case he can then come to you and make all the necessary arrangements thank you judiths face was flooded with relief and then sudden shame you have done so much already you must be exhausted and i have sat half the evening pouring out more troubles and expecting your help when you must be worn to a shadow for lack of sleep and want more than anything on earth to reach your own home and your own bed i am sorry there is no need to be hester reached across quickly and touched judiths hand we have grown fond of merrit ourselves and are almost as angry as you are at the injustice that could be done were breeland not to pay the price of his crime even had you not asked we should not have wished to leave the task half completed judith said nothing she was too full of emotion to retain command of herself thank you casbolt spoke for her it was a fortunate day for us when you crossed our path without you this would have been an unmitigated tragedy he turned to trace and i have been remiss in acknowledging your part also sir your knowledge and your willingness to take your time and risk your safety in pursuit of justice and towards merrit a very considerable mercy marks you as a true gentleman we are in your debt also there is no debt between friends trace replied he spoke to casbolt but monk was quite certain his words were meant for judith it was not a task to which monk looked forward he had half hoped judith alberton would have a lawyer in whom she had such explicit trust that she would look no further but he had always acknowledged the possibility that in the end rathbone would have to be approached this was a desperate case still as he and hester rode homeward at last he felt a weight of oppression settle over him at the prospect of having to go to vere street the following day and speak to oliver rathboneworse than that to ask a favor of him their relationship was long and tense rathbone was by birth everything that monk was not privileged financially comfortable excellently educated part of the establishment effortlessly a gentleman monk was a fishermans son from northumberland a selfmade man grasping his education where he could bettering himself by imagination and hard work he could appear a gentleman to the undiscerning eye he had every whit as much elegance as rathbone but it cost him effort he had learned how to behave imitated those he admired but sometimes made mistakes and remembered them with the fire of embarrassment rathbone never made the point that he was superior to do so would have been unnecessary monk was learning that only now in his forties all of which was only a natural abrasion between two men who had equal intelligence and ambition quickness of thought and word passion for justice the issue that mattered that was always at the front of both their minds was that they had loved the same woman and she had chosen monk now monk had to go to him and ask his help offer him a case which could certainly prove complicated and highly emotive and very possibly incapable of resulting in a satisfactory conclusion but it was a kind of compliment that he considered rathbone the only man who could and would attempt such a task hester insisted on going with him they came without an appointment and were told by an apologetic clerk that sir oliver was in court however if the matter was of the urgency they claimed considering their long association a message could be sent to the old bailey and sir oliver might meet them there during the luncheon recess so it proved the three of them sat together in a crowded inn hunched over a small table talking as softly as possible while still loudly enough to be heard above the babble of voices which were all attempting to do the same thing rathbone acknowledged hester then listened studiously to monk as he told the story concentrating on putting the case succinctly monk was surprised at how uncomfortable he felt i daresay you will have read of the murders in the warehouse yard in tooley street he asked yes rathbone said guardedly all england has extremely ugly one of the newspapers this morning said that lyman breeland had been brought back to london to stand trial and albertons daughter also it is probably nonsense he moved the vegetables delicately around his plate someone was seen who resembles them why on earth would he leave his cause and his country when they must need him and come back here to face almost certain hanging i suppose it is conceivable president lincoln may wish accommodation reached at a diplomatic level because of breelands importance to the union cause but i cannot see any way of making that sit well with public opinion here not to mention with the law he frowned why i assume you have some part in it or you would not have raised the subject we brought him back monk replied watching rathbones long patrician face with its thin cheeks and sensitive mouth he saw the start of surprise at gunpoint he added but he is not as unwilling as one would suppose indeed rathbones eyebrows rose he claims he is innocent and knew nothing about albertons death he ignored rathbones expression i dont believe it either but it is not completely inconceivable he says alberton changed his mind about selling him the guns and sent him a message to that effect the hall porter at breelands rooms did deliver a message to him that night on receipt of which breeland packed his belongings and he and merrit alberton left immediately could have been anything rathbone pointed out but continue he said a man called shearer an agent of albertons brought the entire shipment of guns and ammunition how much rathbone asked six thousand rifles and over half a million rounds of ammunition monk replied rathbones eyes widened quite a weight not something you carry around in a barrow do you know how much that is a wagon load two three three at least large wagons monk replied he says shearer took them to the railway station where he paid the full price for them and shearer went on his way breeland never saw alberton at all and certainly never harmed him and what does merrit alberton say rathbone glanced at hester the same she answered she says they went by train to liverpool and from there by sea calling in at queenstown in ireland and then to new york and further by train to washington we went the same way she described it pretty accurately rathbone thanked her it was impossible to know if he had read anything of her emotions in her face i had thought the police had traced the guns to a barge down the river he said thoughtfully did i misread no they did and i was with them monk affirmed we traced the barge all the way to greenwich where we assume it met a seagoing ship and transferred the guns so they are both lying they must be unless there is some other explanation we havent thought of and what is it you want of me although there was a rueful sad shadow of it already in his eyes there was a smile on his lips perhaps in memory of other battles they had fought together both losses and victories that held their hurt hester drew in her breath sharply and left it to monk to reply to defend merrit alberton he answered she swears she did not murder her father and i think i believe her hester leaned forward urgently either way she is only sixteen and completely under breelands influence she believes passionately in his cause and thinks he is a hero all the noble and brave ideals that any young woman would have rathbones dark eyes widened the union of the american states why for heavens sake whatever difference could that possibly make to an english girl no not the union the fight against slavery her own fierce urgency for it her utter loathing of all the evils of dominion cruelty and denial were burning in her face if merrit alberton had felt even part of what she did it would be painfully easy to believe she would have followed to the ends of the earth a man whose crusade was freedom and thought little of the cost rathbone sighed monk knew in a moment of intense understanding exactly what he thought and was proved correct when he spoke that may well earn her some sympathy with a british jury who have no more love for slavery than a unionist but it will not excuse anything in the eyes of the law is she married to this breeland no he sighed very slightly well i suppose that is something and she is sixteen yes but she wont testify against him anyway i assumed as much and if she would that would not help us greatly loyalty is a very attractive quality disloyalty is not even if it is well justified i swear monk i sometimes think you spend your time trying to find ever more complicated cases for me until you have one which will confound me completely you have excelled yourself this time i barely know where to begin but the expression on his face showed that already his mind was racing monk felt the first tiny lift of his spirits if rathbone saw it as a personal challenge he would take it up nothing would ever allow him to retreat in front of hester the flash of humor mockery and selfknowledge was there in his eyes as if he knew monks thoughts as well as he knew his own and accepted them if there was a moment of pain of loneliness it was hidden instantly he began to question them both on every detail he could think of questions about casbolt judith alberton philo trace and the whole of their journey to america and all they had done there particularly he was interested in monks journey down the thames with lanyon he looked distressed and for a moment seriously out of composure when monk told of finding albertons body in the yard and of almost treading on the watch monk said little of the battle of bull run the horror of it was not something for which he had words the few he found were difficult and stilted the emotion too deep to be shared in this noisy friendly peaceful inn and he was not ready to look at it again himself it was too closely bound with his love for hester and with a strange sharp sense of his own inability ever to be worthy of that beauty he had seen in her and anyway that was the last thing he could share with rathbone it would be the ultimate cruelty he moved on swiftly to the account of finding breeland and how he and trace had guarded him all the way to richmond and then charleston and home again i see rathbone said when monk had finished with only a few words from hester then you may tell mrs alberton that i shall call upon her and she may direct me to her solicitor for instructions i have a very considerable battle ahead monk hesitated on the edge of thanking him then did not rathbone had not taken it for him for hester perhaps for the challenge possibly for justice but never for monk unless it were to prove himself equal to the challenge good he said instead very good rathbone returned to the courtroom rather hurriedly his junior was perfectly capable of conducting the present case it was a routine one purely a matter of presenting the evidence most of which was incontestable it was as well because all through the afternoon it was not the subject of regina versus wollcroft which occupied his mind but how he would handle the case of regina versus breeland and alberton which he had been rash enough to accept he was not only uncomfortable with the case itself but with his own reason for agreeing to take it he had read something of it in the newspapers although it did not especially interest him because it seemed so clearcut but like most of the editorial writers he was deeply sorry for judith alberton compassion was a noble emotion but it was not a good basis upon which to go to law juries might be swayed by sentiment judges were not and public opinion was very harshly against merrit alberton it seemed she had conspired with a foreigner to murder her own father it was an affront to all decencies to family loyalty to obedience to property and to patriotism if every daughter were free to disobey her father in such a violent and appalling manner then all society was threatened rathbone found that those assumptions irritated him and that his respect for the establishment while deep in the roots of his lifeon the surface at leastwas becoming a trifle frayed he despised prejudice tradition set in rigid minds and no more than habit he had also accepted the case in part because he liked the challenge there was an excitement in stretching himself to the full and a danger what if he were not equal to it what if he failed to secure justice and an innocent man or woman was hanged because he had not been clever enough brave enough or imaginative articulate persuasive or a guilty man were to be freed perhaps to kill again at the best to profit from his crime and show to others that the law was not capable of protecting his victims but even without these he knew he would have accepted it because hester was involved she had not said so but he had seen in her face that she cared for merrit might even find something of herself in her as she might have been at sixteen wayward idealistic too much in love to believe ill of the man in whom she had vested so much too close to her dream to deny it whatever the cost was that how she had been he wished he had known her then ridiculous how sharp that ache was even half a year after she had married monk in fact it was sharper now than it had been when she was still single and rathbone could have asked her to marry him if he had only realized how much he had wanted it when the case reached its conclusion satisfactorily and a good hour earlier than he had expected he accepted his clients thanks and went out into the hot noisy august street he hailed the first available hansom that passed him giving his fathers address in primrose hill he settled back for the long ride and deliberately let his mind slip into idleness he did not wish to think of monk or of his new case especially he did not wish to think of hester after an agreeable supper of fresh bread brussels pate a very pleasant red wine and then hot plum pie with flaky pastry and fresh cream he sat back in his armchair and looked through the open french windows across the lawn to the honeysuckle hedge and the orchard beyond there was no sound but birds singing and the faint scratch as henry rathbone wiggled a small knife around in the bowl of his pipe not really achieving anything he did it out of habit his mind not on the task just as he seldom actually smoked the pipe he filled it tamped down the tobacco lit it and invariably allowed it to go out well he said eventually oliver looked up pardon are you going to tell me or do i have to guess it was both comfortable and disturbing to be understood so well there was no room for evasions no escape and no temptation to try have you read about the murders in the warehouse yard in tooley street oliver asked henry knocked out his pipe on the fire surround yes he said looking anxiously at oliver i thought it was supposed to be an american gun buyer isnt it almost certainly oliver said ruefully monk has just brought him back here to stand trial so what does he want from you he does want something doesnt he of course occasionally he tried hedging with his father it never worked because even if he succeeded in misleading him he felt so guilty he found himself admitting the truth and then feeling ridiculous henry rathbone was transparently honest himself sometimes it was a faultin fact quite often when negotiation or management had to be achieved he would never have made an even moderate barrister he had not the first idea how to act a part or plead a cause in which he did not believe but he had a brilliant grasp of facts and a relentlessly logical mind which was capable of remarkable leaps of imagination now he was waiting for oliver to explain outside the starlings were swirling across the sky black against the fading gold of the sun somewhere close by a lawn recently had been mown and the smell of the cut grass was heavy he brought the daughter back also oliver started to explain extraordinary but she and breeland say that they are neither of them guilty of killing alberton or of stealing the guns he saw the look of disbelief in his fathers face no i dont think so either he said quickly but he does have a story better than simple denial he says alberton changed his mind but had to do it secretly because of philo trace the buyer from the south to whom he had already given his word and from whom he had accepted a half payment in advance henrys mouth pulled down at the corners in distaste and was alberton the sort of man to do that not from what ive read but i have no personal knowledge oliver replied apart from dishonesty it would ruin his reputation for the future but more to the point according to monk trace did not receive his money back he hesitated at least he says he didnt and albertons estate has no record of having received breelands money henry put his pipe in his mouth he lit a match and the sharp smell of it filled the air momentarily he held it to the tobacco and inhaled it ignited puffed smoke for an instant then went out again he sucked at it anyway the most reasonable explanation seems to be that breeland is lying oliver went on perhaps i need to examine albertons business affairs and what i can of mr trace to guard myself from unpleasant surprises henry nodded slowly in silent agreement oliver was still leaning forward elbows on his knees they were facing each other across the space in front of the fireplace as if the fire were lit although on this summer evening it was still warm enough for them to be pleased the french doors were open it was merely a comfortable habit shared over years of discussing all manner of things oliver had first done it when he was eleven then it had been a question of irregular latin verbs and trying to find a logic behind their eccentricity they had reached no conclusion but the sense of companionship of having attained some quality of adulthood was of immeasurable satisfaction the police traced the guns to the river and onto a barge down as far as bugsbys marshes he went on whereas breeland claims he took delivery of them at the railway station and went by train to liverpool merrit alberton swears to the same thing that doesnt make a great deal of sense henry said thoughtfully how competent are the police i wonder monk says the man in charge seems excellent and regardless of that monk himself went with him he says exactly the same the guns went from the warehouse to the river and downstream as far as bugsbys marshes from there it would be an easy matter to transfer them to an oceangoing ship and across the atlantic even breeland doesnt argue that he took them and they arrived safely in america presumably they were used in the battle at manassas henry said nothing absorbed in thought hester believes the girl is innocent oliver said then instantly wished he had not he had betrayed too much of himself not that henry was unaware of his feelings hester had visited him often enough she had sat in this room watched the light fade across the sky and the last sun gilding the tips of the poplars the evening breeze shimmering through the leaves she had liked henry and she had felt at home here comforted by more than the beauty of the place the honeysuckle and the apple trees also by an inner peace not that that is a reason of course he added and as henrys eyes opened wide he felt himself blushing it was exactly a reason he had only drawn attention to it by denying it there seems to be a great deal that you dont know yet henry observed holding his pipe up and examining it ruefully the girl may have been used and unaware of it that is possible oliver agreed i need to answer a great many questions if i am to go into court with any chance of competence let alone success henry looked at oliver closely you have accepted the case i assume well yes henry grunted a trifle precipitate but then you are far more impulsive than you like to think he smiled robbing his words of offense there was deep affection in him and oliver had never in his life doubted it i shall have to see mrs alberton of course he pointed out she may not wish to engage me henry did not bother to answer that he had as high an opinion of his sons professional abilities as had everyone else what does monk think he asked instead i didnt ask him oliver replied a trifle tartly interesting that he did not tell you anyway henry said contemplating his pipe he is not usually discreet with his views he is either being devious or he does not know i shall have more ideas when i have seen merrit alberton and heard what she has to say oliver went on perhaps more to himself than to his father i shall be able to make some estimate of her character and naturally whether i represent him or not i shall have to speak to breeland do you intend to represent him i would rather not but if he has any sense hell do everything in his power to see that they are charged and defended together what if he is prepared to defend her at his own cost henry asked quietly if he loves her he may do that will you allow him to oliver considered for several moments what would he do if breeland were willing to take the blame in order to exonerate merrit and yet he believed merrit guilty you had better consider it henry warned if they are truly in love they may each try to take the blame for the other and make your task a great deal more difficult whomever you represent you had not thought of that he observed with surprise no oliver admitted it was nothing monk said rather what he omitted to say but i had the impression breeland would not sacrifice himself for anyone else but i need to know a great deal more than i do or i am going to run the risk of being caught in this precisely henry agreed for a start could the story of breelands be true however unlikely about the agent shearer i dont know certainly i know of no reason that makes it completely impossiblei shall have monk find out if there is such a person and if so what he is like could he have murdered alberton and taken breelands money himself he went on thinking aloud that would be the obvious line of defense and presumably what breeland will say if i use that either for breeland or for merrit alone then i must be certain it cannot be disproved henry watched him in silence oliver realized he would certainly have to work closely with monk and he had resisted it until now he wanted to take the case but he would rather have been independent presented monk and hester with the defense accomplished rather than sought their assistance is it possible breeland is guilty and the daughter did not know of it henry suggested if she knew of it unless she was taken by force to america then she is an accomplice at least and an accessory after the fact oliver said quickly i dont know beyond doubt but from what monk told me she cannot be unaware of the truth she and breeland were together the whole of the night alberton was murdered and she certainly was not in america under duress he hesitated and a watch that breeland gave her as a keepsake was found in the warehouse yard henry said nothing but his expression was eloquent outside the shadows were lengthening on the lawn and the air was definitely cooler a threequarter moon was luminous in the fading sky the sun had gone even from the poplars i am obliged to defend breeland also oliver stated the inevitable unless he insists on his own man in which case i imagine merrit alberton will choose to have the same person whatever her family wants and will you accept him as a client believing him guilty henry asked knowing that his condemnation will certainly mean the girls as well it was a moral dilemma oliver disliked acutely he found the murders unusually repellent because they were brutal and as far as he could see also unnecessary breeland or anyone else could have stolen the guns without killing alberton and the guards they could have been left unconscious and bound and still been unable to prevent the theft by the time they were found breeland had been safely away the killing accomplished nothing and it was a gratuitous cruelty he would far rather have defended merrit even if it were no better than pleading her youth and a certain amount of duress or intimidation and that she had not foreseen the violence no such argument was feasible for breeland i dont know he confessed i need to understand a great deal more before i can even formulate what defense to make the silence remained unbroken for some time henry stood up and closed the french doors then returned to his seat there is also the matter of the blackmail oliver resumed and to henrys surprise told him what monk had said briefly of albertons urgent reason for consulting him i suppose that could be involved he finished dubiously well you certainly need to find out who was responsible henry agreed perhaps they took revenge for not having been sold their guns but breeland lied about the guns oliver went back to the one fact that seemed inescapable monk traced them down the river to bugsbys marshes not to the railway station and liverpool he stared at the empty fireplace but why murder henry asked from what you have said breeland did not have to kill alberton to take the guns consider this girl very carefully oliver and consider the widow as well oliver was startled a domestic crime or a financial one henry amended whatever it is make sense of it in your own mind before you go into court i am afraid you have no choice but to employ monk to learn much more before you commit yourself to anything i think you would be well advised to delay the trial for as long as you are able to and know far more about the alberton family before you speak on their behalf or you will not serve your client well oliver sank further into the chair content to sit with his thoughts in the quiet room without any necessity to stand up and light the gas henry sucked thoughtfully on his pipe but he knew he could allow the subject of the alberton case to drop for this evening rathbone was startled by judith alberton he had expected the handsome house suitably draped in black curtains drawn wreath on the door and the straw in the street outside to muffle the sound of the horses hooves as they passed the mirrors draped or turned to the wall some people even stopped the clocks all widows wore mourning the unrelieved black gown except for perhaps a jet brooch or a locket the decoration made of hair which he found repellent but judith albertons face was so remarkable in its beauty and the extraordinary power of emotion in it that what she wore was irrelevant thank you for coming so soon sir oliver she greeted him as he came into the dim withdrawing room i am afraid our predicament is very serious as i expect mr monk has told you we are desperately in need of the most skilled help we can find has he described our situation an outline of it mrs alberton he replied accepting the seat she indicated but there is a great deal more i need to understand if i am to do my best for you he avoided using the word success he was not sure if there was any possibility of it what would success be merrit acquitted and someone else condemned who not breeland they had been in love then whether they were now or not they survived or fell together he must make her realize that of course she agreed at least outwardly she was perfectly composed i will tell you anything i can i dont know what can help her confusion was plain in her eyes her hands lay still in her lap on the black fabric but they were stiff the knuckles pale it was surprisingly difficult to begin it was always unpleasant intruding on someones grief probing into affairs which might show a side of the dead person that others had not known and which would have been so much less painful to have kept secret but present danger did not allow such luxury her dignity in concealing her grief moved him more than weeping would have done mrs alberton from what i have heard so far there does not seem any way in which we can defend your daughter separately from lyman breeland he saw her lips tighten but he could not afford to tell her what she wished to hear rather than the truth they have both stated that they were together the whole of that night he continued whether she was aware beforehand of what he intended to do or was in any way a willing partner can be argued although we should need better proof than anything we have so far in order to convince a jury of it our only hope is to learn exactly what did happen and then do the best we can to show anything that mitigates the blame unless of course we can show that there is a highly reasonable possibility that someone else altogether is guilty he said it with little hope i dont know what the truth is she said frankly i simply cannot believe that merrit would do such a thing not willingly i dont care for mr breeland sir oliver i never did but my husband had no such qualms he did not sell him the guns simply because he had already committed himself to sell them to mr trace and accepted a payment of half the sum you are certain the money had been paid by trace oh yes what about the money from breeland her eyes flew open wide from breeland there was no money from him he stole the guns surely that was the whole reason forfor murdering my husband and the guards poor men i have done what i can for their families but no recompense makes up for the loss of someone you love one would assume robbery was his reason he agreed and yet surely he could have stolen the guns without killing anyone a blow to the head would have overpowered them and kept them silent and they would have been tied adequately to prevent any escape and pursuit he saw the shadows in her eyes the quick shock of pain as the realization came to her that perhaps her husbands death was unnecessary to the theft that he had been killed in hatred or cruelty not as a part of war i had not thought of that she replied very softly her gaze lowered as if to defend herself from his understanding he was painfully aware of it he would not have pried were there any alternative but time and the imperatives of the law allowed no mercy mrs alberton if i am to defend your daughter i am forced to defend breeland as well unless i can find some way to separate them in the eyes of the public and therefore of a jury i must know the truth whatever that is believe me i cannot afford to be surprised in this courtroom or to face an adversary who knows more of the facts than i do he shifted fractionally in his seat knowledge is my only weapon and all the skill in the world cannot defeat a man whose armory is vastly superior david and goliath is a fine story and can be applied as metaphor to certain circumstances but what is too often overlooked or even forgotten is that david did not stand alone i have not his confidence that god is on my side he smiled as he said it but in mockery of himself her chin came up quickly and she met his eyes i have total confidence that merrit did not have any willing hand in the murder of her father she said without hesitation her voice strong but i do not believe that god intervenes in every miscarriage of justice in fact we all know perfectly well that he does not tell me what you need from me sir oliver i will give everything i have to save my daughter he did not doubt that she meant it even had he not already formed an opinion of her it was plain in her face the urgency the courage and the fear i need all the facts that i can find he replied and i need your agreement that if it is necessary which it may be i shall represent lyman breeland as well with whatever consequences may stem from that he watched her intently as he spoke seeing the flicker in her gaze the awareness of how repugnant it would be to ally herself with the man she believed had murdered her husband please consider it carefully before you reply mrs alberton he warned i do not know what i shall discover when i begin to look into it with more care more thoroughness i cannot promise you that it will be what you wish to know all i can say is that if you employ me to act for you i will do everything i can to serve your best interests i can and will keep every confidence entrusted to me but i will not lie to you nor can i protect you from reality i understand she was very pale indeed her body stiff as if were she to let go of the iron control she willed upon herself she might collapse completely i will face whatever you may find i believe in the end it will prove my daughter to be innocent of malice if not of folly do whatever is needed sir oliver that will include employing monk again to enquire into the case further than he has done so far anything that you judge appropriate she agreed if you trust him then i do and he has already proved himself more than able by bringing merrit home how he managed to convince breeland to come as well i cannot imagine at gunpoint i understand he said dryly but apparently he claims that was more because breeland wished to remain with his regiment than because he was afraid to face trial he claims to have a complete defense not only to murder but even to robbery she said nothing emotions chased each other across her face fear pain bewilderment doubt he rose to his feet first i shall go and speak with miss alberton i can proceed little until i have heard what she has to say will you come back and tell me she stood up quickly she moved with remarkable grace and he was reminded again what a beautiful woman she was i will keep you informed he promised it was not quite the answer she had requested but it was all he would commit himself to do he wondered as the footman showed him out how deeply he might regret such a promise he could imagine no outcome of this issue which would not bring with it deep and terrible pain there seemed no answer which would not add to judith albertons loss he had no difficulty in obtaining an interview with merrit he stood in the small bare room in the prison where she was being held prior to trial it was stonewalled washed with lime the floor made of stone blocks the hinges of the iron door were bedded deep into the jamb on one side and the lock bit into the other as if some desperate person might fling himself against it in a blind effort to escape there was a table where he could sit and presumably write notes if he wished although there was no inkwell a pencil would have to suffice there was a second chair for the accused when she came in he was again surprised he had expected someone very girlish angry frightened and very possibly disinclined to cooperate with him instead he saw a young woman who would never rival her mother in beauty but who nevertheless had some remnant of both charm and dignity in spite of being very obviously exhausted her fair hair scraped back and pinned by the look of it without benefit of a mirror since she had not yet been convicted of any crime except in public opinion she still wore her own clothes a blue muslin dress with a white collar which exaggerated the pallor of her skin it was clean and fresh her mother must have had it sent for her the wardress says you are sir oliver rathbone and you are to represent me she said very quietly i presume that my mother has engaged you it was barely a question they both knew that there was no other explanation he began to reply but she cut across him i did not have any part in the murder of my father sir oliver her voice trembled only very slightly but i will not allow you to use me in order to blame mr breeland she lifted her chin a fraction as she spoke his name and the corner of her mouth softened perhaps you had better tell me what you know miss alberton he replied indicating the chair opposite for her to be seated only if it is understood that i will not be manipulated she answered she stood quite still waiting for his word before committing herself even to listen he had a sudden sense of how very young she was her loyalty was blind absolute and perhaps the most precious thing to her he could believe she defined herself by such a value the ability to love totally even at such a terrible cost it was part of being sixteen he could hardly remember such unequivocal passion he hoped he had once been so ardent so careless of hurt to himself placing love before all time and experience had blunted that too much perhaps if he had not been afraid to love like that he would not have lost hester but that was a useless thought now and too brilliantly painful to indulge even in passing that was much too real too wholehearted i have no intention of trying to manipulate you he said with a fierceness that even surprised him i would like to know the truth or at least as much of it as you can tell me please begin with simple facts we may go on to deduction and opinion later perhaps you would begin with the day of your fathers death unless you feel there is something relevant earlier she sat down obediently and composed herself folding her hands mr breeland and mr trace both wished to purchase the guns that my father had for sale each of course for his own side in the civil war in america mr trace represented the confederacy the slave states mr breeland is for the union and against slavery anywhere the ring of pride and anger in her voice was unmistakable rathbone could not help identifying with her in that much at least he did not interrupt my father said that he had already promised to sell the entire shipment of guns above six thousand of them to mr trace she continued and he would not change his mind no matter what mr breeland or i for that matter would say to him every argument against slavery was tried every horror and injustice every monstrosity of human cruelty detailed but he would not reconsider there were tears in her eyes but she blinked them away furiously annoyed with herself for betraying such emotion i quarreled with him she sniffed then shook her head as she realized how inelegant it was rathbone offered her his handkerchief she hesitated then took it simply so that she might blow her nose and then continued thank you i was very angry indeed i think the more so because i had always thought well of him before i had never seen that side of him which she lowered her eyes looking away from him which could not admit when he had made a mistake and yield to a better cause i said some things to him i wish now i could take back not that they are not true but i could not know they would be the last words he ever heard from me rathbone did not wish to give her time to dwell on the thought you left the room where did you go what oh i went upstairs and packed a small valise with immediate necessitieslinens clean blouses toiletries thats all where was mr breeland during this quarrel i dont know at his rooms i suppose he was not in your parents house no he did not overhear the quarrel if that is what you are thinking it occurred to me then where did you go i left the color rose up her cheeks delicately it made him more inclined to believe her awareness of just what a major step she had taken and that she was as sensible of the risk to her reputation as her mother would have been she took a deep breath i went out of the servants door at the side of the house and walked along the street until i came to the crossroads where i found a hansom i took it directing the driver to mr breelands rooms he did not need to ask the address monk had already told him and was mr breeland at home yes he welcomed me most especially when i told him about the quarrel i had had with my father she leaned forward across the table but you must understand he in no way encouraged me to defy my parents or behave in any way the least improperly i require that you should fully believe that rathbone was not sure what he believed but it would be foolish to tell her so now it was not the issue he could not afford to be concerned with breelands morality except as it showed itself in acts that were punishable in law i dont question it miss alberton i need to know how you spent the rest of that night until you had left london altogether very precisely if you please omit nothing you think lyman murdered my father her eyes were direct her voice perfectly steady he did not what he told mr monk is the exact truth i know it because i was with him we spent the evening speaking together and planning what we should do a first smile touched her lips it seemed like selfmockery of another more innocent time he tried to persuade me to make peace with my parents he warned me that his country was at war he explained to me that honor required he join his regiment and fight but of course i understood that already i simply wished to be his wife and wait for him support him and do everything i could myself to help in the fight against slavery i never imagined i was going to sail off into a new and peaceful life somewhere else rathbone believed her her earnestness was transparent and he thought he heard a thread of disappointment she herself was surprised to discover something confused her but as yet he had no idea what it was please continue he prompted tell me exactly what occurred was mr breeland ever out of your sight not for more than a few moments she replied he did not leave his apartment it was nearly midnight and we were still talking about what we should do pride and tenderness flickered in her for a moment he was concerned for my reputation more than i was myself if i should have slept the night in his sitting room no one in america would have known it and that was all my concern but he cared for me and it troubled him rathbone was better aware than she how rapidly word traveled and it flashed through his mind to wonder how much breelands concern was for her reputation as it might affect him as her future husband but it was an uncharitable impulse and he did not speak it aloud she swallowed in spite of her attempt at calm and her undoubted courage the effort was costing her dear a little before midnight a young boy came with a message for lyman it was a note he tore it open and read it immediately it said that my father had changed his mind about selling the guns but for obvious reasons he could not say so in front of mr trace he would return him his money later and explain that lymans arguments regarding slavery had won him over and he could no longer in good conscience sell the guns to the confederates lyman was to go to the railway station at euston square and the guns would be delivered to him there liverpool was the best port for them to be shipped to america she was watching him intently willing him to believe her he recognized that she was almost certainly using breelands words for the explanation but he did not interrupt her that was what he did she continued we packed up immediately taking what was of most importance to him there was hardly time to do even that but the guns were the most valuable of all they were part of the battle for freedom and a cause that is just must always take precedence over a few material possessions you helped him pack he asked naturally i had only a few things myself again the tiny smile touched her face she must have been thinking back now on her own hasty departure in the name of love and principle with only what she could put into a bag she could carry in her hand he tried to imagine what precious things gathered in her short lifetime she had had to leave behind and apparently she had done it without serious regret he thought how deeply how unselfishly she must love breeland it hurt him with surprising force that he might be utterly unworthy of it when he spoke his voice had more anger in it than he had intended and who was this note from i presume it was signed yes of course she said indignantly he would hardly have acted upon it leaving everything had he not known who sent it who did color deepened in her face and there was a moments confusion as she realized how much depended upon the truth of the issue and that she thought after all not knew it it was signed by mr shearer she said defiantly of course in light of the murders she gulped she seemingly could not bring herself to say her fathers name in this connection her chin came up but when we got to euston square the guns were there already loaded onto a wagon lyman never left me for more than a few moments and that was after the guns were delivered and he paid shearer the money he had written authority to accept on my fathers behalf and it was all perfectly in order i i was so happy my father had at last seen the justice of what lyman was fighting for and changed his mind but you did not think to return home and tell him so misery filled her eyes no she answered very quietly i loved lyman and still wanted to go with him to america i i was still angry that my father had taken so long to see what had been plain to me from the beginning slavery is wicked treating a human being like a possession can never be right he did not know what to think the story made no sense and yet he did not think she was lying to him she believed what she said had breeland somehow duped her if he had not murdered alberton himself then had he employed someone else to do it perhaps this man shearer tell me about your journey north to liverpool and what happened there he instructed how can it matter she was puzzled please do so he insisted very well lyman showed me to a carriage where i was reasonably comfortable and told me to wait for him while he spoke to the guard he returned in about ten minutes and shortly after that the train pulled out who else was in the carriage he interrupted how can it matter no one i know i did not speak to them an old man with a lot of whiskers a woman with a dreadful hat quite the ugliest i have ever seen red and brown why would anyone wear red and brown together i dont know who else its all unimportant where did the train stop he pressed obediently she described the journey in its monotonous details he wrote down her answers in rapid almost illegible notes and in liverpool she told him of breelands trouble in having the guns stored temporarily of finding space on a ship bound first for queenstown in ireland then for new york with every new fact she spoke of the pictures became more real the more he was convinced her story was told from experience rather than imagination thank you he said at last you have been very patient miss alberton and you have helped greatly in your defense i will not allow you to defend me at lymans expense she said quickly leaning forward across the table her face flushed please understand that i shall dismiss you or whatever it takes if i understood you when you first told me miss alberton he said calmly i shall not do so you have my word i cannot promise what the court will do and i have never promised to anyone what a jury will do but for myself i can answer absolutely she sank back thank you sir oliver then i shall be very glad if you will act for me and and do what you can he rose to his feet feeling a twist of pity for her almost like a physical spasm she was so young a child trying to behave like a woman trying to keep a dignity she was so close to losing he wished profoundly he could have comforted her that either her mother or father were here even that breeland was damn him but all he could do to help her was to remain formal keep the fierce control she depended upon i shall return to tell you how i am progressing he said carefully if you do not see me for a few days it is because i am working on your behalf good day miss alberton he turned a little quickly not waiting to look at her as the tears spilled from her brimming eyes rathbone was driven to see lyman breeland by curiosity as well as by duty but it was still not a task he expected to find either easy or pleasant he was received in a room markedly similar to the one in the womens section of the prison with the same bare limewashed walls simple table and two wooden chairs in some ways breeland was exactly what rathbone had expected tall lean a hard body used to exercise one would have judged him a man of action military was the first thing that came to mind because of his upright bearing and a certain pride in him even in these crushing circumstances he was dressed in a plain shirt and trousers an inch or two short for him presumably they were borrowed he would have left the battlefield at manassas in his dirty bloodstained uniform but breelands face surprised rathbone without realizing it he had formed preconceptions in his mind expected to see a man of readable passions an arresting face in which one could see zeal and loyalty and a will that overrode all obstacles all pain or rebuff perhaps unconsciously he had envisioned someone like monk instead he saw a handsome man but unreachable in an entirely different way his face was smooth features perfectly regular but there was something in it which struck him as remote perhaps there were not enough lines yet as if his emotions were all within smothered how do you do mr breeland he began my name is oliver rathbone mrs alberton has engaged me to defend her daughter and as i daresay you will appreciate it is necessary that her defense and yours be conducted either by the same person or by two people who are acting as one of course breeland agreed neither of us is guilty and we were in each others company the entire time when the crime occurred surely you have already been informed of that i have spoken with miss alberton however i should like to hear it from you on your own behalf if you wish me to act for you and on hers if you prefer to retain someone else no smile touched breelands face i am told you are the best and it would seem sensible that one person should represent us both since apparently you are willing i accept i have sufficient funds to meet whatever your charges are it was an oddly discourteous way of putting it as if rathbone had been touting for business but he could understand breelands feelings he had been brought back to a foreign country by force to stand trial for a crime for which he would be hanged if he were found guilty he would be defended by strangers he was obliged to trust without the ability to test them himself any man who was not a fool would be defensive afraid and angry rathbone decided not to attempt any kind of rapport at least not yet first quite formally he would establish the facts good he said graciously perhaps if you will sit down we shall be able to begin discussing the details of strategy breeland sat obediently he moved with ease even grace apart from a slight awkwardness in one shoulder rathbone sat opposite him would you begin with your first acquaintance with daniel alberton i heard of him through the arms trade breeland answered his name is well known and trusted and he could provide the most excellent guns and rapidly i called upon him and attempted to purchase firstclass muskets and ammunition for the union i told him of the cause for which we were fighting i did not expect him to understand that the union itself was of the profoundest value an englishman could not be expected to grasp the damage of secession but i believed any civilized nation would be against the enslavement of one race of people by another the contempt in his voice was stinging they had been speaking for only minutes and surely breeland must be aware that his own life was in jeopardy but already he had made an opportunity to express his passion for the union cause rathbone found it oddly disconcerting and he was not sure why breeland went on to describe his attempts to deal with alberton and his failure alberton had given his word to philo trace and accepted his money and he considered himself bound breeland allowed a grudging admiration for that but still believed the justice of the union cause should have overridden any one mans sense of commitment rathbones reply was instant not weighed can any group claim collective honor without that of the individuals who compose it of course breeland responded with a direct almost confrontational stare the group is always greater than the one that is what society is that is civilization i am surprised you need to ask or are you testing me rathbone was about to deny it then realized that in a sense he was testing him but not as breeland meant what is the difference between that and saying that the end justifies the means the barrister asked breeland gazed back at him his clear gray eyes unwavering our cause is just he replied with an edge to his voice no sane person could doubt it but i did not kill daniel alberton for it or anyone else except on the battlefield facetoface as a soldier does rathbone did not answer him tell me what happened the night you quarreled with alberton and later miss alberton left her home and came to you you spoke with her did she not tell you i wish to hear your account of it mr breeland please oblige me rathbone was angry without knowing why if you wish she will bear out all i say because it is the truth then breeland proceeded to describe the evening in essence exactly as merrit had rathbone pressed him for details of the train journey to liverpool of the carriage in which they rode and such trivia as the other occupants and what they were wearing i dont see the relevance breeland protested a shadow of anger darkening his face how can it have anything whatever to do with albertons death what kind of a hat some woman in a railway carriage was wearing hours later i do not tell you how to purchase guns mr breeland rathbone said tartly please do not advise me how to conduct a case in court or what information i shall need if you feel you need a description of the womans hat mr rathbone then i shall give it to you breeland said coldly but miss alberton would be in a better position to judge such a thing it seems to me both trivial and absurd sir oliver rathbone corrected with a chilly smile what my name is sir oliver not mr rathbone and the hat is important please describe it it was large and extremely ugly as far as i can recall there was a lot of red in it and some other duller shade brown or something like thatsir oliver thank you i believe your account of your journey even though it seems to contradict the facts that the police have he rose to his feet it is the truth breeland said simply also standing up is that all for the time being is there anything i can do for you do you wish any messages sent to your family or anyone else do you have all you require in the way of clothestoiletries for example sufficient breeland gave a slight grimace a soldier should think nothing of personal privation and i have been permitted to write such letters as i wished to so that my family might know i am in good health i should prefer they did not learn of this absurd accusation until after it has been proved false then i shall continue investigating every avenue of proof that someone else is responsible for the deaths of daniel alberton and the two guards at the warehouse rathbone said inclining his head in the slightest of gestures and taking his leave he was outside in the sun amid the traffic of the street with its noise and haste before he realized why he was so angry breelands account of his actions had tallied so precisely with merrits even to the complete irrelevancies such as the womans hat that he did not doubt it was the truth an invented tale would not run to such trivia he was quite certain that both merrit and breeland had indeed made the journey by train from london to liverpool and there seemed no other occasion on which it could have happened nevertheless he would have monk make absolutely certain produce witnesses if possible what made him clench his hands as he strode along the footpath holding his shoulders tight was that not once had breeland asked if merrit was all right if she was frightened suffering unwell or in need of anything that could possibly be done for her she was little more than a child in a place that was more terrible than anything her life could have prepared her to meet and facing the possibility of being hanged for a crime which depended wholly upon his passion for his own political cause however justified and yet it had not entered his mind to ask after her even when he knew rathbone had only just left her rathbone might admire breelands dedication in time but he could not imagine liking a man who devoted himself to the cause of mankind in general but could not care for the individuals closest to him and who was blind to their suffering when even a word from him would have helped the question crossed his mind whether it was people he loved at all or simply that he needed some great absorbing crusade to lose himself in as an excuse for evading personal involvement with its sacrifices of vanity its compromises its patience and its generosity of spirit with a great cause one could be a hero ones own weaknesses did not show one was not tested by intimacy there was a prick of familiarity in that an understanding of regret the slow quiet ache inside when he thought of hester was also a selfknowledge now made sharper by coming facetoface with lyman breeland it was late afternoon by the time rathbone went to see monk it was not an interview he was looking forward to but it was unavoidable breelands story must be substantiated by facts and witnesses monk was the person to find them if they existed and rathbone was inclined to believe that they did he arrived at fitzroy street just after six and found monk at home he was glad he would not have chosen to be alone with hester he was surprised by how little he trusted his emotions monk appeared almost to have expected him and there was a look of satisfaction in his lean face as rathbone came in of course monk agreed waving for rathbone to sit down hester was not in the room perhaps she was about some domestic duty he did not ask ive heard her story rathbone crossed his legs elegantly and leaned back exactly as if he were at ease he was a brilliant barrister which meant he was articulate thought rapidly and logically he was also a very fine actor he would not have described himself in those terms however at least not the last one and breelands also he added i think it more likely true than not but naturally we shall require substantiation you believe it monk said thoughtfully it was impossible to tell from his expression what his own ideas were rathbone would have liked to know but he would not ask not yet merrit gave a very detailed description of the train journey to liverpool rathbone explained telling monk about the woman with the hat breeland gave the same description more or less it is not proof but it is highly indicative you might even be able to find someone else on that train who may have seen them that would be conclusive monk chewed his lower lip it would he conceded then who killed alberton and rather more awkwardly how did the guns get from the river at bugsbys marshes across the city to the euston square station rathbone smiled very slightly that is what i shall employ you to discover there appears to be some major fact which we have not learned possibly it has to do with this agent shearer there is also the very unpleasant possibility that alberton himself was involved in deception of some sort and was doublecrossed by shearer or even by breeland a flicker of amusement lit monks eyes i take it that you did not greatly like mr breeland it was made more in the tone of an observation than a question rathbone raised his eyebrows that surprises you not in the slightest there is much in him i admire but i cannot bring myself to like him monk agreed you know he never once asked me how merrit was rathbone heard the anger and amazement in his own voice he cant see anything but his damned cause slavery is pretty repugnant a lot of things are and a great many of them spring from obsession rathbones voice suddenly shook with anger and an inability to see any point of view except your own or to empathize with another persons pain if he is in any way different from yourself monks eyes widened you are absolutely right he said with sudden profound seriousness yes lyman breeland is a very dangerous man i wish to hell we did not have to defend him in order to defend merrit i see no alternative or believe me i should have taken it rathbone assured him with feeling investigate everything i dont believe merrit is guilty of anything beyond falling in love with a cold fanatic of a man he may be guilty of no more than an ability to love a theory too much and people too little and that may lead to many sins but not necessarily the murder of daniel alberton you had better look very carefully at philo trace and at this agent shearer and anything else you find pertinent and as always you are in a hurry just so rathbone rose to his feet try hard monk for merrit albertons sake and for her mothers but not breelands i dont give a damn about breeland find the truth monk walked towards the door with rathbone his face already furrowed in thought it has a nice irony to it doesnt it he observed i hope to hell it isnt trace i rather like him rathbone did not reply they were both too aware of men in the past they had liked of cases where love and hate had seemed so misplaced some tragedies it was too easy to understand the emotions and judgments not nearly simple enough monk would also dearly have liked to find a way to defend merrit without at the same time defending breeland but he was too much of a realist to imagine it could be done he had watched them together on the long journey home across the atlantic he knew merrit would never allow it whatever her belief about breeland or her horror at the reality of war her own nature was based on loyalty to have saved herself at his expense would be to deny everything she valued it would be a kind of suicide nor did it surprise him that breeland was still more concerned with clearing his own name and thus the cause than with how merrit was enduring imprisonment and the fear and suffering that must come with it he smiled as he thought of rathbones distaste and imagined his regard for merrit her youth her enthusiasm and vulnerability he wondered also as he strode along tottenham court road watching for a hansom what rathbone had felt for judith alberton and if he had been sensitive to her remarkable beauty the august sun was hot shimmering up from the pavements winking in hard glittering light on harnesses polished carriage doors and at certain angles from the windows of busy shops a shoeblack boy was accepting a penny from a tophatted customer he winked at a girl selling muffins monk hailed a cab and gave the address of the police station where he hoped this early in the morning to find lanyon still there it was the natural place to begin even though he was now attempting to prove the opposite from that which had seemed to be so obviously the truth at the beginning he was fortunate he met lanyon just as he was coming down the steps the sun catching his fair straight hair he was surprised to see monk and stopped his face full of curiosity looking for me he asked almost hopefully monk smiled in selfmockery i am now retained for the defense he said frankly he owed lanyon the truth and it was easier than lying or evasion lanyon grunted but there was no criticism in his eyes money or conviction he replied money monk replied lanyon grinned i dont believe you you asked lanyon started to walk a long loping step and monk kept pace with him sorry for the girl lanyon went on wish i could think she was innocent but she was there in the yard he looked sideways at monk his face shadowed with regret trying to read monks reaction monk kept his own face expressionless it cost him an effort how do you know the watch you found it was breelands all right of course but he had given it to her as a keepsake did he say so lanyons mouth turned down at the corners do you think i would take his word for it no he didnt mention it at all and i didnt bother to ask him it doesnt really matter what he says miss dorothea parfitt told us shes a friend of miss albertons and apparently miss alberton was showing it to her boasting a little his expression was rueful leaving monk to picture the scene himself and draw his own conclusions they passed a strawberry sellers cart monk said nothing his mind was racing trying to fit into one congruous whole the vision of merrit bragging about the watch breeland had given her as a token of his love merrit standing in the warehouse yard watching as breeland forced her father and the two guards into the cramped and humiliating position then shot them in cold blood and the merrit he had seen in washington and on the ship home young and loyal confused by breelands coldness towards her constantly making excuses for him in her own mind making herself believe the best of him and now alone and in prison frightened facing trial and perhaps death and yet determined not to betray him even to save herself perhaps she was one of the worlds great lovers but breeland was not he might be one of the worlds idealists or one of its flawed obsessives not so much a man who supported a cause as a man who needed a cause to support him to fulfill a nature otherwise empty lanyon was waiting for an answer from him an ugly fact he granted im not yet ready to concede its meaning lanyon shrugged what about shearer monk changed the subject what does he say for himself have you found the boy who delivered the message to breeland at his rooms who sent it dont know yet lanyon answered havent found the boy could be any of thousands and hes not coming forward doesnt surprise me doesnt want to be connected with a man who committed a triple murder even supposing he knows we want him very likely he cant read even if somebodys told him hell be keeping his head down merrit said it was shearer who sent it nobodys seen him since the day before alberton was killed lanyon replied again watching for monks response they crossed the street just behind an open landau with laughing ladies holding up pale parasols their white and blue muslins fluttering in the slight breeze a lemonade seller stood on the corner now and then shouting out his wares lanyon stopped and bought one looking enquiringly at monk who copied him they both drank the liquid down without interrupting themselves to speak have you looked for him monk asked as they moved on already the air was getting hot but it was nothing like the stifling closeness of washingtonand london for all its tens of thousands its poverty and grime its magnificence opulence and hypocrisy was at peace yes of course we have lanyon replied not a whisper dont you think that requires an explanation lanyon grinned well the first one that comes to mind is that he was in league with breeland but had the good sense to disappear completely instead of going openly somewhere but then he didnt have six thousand guns to ship presumably he just had the money monk said dryly lanyon walked in silence for a hundred yards or so you did look into the money monk asked him of course lanyon answered stepping off onto the cross street monk keeping pace with him its clear enough in casbolt and albertons books he had the half down that trace paid him he never received a penny from breeland breeland says he paid the full amount to shearer when the guns were handed over at the euston square station well he would lanyon skirted around two elderly gentlemen in dark coats and striped trousers heads bent in earnest conversation and if he received the guns in time for the night train to liverpool what was it we followed down the river to bugsbys marshes monk thought for several minutes while they walked perhaps merrit was his witness he said at last the idea forming in his mind as he spoke maybe the guns went from bugsbys marshes and he simply told merrit they went through liverpool but he went that way himself so she would swear to it on the assumption you would go to america find him and bring him back to stand trial lanyon finished for him you work hard for your money monk ill give you that id hire you on my case if i were in trouble not on the assumption id bring him back monk snapped feeling the color wash up his face in order to deceive merrit because he didnt want her to know the truth couldnt afford for her to know he may well believe that anything he does including triple murder is justified by the cause but he knows damned well that merrit wouldnt especially when one of the victims was her father lanyons eyes widened and he slowed his stride considerably i suppose thats not impossible you mean shearer and breeland were accomplices breeland got the guns and shearer got the money poor alberton was killed which way did the guns go down the river to bugsbys marshes and across the atlantic from there monk answered as they crossed a busy street breeland went to liverpool and sailed separately taking merrit with him that may have been his original intention and he might have had to change his mind because of merrits obsession with him either way she is innocent of her fathers death so shearer killed alberton in order to steal the guns and sell them to breeland why not monks spirits rose doesnt it fit with everything we know apart from breelands watch at the warehouse yard yes lanyon looked sideways at him stepping up onto the curb how do you explain that i dont yet maybe she dropped it there earlier doing what lanyon asked incredulously why would merrit alberton be at the warehouse in tooley street not a usual place for a young lady in the normal course of her summer social round even as he was denying it monk realized how desperately he was reaching for an escape for merrit perhaps she and breeland went there to make some agreement with shearer earlier in the evening why there to verify the merchandise breeland wouldnt pay for guns unless he knew what he was getting lanyon squinted at him didnt trust him to sell the right guns even though he was albertons agent but did trust him enough to hand over the whole amount of the money to him and sail off to america in the absolute faith that the guns would be shipped to him and not either kept or sold to someone else he pursed his lips what was to stop shearer from pocketing the money and selling the guns again or even simply leaving them where they were not a lot breeland could do about it from new york another idea flashed into monks mind maybe that was why he took merrit with him insurance against being cheated by alberton maybe but why would shearer care what happened to merrit he killed alberton anyway monk remembered breelands face when he had been told about the murders i dont believe breeland knew about that he believed shearer was acting out of principle that he believed just as passionately as he did himself in the fight against slavery he saw lanyons look of comical incredulity talk to breeland he said quickly listen to him hes a fanatic in his view all rightminded people believe as he does lanyon took the point i suppose its possible he said cautiously so shearer is the villain breeland the fanatic guilty of buying stolen guns and using merrits love for him but not of murder and merrit herself is guilty only of being led by her heart and ignoring her head i suppose at sixteen thats half to be expected he shrugged if a woman wouldnt do all she could to help her betrothed wed be just as quick to criticize her probably monk agreed although privately he wondered just how much blind adoration he could takeperhaps at thirty a lot more than he could now and would he have used it with the same disregard as lyman breeland did probably what was given so freely was often valued too little but the fact that he himself might have been no better did not soften his dislike for breeland if anything it deepened it are you going to pursue that lanyon asked curiously im going to pursue everything monk replied unless of course i find something so conclusive it isnt necessary he grinned broadly at lanyon but it was ironic and they both knew it lanyon shrugged good luck he sounded as if he meant it monk started again at the very beginning at the warehouse yard following the trail of the wagons leaving he remembered vividly going into the closed space in the pale summer morning and seeing the dead bodies in their grotesque positions he remembered casbolts face in the light the smell of blood the wheel tracks over the stones he also remembered manassas and the strange reality of war the whole of it was like a dream all smaller than it should have been the dust and the heat ridiculously commonplace gunshots were not like thunder they were crackling like dozens of sticks being snapped as a bonfire took hold only the cannons roared but the blood and the fear had been more real than anyone could imagine so stark they still came back to him every time he closed his eyes and forgot to guard against them it was the smell that stayed in his memory what were three deaths compared with so many some of the soldiers had been shot down without even a fight just wasted as thoughtlessly as a man mows down grass was that how breeland looked at it did he see it not as murder but as war did he feel a few individual deaths were a small price to pay to secure the end of slavery for a whole race and perhaps the end of the sin of enslaving for another race his own an argument could be made for it monk could make one himself he knew what hester would say at least he thought he did you did not save a people from sin by committing another sin yourself but was she a realist or did she think of individuals one mans injuries or pain one mans grief because it was what she could help and refuse to see a wider whole certainly lyman breeland ignored the individual and saw the thousands the tens of thousands and monk found something in breeland repellent did that make breeland wrong or only morally braver more of a visionary and less of an ordinary limited human being monk stood in the sun in tooley street and weighed the possibilities the wagons had left through the gates and must have turned either left or right the guns were too heavy to have been transported other than by horsedrawn vehicles or on barges along the river the river was by far the closer it was the way alberton normally moved all heavy goods it was the way everyone did but breeland was american perhaps he did not know that could he have gone by road to the euston square station well over a month had gone by it would be hard to find witnesses who remembered anything let alone were willing to testify to it could breelands story be true that was the place to start the wagons loaded with six thousand guns would be big enough passing through the streets in the middle of the night but time was a whole different question breeland had said the note had come to him about midnight alberton was still alive then he was killed around three according to the medical evidence and the reasonable deduction as to the loading of the guns the wagons must have left immediately after how long would it take them heavily laden but in the trafficfree still of the night he started to walk rapidly then caught a cab following the shortest route over the river towards the euston square station thinking furiously all the way even at a trot which wagons could not have done he could not have made it in less than half to threequarters of an hour he paid the cabdriver and strode into the station he asked to see the stationmaster quoting lanyons name as if he had a right to it is regarding illegal shipment of arms he said grimly and triple murder my information must be exact lives depend upon it and perhaps britains reputation for honor the clerk obeyed with alacrity let the decision for dealing with this be somebody elses ill fetch mr pickering sir the stationmaster kept him waiting only fifteen minutes he was an agreeable man with a thick gray mustache and handsome sidewhiskers he welcomed monk into his office how can i be of assistance sir he said mildly but he eyed monk up and down weighing his importance and reserving judgment he had heard wild statements before and was not easily impressed monk would not retreat but he decided to phrase his request carefully thank you for your assistance mr pickering as you are no doubt aware there was a triple murder in tooley street on june twentyeighth and a large shipment of british guns was stolen and exported to america all london is aware of it sir pickering replied a very enterprising agent of enquiry tracked down the murderer and brought him back to stand trial for it monk felt a sharp prickle of satisfactionhe did not like to call it pride indeed william monk he introduced himself allowing himself a faint smile now i need to be sure that at that trial the man does not escape justice he is claiming that he bought the guns quite legally paying full price for them and that he shipped them out from this station on the train to liverpool the very night that the murders took place there was a train to liverpool that night no trains before six in the morning sir pickering shook his head we dont run night trains on this line monk was taken aback suddenly the one thing he was sure of had slipped away none at all he pressed well the occasional special pickering swallowed hard but his eyes did not waver private hire dont often refuse one of those was there one that night friday the twentyeighth of june it would really be the early hours of saturday morning i can look it up pickering offered turning to look at a sheaf of papers on a shelf behind his desk monk waited impatiently the seconds stretched out into a minute then two here we are pickering said at last yes by jove there was a special that night all the way to liverpool goods and a few passengers here you are he held out the sheaf of paper monk snatched it from him the train had left at five minutes before two oclock are you sure it went on time he demanded he heard the edge to his voice and could not control it yes sir pickering assured him that sheet is written up afterwards it should have gone five minutes before thats the time it actually went i see thank you does it help yes it does the murders could not have happened before about three oclock pickering looked relieved and puzzled i see he said although plainly he did not do you know if it carried cases of guns monk asked not expecting an answer of any value guns no sir just machinery timber and i believe a consignment of bathroom furnishings why a special train for those bathroom furnitures fragile sir i suppose who hired it on the bottom there sir pickering pointed at the sheet in monks hand messrs butterby and scott of camberwell he regarded monk curiously did you think the american took the guns on our train to liverpool newspapers said he went down the river to bugsbys marshes and then across the atlantic to america seems like the sensible thing to do if id just murdered three men and stolen thousands o guns id get out of the country and away from the law as fast as i could i wouldnt even hang around on the river id be down there as quick as the tide would carry me and while it was still as dark as it gets this time o the year so would i monk agreed id hope to have weighed anchor and be on the high seas before theyd traced which way id gone pickering looked puzzled but if i hadnt stolen them monk explained if id bought them legitimately and didnt know anything about murders id go through liverpool it would save considerable time days rather than go all around the south coast of england before reaching the atlantic pickerings bristly eyebrows shot up you think he didnt do it so who did then i dont know what i think monk admitted except that whoever killed those men in tooley street did not travel north on one of your trains i can swear to that pickering assured him and i will if im called you get that devil mr monk thats no way to treat anybody whatever it is you think youre fighting for monk agreed with him thanked him and took his leave he spent the rest of the day and all the following one retracing his steps down the river from tooley street as far as bugsbys marshes again he spoke to everyone who had seen the barge he and lanyon had tracked the first time and a good few others who might have it was exactly the same as before a heavily laden barge piled with crates the size and shape to carry muskets the barge lying low in the water moving clumsily to begin with but gathering impetus as it increased speed out in the center of the current two men one tall and lean and with a soft foreign accentthey thought american certainly with its pronounced rs and slightly slurred consonants it was not european of any sort he had seemed to be in charge and was giving the orders it had all been done discreetly even stealthily hailing no one else ignoring the usual comradeship of the river men again he lost them at bugsbys marshes he tried several times to find anyone who had seen them beyond greenwich or who had seen an oceangoing ship coming going or moored but there was nothing a waterman shrugged leaning on his oars wrinkling his eyes against the glare of the sun off the incoming tide not so odd really he said chewing on his lip idden round the bend o bugsbys marshes ood be lookin lie there all night and not likely ter be seen if yer lie close in like thats wot id do if i ad business as was private then be off on the first o the tide be out ter sea afore breakfast monk thanked him and was about to turn away and walk back towards the artichoke tavern when the man called after him eh yer wanner find out wot appened ter it monk swiveled back do you know course i dont or id a told yer but yer said yer traced it down this far an a blind man can see yer think it ad suffink valuable in it suffink stolen monk was impatient well avent yer asked them wot as the barge the waterman said shaking his head asked then it struck monk almost like a physical blow he had followed the trail of the barge as far as bugsbys marshes but his mind had been fixed on breeland and the guns he had not thought of the barges returning upstream to wherever it was now that might provide proof of shearers complicity and if not where he was now then at least where he had gone after the murders monk could have kicked himself for not having done that straightaway it seemed lanyon had not thought of it either they had both been so convinced that catching breeland was everything it had not seemed to matter presumably breelands undenied possession of the guns plus his watch at the scene had been proof enough without finding out where he had hired the barge and from whom that in itself was not incriminating breeland would claim he had done so in the hope of being able to purchase the guns in the usual way but now it mattered yes he said grudgingly it pricked him to be taught the obvious by a river man whose job it was to row boats and understand tides yes ill trace the barge back up thank you the river man grinned and pushed his cap back farther on his head before picking up his oars again and pulling away but even though he spent that evening until dusk and all the day after monk found no trace of the barges return journey nor did the river police know anything about a barge stolen or missing appens a gaptoothed sergeant told him standing on the dockside in the sun the tide lapping high at the pier stakes below them mebbe it was stole from someone as stole it emselves so they couldnt say much or could be it were put back afore it were missed or maybe it belonged to whoever used it monk added they might have been well paid to keep silent could be the sergeant agreed glumly daresay yerll never know sorry i cant elp yer i cant even tell yer were ter begin theres undreds o wharfs an docks along the river an scores of em d do yer a favor if yer paid em right an keep their mouths shut monk stared across the busy river light reflecting off the gray water between strings of barges going upstream with the incoming tide they carried goods from all over the world everything from timber coal and machinery to silks spices and exotic furs perhaps cotton from the confederate states to feed the mills of manchester and the north and tobacco for the gentlemens cigars in mayfair and whitehall a pleasure boat passed decks lined with people their straw hats on against the sun scarves and handkerchiefs bright somewhere a hurdygurdy was playing the air smelled of salt and fish and a whiff of tar do you know an agent named shearer monk asked the sergeant thought for a few moments tall feller thin long nose an a lot o teeth he asked crooked at the front like actually i dont know ive not met him and he had not seen judith alberton to ask her for a physical description he worked for daniel alberton in tooley street thats the one sharp feller very quick ter see the advantage in anything do you know him professionally i mean criminally like no too fly for that an no need as i can see jus eard of him up an down the river do you know anything else about him monk pressed him do you know where he came from has he any political beliefs political beliefs the sergeant looked startled like wot anarchist or the like never eard e were dangerous ceptin if yer crossed im over money could be nasty then but so can a lot o folk i was thinking of sympathies with either side in the american civil war monk knew it sounded ridiculous as he said it standing side by side with this river sergeant watching the barges nudging each other upstream towards the docks the commerce of the world coming and going this was trade cargo profit it was tides weather tonnages who bought and who sold and at what price washington and bull run were another life shouldnt think so the sergeant shrugged shouldnt think e even knew there was a war less they bought summink for someone an wanted it shipped spose thats the guns eh wouldnt think a man like shearerd give a toss where they went long as they were paid for that fit in with monks theory that breeland could have paid shearer with the price of the guns and shearer could have been the one who murdered alberton and took the guns down the river while breeland himself and merrit went to liverpool by train the only question then was why had breeland been rash enough to trust shearer and obviously he had been right to do so because the guns had arrived in washington but monk could not believe it not without some compelling reason why breeland would trust shearer yet it seemed there must have been such a fact was there another person involved not likely unless it had in some way been alberton himself and he had then been betrayed by shearer breeland had said the note sent to him had been from shearer but he would not know that anyone could sign shearers name one thing was absolutely certain monk was still a considerable distance from the truth he made his way back to tooley street and the warehouse it was busy now storage and shipment buying and selling continued in spite of albertons death perhaps it was not as thriving as it had been but his reputation had been excellent and casbolt was still alive although his part in the business had apparently been more to do with purchase monk went in through the open gates with an icy shiver of memory there was a wagon in the center of the yard horses shifting restlessly on the cobbles flies buzzing around a smell of manure wood shavings oil sweat and tar heavy in the air two men were working together lowering a wooden crate from the winch into the back of the wagon and they finished as he approached them one lashed the crate firmly so it would not shift the other went to close the warehouse doors yeah the one at the wagon turned to monk civilly enough he was a square heavyshouldered man with a mild blunt face elp yer sir i hope so im looking for mr shearer i believe he used to work with mr alberton monk replied yeah e did an all the man responded pushing his hand through what was left of his hair poor mr albertons dead murdered spect you know that all lunnon does but i aint seen shearer for weeks in fact not since poor mr alberton were done in an thats a fact he turned to the man coming back from closing the warehouse doors eh sandy feller eres lookin fer shearer yer see im lately cos i aint sandy shook his head aint seen im since i dunno reckon not in weeks mebbe day afore poor mr alberton got done in his face reflected sadness and an undisguised anger monk was surprised how much it pleased him he had liked alberton he had not allowed himself to think about that lately suppressing it in his concentration on solving the question of who was responsible for albertons death and proving exactly how it had been accomplished what was he like he asked aloud then he realized he had not introduced himself my name is monk mrs alberton has employed me to help her with regard to mr albertons death she believes there is much more to learn about it than we know at present and there may be other people involved that was true literally if not in its implication he did not wish to tell them it was to clear merrit of the charge of murder they might well believe her guilty if the newspapers were accurate which was highly debatable the general public had little doubt as to her involvement eh bert over ere sandy called to a third man who had appeared at the warehouse doors come an elp this gent ere es workin fer mrs alberton that was sufficient to make bert move with alacrity whether they knew judith personally or not mention of her name ensured complete cooperation wot yer reckon ter shearer then sandy prompted ow would yer describe im fer someone as ad never met im an knew nuffink bert considered carefully before he answered clever he said at last clever as a rat eye ter the best chance the first man added nodding sagely ambitious monk asked they all three nodded greedy monk ventured gonna get is share bert agreed never knowed im ter cheat though ter be fair dont do ter cheat not if yer get caught at it sandy added this sort o business yerll be lucky ter land in the clink more like facedown in the river but i never knowed im ter cheat neither cant say as i ever eard e did had ambitions but not dishonest as far as you know monk summed up sright guv theres another five undred guns was ere an theyre gorn too but we reckoned as ooever was ere took em all you think as shearer ad summink to do wif doin in the gaffer the first man asked squinting a little at monk papers says as it were that yankee im not sure monk said honestly breeland got the guns no doubt about that but im not sure he actually killed mr alberton then owd e get em sandy said reasonably an if it werent for them guns whyd anyone do im like that that aint even a decent way ter kill anyone thats he searched in vain for a word barbaric monk supplied yeah that an all bert nodded vigorously yer reckon as shearer ad summink ter do wif it sandy persisted an then he scarpered like cos nobody round eres seen im since then does it fit in with what you know of him monk asked they looked at each other then back again yeah near enough sandy agreed don it yeah if the money were right bert added ave ter be e wouldnt do it fer nuffink sort o liked the gaffer in is own way ave ter be a lot he bit his lip still an all the way it were done i dont see shearer doin it like that that ad ter be the yankee what about for the price of six thousand firstclass rifled muskets monk persisted wellspose so thats a lot o money in any mans reckonin sandy acknowledged could he have sympathized with the union cause monk tried a last question on the subject they all looked mystified against slaving monk explained to keep all the states of america as one country we dont ave no slaving in england sandy pointed out least not black slaving he added wryly theres some as thinks they got it ard an as for the states o america why should we care let em do whatever they likes i says bert shook his head id be agin slavery int right me too the first man added cant say as shearer gave a toss though not so as ter kill anyone over it like do you know where shearer lives monk asked them new church street just off bermondsey low road bert replied dunno the number but ends in a three as i recall about alfway along was he married shearer not likely monk thanked them and left the yard to try new church street it took him nearly half an hour to find where shearer had lived and an irate landlady who had waited three weeks with an empty property bin ere near on nine year e ad she said belligerently then ups and goes gawd knows where an without a byyourleave says nothing to nobody an left all is rubbish ere fer me ter clear out lorst three weeks o rent money i did her eyes glared stonily at monk you a friend o is then no monk lied quickly he owes me money too she laughed abruptly well yer got no chance ere cos i got nuffink an i aint partin wif the lil i got from sellin is clothes ter the rag an bone an i tell yer that fer nothin do you think something could have happened to him her thin eyebrows shot up that one not likely too fly by alf im got a better offer an took it i spec or the rozzers is after im she looked monk up and down that wot you are a rozzer i told you he owes me money yeah well i never knew a rozzer wot was close kin ter the truth but if e owes yer money i reckon as es in for trouble if yer finds im like yer look like trouble ter me monk had an instant of recollection as if someone else had said exactly the same to him but it was gone before he could place it such jolts of memory from before the accident were becoming fewer and he no longer actively searched for them or tried to hold them with him what she had said was probably true he did not forgive easily and if someone had cheated him he would have pursued the culprit to the last hiding place and exacted what was due but that was a long time ago then his carriage had overturned robbing him of all his past in the summer of in the five years since he had built a new life a new set of memories and characteristics he thanked her and left there was nothing more to be learned here shearer had disappeared what mattered was where he had gone and why tomorrow he would speak with dockers and bargees who would have known him he might even find where the barge had come from that had taken the guns down the river then he would go on to the shipping offices shearer would have dealt with to export albertons guns or machinery and whatever else he traded in that evening he told hester a little of what he had learned do you think it was shearer who actually killed mr alberton she asked with a lift of hope in her voice they were sitting at the table over a meal of cold chicken pie and fresh vegetables he noticed that she looked a little tired where have you been all day he asked do you she insisted what do you think shearer killed daniel alberton possibly where have you been at the small pox hospital at highgate were still trying to improve the quality of staff caring for the patients there but its difficult ive been writing letters most of the time it was on the edge of his tongue to make some remark about florence nightingale who was inexhaustible in her letter writing in her efforts to bring about hospital reform but he forbore it explained hesters tiredness he had promised months ago to employ a woman to keep house and forgotten about it it would mean merrit was not guilty she said watching him keenly it would explain how breeland did it without her knowledge he smiled youd like that wouldnt you it was a statement she hesitated only a moment yes she admitted i cant see any way he is innocent but i really want to believe she is he relaxed a little you should start looking for someone to come in every day even if its only for a few hours she thought about it for several minutes watching his face trying to judge if he was being overgenerous he could read her thoughts as if they were written in front of him look for someone he repeated maybe three days a week long enough to clean and do some cooking yes she accepted yes i will she looked at him very levelly a smile beginning in her eyes he felt remarkably pleased as if he had given her the best gift imaginable and perhaps it was because his real gift was time to devote to what she was good at time to use the skills she possessed in abundance instead of laboring to develop those she would never find natural he smiled back more and more broadly she knew his thoughts too she bit her lip i can cook she said quickly moderately he did not argue he just grinned in the morning he began on the river speaking to dockers and bargees yet again this time not about the movement of the guns but about shearer it took him till early afternoon to find anyone who knew shearer and was willing to talk about him but all he could say reinforced what monk had already heard from the men at the warehouse shearer was hard ambitious competent but to all outward appearances loyal to daniel alberton he was not spoken of with liking but there was a definite respect in the mens faces and in the tone of their voices it left monk further confused the picture of shearer that emerged did not sit easily with the facts he walked along the street almost unconscious of the passing traffic the heavily laden wagons the men shouting to one another the cranes rising and lowering the jostling crowds of masts as the tide jiggled the boats the occasional gull wheeling overhead shearer had disappeared that seemed unarguable the guns had gone to america as had breeland and merrit alberton and the two guards were dead murdered the barge with the guns had gone down the river towards bugsbys marshes and was untraceable after that breeland and merrit seemed to have traveled by train to liverpool but the only train in which they could have gone had left before the murders and thus before the guns had left the warehouse it seemed shearers involvement was the only fact which could link all three things together and make any kind of sense of them someone must know more of shearer and might even know of the ship which had come up the thames as far as bugsbys marshes and loaded the guns and then weighed anchor and gone out to sea again was it a british ship or an american one perhaps what he had already learned would be enough to raise reasonable doubt as to merrits guilt if there were no prejudice and jurors were able to disregard their emotions but it would certainly not be sufficient to clear her name there would always be those who would believe her guilty simply that it had not been proved she had got away with it that was only a little better than hanging a kind of life in limbo although if she returned to america with breeland perhaps englands opinion of her would matter less but was it also enough to save breeland from the rope against the hatred there was for him the conviction in the publics mind that he was guilty and would he inevitably drag her down with him not that it made any difference to what monk had to do probabilities of a verdict one way or the other were rathbones business although he was certain rathbone would want to know the truth as much as he did someone had bound up three men and shot them through the head he needed to know who that someone was beyond any doubt at all reasonable or not he went into the nearest shipping office and asked to speak to the clerks shearer a young man in a tight jacket repeated the name oh yes very good fellow agent for mr alberton he sucked in his breath terrible business that awful thank goodness they got the man who did it kidnapped the daughter too by all accounts he made a clicking sound with his tongue when did you last see shearer monk asked the clerk thought for a few minutes doesnt deal with us a lot he replied certainly i havent seen him for a couple of months or more i expect hes very busy what with poor mr alberton gone dont know whats going to happen to the business good reputation but wont be the same without mr alberton himself very reliable he was knew a lot about shipping and trade too knew who had what and always paid a fair price but nobodys fool cant replace that even though mr casbolt is brilliant at the buying so i hear terrible shame i cant find anybody who has seen shearer since mr albertons death monk told him the clerk looked surprised well i never knew he thought the world of mr alberton but didnt think hed go off like that thought hed stay around to look after the business best he could for the widows sake poor woman goes to show you never know do you no who did shearer deal with mostly if not you pocock and aldridge up on the west india dock road big place ask anyone monk thanked him and left it was some distance to the west india docks so he took the first hansom he saw and arrived twentyfive minutes later he paid the driver and alighted then turned towards the building and suddenly he knew exactly what it would be like inside as if he had visited it frequently and this were only one more routine call it was unnerving he had no idea why he would have come here or when it was no time he could recall since the accident he strode across the pavement almost bumping into a thin man in gray and without apologizing he went up the few steps and pulled the door open inside was completely strange to him not as he had seen it in his minds eye at all the proportions were more or less the same but there was a desk where he had not seen it the walls were the wrong color and the floor which had been the most individual feature tiled in grayandwhite marble was now wooden he stopped abruptly confused mornin sir can i elp yer the man behind the desk asked monk collected himself with difficulty he found he was fumbling for words trying to bring himself back to the present yes i need to speak to the name taunton came into his mind but he had no idea from where yes sir oo was it yer wanted the man asked helpfully do you have a mr taunton here yes sir would that be the elder mr taunton or the younger monk had no idea but he must answer he went with instinct rather than sense the elder yes sir what name shall i say monk william monk right sir if yerd care ter wait sir ill tell im the message came back within minutes and monk was directed up a stair that curved graciously onto a landing he could not remember what the man in the hall had said but he had no hesitation in turning left and walking to the end of the corridor this was familiar a little smaller than he recalled but he even knew the feel of the handle when he touched it recalled the catch as the door stuck before it swung wide the man inside the comfortable room was standing there was surprise in his face and unease in the angles of his body he was a little older than monk perhaps fifty his hair was receding auburn in color his cheeks ruddy monk knew that mr taunton the younger was his half brother not his son a taller darker man with a sallow complexion well well taunton said nervously after all these years what brings you here monk thought id seen the last of you he looked puzzled as if monks appearance confused him he could not help staring first at monks face then at his clothes even his boots monk realized that taunton was older than he had expected he could not recall him with a full head of hair but the gray in it was new the lines in his face a certain coarsening of features he had no idea how long it had been since they had last met or what the circumstances were was it to do with police work or even before that that would make it twenty years or more well into the past that monk had lost completely not even patched together from fragments learned here and there people he had come across in investigations since the accident he could not afford to trust that taunton was a friend he could not assume that of anyone the little he knew of his life showed he had earned more fear than love there might be all manner of old debts left unpaid his and others this was a time when he wished fiercely that he knew himself better knew who were his enemies and why knew their weaknesses he was without armor without weapons he searched tauntons face and saw no warmth in it the expression was guarded careful but already there was a beginning of pleasure as if he had seen a vulnerability in monk and it pleased him monk racked his mind for something to say that would not betray his ignorance the place has changed he played for time hoping taunton would let slip some information so at least he would know how long ago they had last met perhaps even the mood whether their enmity was open or concealed because with every passing second he was more and more certain that it was enmity twentyone years i make it taunton said with a faint curl of his lip were doing well did you think we couldnt have the odd renovation here and there monk looked around the office it was well appointed but not luxurious he allowed his observation of it to reflect in his expressionunimpressed the color deepened in tauntons cheeks youve changed too he said with a faint sneer no more fancy shirts and boots thought youd have had everything made specially for you by now fall on hard times did you there was a keen undertone of pleasure in his voice almost relish dundas take you down with him did he dundas with blinding clarity monk saw the gentle face the intelligent clear blue eyes with laughter deep in the lines around them then as quickly it was overtaken by grief and a raging helplessness he knew dundas was dead he had been fifty perhaps fiftyfive monk himself had been in his twenties aspiring to be a merchant banker arrol dundas was his mentor ruined in some financial crash blamed for it wrongly he had died in prison monk wanted to smash the sneering face in front of him he felt the rage burn up inside him knotting his body making it difficult even to swallow his throat was so tight he must control it hide it from taunton hide everything until he knew enough to act and foresee the results how much did taunton know of monk since then did he know he had joined the police monk could not be sure his reputation had spread widely he had been one of the best and most ruthless detectives they had had but he might never have had occasion to work here in the west india docks a little change of direction he answered the question obliquely i had certain debts to collect he allowed himself a smile wolfish as he intended it to be taunton swallowed his eyes flicked up and down monks very ordinary clothes the ones he had chosen in order to be inconspicuous on the river and in the docks doesnt look like they amounted to much he observed i havent collected them all yet monk answered the words out before he gave them thought taunton was rigid his hands moving restlessly by his sides his eyes never leaving monks face i dont owe you anything monk and after twentyone years i dont know who does he let out a little snort we always did very well by you everybody made their profit no one got caught far as i know caught the word struck monk like a physical blow caught by whom over what he did not dare ask what had dundas been accused of in the end what was it that had ruined him monk could remember only the fury he had felt and the absolute conviction that dundas was innocent blamed wrongly and he monk should have known some way to prove it but was it something to do with taunton or did taunton know about it because everyone did monk hungered to have the truth all of it more than almost anything else he could think of it had haunted him ever since the first shafts of memory had struck him fragments emotions small moments of recollection gone before he could perceive anything more than an impression a feeling a look on someones face the inflection of a voice and always the sense of loss a guilt that he should have been able to prevent it worried he asked staring back at taunton not in the least taunton replied and they both knew it was a lie it hung in the air between them for once monk was pleased that he inspired fear too often his ability to intimidate had disturbed him made him feel guilty for that part of him which must have liked it in the past know a man named shearer he changed the subject abruptly not to discomfort taunton but because he did not know what else to say to him about the past above all taunton must not guess that monk himself did not know shearer taunton was startled walter shearer thats right you do know him that was a statement of course i do but you wouldnt have come here if you didnt know that already taunton answered he frowned hes an agent for shipping machinery and heavy goods marble timber guns mostly for daniel albertonor he was until alberton was murdered his voice dropped whats that to do with you are you in guns now he shifted his weight slightly monk could smell fear sudden and sharp physical rather than the slow anxiety there had been before tauntons imagination had taken a leap forward when he spoke again his voice was a pitch higher as if his throat had tightened till he could scarcely breathe is it something to do with you monk because if it is i want no part of it he was shaking his head stepping backwards working for men who make their money slaving is one thing but murder is something else you can swing for that alberton was well liked every mans handll be against you i dont know where shearer is and i dont want to hes a hard man gives no quarter and asks none but hes no killer monk felt as if he had been hit so hard his lungs were paralyzed starved for air tauntons voice rose even higher look monk what happened to dundas was nothing to do with me we made our deal and we both kept our sides of it i dont owe you anything and you dont owe me if you cheated dundas thats between you and and the grave now dont come after me he held up his hands as if to ward off a blow and i want nothing to do with those guns theres a rope waiting at the end of those im not shipping them for you i swear on my life monk found his voice at last i havent got the guns you fool im looking for the man who killed alberton i know where the guns are theyre in america i followed them there taunton was stunnednonplussed then what do you want why are you here i want to know who killed alberton taunton shook his head why for a moment monk could not answer was that really what he had been like a man who did not care that three men had been murdered or who had done it did his need to know require explaining taunton was still staring at him waiting for the answer it doesnt matter to you monk jerked himself out of his thoughts where is shearer i dont know i havent seen him for close on two months id tell you if i knew just to get rid of you believe me monk did believe him the fear in his eyes was real the smell of it in the room taunton would have given up anyone friend or foe to save himself how had monk ever been willing to trade with such a man and worse than that larger and far uglier to make profit by trading with a man whose money came from slaving had dundas known that or had monk misled him as taunton implied either thought made him sick he needed the truth and he was afraid of it there was no point in seeking an answer from taunton he did not know what he believed of monk was indictment enough monk shrugged and turned on his heel going out without speaking again but as he walked past the man at the desk in the hall his thoughts were not on taunton or shearer but on hester and her face in his minds eye as she had spoken of slavery to her it was unforgivable what would she feel if she knew what he now knew of himself already the thought of it bowed him down crushed him inside he walked out into the sun and was cold for the first time since he had been married monk was reluctant to go home and because he dreaded it he did it immediately he did not want time to think any more than he had to there was no possibility of avoiding seeing hester meeting her eyes and having to build the first lie between them earlier in their knowledge of each other they had fought bitterly he had thought her opinionated quicktongued and coldnatured a woman whose passion was all bent towards the improvement of others whether they wished it or not and she had thought him selfish arrogant and essentially cruel this morning he would have smiled at how happy they both were now it twisted inside him like a torn muscle a pain reaching into everything blinding all other pleasures he opened the door and closed it behind him she was there straightaway giving him no time to recompose his thoughts all his earlier words fled she misunderstood thinking it to do with his search along the river you found something ugly she said quickly what is it to do with breeland even if hes guilty that doesnt mean merrit is there was so much conviction in her voice he knew she was frightened that somehow she was mistaken and merrit had played a willing part it was the perfect chance to tell her what he had really found uglier than she could imagine but about himself not breeland he could not do it there was a beauty in her he could not bear to lose he remembered her in manassas bending over the soldier half covered in blood tending to his wounds willing him to live sharing his pain and giving him her strength what would she think of a man who had made money out of dealing with the profits of slaving he had never been more ashamed of anything in his life anything he knew about or more afraid of what it would now cost him and he realized that was the most precious thing he would ever have william what is it there was an edge of fear in her voice and in her eyes what did you find she was concerned for merrit and perhaps for judith alberton she could not guess that it was her own life that was threatened her happiness not theirs the truth stuck in his throat nothing conclusive he swallowed i didnt find any trace of the barge coming back up the river ive no idea whose it was probably someone who lent it willingly or it was stolen from someone who darent report it or maybe they stole it themselves he wanted to touch her as he usually did feel the warmth of her body the eagerness of her response but selfdisgust held him back closing him in like a vise she moved back again a flicker of hurt in her face it was the first taste of the overwhelming loneliness to come like the fading of the sun before nightfall hester she looked up he had no idea what to say he could not face the truth he had had no time yet to work out what words to use i think shearer may be the one who killed alberton it was a lame thing to fill the place of what was in his mind it was hardly a revelation she looked a little puzzled well it would explain the odd time with the train i suppose she conceded a conspiracy between shearer and breeland which merrit did not know about perhaps she and breeland were at the yard earlier and that was when she dropped the watch then her face clouded but why would they go there it doesnt make sense why was daniel alberton there anyway at that time of night she frowned was it something to do with merrit running away do you suppose and he was still there when shearer came to steal the guns she shook her head it doesnt sound likely does it it did not there was still some major fact they were missing he had to concentrate hard to make himself feel that it mattered are you hungry she asked her eyes bright again yes he lied he guessed she had gone to some trouble now that he thought about it there was a warm savory odor coming from the kitchen she smiled fresh game pie and vegetables she looked pleased with herself i found a woman today shes scottish her name is mrs patrick shes a bit fierce but shes a terrific cook and shes prepared to come every weekday afternoon for three hours which is good because most people like to do all day or not at all some even expect to live in she searched his face shes half a crown a week do you think that will be all right he did not even think to add it up excellent yes if you like her then make it permanent thank you her voice lifted i do appreciate it she touched him lightly but there was intimacy in it a sweetness that sent his pulse racing and a pain through him at his deception he had no idea how he was going to live with it an hour at a time then a day at a time maybe he would learn to forget it for whole periods he would probably never know exactly what he had done with taunton if he had betrayed arrol dundas or not or what had driven him to it it might have been as simple as greed the desire for the power of success or possibly there was some mitigating circumstanceif only he knew it he followed her into the kitchen pleasantly cool with the back windows open and full of the delicious aromas of expertly seasoned food in other circumstances it would have been a perfect meal it took all the skill he possessed all the selfmastery to pretend it was hester was unaware of the turmoil within monk she believed it was no more than the frustration of a case he could not understand which made him shrink away and she resolved to play her own part in the detecting as soon as possible by the time he left the following morning still in search of more knowledge of shearer she had determined what to do dressed in her best morning gown of pale bluegray muslin she set out to visit robert casbolt she had no doubt he would see her because of the depth of his regard for judith alberton and for merrit he could not fail to know how desperate the situation was and regardless of his other commitments he would make time to help she knew where he lived because he had mentioned it that first evening at dinner she arrived shortly after nine oclock in the morning and gave her card to the butler with a respectful note written across the back saying simply that she felt it most urgent to speak with him at his earliest convenience in merrit albertons interest she was kept waiting only fifteen minutes then shown into a beautiful sitting room full of warm colors the walls were paneled with mellow oak and a red persian rug covered the floor in front of the huge stonemanteled fireplace which at this time of the year was half hidden by a tapestry screen the sofa and chairs were all odd some covered in velvet some in brocade and one in honeycolored leather but the whole effect was one of the greatest comfort there were two tall lamps of different sizes but both with brass columns and large hexagonal shades fringed in deep gold casbolt himself was dressed casually but obviously with care his linen was immaculate his soft indoor boots polished and shining how good of you to come mrs monk he said earnestly after you have already done so much judith told me that your husband is still working almost night and day to find some way of proving merrits innocence what can i do to help if i knew of anything at all believe me i would have done it she had already planned carefully what she intended to say i have been giving a great deal of thought to the matter for which mrs alberton first engaged my husbands services she said accepting the seat he offered her but declining any refreshment she did not need the excuse of a social amenity to keep his interest no pretense was necessary between them he looked startled almost as if he were not sure of her meaning he sat down opposite her on the edge of the chair rather than leaning back there was no relaxing in him at all whoever was willing to resort to blackmail to obtain the guns may have taken it a step further do you not think she explained his face cleared then he frowned again has mr monk found some evidence which suggests breeland is not guilty after all surely the fact that he has the guns precludes that possibility of course he is involved she agreed and perhaps we are seeing something more than is there because we all so badly wish merrit to be innocent we are trying to think of any solution that excludes her of course he agreed his face had a crumpled hurt look as if the optimism in his voice were at odds with his belief hester wondered if he knew a side to merrit they did not and it was that which now caused him to hesitate then he smiled i think merrit may have been completely duped by breeland she is young and in love one does not always see clearly and all the experience she has had is with honorable people he looked down at the rich carpet on the floor then up again quickly i know she quarreled very badly with her father but believe me mrs monk daniel alberton was a totally honorable man a man whose word anyone could trust absolutely and who would never stoop to a cruel or greedy act she was angry with him but she spoke in haste and the heat of emotion in her heart she knows just as i do that he was as good a man as walks the earth she met his gaze very frankly what are you telling me mr casbolt that she could not imagine duplicity therefore breeland could easily have misled her or that she loved her father too much to have been party to hurting him regardless of her anger that evening i suppose im telling you both mrs monk a sad selfmocking expression filled his face or that i care very much for the outcome of this tragedy and i would do anything to spare the family further pain there was no way she could be unaware of the power of his feelings the air between them was charged with the knowledge of fear horror the grief of loneliness in that moment hester glimpsed the reality of casbolts involvement with the albertons and the depth of his lifelong love and devotion to his cousin but she was not here to offer sympathy or encouragement could breeland have been part of the attempt at blackmail she asked he seemed willing to do anything at all to get the guns he is a man whose belief in his cause seems to him to justify anything he would see it as helping to preserve the union and freeing slaves casbolts eyes widened very slightly i had not thought of it but it is possible except how could he know of gilmer and daniels kindness to him any number of ways she responded someone obviously knew but he had only been in england a few weeks at that time how do you know that he drew in his breath slowly i dont and he could have had allies whatever the truth of it she pointed out it seems breeland was on a special night train to liverpool and could not actually have killed mr alberton himself and merrit was with him so that excludes her also thank heaven he leaned forward are you sure mrs monk please please dont raise judiths hopes unless there is no doubt whatever you understand it would be unbearably cruel of course i understand this is why i came to you not to her she said quickly and because i can speak to you more frankly about mrs alberton but do you think it is possible that the whole blackmail attempt is connected with the final theft of the gunswhether it was an unsuccessful attempt by breeland or even by mr trace his eyes widened trace yes it could be he is devious enough for that then he frowned but even if it were so how would that help merrit and to be honest mrs monk that is really all i care about i am not concerned with justice i hope i dont shock you in saying that i am sorry if i do daniel was my friend and i need to see his murderers brought to justice but not at the cost of further loss to his widow and daughter he was my best friend from youth and i knew him well i believe their welfare is what would have concerned him far above any revenge for his death and that is all it would be now he looked at her earnestly searching her eyes for understanding she tried to think how she would feel in judiths place would she care above all things that monk be avenged or would their childs safety and happiness come first if she were killed would she want monk to pursue vengeance for her the answer to that came immediately no she would want the living protected let time take care of justice i see you understand he said softly i thought you would there was gentleness in his voice and relief he could not hide it and perhaps he did not want to but she could not let go of the truth the need to worry at the problem until she had unraveled it she would decide afterwards who to tell and what decisions to make i wonder why they asked for the guns to be delivered to baskin and company instead of direct to them do you suppose they believed mr alberton had some reason not to sell to one side or the other in the american war he understood exactly what she meant i know of none but it would suggest someone who was unfamiliar with his family history anyone who knew him would never imagine he would do business that would profit pirates however indirectly so you are right in that it may be an american rather than someone british he shook his head a little but i dont see how that helps merrit in fact i dont even see how it brings us any closer to the truth what we need is something that shows merrit had no knowledge of breelands intention to harm daniel either that or that she knew but was unable to help she was under threat herself or imprisoned in some way we couldnt prove that because it is quite obviously untrue she pointed out she went with him willingly and is still prepared to defend him she believes he is innocent she believes it because she has to he shook his head and smiled very slightly ive known merrit since she was born she is the closest i have to a child of my own i know she is passionate and willful and when she gives herself to something or someone it is wholeheartedly and not always wisely i have watched her through a love of horses the determination to be a nun and then a missionary in africa and a deep infatuation with the local doctor a very nice young man who was quite unaware of her regard amusement and affection lit his face mercifully it passed without incident or embarrassment he shrugged i think it is all part of growing up i seem to remember a few turbulent emotions myself which i blush to recall now and certainly will not speak of hester could do the same including the vicar she had mentioned to monk she had also had periods of being quite convinced nobody loved her or understood her feelings least of all her parents nevertheless she persisted the blackmail attempt was quite real if it was not either breeland or trace then it was someone else could it have been mr shearer the agent he was startled shearer why he stared at her intently yes it could mrs monk it is a very disagreeable thought but it is not at all impossible shearer acting as intermediary for pirates and when that did not work then for breeland his voice rose and if breeland himself cannot have killed poor daniel then perhaps shearer did certainly he seems to have left london since daniels death i have not seen him since a day or two before that would explain a great deal and best of all it would account for merrits belief that breeland is innocent the quiet room seemed to glow around them a bowl of golden midseason roses shone amber and apricot reflected in the polished surface of the table beneath the grace of a targ horse filled an alcove poor daniel he said quietly he trusted shearer he was ambitious always looking for the advantage driving the hardest bargain for shipping of any man on the river and believe me that is saying a great deal but daniel thought he was loyal and i confess so did i his lips twisted in a bitter grimace but then i suppose the greatest betrayals are from where they are least expected another thought occurred to hester one she would far rather not have entertained but it would not be dismissed do you have any control over who buys the guns mr casbolt not legally but i suppose effectively i do if daniel had done something i found intolerable i could have overridden it why do you ask he never did or anything even questionable would you have sold them to the pirates no again he was meeting her eyes with candor and a fierce intensity and if you are thinking that daniel would then you are mistaken judith would never have borne it after what happened to her brother nor would i and daniel would not have done it even if she had never known believe me he hated the pirates as much as we did he looked down for a moment im sorry if i sound harsh mrs monk but you did not know daniel or you would not have asked what they did to her brother was monstrous daniel would not give them air to breathe let alone guns to continue their crimes nor would i have allowed it whatever the threat or the price hester believed him but she could not help wondering if perhaps daniel alberton had needed the sale sufficiently to connive at it and hope judith would never know with the american war guns appeared to be scarce and at a premium she did not wish to believe it she had liked alberton but she knew people would do desperate things if faced with ruin not even so much for the loss of material goods as for the shame of failure thank you mr casbolt you have been very kind in giving me so much of your time mrs monk please do not pursue this idea any further i knew daniel alberton better than any man in some ways even better than his wife did nothing in the world would have persuaded him to sell guns to any pirate on earth and least of all to those in the mediterranean you have met judith you must have some sense of what a remarkable woman she is how how it was obvious in his face that he could find no words adequate to name the qualities he saw in her daniel adored her he said fiercely his voice thick with emotion he would have lived out his days in debtors prison rather than break her trust by doing such a thing he was a most honorable man and and she loved him for it he this is difficult for me to say mrs monk he shook his head very slightly as if to dismiss some cloud around him he did not have great passion or wit great imagination but he was a man you could trust with anything and everything you possessed could you not sense that for yourself even in the brief time you knew him his smile was twisted with pain the agony in him seemed to fill the room or am i thinking you could see in a few hours what i saw in half a lifetime she was embarrassed for her thoughts and ashamed of having allowed him to see them i imagine it will prove as absurd as you say she made it half an apology in tone if not in words perhaps if we could find mr shearer it would give us the solution a strange bitterness filled his face for a moment then vanished i have no doubt that that is true who knows what hungers drive a man to the betrayal of those who trust him please just do what you can to save merrit mrs monk for judiths sake it is something i cannot do he swallowed i dont have the skill i can care for her in many other ways ways of business affairs and seeing that she is provided for and that she always has the respect of society but of course she promised quickly rising to her feet i shall do it for merrits sake also we worked side by side for a little while on the battlefield i know her courage and i like her he relaxed a little thank you he said quietly standing also please god that monk will find shearer or at least proof of his part in this when she spoke of her thoughts to monk he found the idea of albertons having connived to sell guns to the pirates repellent but he was obliged to consider the possibility she saw the wince of pain in his face as they sat over mrs patricks excellent supper which included a rhubarb pie whose pastry melted in the mouth she saw the darkness in his face it had been there the previous evening also and she wondered if the same fear had occurred to him then and he had been unwilling to say so he had liked alberton instinctively more than most clients and his death had left a sense of loss as well as anger but there was no way to blunt the thought only the truth could banish it perhaps what did casbolt say he asked her he denied that it was possible he said alberton adored judith and would rather have gone to debtors prison than deal with pirates she hesitated but he prompted but he was albertons closest friend and he could not bear to think he would betray judith like that or that he was so much less than they all believed him hes very loyal and she smiled very faintly at the memory of casbolts face in the beautiful glowing room the intensity of the emotion filling his body as he sat on the edge of his seat and he is pretty devoted to judith himself he would do anything to protect her from further hurt including lying to hide albertons guilt he pressed i should think so she answered frankly weighing her words and aware that she believed them true it would also be a matter of protecting the reputation of a dead friend for judiths sake too i can understand that even if i dont know whether i would do it myself or not his eyes widened at the expense of the truth you she looked back at him trying to read his expression but not with any intent to moderate how she answered i dont know not all truths need to be told some shouldnt i just dont know which they are yes you do there was a black shadow in his face they are those which cause the innocent to suffer and create a divide between people because of lies even lies of silence she did not understand the depth of feeling behind his words it was as if he were angry with her as he had been when they had first known each other and he had thought her hypocritical even cold perhaps then there had been parts of her that were locked away too quick to condemn what she did not understand and was afraid of but not now she did not know how to break through the barrier she could not find it touch it but she knew absolutely that it was there what had she said that had created it why did he not know her better than to misunderstand or love her enough to break it himself i dont know what the truth is she said quietly looking down at the table i think it more likely it had to do with shearer whether he meant to sell the guns to the pirates or trace or breeland or just anyone who wanted them i cant find shearer his voice was flat no one has seen him since before the murders doesnt that say a great deal in itself she asked if he were not involved somehow wouldnt he still be here wouldnt he be doing all he could to help and perhaps improve his own position in the business he might even hope to be some sort of manager he pushed his chair away from the table and stood up moving about the small room restlessly it isnt enough he said grimly you can see it and i can but we cant rely on a jury breeland had the guns he was involved he might have persuaded shearer actually to commit the murders probably for the price of the guns which could be enough to corrupt many men i admit i dont care if breeland hangs for it to corrupt another man to betrayal and murder is an even deeper sin than doing it yourself but it wont help merrit because it doesnt prove she had no knowledge of it but she started to protest then realized with a crushing weight that he was right not only would the jury be less likely to believe it because of her closeness to breeland and the fact that she had gone willingly with him dropping her watch in the warehouse yard but she herself in her misguided loyalty to him would not deny it there are dark places in everybody he said in the silence people you believe you know have violence and ugliness it is hard to accept and impossible to understand there was anger in his voice and a pain she heard only too clearly she wished to ask what he had discovered that he had not told her but she knew from the angle of his body the part of his face she could see half turned away from her as it was that he would not tell her she stood up to clear away the dishes and carry them through to the kitchen she would not mention it again at least not tonight monk went to bed early he was tired but far more than that he wished to avoid speaking with hester he had shut himself out and he did not know how to deal with it in the morning he woke early and left hester still asleep at least he thought she was he was not certain he wrote a hasty note telling her he had gone to the river again to pursue the matter of the guns the money and anything he could learn about the company who dealt with the pirates then he left he would find something to eat if he felt like it somewhere on the road there were plenty of peddlers around with sandwiches and pies the general mass of working people had no facilities to cook and ate in the street he did not want to risk hesters waking and finding him in the kitchen because he would have to give some explanation or openly avoid it and he was not ready to face so much inward pain from the very moment he awoke in the hospital his past had been an unknown land which carried too many areas of darkness too many ugly surprises he should have had the sense the selfrestraint to have guarded his feelings more he had known then that marriage was not for him love and its vulnerabilities were for those with uncomplicated lives who knew themselves and whose darkest recesses of the soul were only the ordinary envies and petty acts of retreat that affected everyone he had not been prepared for someone like hester who forced from him emotions he could not stifle or control and in the end could not even deny he should have found the strength to or at least the sense of selfpreservation too late now the wound was there wide open he went out of the house closing the front door softly and walked as quickly as he could along fitzroy street and into tottenham court road he had no choice but to examine the blackmail issue more closely his revulsion against the idea was no excuse in fact it impelled him to do all he could to test it against the facts and if possible disprove it it was too early to obtain permission to examine albertons finances rathbone would not be at his offices in vere street at this hour however monk could write a note asking for the necessary authority and leave it for him then he would pursue baskin and company who had been named as the intermediary for the pirates guns the river was busy in the early morning tides waited on no mans convenience and already dockers ferrymen bargees and stokers were busy he saw coal backers bent double under their heavy sacks keeping a precarious balance as they climbed out of the deep holds men shouted to one another and the cries of gulls circling low in hope of fish the clatter of chains and metal on metal were loud in the air above the everpresent surge and slap of water never eard of it guv the first man answered cheerfully when monk asked for the company int nowere round ere eh jim yer ever eard o baskin and company not round ere jim replied sorry mate and so it continued down as far as limehouse and around the curve of the isle of dogs and again across the river at rotherhithe he had been certain the ferrymen would know if anyone did but even the three he asked had never heard either name by midafternoon he gave up and went back to vere street to see if rathbone had obtained the necessary permission to go through daniel albertons accounts theres no difficulty rathbone said with a frown he received monk in his office looking cool and immaculate as always monk who had been traipsing up and down the dockside all day was aware of the contrast between them rathbone had no shadows in his past that mattered his smooth almost arrogant manner came from the fact that he knew himself better than most men he was so supremely confident in who he was he felt no need to impress others it was a quality monk admired and envied he had come to understand himself well enough to know that his own moments of cruelty came from selfdoubt his need to show others his importance he recalled himself to the present good what do you expect to find rathbone was looking curious and a trifle anxious nothing monk replied but i need to be certain rathbone leaned back in his chair why didnt you ask me to look monk smiled thinly because you may not want to know the answer humor flashed for an instant in rathbones eyes oh then you had better go alone just dont leave me walking into an ambush in court i wont monk promised i still think shearer is the one who actually committed the murders rathbones eyebrows rose alone no i think it would have taken more than one even holding a gun they were tied up before they were shot but he could have hired help anywhere he certainly lived and worked where he would be able to find plenty of men willing to kill a man for a reasonable price the price of those guns would be enough to buy nine decentsized houses a small percent of the profit would give him sufficient to obtain all kinds of assistance rathbones fastidious face expressed his distaste and i suppose we have no idea where shearer is now none at all could be anywhere here or in europe or america for that matter except its not the best place to be unless he has designs on making more money in the armaments business he debated with himself whether to mention the whole blackmail affair and his failure to find any trace of baskin and company and decided against it for the moment it might be easier for rathbone if he did not know he could well do that rathbone said thoughtfully leaning back and placing his fingertips together elbows on the arms of his chair he might have bought more guns somewhere with the money from breeland if what breeland says is true theres a very murky area in arms dealing and he would be in a position to know more about it than most it was a thought which had not occurred to monk he was annoyed with himself for it his preoccupation with the past and its destruction into the present was costing him the sharp edge of his skill but it was second nature to conceal it from rathbone thats another reason i need to see albertons books he said rathbone frowned i dont like this monk i think perhaps i had better know what you find i cant afford to be taken by surprise however much i may dislike what it shows no one has accused alberton of anything yet but i know the prosecution is going to use horatio deverill hes an ambitious bounder and they didnt nickname him devil for nothing hes unpredictable no loyalties few prejudices doesnt his ambition curb his indiscretion monk asked skeptically rathbones mouth turned down at the corners no hes got no chance of a seat in the lords and he knows it his hunger is for fame to shock to be noticed hes goodlooking and a certain kind of woman finds him attractive a quiver of humor touched his lips the sort whose lives are comfortable and a trifle boring he continued and who think danger would give them the excitement their rank and money shield them from i imagine you are familiar with the type do you then like a wave of heat inside him monk knew why rathbone had smiled monk himself carried that sort of danger and he knew it and had used it often enough it was a hint of the reckless the unknown even a suggestion of pain another reality they wanted to touch but not be trapped in boredom held its own kind of destruction he stood up then we had better know everything we can good or bad he said tersely if i see anything i dont understand ill send you a message and you can find me an accounts clerk monk only if i need one monk said from the door he did not intend to tell rathbone about his merchant banking days and that he knew very well how to read a balance sheet and what to look for if he suspected embezzlement or any other kind of dishonesty he wanted to block the whole of the past most especially to do with arrol dundas from his mind monk examined the books of albertons business far into the night alberton and casbolt had dealt in a number of commodities mostly to considerable profit casbolt had been extremely knowledgeable as to where to obtain goods at the best price and alberton had known where to sell them to the best advantage they had left a good deal of the shipping to shearer and had paid him well for his services read in detail the movement of money showed a trust among the three men stretching back nearly twenty years even with the skills he half remembered and which came back with startling clarity as he read added subtracted monk found nothing that was less than completely honest but he also had no doubt whatever when he finally closed the last ledger at twentyfive minutes to one that the guns the pirates agents had demanded through blackmail would be worth roughly the guns unaccounted for from the warehouse after albertons death and the robbery had not been paid for through the books there had been no money in albertons possession at the time of his death and nothing concealed in the warehouse if money had changed hands at all it had gone with whoever had left tooley street that night or else breeland had passed it to shearer at the euston square station as he had said tomorrow he would go back and speak to breeland when hester awoke she found monks note it left her with an increasing sense of loss she was almost grateful that the trial of merrit and breeland loomed so close it left her less time to torture herself with questions and fears as to what had changed between them thoughts had flickered darkly across her mind that perhaps he regretted the commitment of marriage that he felt trapped closed in by the expectations the constant companionship the limits to his personal freedom but the change in him had been so sudden it made little sense there had been no hint of it before indeed the opposite was true finding mrs patrick had been a stroke of good fortune it freed hester to pursue her interest in medical reform without neglecting domestic duties and mrs patrick was undeniably a better cook she forced it from her mind and dressed in soft gray one of her favorite colors then set out to call upon judith alberton she was not exactly sure what she wished to ask her or even what she hoped to learn but judith was the only person who knew what had happened to her brother and his family and hester still had the feeling that the blackmail attempt was at the heart of the murders whether it had been brought about by shearer or by breeland or even possibly by trace although that was a thought she hoped profoundly was not true she had liked philo trace the fact that he was from the south and his people countenanced the keeping of slaves was an accident of birth and culture it had nothing to do with the charm of the man or the pleasure she felt in his company the conflict of morality was something she sensed he was already facing within himself perhaps that was because she wished to believe it but until forced to do otherwise by evidence she would suppose it to be so it might be coincidence that the murders and the theft had followed so soon after the blackmail for which the price of silence had been guns but she did not think so there was a connection if she could find it judith seemed pleased to see her naturally she was not receiving social calls and was wearing full mourning for her husband but she was perfectly composed and whatever grief she felt was masked by a dignity and warmth which immediately drew hesters admirationand made her task more difficult and seem more intrusive nevertheless only the truth would serve and merrits situation was desperate the trial was due to start at the beginning of the following week how nice of you to call mrs monk judith welcomed her please tell me what news you have hester hated lies but she knew from many years of nursing that sometimes halftruths were necessary for a period at least some truths were better unknown altogether the ability to fight the battle was what was needed and without the death of hope i have never believed merrit was involved she answered following judith into a small room which opened onto the garden and was decorated in greens and white and at the present moment was filled with the morning sun but i am afraid it seems unavoidable that mr breeland was even if not directly judith stared at her no anxiety in her eyes only confusion if not mr breeland then who it seems most likely it was shearer im sorry she did not know why she apologized only that she regretted that alberton should have been betrayed by someone he had trusted so long and so closely it added to the pain shearer judith questioned are you sure hes a hard man but daniel always said he was completely loyal have you seen him since mr albertons death no but then i have only met him once or twice anyway he hardly ever came to the house she did not need to add that they were not social acquaintances no one else has seen him since then either hester told her surely if he were innocent he would be here to help to continue to work in the business and to offer all the support he could would he not be as anxious as we are to catch whoever is responsible yes judith said quietly i suppose the answer had to be terrible whatever it was it was foolish to have hoped it would be something bearable someone easy to hate and dismiss there was nothing hester could say to mitigate that she turned to the other matter she needed to probe mrs alberton your husband and mr casbolt received a very ugly letter requesting that they sell guns to a company which is known to be an intermediary who would sell them on to most undesirable quarters judiths face registered no comprehension of why hester should ask they refused but they asked my husbands assistance in finding out who was making the request the letter was anonymous and threatening threatening judith said quickly have you informed the police surely they must be responsible then mr breeland has the guns that were stolen oh yes of course im sorry then why are you asking about these people again hester told less than the truth i am not quite certain i just feel that the coincidence of time and the fact that it was guns may mean that they are connected somehow we need all the knowledge we can possibly obtain yes i see of course what can i tell you judith made no demur at all she leaned forward her face watchful and intelligent hester hated opening the subject but it was a past loss raised perhaps to avoid a present one i believe you lost your brother in dreadful circumstances she saw judith wince and the color pale in her cheeks hester did not retreat please tell me at least the main story i dont ask lightly judith looked down i am half italian i daresay you knew i was not entirely english my father came from the south about fifty miles from naples i had only one brother cesare he was married and had three children he and his wife maria used to love sailing her voice was tight and low seven years ago their boat was boarded by pirates off the coast of sicily the whole family was killed she swallowed convulsively their bodies were found later i she shook her head minutely little more than a shiver daniel went out i didnt he he wouldnt tell me the details i asked i was glad he refused i saw in his face that it was terrible sometimes he dreamed i heard him cry out in the night and wake up his body rigid but he would never say what had happened to them hester tried to imagine the crushing weight of horror that had remained with alberton so vividly and the love for his wife which had taken him to sicily and then kept him silent all the years between and yet he still dealt in guns did he feel they were also used for good to fight just causes defend the weak even keep a balance of power between otherwise violent forces or was it simply the only business he understood or the most profitable they would probably never know she wished to think it was one of the former how long was he away she asked aloud i dont know almost three weeks judith answered it seemed an age at the time i missed him dreadfully and of course i feared for him also but he was determined to do everything he could to have the pirates found and punished he pursued word of them from one place to another but always they eluded him and most of the forces of law were those who had no interest in catching them a fleeting love and sorrow filled her eyes italy is a culture a language a great art a way of life but it is not a nation one day it may be if god is willing but that day is not yet i see judith smiled no you dont you are english forgive me but you have no idea at all neither had daniel he did all he could and when he realized that they could simply disappear anywhere in hundreds of miles of coastline thousands of islands anywhere between constantinople and tangiers he came home again angry defeated but prepared to care for me and for merrit and let justice be gods in whatever manner it may there was nothing for hester to add of course it was possible alberton had made contact with gun buyers in the mediterranean pirates or otherwise fighters for or against italian unification but there was no way she could find out probably judith did not know certainly she would not say how did you know of the blackmail judith asked interrupting her thoughts mr casbolt told me hester realized that needed some explanation i was seeking his help regarding his knowledge of mr breeland and of the munitions business in general he told me of the pressure to sell to the pirates and why mr alberton never would whatever the threat or the price judiths face relaxed into a smile he always understood he knew daniel before i did you know they were friends at school here in england and one year he brought daniel with him to italy that was where we fell in love she looked down for a moment without roberts help i dont know if i would be able to commit to sir olivers fee for representing merrit and that would be more than i could bear she raised her head quickly her eyes wide fear naked in them mrs monk do you think sir oliver is going to be able to save her the newspapers are so certain she is guilty i had no idea written words could hurt so much that people who dont even know you could be so passionately certain of what you are like what is in your heart i dont go out not at the moment but i dont know how i will be able to when the time comes how will i face people when everyone i pass in the street may believe my daughter is guilty of ignore them hester replied think only of merrit those with any honesty will be ashamed of themselves when they discover their error the others are not worth battling with and there is nothing you can do about them anyway judith sat quite still will you be there yes there had been no decision to make thank you hester stayed another half hour but as a matter of companionship they talked of nothing important carefully avoiding speaking of the case or of love and loss judith showed her around the garden vivid with color as the roses began their second flush it was warm even in the shade the heavy perfume of flowers dreamlike it made mondays opening of the trial harsher by contrast as if this were so soon to end for a long time neither of them spoke platitudes would insult the reality monk went to see breeland on saturday he had not found enough to help rathbone beyond hope doubt issues to raise he would continue seeking during the trial but he was beginning to fear that there was no proof to find that merrit was innocent it might end in being no more than a matter of judgment there was one question to ask breeland the answer to which would do him no injury so monk had no hesitation in asking it breeland was brought into a small square cell he looked pale and thinner than when monk had last seen him his face had hollows around the eyes and a certain leanness to the cheeks where the muscles showed tightclenched he stood stiffly looking at monk with resentment i have already told you everything i have to say he began before monk had spoken at all you brought me back to stand trial and to prove my innocence i assume your friend rathbone will do his duty although i have little confidence in his belief in my innocence i trusted you monk but i now fear my trust may have been misplaced i think you would be pleased enough to see me hang as long as miss alberton is acquitted and you are paid your fee for rescuing her i apologize if i accuse you unjustly i hope i do monk searched the smooth chiseled face and saw no surface emotion no fear no weakness no doubt in his own courage to face the ordeal now only two days away he should have admired it instead it filled him with a strange fear of his own he was not certain whether breelands demeanor was more than human or less he could see none of his own vulnerabilities reflected there i accept your apology he said coolly certainly i would like miss alberton acquitted and i admit i dont give a damn whether you hang or not provided you are guilty whether you actually fired the gun doesnt matter if you corrupted shearer or anybody else into doing it for you thats all the same to me if you didnt and it had nothing to do with you then ill fight as hard to clear you as i would any man there was no flash of humor in breelands face not even the ghost of recognition of irony monk had a sudden thought that breeland did not perceive himself except as a hero or a martyr human foibles and absurdities eluded his grasp monk saw a vision of an endless desert of existence always on the grand scale stripped of the laughter and trivia that bring proportion to life and are the measure of sanity poor merrit he pushed his hands into his pockets how many guns did you buy he asked casually exactly exactly breeland repeated his eyebrows lifted to the gun i didnt count them there was hardly time i assumed every crate was full alberton was a stubborn man with limited views and no moral or political understanding but i never doubted his financial integrity how many guns did you pay for six thousand and i paid him the agreed amount per gun you paid shearer i already told you that breeland frowned for that amount of money you could build several streets worth of fourbedroom houses in any part of london it seems obvious to me that shearer doublecrossed alberton shot him and the guards in a manner to make it look as if it were union soldiers who did it sold the guns to me and escaped with the money i am innocent and rathbone will be able to demonstrate that monk made no reply breeland was perfectly correct monk did not care whether he hanged or not not at this moment on the following monday the trial began of lyman breeland and merrit alberton jointly accused of the tooley street murders oliver rathbone was as well prepared as he was able to be given the information he possessed from what monk had told him he believed breeland had not committed the crimes himself but assuring the jury that he had not instigated them and profited from them knowing what had occurred was quite another matter and rathbone was aware of having a client who would not naturally elicit the sympathy of the jury he had spoken to both merrit and breeland on the friday before he had weighed whether to suggest to breeland a softer manner more expression of humility even of regret for the tragedy of albertons death but he formed the belief that it would be a wasted attempt perhaps even produce a pattern of behavior that was obviously false now as the court was called to order and the proceedings began rathbone looked up at breelands face in the dock expressionless staring straight ahead as if he had no interest in the people assembled there no regard or respect for them and rathbone wished he had made some effort to warn him how dearly that could cost merrit on the other hand looked young and frightened and very vulnerable indeed her skin was pale blueshadowed around her eyes and her hands were clenched on the rail so hard it would be easy to think she was holding on to it to save herself from falling as rathbone watched her she squared her shoulders and lifted her chin a little and looked up at breeland very tentatively she reached out her hand and touched his arm the shadow of a smile moved his lips but he did not speak to her perhaps he did not wish the court to witness any emotion in him perhaps he felt that love was a private thing and he would not share it with those who had come to stare and to judge rathbone was acutely conscious of judith alberton as were most of the people in the court there was a beauty in her carriage and in what could be glimpsed of her features he saw people nudge each other as she came in and several men were unable to keep the admiration or the interest from their expressions rathbone wondered if she was accustomed to being stared at or if it made her uncomfortable she looked at merrit who was still turned towards breeland then across at rathbone it was only a glance before she sat down and he could not see her eyes through the veil he only imagined the desperation she must be feeling all the help anyone could give her could not cross the barrier of loneliness she must face the fear of what these days would bring hester was beside her dressed in dark and pale grays the light catching her fair skin and a little white lace at her throat he would have recognized the curve of her cheek anywhere and the individual way she carried her head the greatest beauty in the world did not catch his breath that way with the ache of familiarity the memory of so many shared struggles for victory over ignorance and wrong winning had mattered of course it had the causes had always been worth the fight but he realized how good the battles themselves had been this was another one but they were not together in it as they had been in the past monk was between them in a new way he saw breeland stiffen and a look of extraordinary dislike fill his face rathbone followed his glance a slender darkhaired man had entered the courtroom and was making his way towards a vacant seat on the edge of the aisle in the public gallery he moved with an unusual grace and made no sound at all taking a place where it was unnecessary to excuse himself to anyone his remarkable eyes studied judith alberton even though she was in front of him and he could not have seen her face rathbone wondered if this was philo trace he knew it was not casbolt since they had already met opposite him across the aisle horatio deverill was rising to open his case he was a tall man slender in his youth but now thickening around the middle his oncehandsome features were slightly coarsened but still full of power and character but it was his voice which commanded attention and forced one to listen it was rich idiosyncratic with perfect enunciation many a jury had been mesmerized by it when he spoke no ones attention wandered gentlemen he began smiling at the jurors sitting upright and selfconscious in their high carved seats i shall tell you about a heinous and terrible crime i shall show you how an honorable man much like yourselves was conspired against to be robbed and then murdered in order to gain guns for the tragic conflict which is even now being fought out in america brother against brother there was a murmur of horror and sympathy around the room rathbone was not surprised he had expected deverill to play for any emotional reaction he could draw he was perfectly capable of doing the same were he to suppose it would win him a case he did not care about individual points only the verdict and i shall show you deverill continued that this terrible deed was not only an offense against the law of this land and the laws of god but against the very laws of nature itself acknowledged by every race and nation in mankind it was carried out at the behest and to serve the purposes of the accused lyman breeland but gentlemen it was aided and connived at by the victims own daughter merrit alberton he received the desired gasp of horror shimmering around the room like a hot wind before a storm she was infatuated with breeland he continued and what he did to induce this obsession in her i cannot prove so i shall not attempt even to tell you but suffice it to say after the terrible deed was done she fled to america with him that very night he shook his head and it was only by the good offices of a private agent of enquiry employed by her own mother the widow of the murdered man that she and breeland were brought back to this country at gunpoint to face you and your decision as to how justice may be served to this end my lord he turned at last to face the judge a lean man with powerful features and clear silvergray eyes to this end i call my first witness robert casbolt there was intense interest as casbolt came into the court and crossed the open space of the floor in front of the judge and jury and climbed up the short curving steps to the witness stand he was immaculately dressed in dark gray and looked pale but composed there was not even the shadow of the smile he so often wore and which had etched the lines around his mouth he swore as to his name and residence and awaited deverills first questions calmly once he glanced down at judith and his expression softened but it was only for an instant he looked like a man at a funeral he did not look towards the dock mr casbolt deverill began smiling apologetically and walking up and down the open floor like an actor facing an audience to deliver a great soliloquy although it was the jury to whom he was playing he never once looked in their direction i realize this is acutely painful for you sir nevertheless it is necessary and i hope you will bear with me while i take the court through the events which led to this tragedy you were aware of almost all of them even though you can have had no idea to what terrible end they were destined rathbone looked at the jury they ranged from about forty to sixty in age and seemed decent and prosperous like most jurors there were qualifications of property required which ruled out many younger men or those of a different social class they sat serious unhappy and concentrating fiercely upon every word that was said mr casbolt would you tell the court how and when you first encountered lyman breeland of course casbolt said quietly but his voice fell with perfect clarity in the faint rustling around the room i do not recall the exact date but it was early in may of this year he presented himself at the business premises of daniel alberton and myself he lifted one shoulder very slightly he was interested in the armaments aspect of our business and what did mr breeland say to you deverill asked innocently that he was authorized to purchase guns for the union cause in the american conflict casbolt answered he said he was entrusted by his superior with a very large sum of money approximately twentythree thousand pounds which he had deposited at the bank of england there was a gasp of amazement around the room it was a fortune beyond most mens imagination several people looked up at breeland in the dock but he studiously ignored them all keeping his eyes on deverill did you see this money deverill asked his voice hushed with awe no sir one would not have expected him to bring it with him casbolt answered it is a a fortune it is indeed but he told you and mr alberton that the government of the northern states of america had sent him with this money in order to purchase guns is that so guns and ammunition for them yes sir and you believed him we had no cause to doubt him i still have not casbolt replied he presented credentials including a letter from abraham lincoln bearing the seal of the president of the united states both daniel alberton and i were well informed as to the escalating hostilities across the atlantic and naturally we were also aware of the fact that representatives from both the union and the confederate states had been purchasing guns wherever they were available all over europe just so deverill agreed he pushed his thumbs into the armholes of his waistcoat stared at the polished toes of his boots then looked up at casbolt and had you or daniel alberton sold guns before to either party in this war we had not and you are sure that daniel alberton had not for example made a private agreement with lyman breeland unknown to you or mr trace deverill prompted casbolts face filled with a curious mixture of emotions which were only too apparently painful his eyes flickered towards judith sitting in the front seat of the gallery everyone in the room must have been aware of the tension and the personal grief rathbone looked up at breeland he was watching intently but if he felt any sorrow or fear it was too tightly under control to betray itself his pride could serve him ill it looked too much like indifference the next time he had the opportunity to speak to his client rathbone would tell him so for any good it would do are you sure deverill prompted casbolt drew his attention back his expression cleared the other reason was that daniel alberton was my friend and one of the most honorable men i have ever known in twentyfive years i never knew him to break his word to anyone his voice caught one could not ask more of a business associate than that coupled with skill and knowledge of his field indeed one could not deverill agreed softly looking again at the jury rathbone swore under his breath he had never imagined defeating deverill would be easy but the reality of his task was becoming sharper by the minute brilliant as rathbone was and ruthless he could not alter the truth nor would he try what precisely was the agreement made with mr trace deverill asked ingenuously daniel had given his word to sell six thousand p enfield rifled muskets casbolt replied clearly deverill was supremely satisfied it glowed in his face rathbone knew the jurors saw it and had judged its importance accordingly they believed he had scored a major point even if they did not know what it was one of them a man with magnificent sidewhiskers shot a malevolent glance up at breeland merrit looked as if she had been struck she moved a fraction closer to breeland in the dock the movement was not lost on the jury rathbone knew how to manipulate emotion also although at times he found it repugnant he would have used the slave issue one most englishmen deplored even though many of them favored the south but he was conscious of hester sitting beside judith alberton and how she would despise him for the moral dishonesty of it he was angry with himself that he allowed it to hurt why was he prepared to sell guns to mr trace sir deverill enquired innocently was he a sympathizer with the confederate cause no casbolt answered i am not aware that he had a loyalty to either side the only opinion i heard him express was one of sadness that the issue had come to war at all in the several months previously he had hoped it would be resolved by negotiation it was simply that mr trace presented himself and was desperate to purchase he did not argue his cause greatly he said the south wanted to be free to decide its own destiny and choose its form of government but little more than that it was mr breeland who tried to persuade him that his cause justified the sale of arms to the union rather than anyone else so mr trace obtained the sale simply because he was first deverill deduced yes he paid half the sum as an evidence of good faith the second half was to follow upon delivery of the guns and ammunition and breeland wished mr alberton to renege on that agreement and sell the guns to him instead yes he was most insistent to the point of unpleasantness casbolts face was twisted with regret even a degree of selfblame as if he should have foreseen the tragedy deverill was quick to seize on it what sort of unpleasantness did he threaten anyone no not so far as i am aware casbolts voice was soft his mind very much in the past tragedy he accused daniel of being in favor of slavery which of course he was not breeland was passionate about his cause both to abolish slavery in america and to keep all the states in the union whether they wished it or not he frequently argued his opinionhis obsessionthat the south should not be allowed independence only he called it secession i admit i dont understand the difference this time the faintest smile touched his face deverill opened his eyes very wide nor i to be frank he gestured very slightly towards the dock but did not look up at it but fortunately it is not our concern he dismissed it in his attempts to change mr albertons mind about the guns did he call upon him at his place of business or at his home do you know both he told me but i know for myself that he called often at his home because i was there on half a dozen occasions he was offered hospitality and accepted it again several jurors shot breeland a look of loathing there is something peculiarly repellent in the ultimate betrayal of eating at a mans table and then rising up and murdering him every society abhors it deverill said quietly his voice very low and yet carrying to every corner of the room the judge glanced at rathbone he would have objected to the irrelevance of the comment but it was not irrelevant except legally and every man and woman in the room knew it it would only betray his own desperation he shook his head minutely deverill continued during these visits mr casbolt did you observe any relationship growing between breeland and merrit alberton casbolt winced and shivered a little not as much as i should have done his voice was tight in his throat strained with regret even sitting several yards away and looking upwards at him on the stand rathbone was moved by the emotion in him it was too genuine for anyone to doubt it or be unaffected there was a ripple of compassion around the room a woman sniffed one of the jurors shook his head slowly and glanced up at merrit in the dock rathbone turned to judith but her expression was hidden by her veil he saw philo trace look towards her and his emotion also was laid bare to see rathbone realized in that moment that trace loved judith silently without expectation of return he knew it with a depth of understanding because that was how he loved hester the time for her responding to him was gone perhaps it was only an illusion that it had ever been deverill had milked the silence for all he could get from it he resumed his questioning and did you see miss alberton return his attentions he asked indeed casbolt cleared his throat she is only sixteen i believed it was an infatuation which would pass as soon as breeland left to go back to america instinctively rathbone looked up at merrit and saw the pain and defiance in her face she leaned a little forward longing to tell them the truth how much she truly loved breeland but she was not permitted to speak casbolt went on he was an officer in an army suddenly anger burst through raw and hard in his voice about to engage in civil war five thousand miles away from england he was in no position to make an offer to a woman let alone a child of merrits age it never occurred to me that he would i dont believe it entered her fathers mind either and if breeland had had the ill judgment the effrontery to do so daniel would naturally have refused in the dock breeland stirred but he also could not defend himself yet if breeland loved her casbolt went on and were an honorable man he would have waited until the war was over and then returned with a proper offer when he could support her and care for her as a man should provide a home for her not leave her with strangers in a besieged city while he went off to a battle from which he might never return or return crippled and unable to care for her he was shaking as he stood gripping the rails his face white he had not given a single fact tying breeland to the murder of daniel alberton but he had damned him in the eyes of every person in the room and deverill knew it it was there in the confident stance of the barristers body the smooth velvet of his voice just so mr casbolt i am sure we all feel as you do and might well have had no more foresight as to the tragedy to come we hold no condemnation sir no wisdom after the event could you now tell us what you observed the night of daniel albertons death casbolt closed his eyes his hands still gripping the rail are you all right mr casbolt deverill said anxiously he stepped forward as if afraid that casbolt might actually collapse yes casbolt said between his teeth he took a deep breath and lifted his head staring with fixed eyes at the paneled wall above the gallery i know only from learning what happened earlier that evening i assume you will call monk who was present to tell you what he saw and heard i had been dining late with friends and had not yet retired it was about halfpast three when a messenger brought me a note from mrs alberton exhibit number one my lord deverill said to the judge the judge nodded and the usher handed a piece of paper to casbolt is this the note you received deverill asked casbolts hand trembled as he took it he had difficulty finding his voice it is will you read it for us deverill requested casbolt cleared his throat my dear robert forgive me for disturbing you at this hour but i am deeply afraid something serious may have happened daniel and merrit had a terrible quarrel this evening mr breeland was here and mr monk mr breeland swore that he would not be defeated in his cause regardless of what it cost him merrit has left home i discovered an hour ago that she has packed a bag and gone i fear to breeland daniel left shortly after the quarrel he must have gone after her but he has not returned please find him and help he will be so distressed he looked up his voice thick as if he fought tears it is signed judith of course i did not hesitate more than a moment to wonder what was the best course of action i realized it would be to enlist monks help in case of unpleasantness and then go straight to breelands rooms if necessary we could bring merrit back by force before her reputation was ruined a bitter humor flashed across his face and disappeared replaced by misery deverill nodded his head slowly the jury looked suitably grieved the judge glanced at rathbone to see if he had any response but there was none to make please continue deverill requested i assume you went to find mr monk yes casbolt agreed i awoke him and told him briefly what had happened he came with me first to breelands rooms which were empty we were let in by the night porter who told us breeland and a young lady had left again the judge glanced at rathbone i have no objection my lord rathbone said clearly i intend to call the night porter myself he has information which supports mr breelands version of events the judge nodded and turned to casbolt please restrict yourself to what you know not what others have told you casbolt bowed acknowledgment and continued with his story because of what the night porter told us we went with all possible haste back to my carriage which was waiting outside and drove to the warehouse in tooley street he stopped for a moment to regain his composure it was obviously a struggle for him anyone in the room could see that the events of that night were so overpowering that he was transported back to the yard in the earlymorning light and the horror he had seen there he spoke in a harsh almost toneless voice as if he could not bear to remember with the reality of feeling rathbone listened finding the story more devastating than when monk had told him there was something in casbolts reliving of it which carried an even greater power if he had asked the jury for a verdict now they would have hanged breeland and merrit today and pulled the lever for the trapdoor themselves casbolt had described finding the bodies in their grotesque positions with only the briefest of words almost too spare to recreate the picture his horror filled the room no man could have acted such searing emotion he did not mention finding the watch deverill had to remind him of it casbolt looked startled oh yes monk found it he picked it up it had breelands name engraved on it and a date i dont recall what it was but lyman breelands name was on it you are certain of that of course thank you just one thing more mr casbolt yes he looked puzzled forgive me for such an enquiry sir deverill apologized but just in case anyone might wonder or my learned friend raises the issue allow me to spare him the trouble exactly where were you that evening before you received mrs albertons desperate note you said you dined with friends yes lord harlands house in eaton square i am afraid the party went on rather longer than expected i did not arrive home until a little after three i was still up when the messenger arrived i see thank you deverill turned with a flourish towards rathbone waving a hand in invitation casbolt had said nothing rathbone disputed nothing he wished to clarify he would have liked to stretch out the proceedings in the hope monk might yet discover something more but if he did so now deverill at least would know it possibly the jury would also he half rose from his seat i have no questions for the witness my lord good then we may adjourn for luncheon the judge said bleakly rathbone was barely outside the courtroom when he saw hester and judith alberton coming towards him philo trace was a few yards away but he did not approach them it flashed through rathbones mind to wonder again exactly what traces part was in the purchase of guns could he have been the one who tried to blackmail alberton and was that why alberton had absolutely refused to deal with breeland because he dared not had monk been the catalyst which made him change his mind it was only the thread of an idea but it persisted sir oliver judith was in front of him he could hear the fear in her voice please dont worry mrs alberton he said with more confidence than he felt it was a part of his profession he had been obliged to practice so often the comforting of people in desperate situations the giving of courage and hope he had no knowledge he could justify we have our turn after mr deverill has done all he can i dont feel any certainty that i can prove breeland innocent but with merrit it will be far easier dont lose heart the watch she said simply if merrit was not there how did it come to be in the warehouse yard she was so proud of it i cannot imagine her willingly letting it out of her possession can you imagine her lying to protect breeland he asked gently he could not help looking for a moment at hester and saw in her eyes the fierce need to help and confusion because she did not know how to yes judith said quietly sir oliver i am terribly afraid i should not have sent mr monk to bring her back have i condemned her to death her voice broke hester tightened her grip on judiths arm willing her to have strength but she could not argue could not think of any words that would comfort no rathbone lied with authority he heard the ring of conviction in his own voice and was stabbed with fear that he would be proved wrong but he was used to risk to defying the rules and trusting to fortune because it was all he had he was acutely conscious that he did not deserve to succeed as often as he had no mrs alberton i do not believe that merrit is guilty of more than foolishness i am very sorry that i may have to demonstrate that the man she loves is in no way worthy of her and she will find that very hard there is little in life as bitter as disillusion and when it happens she will need your comfort you must remain strong for that time it will not be long judiths expression could not be seen but the emotion the effort at selfmastery and the fear were all in her voice of course thank you sir oliver it was painfully apparent that she wanted to say more and also that she would be asking for something he could not give her she waited only a moment longer then slowly turned away after she had moved a step or two she was facing philo trace she must have seen his expression his remarkable eyes perhaps she was the fortunate one to be able to hide behind a veil to have no one know how much she had seen of his emotions or to pretend she had not read them then the moment was gone and with hester beside her she walked away rathbone went to find himself some luncheon although he had little appetite for it the afternoon resumed late with lanyon giving evidence for the police in the rather stiff language of officialdom he corroborated all that casbolt had said at deverills insistence also confirming that casbolt had indeed dined with friends and remained in their company until after the time alberton and the guards were believed to have been killed it was unnecessary rathbone had never considered casbolt a possible suspect nor did he believe anyone else had deverill thanked lanyon effusively as if he had made an important point rathbone was pleased to see several jurors looking mystified and did you find anything remarkable at the scene of the murders which led you to the identity of any of the persons present apart from the victims deverill asked yes lanyon said unhappily a gentlemans gold watch where did you find it the jury were only mildly interested they already knew and their distaste was apparent a couple of them looked up at breeland he ignored them almost as if he were unaware rathbone had seen innocent men with that sublime detachment knowing the crime spoken of had nothing to do with them he had also seen guilty men with a coldness that appeared just the same because they had no understanding that what they had done was repellent they felt no pain except their own merrit was utterly different she was pale shivering and it cost her a very obvious effort to muster even a semblance of composure she had been stunned by casbolts account of finding the bodies lanyons less emotional telling of essentially the same facts had been even harder for her his tightly controlled voice made it more real yet in his own way he was also shocked it was in the keenness of his speech the way he kept his eyes down and did not once look at judith in the front row of the gallery nor up at merrit herself deverill took lanyon through the exact circumstances of finding the watch and of the name engraved on the back then he moved on to lanyons following of the trail of wagons from the yard to hayes dock and the beginning of their journey down the river by barge at four oclock the judge adjourned the court for the day in the morning deverill resumed exactly where he had left the story it took him the rest of the morning to proceed detail by detail until lanyon admitted to losing the trail at bugsbys marshes deverill very graciously offered to call every bargee docker and waterman who had given lanyon evidence wearily the judge asked rathbone if he contested the issue and immensely to the courts relief rathbone said that he did not he was happy to concede that everything lanyon had said was true deverill looked startled and pleased as if his adversary had unexpectedly surrendered are you well sir oliver he enquired solicitously there was a faint titter around the gallery instantly hushed at a glare from the judge in excellent health thank you rathbone replied quite well enough for a trip down the river to bugsbys marshes if i felt like it i dont but please dont let me stop you if you feel it will serve your cause it will certainly not serve yours sir deverill returned nor harm it either rathbone smiled it is irrelevant a diversion please continue the judge had a very dry smile and directed them to proceed your witness deverill invited rathbone stood up and walked across the floor to stand in the middle of the open space this time every eye was on him waiting for him to begin the fight so far he had not even parried a blow much less struck one he knew he must make a mark immediately or forfeit their attention sergeant lanyon you very diligently followed the trail of this barge all the way from tooley street near hayes dock down the thames as far as bugsbys marshes it carried a cargo of something heavy and we have assumed it was the guns from mr albertons warehouse do you know the identity of the men who were seen by these various witnesses to whom you spoke i mean know it sergeant rather than deduce it from a dropped watch or a chance to purchase armaments for a cause no sir i only know they knew where the guns were and they wanted them enough to commit murder to take them lanyon answered with only a flicker of expression in his mild thin face just so rathbone agreed but who were they lanyons jaw set hard i dont know but someone dropped that watch and recently gold watches dont lie around warehouse yards long before someone notices them not in daylight anyway rathbone smiled very slightly thank you sergeant lanyon you seem to have fulfilled your duty excellently i have nothing more to ask of you except did you find out what happened to the guns after bugsbys marshes or what happened to the barge afterwards no sir i see dont you find that curious deverill stood up rathbone held out his hand i rephrase that sergeant lanyon in your experience as a police officer is that a usual occurrence no sir ive looked hard for anything further but i cant find any trace of where the guns went after that or the barge i shall enlighten you rathbone promised about the guns at least the barge mystifies me as much as it does you thank you i have nothing further to ask after the luncheon adjournment deverill called the medical officer who described the exact manner of the killings it was gruesome and distressing evidence and the court heard it in near silence deverill seemed to begin with the intention of drawing from him every agonizing detail then just in time realized that the jury were acutely aware of the pain it had to cause the widow and this not only produced in them a very natural rage against the perpetrators but also against himself for subjecting her to hearing perhaps for the first time a clinical description of horror she had been protected from before rathbone looked up at merrit in the dock and saw the agony in her eyes her ashen skin now so bleached of color as to seem bruised and the achingly rigid muscles of her arms and body as silent weeping racked through her it would be a hard man indeed who could look at her and not believe that if she had had even the slightest knowledge of this before let alone complicity she was tortured with remorse now he also wondered what went through her mind regarding breeland sitting bolt upright as if on some military duty his features composed almost without expression in rathbones mind the thing that burned up inside him with a rage he could not control was that breeland never once extended his hand towards merrit or made any gesture of pity for her if he were distressed within himself it was inside a loneliness nothing could break whatever he felt for her he cared more for his cause and the dignity and stoic innocence he presented to the world if he had any human vulnerability no one must see it if he had weighed the cost to merrit at all it had not been heavy enough on the scales to show a military expert was called who testified that this peculiar method of binding the arms and legs over a pole was known to be practiced by the army of the union to punish those of its members who had been found guilty of various crimes the t indicating thief it was not an execution but usually lasted for six to twelve hours by which time the man concerned was barely able to stand even after release he had no opinion as to the shooting but his anger was palpable that an accepted form of discipline should have been so misused it was an insult to the honorable man who had designed it whether the court agreed with him it was impossible to say they were overwhelmed with the savagery of the only case they had witnessed and they were not at war the necessities of the union army of any army were unknown to them the fact that the practice was specific to the army for which breeland fought was an added condemnation the hatred for him could be felt in the air like a hot stinging smell rathbones mind raced as to how he could undo the emotional damage mere facts would be drowned in the revulsion of feeling the last witness of the day was dorothea parfitt the seventeenyearold friend to whom merrit had shown the watch and bragged a little of her love affair dorothea walked across the open space of the floor and tripped on the very first step up to the box she had hold of the railing so it was only barely noticeable but she let out a little gasp and straightened herself blushing deverill was extremely gentle with her doing all he could to ease her obvious consciousness that her words could condemn her friend perhaps to the rope what motive she had had in first saying this to the police no one else could know it might have been envy because merrit had won the love of a most glamorous man who was older braver more mysterious and exciting than the youths she knew it is very natural to want to prick vanity especially if it is exercised at your expense she could not then have foreseen the terrible consequences she would not even have been able to imagine standing here now about to repeat her words because she could not take them back and give deverill the power to place a rope around merrits neck she faced deverill like a rabbit in front of a snake never once did she allow her eyes to stray towards merrit in the dock the watch was passed up to her but she refused to touch it have you seen it before miss parfitt deverill asked gently at first her throat was so tight her lips so dry that her voice would not come deverill waited yes she said at last can you tell us where and in what circumstances she swallowed convulsively we all realize that you would immeasurably rather not deverill said with a charming smile but loyalty to the truth must outweigh the desire not to cause trouble for a friend just tell me exactly what happened what you saw and heard you are not accountable for the actions of others and only an unjust or guilty person would hold you to be where did you see this watch miss parfitt and in whose possession merrits she answered her voice little above a whisper did she show it to you yes why did she say dorothea nodded deverill held her gaze as if she were mesmerized lyman breeland had given it to her as a token of his love her eyes brimmed with tears she really thought he loved her she had no idea he was wicked honestly she must have found out and given it back to him because she would never have had anything to do with killing her father not ever i know she argued with him because she thought he was terribly wrong to sell the guns to that man from the south because the south keeps slaves but you dont kill people over things like that i am afraid they do in america miss parfitt deverill said with wry regret it is a subject about which some people feel so violently that their behavior is beyond the bounds of ordinary law and society one of the most tragic of all kinds of war is beginning even as we stand here in this peaceful courtroom and argue our differences and we none of us know where it will end please god we will not with our own prejudices and greeds make it any worse it was a sentiment rathbone felt profoundly and yet deverills giving voice to it irritated him like a scraped elbow whether deverill meant it or not rathbone had no doubt he expressed it to manipulate the emotions of the court dorothea had no idea what to make of it she stared at him with open confusion mr deverill the judge admonished leaning forward are you chastising the witness for her lack of knowledge as to the outcome of the present tragedy across the atlantic no my lord certainly not i am simply trying to point out that some people feel passionately enough about the issues of slaving to kill those who differ from them it is unnecessary mr deverill we are aware of it the judge said dryly have you anything further to ask miss parfitt no my lord thank you deverill turned to rathbone his foretaste of victory was plain in his face in the confidence of the way he stood balancing with his back a trifle arched and his shoulders squared sir oliver rathbone rose to his feet the watch was the most powerful piece of evidence against merrit the one thing he could not explain away deverill knew it as well what mattered was what the jury saw miss parfitt he said matching deverill smile for smile gentleness for gentleness of course you have no choice but to tell us that merrit alberton showed you the watch that breeland gave to her as a token of his feelings for her you said it first with no knowledge of its meaning and now cannot withdraw it we all understand that but mr deverill omitted to ask you exactly when this incident occurred was it the day of daniel albertons death she looked suddenly relieved seeing escape no no it was several days before that at least two and maybe three i dont recall exactly now i could get my diary i dont think that will be necessary he declined not for me anyway could she have given it back to him for any reason a quarrel possibly or to have the catch altered or put on a chain or something else engraved yes she said eagerly her eyes widened she seemed to hesitate for a moment thank you he said quickly afraid she would embellish it and be caught in an invention that is all we need to know miss parfitt please do not strive to help only what you know is evidence not what you may wish or even believe yes she said awkwardly i i see the judge looked at deverill deverill shook his head with a slight smile he knew he did not need to make more of it the court adjourned for the day and rathbone went straight to see merrit he found her alone in the cell used for such meetings the wardress was stationed outside the door a big woman with her hair scraped back severely and a pink scrubbed face she shook her head slightly as rathbone went past her and the key clanked in the lock its not going well is it merrit said as soon as they were alone the jury think lyman did it i can see it in their faces did she instinctively think of breeland before herself or had she not yet grasped that she also was charged equally with him no one believed she had fired the shots herself but an accomplice in such a crime would be held just as responsible and punished with the same finality he could not afford to be gentle with her she must face the truth of the situation before it was too late even to try to save it yes they do he agreed candidly he saw the pain in her eyes the trace of unreasonable hope that she was wrong die away i am sorry but it is inescapable and i would not be helping your cause if i were to pretend otherwise she bit her lip i know her voice was hoarse they are so mistaken in him he would never do anything so vile but even if they could not understand that surely they can be made to see that there was no cause to he received a note that my father had changed his mind and would sell the guns to him after all he had found a way of escaping his commitment to mr trace and was free to offer them to the more honorable cause they were there at euston square station there was even a special train just to transport them i believe i can prove that he could not have fired the shots himself he agreed allowing no lift of hope into his voice he must not mislead her even by implication what i cannot prove is that whoever did it was not paid to by mr breeland and that is just as serious a crime since you and he left england with the guns you are accomplices in robbery and murder he held up his hand as she began to protest i can make a good argument that you were unaware of what had happened and therefore innocent but lyman is innocent too she cut in leaning forward urgently her eyes bright he had no idea anyone had killed to get the guns how do you know that he asked very gently it was not a challenge there was no confrontation i she started to answer then she blinked her face puckering with dismay you mean how can i prove it to them surely again she stopped yes you do have to he answered the question he thought had been in her mind in law one is presumed innocent unless you can be proved to be guilty beyond a reasonable doubt consider the word reasonable do you believe after listening to the evidence so far that the men in the jury box will have the same idea of what is true as you will have we lose reason in emotion when you think of issues like war injustice slavery the love of your family or your country your way of life are any of us guided purely by reason she shook her head minutely no she whispered i suppose not she took a deep breath but i know lyman he would not stoop to anything dishonorable honor what is right is dearer to him than anything that is part of the reason i love him so much cant you make them see that and are you absolutely certain that what is right would not include sacrificing three men to the cause of obtaining guns for the union he asked she was very pale not by murder but her voice shook her eyes filled with tears i know he was not in the warehouse yard that evening sir oliver because i was with him all the time and i was not there i swear that he believed her and how did the watch come to be there how do i explain that to the jury fear rippled through her he could not mistake it i dont know it doesnt make any sense i cant explain it when did you last see the watch ive been trying to think but my mind is in such turmoil the harder i try the less clear it becomes i remember showing it to mrs monk and i had it the day after that because that was when dorothea admired it so of course i told her about it she flushed very faintly hardly more than a suspicion of color in her pale face after that im not certain times get muddled in my memory so much happened and i was furious with my father the tears spilled over her eyes and she fought for selfcontrol rathbone did not interrupt her or try to offer words they both knew he could not mean could you have lost it or left it on a garment you were not wearing he asked at length i suppose so she seized the explanation i must have but lyman would never have left it in the yard and who else could i dont know he admitted but i shall have monk investigate it it may now be possible your father took it with him oh yes that could be couldnt it at last there was a lift of hope in her voice sir oliver who was it that killed him was it mr shearer that is very dreadful i know my father trusted him they had worked together for years i only met him once he was rather grim sort of im not sure angry at least i thought he was she searched his face to see if he understood what she found so difficult to say was it for money it seems as if it was how could my father have been so wrong about him i dont know perhaps because we tend to judge others by our own standards she did not answer and within a few moments he took his leave trying to encourage her to keep heart he did not especially wish to see breeland but it was a duty he must not shirk he found him standing by the chair and small table in the room assigned for him his face was stiff his shoulders locked so tight they strained the fabric of his jacket he looked accusingly at rathbone and rathbone could not blame him for it he disliked the man and breeland must know it and also that rathbones first loyalty was to merrit alberton it was judith after all who was paying him it was merrits desire not breelands that they be charged as one and she would not claim any special innocence she was determined to stand with him although rathbone wondered if it was now love for breeland or love of loyalty which kept her without warning he felt a keen pity for breeland thousands of miles from home and overwhelmingly among strangers who hated him for what they believed him to be perhaps had rathbone been in similar circumstances he would have wrapped himself in the same icy dignity it was the last protection breeland had left to seem not to care and why should anyone parade his vulnerability for his enemies to stare at could shearer have murdered alberton without breelands knowledge and certainly without his complicity and should breeland owing all his allegiance to his own people locked in a terrible war not have taken the guns so fortuitously offered himsimply because he suspected they had been obtained by deceit it was war not trade for him they were the survival of a cause not a matter of profit breeland stared at him i assume that at some point in this farce you will attempt to defend at least miss alberton if not me he said coldly although i would remind you she came willingly with me to america and monk will testify to that i am more concerned to hear him testify as to the exact times of the events on the night of the murders and your train to liverpool rathbone replied levelly it will be a simpler matter to convince them of the fact that shearer may well have planned and committed the murders and the theft of the guns with the intention of selling them to you and you buying them in good faith than it will be to make them feel well disposed towards you what does that matter breeland said bitterly i am a foreigner they dont understand my cause or sympathize with it they dont know what america stands for they have not caught our dream i cant help that surely they at least understand justice it was said with an air of challenge and not a little of insult rathbone reminded himself of the mans isolation of how much he had already sacrificed for a cause that was both noble and unselfish would he himself have done any better any more wisely would such threat and such lack of understanding and respect all around him not have made him lash out also juries are people mr breeland and subject to emotional impulses like the rest of us he said as mildly as he could keeping the edge out of his voice they will not remember everything that is said to them in fact they will probably not even hear it all or perceive it in the way we wish them to very often people hear what they think they will hear make them feel some respect for you some liking and they will see the best and recall it when it matters this is not peculiar to english juries it is part of the nature of all people and we choose to be tried before a jury precisely because they are ordinary they work on instinctive judgment and common sense as well as the evidence presented to them your own common law is based upon this yes i know breelands lips were tight rathbone felt there was fear as well as anger and idealism behind the mask of his face he did well that it was not the overriding thing i cannot make people like me and i will not grovel my cause speaks well enough for me i would abolish slavery from the earth now his voice rang with passion his eyes alight i would give every man the chance to be his own master to believe what he chooses and speak his mind without fear it sounds marvelous rathbone said wearily but with total sincerity i am not sure if it can exist liberty is always a matter of balancing one thing against another gains and losses but that is not the issue you can fight for whatever you wish once you are free to leave the dock first accomplish that and to do it you will need to behave with a little more humanity believe me mr breeland i am very good at my profession easily as good as you are at yours take my advice breeland stared at him his eyes steady and fixed fear far down in their depths bright and hard do you do you think you can prove me innocent he said softly i do now make the jury pleased to see me do it breeland said nothing but some of the ice in him melted in the morning monk was called to the witness stand to corroborate first casbolts evidence of their visit to breelands rooms and then their terrible discovery in the warehouse yard in tooley street deverill treated him with civility but he could draw him to say little beyond a simple yes or no he knew perfectly well as was his skill to know that monk worked with rathbone and his interest was in the defense he had no intention of allowing monk to cloud the issue or raise questions monk wished there were some he could raise so far he could think of nothing to add even had deverill allowed him to he substantiated all that lanyon had already told them about their pursuit of the barge down the river as far as greenwich and bugsbys marshes beyond now tell me mr monk when you reported your findings to mrs alberton did she then request you to undertake any further activities on her behalf deverill asked with wide eyes and acute interest in every line of his body it angered monk to have to play out deverills charade but he had no choice deverill asked his questions far too cleverly to give him room to say anything else without lying and being caught at it she asked me to go to america and bring her daughter back he replied alone deverill was incredulous a superhuman task surelyand one not designed to enhance miss albertons honor or reputation not alone monk said tartly she suggested i take my wife with me and mr philo trace also expressed a desire to go which i was glad to accept since he knew the country and i did not most practical at least as far as it extends deverill damned it with faint praise mrs alberton can hardly have foreseen this situation today he turned on the spot his coat swinging or perhaps she did perhaps she loved her husband and wished his murder avenged even at this cost rathbone started to rise not very logical monk criticized with a cold smile if all she wanted was justice she would have employed someone to go to america and kill breelandand miss alberton also had she thought her guilty he ignored the gasps around the room that would have been easier to accomplish and less expensive only one man necessary and no return fare for breeland or miss alberton and no chance of their escape that is an appalling suggestion sir deverill said in welldisplayed horror barbaric no more so than yours monk retorted and no sillier there was a faint titter of laughter around the gallery more a release of tension than amusement the judge half hid a smile deverill was annoyed but as he framed his next question his wording was a great deal more carefully considered did breeland return with you of his own free will i gave him no choice monk replied with slight surprise but actually he did express a willingness to answer the charge he said he thank you deverill cut him off raising his hand holding the palm forward for silence that is sufficient whatever breeland wishes to say he will no doubt be given the opportunity in due course now and of course you will believe him monk said sarcastically rathbone smiled what i believe is irrelevant deverill snapped it is the members of the jury who matter here mr monk but while we are considering beliefs did you believe breelands eagerness to prove his innocence or did you feel it advisable to bring him back under some restraint i have learned that my beliefs may be mistaken monk answered i kept him under restraint however i did not think the same necessary for miss alberton i used no restraint whatever upon her deverills face tightened with irritation he should have foreseen that monk might say that thank you i know of nothing further you could usefully add to our deliberations unless my learned friend has something to ask you you are excused rathbone rose to his feet slowly not until the very last minute certain of what he was going to say how wise was it to pursue the matter how far could he predict what monk would say should he allow deverill the opportunity to reexamine everything monk would corroborate in breelands story would be better told by breeland himself thank you he inclined his head very slightly i agree with mr deverill the judge looked slightly surprised but monk was allowed to return to the body of the court where he sat beside hester and judith alberton only once glancing at the brooding figure of philo trace deverills last witness was a banker who testified that no money whatsoever had reached daniel albertons account since the payment made by philo trace as a deposit in good faith deverill offered to have both casbolt and trace testify to this but the court was willing to accept the bankers word and his documents the prosecution rests deverill said facing the jury with a smile the guns were stolen no payment was made to alberton and casbolt mr alberton was murdered in the warehouse yard in tooley street and the guns taken and shipped to america quite openly by lyman breeland in the willing company of merrit alberton whose watch was found at the scene of the murders none of these things has the defense even attempted to deny they cannot gentlemen breeland is manifestly guilty albeit because he believes in his cause at any cost and miss alberton is swept off her feet in her consuming obsession for him which even now she does not abandon but murder is a deed he cannot walk away from with impunity we shall show him so and he turned to rathbone with an inviting gesture of his hand but please give us your best efforts to try when the court reconvenes tomorrow monk was angry on the witness stand but once the court had adjourned for the day and the heat of antagonism had died down his feelings were different hester had gone with judith alberton casbolt had been there also but perhaps a sense of decorum had prevented him from remaining too close to her the other far uglier thought came unbiddenthat perhaps he was beginning to suspect that alberton himself had been involved in the sale of the extra five hundred guns to the pirates and had been betrayed by them and he could not bear judith to know it he did not want to face having to lie nor did he know enough to tell her beyond doubt perhaps alberton had intended that she should never know how much does one protect the people one loves what is protection and what is stifling denial of their right to be themselves to make their own choices he would bitterly have resented such protection himself he would have felt it belittled him and made him less than equal the sun was fading a little in the street but the air was still hot from the day the slanted light was hazy and the dust rose in clouds from the dry cobbles monk had looked at breeland from the witnessbox and wondered what he felt what emotions there were under his cold exterior he had never been able to read him except perhaps on the battlefield at manassas there his passion his dedication and his disillusion had all been naked but he was an acutely private man he seemed driven to speak of his ideals to rid america of slavery but whatever more personal human emotions he felt he could not show it was almost as if his fire were all in the mind nothing in the heart or the blood was it actually an evasion of real feeling a way of making sure the object of his passion never asked of him anything he could not govern direct guard from hurting him love was not like that no choice could be made between the giving and the taking he saw that in philo traces eyes as he looked at judith alberton trace held no hope of receiving anything from her more than friendship and perhaps he would not have withdrawn his help from her if she had refused even that whether he could have escaped from it was irrelevant he had not tried to there was no meanness of spirit in him no selfregarding at least where she was concerned but was monk thinking of philo trace or what he himself had learned of love he crossed the street and continued walking he passed a muffin seller barely aware of her he had never intended to love hester he had realized very early in their acquaintance that she had the power to hurt him to demand of him a depth of commitment he had no intention of giving all the life he could remember he had avoided such a loss of his freedom and he had lost it anyway she had effectively taken it from him whether he wished it or not that was not true he had chosen to embrace the fullness of living instead of playing on the edge and lying to himself that he was retaining control when all he was doing was abstaining from experience running away from himself he despised cowardice as much as he did selfdeception he hailed the next hansom and gave the driver his address in fitzroy street he could not go back on his decision whatever it cost he had been home for nearly an hour when hester came in she looked tired and frightened she hesitated even before she took off her jacket it was linen of the dusty bluegray she liked so well her eyes searched his anxiously he knew what disturbed her more even than her fear for judith or merrit alberton it was his evasion over the last few days the distance he had opened between them he must bridge it now whatever the result how is she he asked the words were trivial he could have asked her anything what mattered was that he met her eyes she saw the difference it was almost as if he had touched her with the old intimacy something inside her warmed like a flower opening she is frightened for merrit she answered i hope oliver can make as powerful an argument as deverill did i wish breeland would reach out to merrit she looks so alone there again it was not the words that mattered but the softness in her mouth the fact that her eyes did not even flicker away from his he believes in his cause he said wishing beyond almost anything else that he could avoid this moment that somehow it would go away he can see a million slaves and the moral wrong of their state the mass injustice and crueltybut he doesnt dare to look at the loneliness or the need of one human who needs him it is too personal too intimate too close under his own skin she unfastened the pin that secured her hat and took off the hat itself all the time watching him she knew he had not yet reached the point of what he was saying does he love merrit she asked is that what matters she stood quite still she did not know why her puzzlement was in her eyes but she sensed he was asking for reasons deeper than the mere words he used or the personal question its part of it she said carefully the issues he fights for matter as well and philo trace he went on he loves judith i suppose youve seen that a smile touched her mouth then vanished of course ive seen it its so plain even she has seen it why and does she care that hes a southerner fighting for the slave states her eyes widened a little i have no idea why do you ask you like him so do i but you abhor slaving the shadow was at the back of her eyes she knew he still had not said what he needed to although she could not guess what it would be would the warmth go from her then would these be the last few seconds he would ever look at her and see that undisguised tenderness in her face and the honesty could he stretch the minutes out make them last so he would never forget yes she agreed i learned something about myself when i went down to the river looking for shearer now there was no going back she understood she saw the fear in him she knew the darkness already she could not have forgotten that first terrible drowning fear in mecklenburg square the horror which had nearly destroyed him it was her courage which had made him fight now she came forward standing just in front of him so closely he could smell the perfume of her hair and skin what did you find out she asked only the slightest tremor in her voice one of the shipping companies knew me the man expected me to be wealthy this was every bit as difficult as he had expected her clear eyes allowed no evasions or euphemisms if he lied now he would never be able to regain what he lost as a policeman her face was white her voice catching in her throat he knew she envisioned corruption she was shaking her head a little denying the possibility no he said quickly before that as a banker she did not understand it was time to put it into unmistakable words words that could not be misunderstood or evaded anymore doing business with men who had made their money out of slaving and it seems i knew it he must say it all easier now than raising the subject again later i was bargaining for arrol dundas my mentor i dont know whether i told him that that was where the money came from or not perhaps i misled him for a moment she was silent time ballooned out to seem like eternity i see she said at last is that why youve been away these last few days yes he wanted her to know how ashamed he was he needed her to know it but the words were too trite none of them meant enough for the bitter weight of regret now that he should have allowed himself to be without honor he had degraded his own worth she smiled but her eyes were filled with sadness she reached out her hand and touched his cheek it was a soft gesture it did not dismiss what he had done or excuse it but it set it in the past youve looked back enough she said quietly if you profited from it its gone now he wanted to kiss her to be as close as people can be to hold her tightly and feel her answering strength but he had created the gulf and it must be she who crossed it otherwise he would never be sure she had wished to that he had not precipitated it she looked at him a moment longer weighing what he thought what he felt then she was satisfied her eyes filled with warmth and smiling she put her arms around him and kissed his lips relief washed over him in a warm sweet tide he had never been more grateful for anything in his life he responded to her with a whole heart rathbone began his defense when the trial resumed in the morning he wore an air of confidence he was far from feeling there was still no trace of shearer and no sign of where he had gone of course with his shipping connections that could be anywhere in europeor the world for that matter but juries liked a person they could see and whose guilt had been shown them not a reasonable alternative who was nothing more than a name he must repair the damage deverill had done the emotional impression he had created in the jurors minds he began by calling merrit to the stand he watched her walk across the floor of the court everyone in the room must have been aware of how nervous she was it was there in the pallor of her face in the slight misstep as she climbed up to the witnessbox and in the quaver of her voice as she took the oath again hester sat beside judith monk had given his evidence and was free to return to searching for more information about shearer anything at all however tiny that would give proof of the theory that it was he alone who had planned the robbery and the murder knowing he would sell the guns to breeland but without breelands foreknowledge rathbone began very gently leading merrit through her story starting as late in events as the day of the murders itself he did not wish to open the subject of their early acquaintance in case deverill should pry out of it the appearance that breeland had courted her not for herself but purely as a means to corrupt her into helping him obtain the guns it might not be difficult to do given her loyalty to him her passion against slavery and how much she had already committed herself to the cause and could not now retreat beside hester judith sat a little forward her black lacegloved hands knotted together in her lap she was listening to every word watching every gesture each expression of the face hester knew she was seeking meanings hope wrestling with fear trying to outguess the future she had been there too many times herself on judiths other side robert casbolt his evidence also given was offering silent support he was too wise to mouth comforting words that could have no meaning everything lay in the balance it all depended on rathbone and merrit you quarreled with your father that evening rathbone was saying looking up at merrit on the stand what about precisely she cleared her throat his selling guns to the confederates instead of to the union she answered i believed he should have found a way to get out of his bond to sell them to mr trace even though he had promised to he should have given back the money mr trace had paid in advance did he still have that money rathbone asked curiously i it was very obvious she had never considered that possibility i dont know i assumed that he had not paid for the guns with it he asked but he did not manufacture the guns did he no then it may not have been possible well i suppose i thought he bought them first involuntarily she glanced at casbolt as she spoke then back to rathbone but if he still owed anything i am sure he would have made some way i mean when lyman mr breeland paid for them in full as he could then anything my father owed could have been paidcouldnt it she spoke with confidence sure she had the solution if indeed breeland did have the money rathbone agreed hester knew what he was doingdemonstrating for the jury merrits trust her naivete and her transparent belief that the dealings were legitimate she did not yet see how he was going to extricate breeland from the suspicion of deceit but he did merrit said urgently he actually paid it to mr shearer at euston when we took the guns did you see that rathbone enquired well no i was in the carriage but mr shearer would not have handed over the guns without the money would he that was a challenge not a question i think it excessively unlikely rathbone agreed with a smile but may we return to your parting from your father you accused him of being in favor of slavery is that right she looked abashed yes i wish now that i hadnt said those things but i believed them then i was terribly angry and you believed that lyman breeland wanted to purchase the guns for a highly honorable cause far more honorable than that of mr trace her chin lifted sharply i knew it i was in america i witnessed the most terrible battle i saw she gulped i saw so many men killed i had never realized it would be so dreadful until you have seen a battle heard it smelled it you can have no idea of what it is really like we dont begin to know what our soldiers endure for us there was a murmur of appreciation around the room even of awe rathbone allowed the jury to see her remorse just long enough that he did not seem to be doing it deliberately then he continued after your quarrel where did you go miss alberton i went upstairs to my bedroom packed a few personal belongingstoiletries a change of costumeand i left the house she replied a change of costume he smiled you were wearing an evening gown a dinner dress she corrected him but not suitable for travel of course deverill looked exaggeratedly weary my lord oh yes it does matter rathbone said with a smile he turned back to merrit and then you left for mr breelands rooms she flushed very slightly yes that must have been a very emotional time for you and required courage and decision my lord deverill protested again we do not doubt that miss alberton has extraordinary courage an attempt to arouse our sympathy it has nothing whatever to do with courage or sympathy my lord rathbone interrupted it is purely practical i am glad to hear it the judge said dryly proceed thank you miss alberton what did you do just when you arrived at mr breelands rooms she looked confused did you talk together eat something perhaps change your clothes to the ones you had brought oh we spoke for a little of course then he stepped out for a few moments while i changed my clothes deverill murmured under his breath and the watch rathbone asked suddenly there was utter silence in the room i her face was white deverill was on the point of interrupting again rathbone wondered if he should remind merrit that she had sworn to tell the truth but he was afraid that she would consider the truth a small price to pay not to betray breeland miss alberton the judge prompted i dont remember she said looking at rathbone he knew she was lying in that moment she had recalled very clearly but she would not say so he changed the subject was mr breeland expecting you miss alberton no no he was very surprised to see me the color washed up her face she was acutely conscious of the fact that she had gone uninvited it seemed to hester seeing her discomfort that breeland had not welcomed her as a lover might but rather as a young man would who had been taken very much by surprise and been obliged extremely hastily to rearrange his plans she hoped that was not lost upon the jury rathbone was standing elegantly in the open space of the court his head a little bent the light shining on his fair hair hester glanced up at breeland he also looked selfconscious and uncomfortable although it was not so easy to know for what cause i see and after you had greeted each other you had explained your presence and he had permitted you to change your clothes what did you do then rathbone asked we discussed what we should do she replied do i have to tell you what we said i am not sure i can remember it is not necessary were you together all the time yes it was not so very long at a little before midnight a messenger arrived with a note saying that my father had changed his mind and would sell lyman the guns after all and we should go straight to the euston square station with the money who wrote this note mr shearer my fathers agent surely it surprised you after all your father had been adamant only a few hours before that it was completely impossible for him to change his mind it was a matter of honor rathbone pointed out yes of course i was surprised she agreed but i was too happy to question it it meant he had seen the justice of the union cause after all he was on the right side i thought perhaps perhaps my argument meant something to him rathbone smiled ruefully and so you went to the station with mr breeland yes would you describe that journey for us miss alberton step by step in tedious detail she obliged they adjourned for lunch and then resumed by midafternoon when she had completed her account anyone still listening might well have felt as if they themselves had made the train journey to liverpool stayed in a boardinghouse and embarked upon the steamer to cross the atlantic thank you miss alberton and just to make sure we have not misunderstood you was mr breeland out of your company at any time during the night of your fathers death no absolutely not and did you see your father after you left home or go anywhere near the warehouse in tooley street no oh one thing more miss alberton yes did you actually see shearer at the euston square station i assume you do know him by sight yes i do i saw him very briefly talking to one of the guards i see thank you he turned to deverill inviting him to take his turn deverill considered carefully perhaps more to test rathbone than in actual indecision merrit had already made it plain she would defend breeland to the last degree and the more she did so the more the jury respected her whether they believed her or not they did not think she was lying except perhaps about leaving the watch in breelands rooms but they may well have thought her duped and used by a man unworthy of her he would alienate them if he made that any more publicly apparent than it already was it was a difficult night the tension made sleep difficult in spite of exhaustion monk had been up and down the river all day and intended to resume the day after as well determined to find something hester did not ask him for an account of progress she needed to keep hope alive for judiths sake on friday rathbone called lyman breeland to the stand this was the most dangerous gamble of the whole defense but he had no choice not to have called breeland would have demonstrated his fears not only to deverill but more important to the jury deverill would have made the most of it in his summing up above all rathbone would have liked to separate merrit from breeland in the jurors minds even in the legal charge but that was morally impossible he had already done too much with the watch he had undertaken to defend breeland and he must do so to the very best of his ability standing in the witnessbox with shoulders squared and chin high breeland swore that he would tell the truth and gave his name and his rank in the union army rathbone drew from him the bare facts of his journey to england and the reason for it he did not ask him why he was prepared to go to such lengths in his cause he knew breeland would tell them anyway spontaneously and with a passion that would ring through whether they wanted to believe him or not and you presented yourself to daniel alberton in the hope of purchasing the guns you needed rathbone asked meeting breelands eyes and willing him to keep his answers brief that they might also be respectful was beyond his hope in spite of his efforts to convince breeland that antagonizing everyone now might cost him his life the balance was so fine breeland had replied simply that he was innocent and that should be enough rathbone had dealt with martyrs before they were exhausting and seldom open to reason they had a single view of the world and did not listen to what they did not wish to hear in some ways their dedication was admirable perhaps it was the only way to accomplish certain goals noble ones but it left a trail of wreckage behind rathbone had no intention that merrit alberton should be part of breelands destruction breeland agreed with unexpected brevity that he had indeed gone to see alberton in hope of purchasing guns and when he had met with resistance and learned that the reason for it was a commitment to philo trace he had done all in his power to change albertons mind by convincing him of the unions morally superior cause and during this time you made the acquaintance of miss merrit alberton yes breeland agreed a flicker of warmth at last lighting his face she is a person of the deepest compassion and honor she understood the union cause and espoused it herself immediately rathbone would have wished he had phrased it in more romantic terms but it was better than he had foreseen he must be careful not to lead breeland so his emotions seemed coached you found you had in common the most important values and beliefs yes my admiration for her was greater than i had expected to feel for any woman so young and so unacquainted with the actuality of slavery and its evils she has an extraordinary gift for compassion his face softened as he said it and for the first time there was something like a smile on his lips rathbone breathed a sigh of relief the jurors expressions relaxed at last they saw the human man the man in love with whom they could identify not the fanatic he did not look at merrit but he could imagine her eyes her face but in spite of all both you and miss alberton could do to change his mind he continued mr alberton did not agree to go back on his word to mr trace and sell you the guns instead why did you not simply go to another supplier because he had the finest modern guns available immediately and in quantity i could not afford to wait i see and what plans did you make as a result of this mr breeland breeland sounded slightly surprised none i confess i was very angry with his blindness he seemed incapable of seeing that there was a far greater issue at stake than one mans business reputation the hard edge had returned to his voice and he directed his attention entirely towards rathbone merrit seemed to have gone from his mind he leaned a little forward over the rail of the witnessbox he could see nothing but the narrow view his own word and what philo trace thought of him he was a man without vision no matter what i told him of the evils of slavery he waved his hand in a small dismissive gesture and all your gentlemen here have no idea what a cancer of the human soul it is when you have seen human beings treated with less dignity than a good man treats his cattle his voice rang with the fire of his anger his face burned with it rathbone could easily see why merrit had fallen in love with him what was less easy to see was what tenderness or patience he could give her in return what laughter or tolerance or simple joy in daily life what gratitude for little thingsabove all perhaps what forgiveness for failing and understanding of its needs he had no compassion for weakness but rathbone was in his middle forties merrit was sixteen perhaps she had years ahead before she would come to realize the value of such things now breeland was a hero and heroes were what she wanted she knew his vulnerabilities and loved him the more for them she did not see his limitations we have heard that you quarreled with mr alberton on the night of his death and on leaving his house you told him that you would win in the end regardless of what he might do what did you mean mr breeland why that the union cause was just and in the end would prevail against any ignorance or selfinterest breeland replied clearly as if the answer should have been obvious it was not a threat simply a statement of the truth i did not harm mr alberton as god is my judge rathbone kept his voice calm almost matteroffact as if he had barely heard breelands denial or the passion in him where did you go after you left mr albertons house back to my rooms alone of course did you make any agreement with miss alberton that she would follow you breeland opened his mouth to respond instinctively then changed his mind perhaps breeland remembered rathbones warnings about the sympathies of the jury no he said gravely i had no wish to come between miss alberton and her family my intentions towards her were always honorable rathbone knew that he was on dangerous ground full of pitfalls he wished he could have avoided asking at all but the omission would be so glaring it would have done more harm you went to your rooms mr breeland had you for any reason taken back from miss alberton the watch you gave her as a keepsake breeland did not hesitate no his gaze was unflinching rathbone had not meant to look at the jury but in spite of himself he did he saw the coldness in their faces they believed breeland but they did not like him for it in some subtle way he had enlarged a gulf between himself and merrit her loyalty was to him his was to his cause it was not what he had said which jarred it was the manner in which he said it and perhaps it was also what he did not say have you any idea how the watch came to be in tooley street rathbone asked none at all breeland responded except that it was not dropped by either miss alberton or myself she arrived at my apartments at about halfpast nine and remained there with me until we both left a little before midnight when the note came from shearer that mr alberton had changed his mind and was willing to sell the guns to the union after all then we left together and went to the euston square station and from there to liverpool he summed up the entire story in a few sentences leaving rathbone less to draw from him than he had intended but it was spontaneous and spoken with such force that perhaps it was better than a carefully guided response would have been were you surprised by the note from shearer rathbone began then was aware of deverill rising to his feet i apologize my lord he said quickly the note that purported to come from shearer i was amazed breeland conceded but you did not doubt it no i knew the justice of my cause i believed that alberton had at last realized it himself and that the issue of freedom from slavery was far greater than the business dealings or the reputation for honor of any one man i admired him for it there was total silence in the room rathbone felt as if a kind of darkness had descended over him he drew in his breath with difficulty breeland had in a few moments laid bare his philosophy and shown them an indifference to the individual which was like a breath of ice a road whose end could not be known rathbone looked at the jury and saw that they did not yet perceive the fullness of what breeland had said but deverill did victory was in his eyes rathbone heard his voice in the highceilinged room as if it were someone elses echoing strangely he must continue play it out to the very last word did you show the note to miss alberton no i had no reason to it was important to pack up my few belongings and leave as quickly as possible he had allowed us very little time to get to the euston square station breeland was quite unaware of there having been any change nothing was altered in him not the set of his shoulders his hands gripping the rail the confidence in his voice i told her what it said and she was overjoyed naturally yes naturally rathbone repeated detail by detail he took breeland through the ride to the station a description of the place of the guards of shearer himself of the train and all the passengers in the carriage they shared it coincided with merrits description so honestly he began for a moment to feel hope again all the events and people were recognizable as the same she had seen and yet with a sufficiently different perception a different use of words that it was clear they were not copied from each other or rehearsed he even noticed a couple of jurors nodding candor in their expressions acceptance perhaps they too had made the journey from euston to liverpool and knew the truth of what breeland was saying in the afternoon he took him more briefly through the voyage across the atlantic and his short stay in america deverill interrupted to ask if any of this was relevant i do not doubt my lord that mr breeland bought the guns for the union army or that he believes unequivocally in its cause it is not difficult to see why any man might wish to abolish slavery in his own land or any other nor do we doubt that he fought at manassas probably bravely as did many others he lowered his voice that he would pay any price whatever for union victory is only too tragically clear that he should sacrifice others to it is the substance of our charge it is not my aim to prove that rathbone argued knowing he was telling less than the truth and that deverill knew it also i wished to show that his treatment of miss alberton was always honorable and quite open even when monk and trace were in washington because he knew he was innocent of any crime and had no cause to fear them deverill smiled i apologize you were so far from it i had not realized that was your aim please continue rathbone was foundering and they both knew it but he could not now retreat he took breeland through his confrontation on the battlefield with monk and trace and his acceptance of returning to england you offered no resistance no many men can fight the physical battle in america breeland answered only i can answer here for my actions and fight the moral cause by persuading you here in england that our cause is just and our behavior honorable i bought guns openly and paid a fair price for them the only person i deceived was philo trace and that is the fortune of war he would expect it of me as i would of him we are enemies even if we treat each other politely if we chance to meet in london we are not barbarians he cleared his throat i am not afraid to answer for my acts before a court of law and i wish you to think of my people as the just and brave men they are he lifted his chin slightly staring straight ahead of him the time will come when you will have to choose between the union and the confederacy this war will not cease until one side has destroyed the other i will give everything i have my life my freedom if necessary to ensure that it is the union that wins rathbone looked up at merrit and saw the flash of pride in her face and that it cost her an effort he thought he also saw a deepening shadow of loneliness there was a very slight murmur of applause from somewhere in the back of the court instantly hushed deverills smile widened but there was also a flicker of uncertainty in it he wanted the jury to think he was confident perhaps that he perceived something they did not it was a game of bluff and double bluff rathbone could play it too at the moment it was all he had i cannot imagine that there is any man here who does not share your sentiments he said very clearly it is not our war and we grieve for your country and we hope profoundly that some better solution may be found than the slaughter of armies and the ruin of the land we have no desire to take the freedom of an innocent man who is serving his people in such a cause he bowed very slightly as if the battle against slavery were the question at issue his achievement was shortlived deverill rose to crossexamine breeland swaggering very slightly into the center of the floor he began with a broad dramatic gesture mr breeland you speak with great passion about the union cause no one here could mistake your dedication to it would it be true to say you hold it dearer to you than anything else breeland faced him squarely with pride yes it would deverill considered for a moment i believe you sir i am not sure i could be so wholehearted myself rathbone knew what was coming next he even considered interrupting diverting the jury for a few moments by pointing out that what deverill had said was hardly a question and not relevant to the case but it would be delaying the inevitable it would emphasize the fact that he had not wished breeland to answer he remained in his seat i think deverill resumed turning sideways to look up at merrit i think that rather than declare the justice of my cause and my own innocence i should have been tempted to protest my love for a young woman who had given up everythinghome family safety even her own countryto follow me into a foreign land at war with itself and to expend my energy in doing all i could to see that she did not hang for my crimes at the age of sixteen barely yet a woman on the verge of her life the effect was devastating breeland blushed crimson one could only guess what anger and shame consumed him merrit was white with misery perhaps never in her life again would she face such a terrible understanding or humiliation judith bent her head slowly as if a weight had become too much to endure philo traces lips were twisted with a pity he could not reach across and express casbolt also stared at judith the jurors were torn as to whether they would look at merrit or not some wished to grant her privacy by averting their gaze as if they had unintentionally intruded upon someone caught naked in an intimate act others glared at breeland in undisguised contempt two looked up at merrit with profound compassion perhaps they had daughters her age themselves there was no condemnation in their faces rathbone forced himself to remember that he was charged equally to defend breeland and merrit he could not take advantage of this and let breeland hang to accomplish merrits acquittal but at that moment he wished he could deverill did not need to add more whatever the facts and those he could not shake he had stifled any possible act of mercy the jury would want to convict breeland not for the murders but because he did not love while rathbone was struggling in the courtroom monk was trying to trace shearers actions on the night of albertons death and for the few days before the only way to clear breeland of the charge would be to prove that he had not conspired with shearer the times of the quarrel at albertons home the delivery of the note to breelands rooms and his arrival at the euston square station all made it impossible for him to have been at tooley street but they did not prove that he had not either deliberately corrupted shearer into committing the murders or at the least conspired with him and taken advantage of it he began at tooley street again with the surviving warehousemen it was a dusty warm day with scurries of wind making little eddies over the cobbles when did you last see shearer monk asked the man with the sandy hair to whom he had spoken before the mans face creased in concentration not rightly sure e was ere two days afore that tryin ter member if e was ere that day dont think so in fact im certain cos we ad a nice load o teak in an it werent anything as e ad ter be ere for dunno were e was but joe might know ill ask im and he left monk standing in the sun while he did so at seven sisters e was he said on his return went up ter see a feller abaht oak cant see as its got anything ter do wi guns neither could monk but he intended to follow every movement of shearer regardless do you know the name of the company in seven sisters bratby an summink i think bert replied big firm e said on the igh street or just off it what does it ave ter do with poor mr albertons death bratbys deals in oak an marble an the like not guns id like to know where shearer was from then onward monk said frankly there was no point being evasive he was at the euston square station to pass over the guns to breeland at just after halfpast midnight and no one has seen him since for certain so where is e i should dearly like to know what does he look like shearer ordinary sort o bloke really bout your eight or a bit less i spose lean not much air but darkish got green eyes thats different an a spot on is cheek bout ere he demonstrated touching his cheekbone with his finger an lots o teef monk thanked him and after a few more questions which elicited nothing of worth he took his leave and spent the next hour and a half taking a hansom to seven sisters he found the firm of bratby amp allan just off the main street mr shearer the clerk asked pushing his hand through his hair yes we know im right enough what would that be about sir if i may ask monk had already considered his reply im afraid he has not been seen for several weeks and we are concerned that some harm has come to him he said gravely the clerk did not look much concerned pity he said laconically spose people o work on the river ave haccidents like not certain wot day it was but i can look at me books an see if you want yes please the clerk put his pencil behind his ear and went to oblige he returned several moments later carrying a ledger ere he said putting it down on the table he pointed with a smudged finger and monk read it was quite clear that shearer had been at bratby amp allan on the day before albertons death until late in the afternoon negotiating the terms of sale of timber and the possibility of transporting it south to the city of bath what time did he leave here monk asked the clerk thought for a moment alf after five as i recollect i spect youll be wantin ter know were e went next if you know i dont but then i could give yer a guess like i would be grateful well ed go ter a cartin company what as yards close by stands ter reason dont it the clerk was pleased with his status as an expert it pleased his selfrespect quite visibly monk gritted his teeth indeed and theres not many as goes as far as bath the clerk went on so if i was you id try cummins brothers down the road from ere a bit he pointed to his left or theres b amp j horners the other way an o course the biggest is pattersons but thats not ter say theyre the best an mr shearer likes the best dont stand no nonsense e dont ard man but fair more or less so who is the best monk said patiently cummins brothers the clerk replied without hesitation costly but reliable yer should ask ter see mr george es the boss an mr shearerd go to the top like i said an ard man but good at is business monk thanked him and asked for precise directions to the premises of cummins brothers once there he requested mr george cummins and was obliged to wait nearly half an hour before being shown into a small room very comfortably appointed george cummins sat behind his desk the light shining through his thin white hair his face pleasantly furrowed monk introduced himself without evasion and told him honestly what he had come for shearer cummins said with surprise disappeared you said cant say i expected that he seemed in good spirits when i last saw him expecting a nice profit on a big deal something to do with america i think monk felt a quickening of interest he controlled it to protect himself from hope or forcing circumstances to fit his wishes did he elaborate on that at all cumminss eyes narrowed why just what is your business mr monk and why do you want to know where shearer is i consider him a friend have done for years im not speaking about him to just anyone until i know why monk could not tell him the truth or it might prejudice any evidence cummins could give he must be honest and yet evasive something he had learned to do well the deal with the american went badly wrong as you may be aware he replied gravely no one appears to have seen shearer since then i am a private enquiry agent acting on behalf of mrs alberton who is concerned that some harm may also have come to mr shearer he was a loyal employee of her late husband for many years she feels some responsibility to ascertain that he is alive and well and not in need of assistance and of course he is sadly missed especially now i see cummins nodded yes of course he frowned frankly i cant understand him not being there i confess mr monk you have me worried now when i didnt see or hear from him i took it he was away on a trading matter he does go to the continent now and then when did you last see him monk pressed exactly cummins thought for a moment the night before alberton was killed but i suppose you know that and thats why youre here we talked about moving some timber to bath as i said he was in good spirits we had dinner together at the hanley arms next to the omnibus station on hornsey road what time did you leave cummins looked anxious what is it youre thinking mr monk i dont know what time late about eleven we we dined rather well he said he was going back to the city how cab train from seven sisters road station its just down the bottom of the street from the hanley arms then along a bit how long would the journey take that time of night not many stops holloway station through copenhagen tunnel then into kings cross best part of an hour why i wish youd tell me what it is youre thinking anyone see you together swear to what time he left if you want ask the landlord of the hanley arms why cumminss voice was sharp with alarm because i believe he was at the euston square station at halfpast one monk answered rising to his feet what does that mean cummins demanded standing also it means he couldnt have been at tooley street monk replied cummins was startled did you think he was good god you you didnt think he did that not walter shearer he was a hard man wanted the best but he was loyal oh no he stopped he knew from monks face there was no need to say more it was the american he finished no it wasnt monk replied i dont know who the hell it was will you swear to this of course i will its the truth monk checked with the landlord of the hanley arms but he received the answer he expected and corroboration from the landlords wife he retraced shearers steps to the euston square station and found thirtytwo minutes unaccounted for no one could have gone south to tooley street murdered three men and loaded six thousand guns in that time but he could have stopped at kings cross and walked from there to the euston square station to claim a wagon load of guns already stored there and waiting he recounted all these things to rathbone that evening in the morning rathbone asked for the court to be delayed for sufficient time for the landlord of the hanley arms to be called and it was granted him by early afternoon all evidence had been given and both deverill and rathbone had made their summations no one knew who had murdered daniel alberton or the two guards in tooley street but it was quite clear it could not have been either breeland or sheareracting for breeland or with his knowledge rathbone could not say how breelands watch had come to be in the yard or account for the movement of the guns from tooley street or to euston square but a mystified and unhappy jury returned a verdict of not guilty judith was weak with relief for her the immediate fact that merrit was free from the threat of death was sufficient she allowed herself to have a few moments respite from grief hester stood in the crowded hallway outside the courtroom watching as merrit came towards her mother hesitantly at first philo trace was standing a dozen yards to the left of them he did not wish to be included in the circle but it was nakedly apparent in his face how much it mattered to him that judith should be happy his eyes were soft as he looked at her oblivious to everyone else coming and going robert casbolt was closer palefaced exhausted by the emotional turmoil of the trial but now also if not relaxed at least no longer struggling to rescue merrit lyman breeland stood back it was impossible to tell from the stunned pallor of his face what he felt he was free but neither his character nor his cause had been understood as he would have liked he was at least sensitive enough to the pain that had been experienced not to come forward now of this immediate reunion he was not a part they were left with the grief and the anger all the things that had had to be unsaid even unthought until the battle was over merrits eyes filled with tears perhaps it was the sight of her mother in black the color and vitality in her stifled drained away by loss and then by fear judith held her arms out silently merrit stepped forward and they clasped each other merrit sobbing letting go of all the terror and pain that she had held so desperately in control over the last month since hester had first told her of her fathers death philo trace blinked hard several times then turned and walked away robert casbolt remained rathbone came out of the courtroom door smiling horatio deverill was a couple of steps behind him still looking surprised but not exhibiting any ill will they passed breeland without apparently noticing him did you do that on purpose deverill asked shaking his head i really thought i had you on intent if not facts im still not sure i wasnt caught by sleight of hand somehow rathbone merely smiled merrit and judith parted and judith thanked rathbone formally and moved a little apart with him merrit turned towards hester thank you she said very quietly you and mr monk have done far more for me than i can ever express to you in words there was still confusion and unhappiness in her face hester knew what it was the victory of acquittal was deeply shadowed by the disillusion of breelands isolation from her now that the immediate danger was over she had to face a decision they were not forced together by common circumstances any longer suddenly it was a matter of choice that she had to make it at all was painful enough and her misery was clear it was a very mixed blessing wasnt it hester replied equally quietly she did not wish anyone else to hear their exchange and with as many conversations as there were going on it was not difficult to submerge themselves in the sea of voices merrit did not answer she still did not wish to commit herself to saying aloud that the certainty was gone the crusade was glorious but it was not really love not enough for a marriage im sorry hester said and she meant it profoundly she had mourned dreams herself and knew the pain of it merrit lowered her eyes i dont understand him she said under her breath he didnt ever really love me did he not as i loved him he probably loves you as much as he is able to hester searched her mind to find the truth merrit looked up what shall i do hes an honorable man i always knew he wasnt guilty not just of actively being there but of persuading shearer to do it either are you sure he wouldnt have taken the guns even if he had known that they were tainted by murder hester asked merrit gulped no she whispered he believes the cause is great enough to justify any means of serving it i i dont think i can share that belief i know i cant feel it maybe my idealism isnt strong enough i dont see the great vision perhaps im not as good as he is that was almost a question the pleading for an answer was in her eyes even now she was half convinced the fault was hers that it was she who lacked a certain nobility that would have enabled her to see things as he did no hester said decisively to see the mass and lose the individual is not nobility you are confusing emotional cowardice with honor she was even more certain as she found the words to do what you believe is right even when it hurts to follow your duty when the cost in friendship is high or even the cost in love is a greater vision of course but to retreat from personal involvement from gentleness and the giving of yourself and choose instead the heroics of a general cause no matter how fine is a kind of cowardice merrit still looked doubtful part of her understood but she had not found words to explain it to herself she frowned struggling to make final the realization she had been trying not to see for days i couldnt love anyone who would put me before what he believed was right i mean i could love him but not with a whole heart not the same way neither could i hester agreed seeing the momentary relief in merrits eyes then the confusion return i would want him to do what was right no matter how it would hurt thats the difference i would want the cost to me to tear him apart not to add to his sense of glory merrit trembled on the edge of tears i i really believed you cant leave it behind so easily can you no hester touched her arm very gently of course not but i think going with him pretending all the time watching the reality grow sharper would be even more difficult breeland was coming towards them he looked a trifle awkward uncertain what to say now that the tension had passed he had the guns he was proved innocent and acquitted perhaps he did not even understand the chill in the air judith turned to watch but she remained where she was thank you for your efforts on our behalf mrs monk breeland said stiffly i am sure you did it because you believed it to be right nevertheless we are grateful you are mistaken hester said meeting his eyes i had no idea whether it was right or not i did it because i care for merrit i hoped she was innocent and i believed it as long as i could because i wanted to fortunately i still can that is the sort of reasoning a woman is free to have i suppose he said with faint disapproval but it is too emotional a very small smile touched his lips i do not wish to be ungracious he turned to merrit perhaps you would prefer to remain some time with your mother before we return to washington i understand that i can wait at least a week then i should rejoin my regiment i have very little reliable news of what is happening at home at least now my honor is vindicated and england will know that the officers of the union are upright in their dealings i may well be sent back to purchase more arms there was a moment of silence before merrit replied with her voice level but it was apparent it cost her all the strength of will she possessed i am sure your honor is vindicated lyman and that for you that is the most important thing that could have happened i am happy it is i am equally certain that you deserve it however i do not wish to return to washington with you i thank you for the offer i am sure you do me great honor but i do not believe we should make each other happy therefore i cannot accept he looked as if he had not grasped what he had heard it was incomprehensible to him that she could have changed from the girl who had adored him so completely to the young woman who now made such a considered judgment that incredibly amounted to a rejection you would make me very happy he said with a frown you have all the qualities any man could wish for and what is more you have shown them under the greatest pressure i cannot imagine i could find any woman i should admire more than i do you merrit drew in a deep shuddering breath hester saw the resolve flicker in her face love is more than admiration lyman merrit said with tremendous difficulty gasping to control her breath love is caring for someone when they are wrong as well as when they are right protecting their weakness guarding them until they find strength again love is sharing the little things as well as the big ones he looked stunned as if she had struck him and he had no idea why then quite slowly he bowed and turned and walked away she gave a little gulp drew in her breath to call him back and remained silent judith came and put her arms around her allowing her to weep with deep wrenching sobs that were the end of a dream and already just a thread of relief monk and hester dined out on the most excellent poached fish fresh vegetables and plum pie with cream they walked home arm in arm along the quiet lamplit streets there was an arch of light across the sky between the rooftops and a few windows glowed yellow we still dont know who killed daniel alberton hester said at last they had both refrained from saying it all evening but it could no longer remain a ghost between them no he agreed somberly tightening his arm around her except that it wasnt breeland even indirectly and it couldnt have been shearer who does that leave i dont know she admitted what happened to the other five hundred guns he did not reply for several minutes walking in silence with his head down do you think breeland took them too and he lied she asked why should he the money perhaps what he paid wasnt enough since theres no trace of any money at all there doesnt seem to be any reason he pointed out there was no response to make again they walked a short distance without speaking they passed another couple and nodded politely the woman was young and pretty the man openly admiring of her it made hester feel comfortable and very safe not from pain or loss but at least from the agony of disillusion she gripped monks arm a little more tightly what is it he asked nothing she said with a smile nothing to do with daniel alberton poor man i really want to know what happened and to prove it he gave a little laugh but he held her equally close i cant forget the blackmail she went on i dont believe its happening at the same time was just coincidence thats why he called you in the blackmailer has never been back pirates dont give up do they albertons dead i know that but casbolt isnt why didnt they pursue it with him he also gave money and help to gilmer they crossed the road and reached the pavement on the far side they were still half a mile from home the ugliest answer to that is that they didnt give up he replied we still dont know what happened to the barge that went down the river who took it or what was on it certainly something went from tooley street there are five hundred guns not accounted for the exact amount demanded by the pirates you think alberton sold them after all she asked very quietly it was the thought she had been trying to avoid for several days the tension of the trial had allowed her to now it could no longer be held away why would he do that judith would loathe it presumably he never intended her to know or casbolt either but why she insisted five hundred guns what would they be worth about one thousand eight hundred and seventyfive pounds he answered he had no need to add that that was a small fortune you looked at his company books she reminded him could he possibly have needed that much no he was doing well up and down of course but overall it was very profitable down you mean times when no one wanted to buy guns she said skeptically they dealt in other things as well timbers and machinery particularly but i wasnt thinking of that guns were the main profit makers but also the only bad loss they reached the curb he hesitated looked then crossed they were close to fitzroy street now do you remember the third china war you said judith told you about the first night at the albertons home over the ship and the french missionary not that one the one after only last year what about it she asked it seems they sold some guns to the chinese just before that and because of the hostilities they were never paid it wasnt a large amount and they made it up within a few months but that was the only bad deal he didnt need to sell to pirates trace had paid him thirteen thousand pounds on account for the guns breeland took which of course will need to be paid back breeland says he paid the full price around twentytwo thousand five hundred pounds and theres the ammunition as well which would be over one thousand four hundred pounds the profit on all that would be a fortune he shook his head a little i cant see why he should feel compelled to sell another one thousand eight hundred and seventyfive pounds worth of guns to pirates nor can i she agreed so where are they and who killed alberton and who went down the river and for that matter where is walter shearer i dont know monk admitted but i intend to find out good she said softly turning the corner into fitzroy street we have to know in the morning monk woke early and left without disturbing hester the sooner he started the sooner he might find some thread that would lead to the truth as he walked towards tottenham court road past the fruit and vegetable wagons heading for the market he wondered if perhaps he already had that thread but had failed to recognize it he rehearsed all he knew going over it again in his mind detail by detail as he rode in a hansom across the river ready to begin again the journey down to bugsbys marshes this time he did the trip hastily concentrating more on the description of the barge any distinguishing marks or characteristics it might have had if it had returned even part of the way surely someone must have seen it it took him all morning to get as far as greenwich but he learned a little about the barge it was large and yet still so heavily laden it rode almost dangerously low in the water one or two men who were used to working on the river had noticed it for precisely that reason they described the dimensions very roughly but in the dark even had there been any other distinguishing marks no one saw them from morden wharf beyond greenwich he went by boat back across the river and up a little to cubitt tower pier and then by road again past the blackwall entrance to west india south dock still asking about the barge he stopped for a tankard of cider at the artichoke tavern but no one remembered the night of the tooley street murders anymore it was too long ago now he went increasingly despondently to the blackwall stairs where he had a long conversation with a waterman who was busy splicing a rope working with gnarled fingers and a skill at weaving and pulling with the iron spike which in its way was as beautiful as a woman making lace it pleased monk to watch bringing back some faint memory of a longdistant past an age of childhood by northern beaches the smell of salt and the music of northumbrian voices a time he could not fully recall anymore except like bright patches of sunlight on a dark landscape a big barge the waterman said thoughtfully yeah i member the tooley street murders bad thing that pity they int got oo done it but then i dont like guns neither guns are fer soldiers an armies an the like only bring trouble anywhere else the ones for the union army seem to have gone by train to liverpool monk replied not that it mattered now and certainly not to the waterman yeah the man wove the unraveled end of the rope into the main length and took out his knife to tidy off the last threads mebbe they did monk assured him you see em the waterman raised his eyebrows no but they got there to washington i mean the waterman made no comment but there were others monk went on narrowing his eyes against the sunlight off the river they were directly across from the graybrown stretch of bugsbys marshes and the curve of blackwall point beyond which he could not see something came down on that barge what i dont know is where those boxes went and where the barge went to after it was unloaded theres plenty of illegal stuff goes back and forward around ere the waterman ventured small stuff mostly and farther down towards the estuary specially beyond the woolwich arsenal an the docks on this side down gallions reach or barking way and on it couldnt have got that far in the time monk replied mebbe it waited somewhere the waterman finished his work and surveyed it carefully he was apparently satisfied because he set it down and put away his knife and hook margaret ness or cross ness praps any way i could find out not as i can think of you could try askin if theres anybody round wanter go monk had nothing else left to try he accepted climbing into the boat with practiced balance and sitting easily in the stern out on the water the air was cooler and the faint breeze on the moving tide carried the smell of salt and fish and mud banks go down towards the blackwall point monk directed do you think theres enough cover there to conceal a seagoing ship one big enough to cross the atlantic well now thats a good question the waterman said thoughtfully depends where like why what difference does it make monk asked well some places a shipd stand out like a sore thumb see it a mile off mastsd be plain as day other places theres the odd wreck for example an ood notice an extra spar or two for a while leastways monk sat forward eagerly then go past all the places lets see what the draft is and where a ship could lie up he urged the waterman obeyed leaning his weight against the oars and digging them deep not that itll prove anything mind he warned less o course yer find someone as seen it its going back now must be two months or more ill try monk insisted right the waterman heaved hard and they picked up speed even against the tide they moved around the wide curve of the blackwall reach as far as the point monk staring at the muddy shore with its low reeds and here and there the occasional driftwood floating old mooring posts sticking above the tide like rotted teeth mudflats shone in the low sun patches of green weed and now and then part of a wreck settling lower and lower into the mire beyond the blackwall point were the remains of two or three ancient barges it was difficult to tell what they had been originally too little was visible now it might have been one barge broken by tides and currents or it might have been two other odd planks and boards had drifted up and stuck at angles in the mud it was a dismal sight the falling and decaying of what had once been gracious and useful the waterman rested on his oars his face creased in a frown what is it monk asked isnt this too shallow a lane for an oceangoing ship it would have to stand far out or risk going aground it cant have been here what about farther down the waterman did not answer seemingly lost in contemplation of the shore monk grew impatient what about farther down he repeated its too shallow here yeah the waterman agreed just tryin ter member summink theres summink i seen ere round about that time cant think on what a ship monk said doubtfully it was more of a denial than a question a yardlong board drifted past them towards the shore submerged an inch or two below the surface of the water one end jagged what kind of a thing monk said impatiently another piece of flotsam bumped against the boat more wrecks than that the waterman answered gesturing towards the shore looks different but why would anyone go an move a wreck from ere aint worth nothin now woods too rotten even ter burn aint good for nothin cept gettin in the way another monk started then as his eye caught the jetsam drifting away an extraordinary thought occurred to himdaring outrageous almost unprovable but which would explain everything is there anybody else who would know his voice was surprisingly hoarse when he spoke urgency making it raw the waterman looked at him with amazement catching the sharp edge of emotion without understanding it i could ask ol jeremiah spatts might a seen summink not much as gets by im e lives over tother side but es always up an down mind yerll ave ter be careful ow yer asks es no time fer the law you ask him monk fished in his pocket and pulled out two half crowns and held them in his open palm get me a careful honest answer ill do that the waterman agreed don need yer money jus wanner know what yer guessed tell me the story monk told him and gave him the half crowns anyway that evening monk called upon philo trace and fortunately found him in his lodgings he did not ask him why he was still in london whether it was in the hope of purchasing guns for the confederacy or only because he was loath to leave because of his feelings for judith alberton the trial was over he had no legal or moral duty to remain he recalled traces having mentioned diving in the confederate navy and he needed to speak to him about it now urgently diving trace said in disbelief where what for explaining his reasons and briefly what he had seen monk told him why you cant go alone trace agreed the moment monk was finished its dangerous ill come with you well have to get suits have you ever dived before no but ill have to learn as i do it monk answered realizing how brash it sounded even as he spoke but he had no alternative he could not send anyone else and the look in traces eyes betrayed that he knew that he did not argue then id better explain some of the dangers and sensations you may feel for your own safety he warned there must be divers somewhere along the river for salvage at least and to mend wharfs and so on there are monk agreed the waterman told me ive already made enquiries we can hire equipment and men to assist us from messrs heinke they are submarine engineers in great portland street good trace nodded then im ready when you wish tomorrow certainly monk had told hester of the idea that had come to him on the river and of his plan to take philo trace and dive beneath the thames at blackwall point of course she had asked him about it in minute detail and he answered only with assurances of his safety and generalities as to how that was going to be assured and what he expected to find the next afternoon just before two oclock he left saying he would meet with philo trace and the men from messrs heinke at the river and would return either when he had discovered something or when the rising tide made further work impossible she was obliged to be content with that there was no possibility whatever of her accompanying him she knew from the look on his face that pressing the issue would gain her nothing at all monk found the entire experience of diving extraordinaryand terrifying he met trace at the wharf where they were to be fitted out with all they would need for the proposed venture until this point monk had been concentrating on what he expected to find on the bottom of the river and what he would learn from it if they were successful now suddenly the reality of what he was going to do overwhelmed him are you all right trace asked his face shadowed with anxiety they were side by side on the vast wooden timbers of the wharf the graybrown water opaque twenty feet below them sucking and sliding gently smelling of salt mud and that peculiar sour odor of receding tide which left behind it the refuse of the teeming life on either side of it it was so turgid with scrapedup silt it could have been a foot deep or a mile anything more than a foot beneath the surface was already invisible it was just before ebb tide turned to flood the best time for diving when the currents are least powerful and the visibility of the incoming salt water offered almost a foot of sight monk found himself shivering right sir a thin man with grizzled hair said cheerfully lets be avin yer he eyed monk up and down with moderate approval not too fat anyway like em leaner but youll do monk stared at him uncomprehendingly fat divers int no good the man said whistling between his teeth cant take the pressure down deep their ealth goes an theyre finished off with yer clothes then no time ter stand abaht what off with yer clothes the man repeated patiently yer dont think yer was goin down dressed up like that did yer ood yer think yerll see down there then the flippin queen another man had arrived ready to assist and monk looked across and saw that trace was also being undressed and redressed by a cheerful man who was wearing a thick sweater in spite of the warm august morning obediently he stripped off his outer clothes leaving only his underwear he was handed two pairs of long white woolen stockings then a thick shirt of the same material then flannel knee breeches which had the effect of keeping the other garments together they were suffocatingly hot he had little time to imagine the ludicrous figure he must cut but seeing trace he knew he would appear much the same his dresser produced a cap of red wool and placed it on his head adjusting it as carefully as if it had been an object of high fashion a string of barges moved past them men staring interestedly wondering what was happening what they would be looking for or if it was only a matter of shoring up a falling wall or broken pier stake watch yerself monks dresser warned keep that straight just like i put it get yer air ose blocked up an well be pulling yer up dead an all now yerd best be gettin down them steps onter the barge no need ter put the rest o yer suit on yet its mortal eavy specially wen yer int used ter it watch yerself this last was directed to monk when he took a step in his stockinged feet perilously close to an upstanding nail trace followed after him down the long ladder to the low boat which was bumping up against the wharf it was already occupied by a wonderful array of pumps wheels coils of rubber hose and ropes normally monk would have kept his balance easily in the faintly rocking boat but he was tense and uncharacteristically awkward it flashed into his mind to wonder what they would think of him if they found nothing and who would pay him for this expedition trace was looking grim but his fine features were composed at least outwardly he felt no misgivings had he believed monks extraordinary story the three men who had dressed them and helped so far put their backs against the oars and pulled away from the wharf then began to swing wide and go downstream with the outgoing tide towards bugsbys marshes and beyond no one spoke there was no sound but the creak of the oars in the oarlocks and the splash and dip of the water the sky was half overcast from the smoke of thousands of chimneys in the dock areas on the north side masts and cranes showed black against the haze ahead of them lay the ugly flats of the marshes he had already told them as nearly as he could where they wished to begin the search it was only approximate and he became increasingly aware of just how huge the area was as they approached the point and the wreck he had seen on his earlier trip the men rested on their oars it was just about slack tide right sir one of them said whered yer be wantin ter begin then it was time to seek the counsel of experts if a man wanted to sink a barge with the least chance of its being found where would he choose he asked it sounded ridiculous even as he listened to himself overhead gulls wheeled and cried the wind was rising and the water slurped against the sides of the boat rocking it very gently it was the man who had begun helping monk dress who answered in the lee o one o the sandbanks he answered without hesitation waters deep enough ter ide a barge even at the lowest tide what would sink a barge monk asked him the man screwed up his face not much actual mostly age overloading which some fools do but if you wanted to sink one monk pressed the mans eyes widened bash an ole in it i reckon below the waterline o course not the bottom thats made of elm too ard sides is oak i see thank you he had all he needed now there was no avoiding putting on the rest of the suit and going over the side and into the murky water a few more pulls on the oars five minutes perhaps and he was climbing into the diving suit with the help of two of the men it looked rather like a very baggy allinone jacket and trousers made of two layers of waterproof cloth with india rubber between it felt as though he were pulling on a heavy sack but with arms and legs in it he had had no idea how difficult it would be to force his hands through the tight india rubber cuffs he was obliged to grease his hands with soft soap and then narrow his palms as much as possible while an attendant opened the cuff and he pushed his hand into it so violently he was afraid he was going to tear his flesh the dresser nodded with approval if he noticed the cold sweat on monks face he made no comment on it sit down he ordered pointing to the thwart behind monk gotta get yer boots on an yer elmet gotta make sure everythings right he bent down and began the process with the enormous weighted boots if they int right youll lose them in the mud sucks summink awful down there an old still while i put on yer breastplate that comes loose an yer a gonner monk felt his stomach clench as his imagination visualized the darkness and the bottomless greedy mud it cost him all his selfcontrol to sit obediently motionless while the helmet was placed over his head and screwed metal rubbing against metal until it was tight the front glass was left off for now monk was surprised by the almost crushing weight of the helmet the air hose was passed under his right arm and the end attached to the inlet valve then the breast line was brought up under his left arm and secured next came the belt and the heavy razorsharp knife in its leather sheath the man looped a rope around monks waist ere now old this in yer and and if yer get in trouble pull on it six or seven times an well get yer up thats wy we call it the lifeline he grinned this ere other rope weve tied to yer were gonna tie the other end ter the ladderwe dont wanter lose yerleast not until were paid he laughed heartily all right lad the man asked monk nodded his mouth dry he looked at the brown water around their vessel still drifting idly on the slack tide and felt as if he were about to be buried alive the three men were busy at their tasks careful professional trace sat on the other thwart dressed exactly the same he smiled and monk smiled back wishing he felt as confident as the gesture implied one of the men straightened up all right boys lets get the pump going there was a loud clickclack and in a moment monk felt the air rush into his helmet the man smiled aye its working all right now dont you worry lad just member ter stick close ter the other feller an ow ter inflate yer suit wi that valve an yerll be fine he did not sound quite as confident now as if at this final moment he had realized just what a novice monk was and the risks he was taking the front glass of his helmet was screwed into place and for a moment monk was overcome with panic he gasped for air and drew it into his lungs gradually his wild heartbeat subsided right the man said with a slightly forced smile time ter go monk lumbered towards the ladder thinking with each step that the weight of the helmet would buckle him at the knees he climbed down awkwardly and when the water was to his waist two fiftypound leads were fastened to his chest and back he gasped at the sudden increase in weight he was handed a waterproof lantern with a candle in it his suit began to inflate slightly as the air expanded it now he appreciated why it needed to be so large on him trace was already below him in the water almost submerged the river closed over his head and in moments he was blinded by gloom the only contact with trace and the surface was by rope and he tried to unscramble what the men had told him stay calm dont panic remember you are not on your own pull on the rope if youre in trouble well get you up the pressure built up in his eardrums he swallowed to clear it gradually his sight cleared a little as his eyes became accustomed to the gloom he could make out the form of trace coming towards him taking monk by the hand with leaden feet just touching the muddy bottom monk followed after him he lost all sense of time he was amazed how difficult it was to keep his balance the tide was far more powerful than he had foreseen pulling one way and another at him as current eddied and swirled sometimes going one way at chest height the opposite way at his thighs and knees more than once he found himself falling and regained his footing with difficulty and all the time he was acutely aware that only one thin hose of pumped air supported his life one thin set of ropes could pull him back to the surface the ground sloped up beneath his giant boots they were on the mud bank it was hard work trying to climb up it he was sweating as he went but his hands and feet were cold the murky water swirled around his head a brown blinding mass the dim figure of trace was still just ahead of him close enough to hold his hand but was no more than a deepening of the gloom time seemed endless he longed for light this was all an idiotic idea what had made him think the barge had been sunk simply because he could find no trace of its going back upstream again and if it were down here what did that prove only that fraud had been the intention all along would it prove by whom or who had murdered alberton it was impenetrably dark ahead how long had they been down here trace was still guiding him along turning slowly in the water raising his other arm monk lost his balance again he should have left this to professionals except he could not he must find this himself hold the proof in his own hands see everything there was miss nothing destroy nothing still holding monks hand trace swung his arm around and pointed ahead of them was a deeper murk blocking off even the swirling brown of the water trace started to move again and monk followed agonizingly slowly then suddenly his feet were swept from under him and he felt a hard yank on the ropes awkwardly he tried to look down at what had caught him it was the boards of a sunken wreck trace was climbing up onto an angle of the boat monk went after him the effort to move made his muscles ache they seemed to be on a deck slipping slightly as the bow settled deeper into the mud moving hand over hand they found the cabin it took a long slow examination a foot at a time holding on to each other to discover what was inside it was trace who found the crates it was impossible to tell how many there were of them but moving with infinite slowness they found at least fifty far more than monk had expected more like the original shipment to breeland but why here at the bottom of the river and not on their way over to america or to the mediterranean monk felt traces hand on his shoulder he could see almost nothing there was barely sufficient light to tell which way the surface lay he reached out for trace then drew back his hand now numb with cold this was no time to be foolish a hand came after him then he felt the rest of the body a shoulder perhaps a head it bumped into his helmet and something covered the glass in front of his eyes hair loose human hair in the water trace was drowning monk reached up and clasped the arm trying to pull desperately on the rope at the same time he must get help what had happened there was no resistance on the arm no weight god almighty it was loose just an arm bloated and almost naked he could dimly make out where his fingers had sunk into the flesh like squeezing soft fat he felt himself gag and only just controlled himself from retching the rest of the body was there almost whole huge disintegrating at the touch he saw traces light in the gloom waving around another body floated across his vision and disappeared it made no sense who were they why were they dead he forced himself to govern his revulsion and move slowly after one of them deliberately he felt around until he found the head he shone his light on it close up trying not to look at the unrecognizable features the bullet hole was still there not easy to see in the white halfeaten flesh of the forehead but plain enough in the splintered skull it seemed to take endless time swishing around almost helplessly in the current inside the cramped cabin bumping into each other into the trapped and hideous corpses before they ascertained beyond doubt that there were three men all of whom had been shot dead trace came right up to him holding monk by one arm and touching his helmet to monks when he spoke incredibly monk could hear him almost as normal shearer trace said distinctly waving his other arm with the lantern in the direction of one of the corpses shearer of course this abomination was why no one had seen walter shearer since the night of albertons death he had been loyal to alberton after all he had followed the barge down here and been shot with these other two were they the ones who had actually committed the murders why on whose orders he made a sign of acknowledgment then turned and blundered out of the fearful cabin and stopped abruptly as his air hose tightened and almost broke terror stifled his breath he was covered in cold sweat trace of course he would die down here in this filthy water alone with his murderer he would never see light again breathe air hold hester in his arms or look at her eyes when monk left home that afternoon hester had tried at first to busy herself with domestic tasks mrs patrick arrived at exactly two oclock the agreed time she was a small thin woman with crisp white hair full of natural curl and very blue eyes hester judged her to be about fifty years old she had a strong face albeit a little gaunt and a brisk manner she spoke with a slight scottish burr hester could not place it but she knew it was not edinburgh she had too many memories of that city to mistake its tones mrs patrick neat in a white starched apron began to clear up the kitchen and consider what other tasks needed doing clean and black the small stove put on the laundry scrub the kitchen floor clean out the larder and make a note of what needed restocking take out the rugs sweep the floors beat the rugs and return them hang the laundry out and do the ironing from the previous day and of course prepare the dinner what time will mr monk be home she enquired while hester was sitting in the office out of the way stitching on a shirt button i dont know hester replied honestly hes gone diving mrs patricks eyebrows shot up i beg your pardon hes gone diving hester explained in the river im not sure what he expects to find water and mud mrs patrick said tartly for heavens sake why would he be doing such a thing she looked at hester narrowly as if she suspected she had been lied to regarding the nature of monks employment hester was very keen to keep mrs patricks services life had been altogether much easier since her advent he is still trying to find out who killed mr alberton in the tooley street murder she said tentatively mrs patricks eyebrows were still raised and a trifle crooked her mouth twisted into profound skepticism there are other guns hester went on not sure if she was making matters better or worse something went down the river on the barge from hayes dock it might have been to pay the blackmailers mrs patrick had not intended to admit that she had been following the case she disapproved of reading about such things but the words were out of her mouth before she realized their implication that was why they asked for mr monk in the first place wasnt it yes it was hester admitted if you ask me they dont exist mrs patrick smoothed her apron over her narrow hips i reckon as mr alberton did that himself probably sold the guns to the pirates anyway that wouldnt make any sense hester argued if there were no blackmailer then he could sell them anywhere he wanted highest bidder mrs patrick said darkly money mark my words thats whatll be at the bottom of it the love of money is at the root of all evil and with that she turned and went back to the kitchen and her duties hester sat for another fifteen minutes turning it over in her mind then she went through to the kitchen herself and informed mrs patrick that she was going out and had very little idea when she would be back youre not going along the river mrs patrick asked in some alarm no im not hester assured her im going to consider the question of blackmail again more carefully mrs patrick grunted and returned her attention to the sink but her square stiff shoulders were eloquent of her mixed satisfaction and disapproval she was obviously not at all certain that the position she had accepted was a wise one but it was undoubtedly interesting and she would not leave just yet unless it seriously threatened either her personal safety or her reputation hester went again to see robert casbolt she hoped to find him at home if not she would have to seek an appointment with him in his offices or wait there for him to return from whatever business had taken him away fortunately he was at home apparently reading an ancient manservant informed her mr casbolt would be happy to see her and led her not into the golden room in which they had talked before but to an upstairs room which was if anything even more beautiful french doors opened onto a balcony which overlooked the garden at the moment full of flowers and quiet in the sun the room was done entirely in soft earth colors and creams extraordinarily restful and hester felt immediately comfortable in it casbolt welcomed her inviting her to be seated in one of the chairs facing the garden a little to the left of a magnificent italian bronze lion its beautiful she said moved by something more than mere admiration there was a tenderness in the room as if it were a place apart from ordinary life he was pleased you like it more than that she said honestly its unique yes it is he agreed simply i spend time here alone when i am out it is locked i am glad you see its quality hester hoped even more profoundly that it was not as mrs patrick suggested but she must face the truth if alberton had intended to deal with the pirates in any manner at all or had given them to believe he would then perhaps his death had nothing to do with the american civil war but was a matter of money or perhaps after all those years an old vengeance for judiths brothers death since casbolt was her cousin and obviously cared for her deeply perhaps he even knew that or had guessed it since if it were either of these two answers she longed for it to be the latter a vengeance would be understandable any man might well have hungered to exact some kind of justice in the circumstances and reached where the law could not what can i do for you mrs monk casbolt asked graciously i feel we owe you so much believe me you would have only to name your favor we still do not know who was responsible for the crimes she chose evasive words and she spoke softly somehow in this lovely room it would seem coarse to use words like murder when euphemisms would be understood he looked down at his hands for a moment he had fine hands strong and smooth then he raised his eyes no and i fear we may not he answered i had believed it was breeland himself or shearer at his instigation i am delighted that rathbone proved it was not merrit and not learning who it was is a small price to pay for that it is not necessarily a trade mr casbolt she argued merrit is perfectly safe now i have considered the matter quite carefully and i have wondered if it does not stem back to the original letter of blackmail over which you first consulted my husband after all they asked for guns as a payment for their silence and they have been silent he frowned uncertainty in his face he hesitated for several moments before replying im not sure what it is you believe mrs monk do you think they killed daniel and stole the guns because he would not yield to their demands was breeland simply caught up in it by an unfortunate accident of timing is that what you are suggesting it was not as simple as that but she was reluctant to tell him what she feared daniel alberton had been his closest friend and any slur against him would reflect on judith and on merrit did the truth matter now the detailed truth as to why as long as they knew who is it possible hester said evasively again casbolt sat silently for several moments his brows drawn down in thought as she waited she realized how unlikely it would be if guns could be so simply stolen why would they have bothered with the sophistication of blackmail in the first place he was watching her you dont believe that do you he said softly you are afraid daniel yielded to them arent you you know he was in the yard that night it must have been to meet someone yes she said unhappily she loathed having to do this but the truth lay between them huge and inevitable there was no possibility of avoiding it now daniel would not sell guns to pirates casbolt said shaking his head denying it to himself the guns missing from breelands shipment were exactly the amount asked for in the blackmail letter she pointed out he still wouldnt do that not to pirates but his voice was losing its conviction he was talking to persuade himself and the unhappiness in his eyes betrayed his knowledge that she could see it perhaps he had little choice she said the blackmail we would have fought it through i believe your husband might well have discovered who it was it had to be someone in london how could a mediterranean pirate know about gilmer how would anyone she said so quietly he leaned forward to hear her she could feel the heat in her face and yet her hands were cold he stared at her are you are you saying what i think he stumbled over the words no he would not do that just as breeland could not be guilty because of the times of events casbolt could not either she hated hurting him but he was the one person she could trust and who would be in a position to find the truth and maybe to keep it silent perhaps he needed the money his eyes widened the money i dont understand i am quite familiar with the company books mrs monk the finances are more than adequate at last hester spoke aloud the ugly thought that she had been trying to suppress or deny all day what if he invested privately as well and lost money he looked startled as if the thought rattled him it took him a moment to regain his composure in stocks you mean he asked or something of that sort i dont think it is likely he was not a gambler in even the mildest way and believe me i have known him long enough that i would be aware of it he spoke very gravely still leaning forward his hands locked together knuckles white hester had to pursue it explain to him what she meant not stocks or shares and i had never thought of gambling mr casbolt i was thinking of something which seemed at the time a certain business deal with no risk attached he gazed at her his eyes clouded waiting for her to continue like selling guns to the chinese she answered his face was unreadable his emotions too profound to measure it was at that moment that she believed he knew he had concealed it to protect alberton and possibly even more to protect judith she realized with a jolt how much this whole room spoke of his love for her and why it was special perhaps there would be no need to tell anyone they did not have to know any more than they did now mystery unanswered questions would be better than the truth the third chinese war she finished the thought if he invested in guns to sell to the chinese shipped them out and then they refused to pay because a war had broken out between us and them that was completely unforeseeable by anyone then he would have sustained a heavy loss wouldnt he his lips tightened but his eyes did not waver from hers yes is that not possible of course it is possible but what are you suggesting happened the night he was killed i still dont understand how a loss to the chinese would bring that about yes you do she said softly what if breeland were telling not only what he thought was the truth but what actually was the truth alberton could have taken philo traces money given in good faith then sold the guns to breeland using shearer to deliver them to the euston square station he would then have had two separate amounts of money which would come to an excellent profit more than sufficient to make up for the chinese losses he did not argue his face had a bruised almost beaten look then who killed him and why whoever represented the pirates she answered i suppose so or else there was a confrontation she added her voice lifting with hope in spite of herself perhaps he knew who they were and he may have said he would deal with them because he planned to exact some kind of justice for judiths family she chose the word justice deliberately instead of revenge he considered it it was apparent in his face that he was weighing all the possibilities he seemed to make a decision at last if your suggestion about daniel having lost private money on the chinese war is correct and that he did indeed sell the guns to breeland just as breeland said and kept philo traces money then when trace discovered that would he not be the one to exact revengeor from his point of view justice and the method of murder was a peculiarly american one remember do you not think it more likely that trace went to tooley street to face daniel about it and there was a furious quarrel and trace killed them whether he went there alone or not we may never know perhaps he had help he will have had allies here ready to move the guns when he bought them just as breeland had possibly one man could have made the guards tie each other at gunpoint and he could have tied the last himself i imagine he looked pale very strained trace seems a gentle man full of charm but he is a gun buyer for the confederate army fighting to preserve the way of life of the south and the right to keep slaves underneath the easy manner there is a very desperate and determined man whose people are at war for their own survival he hesitated biting his lip for a moment and there is another thing mrs monk the watch merrit said in court that she didnt know where she left it but she was lying we all know that she took it off in breelands rooms when she changed her clothes and forgot it someone went up there before we did the porter said so he was looking at her very shakily if that were trace then he could have taken it and dropped it in the yard to incriminate breeland what would be more natural hester felt her heart lurch and her skin break out in a hot prickly sweat of horror monk was alone with trace at the bottom of the thames trusting him his life dependent upon traces skill and his honor she shot to her feet her breath rasping william is diving she almost choked on the words he has only trace with him theyre looking for the barge that took the guns down she turned and stumbled towards the door ive got to get there ive got to warn him help him casbolt was beside her instantly ill go he said ill get to them as fast as i can i can get out on the river you stay here safely you couldnt help even if you were there ill tell the river police and he moved past her touching her gently on the arms as if to hold her there remain here he repeated youll be safe ill take the police and confront trace monk will be all right and before she could argue he went out of the door closing it behind him and she heard his footsteps fade away she moved back to the center of the room it really was beautiful there was a miniature portrait at one end of the pale marble mantel at first she had not realized who it was now she could see it was judith as a young woman perhaps twenty or so that would be when she had first met daniel alberton there was another picture no more than a sketch three young people climbing over the rocks on a beach judith laughing close to casbolt alberton a little distance away looking towards them it was obvious that judith and casbolt were the couple alberton the newcomer trace who was so much in love with judith was a newcomer too had his love for judith had anything to do with the reason he had killed alberton instead of merely rendering him unconscious was it judith herself as much as the guns monk was alone with him possibly this moment under the water dependent on him for skill for life but casbolt had gone to fetch lanyon and rescue him he would be there far before there where suddenly she froze like ice her limbs shaking casbolt had not asked her where monk was diving for the barge he knew everything that was true about alberton and the private investment in the chinese war was equally true about casbolt himself he could have lost money and all the glamour and generosity that money allowed this beautiful house and everything in it the admiration and respect that go with success and casbolt was used to success everything around him showed he had had it all his life except with judith she had given him no more than the love of a cousin and friend never passion he was too close she went over to the door and turned the handle but it was locked damnation that old manservant must have seen casbolt leave and locked it up behind him she rattled the handle and called out silence she tried shouting either he was deaf or he did not care perhaps casbolt had even told him to keep her there the watch casbolt would have seen it when he and monk had gone to breelands rooms looking for merrit he could easily have taken it then concealed it from monk and then dropped it himself when they were in the tooley street yard no wonder he had been so startled when he discovered breeland had given it to merrit she shook the door as violently as she could shouting for help it had no effect whatever she swung around and went to the french doors and opened them the balcony had wisteria climbing up it was it enough for a toehold it would have to be monks life depended on it gingerly disregarding the ruin of her skirts she clambered over the edge refusing to look down and began to slip and clutch and slip again until she could jump the last few feet to the grass landing in a heap she stood up brushed herself down and set off at a run to reach the street it had all been about money not guns and because of judith the american war had nothing to do with it at all the guns had been sold twice and paid for at least once and a half casbolt had employed shearer and someone else who had committed the actual murders carefully making sure he was accounted for that night then as monk had guessed the following night they had all met up down the river at bugsbys marshes to pay and be paid she ran out into the middle of the road waving her arms and shouting out her voice high and shrill verging on hysteria a carriage slowed to a stop to avoid striking her a hansom pulled up with a screech and a curse she called up to the driver i need to get to the bermondsey police station my husbands life depends on it please there was an elderly man already inside he looked momentarily alarmed then seeing the anguish in her face and every aspect of her body he acquiesced with startling generosity offering his hand to help her come in my dear driver as the lady wishes with all possible speed the coachman hesitated only long enough to make certain hester was safely inside then he swung the whip wide and high and urged the horses forward monk gasped then the hose fell loose air surged back around his face there was a touch on his shoulder and he tried to swing around but he was too slow achingly clumsy trace was beside him shaking his head holding the air hose smiling monk was ashamed of his thoughts of his panic but above all weak with relief he was grinning idiotically at trace through the filthy water and the thick glass he raised his hand in thanks trace waved back still shaking his head then pointing to the nearest of the piled crates monk took out his knife and together they prized the lid off there were guns there he could feel their outlines trace held up his lamp close only inches above them now it was possible to see that they were old models flintlocks mostly many of them useless without firing pins a far cry from the latest enfields breeland had purchased they were little more than sham laboriously they unpacked the top layer underneath was only bricks and ballast they tried a second case and a third they were all the same a few guns on top then just weight now at last monk understood almost all of it the real guns had never been at tooley street they had been stored somewhere else and taken to euston and loaded onto the freight wagons on the train before shearer even got there the night of the murders he had merely accepted breelands money where he had been the rest of that night they would probably never know these castoff guns laid over bricks and ballast had been stolen by the wretched men whose bodies floated in this ghastly cabin below the thames they had hidden the barge disguised among the wrecks on the shore of bugsbys marshes until the following night then floated it again to keep a rendezvous they thought was to deliver their goods and receive payment for murder instead along with shearer they had met their own deaths if he looked again he would find all the times fitted he put his hand on traces arm to signal they should leave they had seen all there was they moved slowly away and was it all simply greed a matter of selling the guns twice and thus having more money admittedly a vast amount more he lurched through the gloom fumbling his way awash in clouds of mud pulled by tides as the flow increased and they were trying to fight against it it seemed an endless journey his legs ached from the weight of his boots he was imprisoned behind the glass plate breathing pumped air he struggled to remember what they had told him to do use the outlet valve get more buoyancy that was better life and sunlight were only a few fathoms away but like another world trace was beside him moving more rapidly surerfooted he was waving his light guiding and urging monk forward then suddenly trace dropped his light monk saw his hands scrabble at where his throat would be beneath the helmet his face appeared contorted behind the glass as though he were gasping choking for air then his ropes tightened and he was dragged backwards and up disappearing into the murk leaving monk completely alone where was the boat he strained upwards looking for its shadow through the cloud of sand that swirled around him and did not see it then at last the steps were there he grasped them hauling himself up desperate to reach the top the light to get out of the cold clammy imprisoning suit it seemed to take forever he was leadenweighted there was no help from the ropes they had stopped pulling him he had to climb on his own the effort was overwhelming at last his head broke the surface and instinctively he gasped drawing in only more pumped air hands reached out to help him aboard and as the water drained off him and the attendant removed the front glass from his helmet he recognized robert casbolt then a shot rang out and another and another the attendant crumpled forward his chest scarlet and slid into the water the other two men lay sprawled beside the pumping equipment one partly on his back next to trace staring sightlessly upward a dark hole in his head the third doubled over the after thwart blood on his hair philo trace was slumped in the bottom of the boat eyes closed barely conscious his helmet beside him casbolt was holding a gun its muzzle pointed towards monk you found something down there that showed you it was trace he said with a sad little shake of his head but you werent quick enough for him he shot you he nearly got away with it too if your wife hadnt come to me with the truth and i raced here to try to rescue you then he would have succeeded tragically i was just too late he swallowed hard i really am sorry all i wanted was judith back again as it used to be and enough money to look after her that was all i ever wanted he raised the gun a little higher a shot rang out then another casbolt teetered for a moment and then overbalanced falling into the brown swelling tide across the water another boat was coming towards them lanyon in the bow a pistol in his hand beside him hester was ashenfaced the wind whipping her hair and blowing her torn and wet skirts the boat reached the barge and lanyon jumped over a look of horror filled his eyes as he saw the bodies it was a moment before he collected himself and came over to monk trace coughed and sat up a little straighter one of the other boats crew helping him hester scrambled from one boat to the other and ran forward falling on her knees beside monk saying his name over and over searching his face desperate to know he was all right her voice caught in her throat her breathing was wild and jerky he grinned at her and saw the tears of relief run down her cheeks he could understand so very easily that you could love one woman so much that no one else filled your heart or mind for a moment he could almost have been sorry for casbolt he had wanted judith all his life love could hurt it would ask for sacrifices greater than the imagination could foresee and it was not always returned or even understood but it did not excuse what he had done the end does not justify the means lanyon unfastened monks helmet and lifted it off hester put her arms around monks neck and buried her head on his shoulder clinging to him with all the strength she possessed until it hurt them both but she could not let go
