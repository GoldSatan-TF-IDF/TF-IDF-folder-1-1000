am grateful to you all barbara poelle my agent who employed the roadsideassistancephonecall and cocktailnapkin methods to develop my idea claudia gabel who took a chance on me and stephanie elliott my editor who worked tirelessly to help me shape the story writing this book reminded me of a time when i was doing my best to grow up and i would like to thank the friends who were there bobfirst and foremost mary julia sonja anne and maryann joellen and margaret and ellen and john and of course kristen and mike who are always there part one gypsum prologue june waking up hurt her head pounded and there was something in her eyes something sticky and warm that made it hard to see she blinked hard and her eyes cleared and she realized she was in a car not just any carher boyfriends car it was a pretty white celica and she brushed her hand against her lap feeling smooth silky fabric and rememberedit was prom night and they were driving out to boone lake and hed brought champagne a bottle on ice in a cooler she had slipped into the girls bathroom to fix her lip gloss and dab on a little extra perfume before they said goodbye to all their friends to the school gym decorated with streamers and helium balloons to the teachers who smiled and nodded at them because they were nice kids kids who got good grades and didnt make trouble except that her boyfriend had been drinking since they got tothe prom and he wasnt drunk no not drunk exactly but theyd been laughing as he took the turns on state road just a little too fast his hand slipping along the folds of her emerald green skirt and she hadnt stopped him because she liked having his hand there and she couldnt wait to kiss him some more and she liked going fast and reckless around the turns because it felt like the future felt like the day when they would drive away from gypsum and never come back but something had happened there were no lights in the car now not even the glow of the dashboard but the headlights were still on one shining straight into the woods to the right of the tree theyd hit the other beam twisted at a crazy angle it lit up his body lying on the ground ten feet from the car bent in a way that didnt look the least bit natural she started screaming yanked at the buckle of her seat belt and pushed against her doorit wouldnt open it was stuck or jammed and she crawled to the drivers seat her knees grinding on something sharpoh it was the windshield the windshield had shattered and she realized with horror that it was her boyfriends body that had broken it he never wore his seat belthed gone flying through the windshield across the hood of the ruined celica and landed on the hard ground broken and bleeding the driversside door opened easily and she stumbled out of the car tripping on the hem of her dress her beautiful strapless dress that no one knew had come from the st benedicts thrift shop in tipton that fit her like it had been made for her alone she bunched the skirt in her fists and ran to her boyfriend stumbling in her high heels before collapsing on her knees next to him his hand thrown out palmopen as though hed been reaching for something twitched and his lips moved his eyes were glassy and unfocused and she bent close to hear what he was trying to say hurts he managed licking his dry cracked lips no no please dont she murmured as she tugged his tuxedo jacket open as gently as she could what she saw made her throat close with fear it was too much there was too much damage the wound was open and black and glistening in the moonlight so much blood draining into the cold dry earth her hands flew to the wound her fingers working quickly to find the edges of the gash the words coming to her lips even before she realized shed made a decision but he spoke first i i love his voice was so weak she almost missed it but comprehension flickered in his beautiful brown eyes and he looked at her the way he did when he picked her up for school the way he had the first time shed passed in front of his locker last year the way he did when he searched the crowd for her face after every play at football games it was a look that saw her knew her really knew her the way her mother never would and her father whoever he was never chose to it was the look shed hung every dream every foolish hope on and as he blinked twice his eyes rolling up and going opaque she said the words she said the words the way her grandmother had taught her the syllables slipping like gossamer ribbons past her lips words shed chanted a hundred times on a hundred longago nights lit by sputtering candles and her grandmothers eyes bright with purpose a hundred times a hundred nights but tonight was the first time she prayed with all her soul that the words would work a twitch a sighshe broke off in the middle of a word whose sound was burned into her memory but whose meaning she didnt really know not the way her grandmother did her boyfriend twitched again and blinked and she stilled her fingers on his face dont leave me she whispered oh please dont leave her heart thudded hard in her chest because he wasnt gone hed almost died but shed brought him back shed said the words he was back she was bending to kiss him to throw her arms around him when his eyes blinked again and stayed open and there was nothing there vincent she breathed her heart going cold vincent please please vincent please but he said nothing his eyes were empty and his lips were still and the forest around them was dark and silent as a stone chapter now when i was eight the social workers finally made gram send me to school until then she told the authorities she was homeschooling me but after years of her never turning in her paperwork or showing up for the mandatory meetings they finally got fed up and told her i had to go to regular school gram gave in she knew when she was beat the first thing i noticed about the other kids was that they all looked like they could be on tv i called them cleans their clothes were new and ironed smooth their hair was shiny and combed their nails were trimmed and free of the black grime that id had under mine as long as i could remember no one had to tell me that compared with these other kids i was dirty that didnt stop the kids on the bus from reminding me by the end of my first humiliating ride to school id been called a bunch of names and accused of having cooties and lice and a witch for a grandmother it was the same thing on the ride home even though mr francheski pulled the bus over stood up and hollered was all you kids raised in barns wheres your manners be nice to this new girl when i got home that first day i was crying this was long before chub came to live with us and even though i knew better than to hope for anything from gram i dropped my book bag on the floor and ran to her favorite chair in front of the television where she was smoking and watching montel i blubbered out what had happened how the kids had said i was dirty and called me trash gram barely shrugged craning her neck to see over me to the television i guess you know where the soap is at she snapped and you can drag a brush through that hair you want now git now eight years later i had washed my hair the night before and blown it out with a hair dryer id saved up for i was wearing mascara and lip gloss that id bought with the money id made working for gram but everything else i had was secondhand a fact i was always conscious of as i walked the halls at gypsum high my clothes were never right my backpack was never right my shoes my notebooks my haircut wrong wrong wrongand everyone knew it gypsum might be a twostoplight town in the middle of nowhere missouri but there was a structure like anywhere else popular kids and inbetween kids and losers and people like me so far down there wasnt any point in bothering to classify us i had gym second period my locker was next to claire hewitts claire always smelled faintly of baby powder and motor oil and her hair frizzed in a cloud around her shoulders but as i spun my lock even she flinched away from me when youre near the bottom of the school social ladder like claire the only thing that can really hurt you is to be associated with someone even lower and there was no one lower than me not claire not emily engstrom with her limp and her lazy eye not even the morries no one at all i started changing into my gym clothes not bothering to say anything to her what would be the point hey hailey shawna rosen said appearing at my side without warning are those nurses shoes youre wearing the girls trailing her pressed in closer to me and stared down at my feet as claire slammed her locker door shut and slipped hastily away i could practically feel their excitement they were never happier than when they could remind some poor girl of the enormous distance between her pathetic existence and life at the top of the heap sometimes when shawna and her crew came after me i stood my ground i stared into their overly madeup eyes and telegraphed disdain but this wasnt one of those days i shuffled backward away from shawna and into the wide aisle between locker rows bumping into someone behind me tripping and nearly falling my hand shot out to steady myself against the wall of lockers and i was dismayed to see id run into a group of morries sorry i mumbled but they were gone before i finished speaking melting down another aisle without a word you almost never saw one of the morries alone they stuck together at the edge of the halls and the back of the classrooms and the cafeteria tables farthest from the food line in silent clumps of three or four like me they didnt participate in any sports or clubs or extracurricular activities the girls wore their hair long hanging in their faces the boys were so skinny their dirty frayed jeans hung off their hips they never volunteered in class if they were called on the girls would mumble so quietly that teachers soon gave up on them the boys were bolder surly and argumentative and sullen they didnt care at all about their grades they were called morries after morrin street the main road that ran through trashtown which is what everyone called the rundown neighborhood outside of gypsum half a mile past our house i dont know who started calling them that but if there had ever been a time when the trashtown kids mixed with the cleans at school that time was long gone shawna and her friends got bored with me and wandered off but i still had to hustle to finish getting dressed and i was late to gym class ms turnbull and mr coughlin didnt notice since they were busy dragging the vaulting horses and balance beam and parallel bars out of the closet we counted off and lined up behind the equipment no one looked very happy about it but my reasons were probably different from everyone elses it wasnt that i was bad at this stuff the problem was that i was goodtoo good i used to wonder if god had compensated for making me such a freak for my lack of friends and horrible home life with natural athletic ability if so id love to give it back i was fast and i was strong i could balance and throw and catch with amazing accuracy but instead of helping me fit in with the other kids it brought mewhat elsemore trouble in sixth grade my pe teacher noticed i had the thirdhighest mile time in the school he had me run sprints and then another mile eight times around the track clocking me with his stopwatch each time i passed him i could see his expression growing tighter and more excited when i finished he jogged over to where i was stretching outthey were constantly harping on us about stretching after exerciseand told me he wanted me to start training with the middleschool track team i was so surprised i couldnt come up with a response quick enough it had never occurred to me that anyone would ask me to join a club or a sport but of course i couldnt do it gram would never have allowed it she didnt even want me attending school if the social workers hadnt forced her to send me she never would have let me out of the house except to do errands once in grade school i received an invitation to a birthday party i ran home my heart pounding with excitement i knew that the girl didnt really want me there that her mother had made her invite every girl in the class but i didnt care i had never been to a birthday partygram didnt believe in celebrating birthdays so mine passed every year with no cake no presents no singingand i desperately wanted to go gram read the invitation her cracked lips moving as she sounded out the words and then she frowned and tore it into pieces no need for you to mix with them kids she said years later when my gym teacher insisted on sending home a permission slip for track gram wrote in big block letters across the section of the form where she was supposed to fill in my medical information hailey does not have my permishion to do any sport ever since then id been careful not to let anyone see me excel at anything but today would be tough i was in the vault line i stared at the old leathercovered thing wondering how i could feign clumsiness it would be hard if i just hit it headon it would hurt plenty but i wasnt sure i could stop myself from hurtling over it neatly how was it possible to act clumsy when you were sailing through the air your instincts taking over i managed but it took all my concentration i also forced myself to stumble off the balance beam and pretended to be too weak to support myself on the parallel bars when mr c glared at me and shook his head with disgust i felt a flash of pride if he only knew i was at the back of the vault line congratulating myself on escaping attention again when milla swanson reached the front milla was a morrie a thin girl with hair the color of mustard crusted to the lid of a jar she approached the vault with uncertain little steps head down as though she hoped the floor would swallow her before she got there i was only half watching as she got to the old wooden springboard but i saw her hesitateinstead of the stepbounceleap they drilled into us she wobbled and then almost tripped as she jumped toward the vault her hands scrambling on the leather padding that happened sometimes kids hit the vault wrong and sort of slid or fell off the other side usually in embarrassment with a bruise or friction mark it had happened to me once or twice when id purposely messed up but when milla struck the vault momentum carried her into the side and the impact sent her flying backward she fell on her back and i winced at the sound her shoulders made as they struck the springboardthat had to hurtbut then there was another thud and a reverberation i could feel through my feet on the hardwood gym floor as her head bounced off the edge of the springboard the two girls at the front of the line jumped back with little shrieks and then there was a second when no one moved as milla rolled gently to a stop at the base of the springboard her arms flopped out at her sides someone screamed ms turnbull and mr c came running but i got to milla first i didnt even know i was moving until i was crouched by her side reaching for her hand but ms turnbull slapped my hand out of the way dont touch she screamed even though mr c bent down and picked up the same hand id been reaching for i backed away but i didnt want to there was something inside me some roiling force that was making my fingers itch to touch milla that was sending the blood in my veins surging through my body with hot insistence i wantedno i neededto help to put my hands on milla even as i realized how bizarre my impulse was i had to fight not to act on it i stepped back into the silent crowd of kids making a circle around the vault ms turnbull and mr c talked in hushed voices feeling for a pulse and waving their hands in front of millas eyes which were open but unblinking ms turnbull put her face close to millas as though she was going to kiss her on the lips but then she turned away shes breathing we all heard her say shes unconscious mr c said in a panicked voice i saw the flyaway ends of the hair he combed over his freckled scalp trembling as he crabwalked away from millas body like she was on fire and i realized he had no idea what to do despite all the years hed taught us basic cpr im going to go call ms turnbull scrambled to her feet and sprinted toward the gym teachers office in the seconds it took for me to break away from the crowd of kids and rush to milla there was not a single sound in the gym no one spoke or coughed or called my name no one tried to stop me but when i picked up millas cool limp hand with its ragged fingernails and rough calluses i stopped hearing anything else anyway at least i heard nothing in the gym inside my head a strange whispered chorus started up a murmured chant that made no sense a second later my vision went i dont think i closed my eyes but everything else disappeared and it was as though i was looking into time going forward and backward at once like id jumped off a cliff and hovered somewhere in black empty space milla i whispered i felt my lips move so i was pretty sure id actually spoken and then i had that same bloodrushing feeling again like every bit of energy inside me was being pushed to my fingertips where it dissipated into millas body i let go of her hand and my fingers moved over her neck and face until they found her scalp which was hot and damp the hair plastered across a long bump that swelled under my touch the rushing sensation intensified and my own heart seemed to slow and falter and i started to sway but somehow i couldnt let go couldnt stop touching millas injured body just when i felt like i had exhausted the last of my will something shoved me hard and i fell onto my shoulder my vision and hearing returned instantly what the hell do you think youre doing ms turnbull screamed her face purple and her hand raised high as though she was about to hit me maybe she would have except that milla lying at her feet rolled over and threw up it turned out to be a good thing because ms turnbull forgot all about me milla sat up wiping her mouth against her sleeve hiccuped a couple of times and looked like she was going to cry but as ms turnbull shouted questions at her she answered them in a voice too low and mumbly for the rest of us to hear i retreated back into the crowd of kids a couple of them started to ask me what had happened but then the door to the gym burst open and mr macklin the vice principal came in and started yelling at all of us to go to the locker rooms and get dressed for next period that everything was under control and none of our concern i went with the rest of them but i couldnt help glancing back over my shoulder at milla who was trying to stand up even while ms turnbull pushed her back down to the floor milla was watching me the look she gave me was hard to understand fear battling contempt with barely a trace of gratitude the only emotion completely absent from her face was surprise chapter that afternoon i walked to the grocery store rather than riding the bus i needed to walk my mind was unsettled because of what had happened in gym i couldnt stop playing it over and over in my head the sound millas head made hitting the floor the way her skin felt under my fingers the blinding swirling feeling when i touched her when i got home carrying grocery bags the last mile rascal bounded across the yard to meet me he was part blue tick part beagle part something else gram got him from one of her customers after some stray got through a fence and impregnated a prize hound the customer was going to drown the whole litter but gram took a shine to rascal for a while anywayshe got tired of him when he wasnt a puppy anymore he nuzzled my hand then slipped in the door and went straight to chub who was sitting in front of an open kitchen cabinet playing with the pots and pans while the lids rolled around on the floor russo chub exclaimed clapping his hands and throwing his arms around rascal russo was one of chubs better words he called me hayee and he could say wah for water and chah for chair other things he had his own special names for sounds that had nothing to do with the actual word like shoshah for flower and bobbo for truck most of the time he didnt make words at all just hummed sounds rising and falling like a song only he could hear i knew that there was something wrong with chub i tried to figure it out by doing research on the internet but there were so many causes of developmental delays i didnt even know where to start i knew that eventually the social workers were going to demand he be tested but i wasnt anxious for that day to arrive because i was afraid theyd put him in some group home for kids like him and i didnt want chub to go ever besides rascal he was all i had to love when chub first came to live with us gram changed she spent time with him every day murmuring softly to him while i did the chores holding up toys and flash cards and trying to get him to talk those were good days if chub did something new if he crawled toward gram or reached for the shiny blocks she held up she felt like celebrating she turned off the tv and didnt drink as much and even complimented me on whatever i made for dinner but when he had a bad day when he wouldnt repeat the sounds she made or ate dirt from the yard gram seemed to sink a little lower in her chair as i got more and more attached to chub i realized that gram saw him as a project an experiment and when she couldnt fix what was wrong with him she lost interest within a couple of months she was back to spending her days in the chair watching tv and smoking she began drinking earlier in the day and barely paid any attention to chub but she kept cashing the checks the state sent for his care and he became mine to look after just like rascal had you git my cigarettes gram wheezed from her chair she asked me that every time i came home from the grocery as though id ever forget she went through a pack and a half a day i handed her the four packs of marlboro s along with the receipt and a few coins the cigarettes cost almost half what id spent at the grocery but i knew better than to suggest gram cut back the one and only time id tried shed slapped my face so fast and hard it took my breath away gram was mean but she was also weak and sick most of the time so i could stay out of her way if i tried she woke in the morning coughing up nasty stuff and spitting into the sink and she fell asleep drunk in her chair most nights she ordered me around like a servant i didnt mind the housework so muchi had kind of a thing about keeping the house clean and i would have done it even if she didnt tell me to and she paid me even if it was a fraction of minimum wage i unpacked the rest of the groceries and got to work making sloppy joes sautéing the frozen peppers and onions the ground beef stirring in the tomato sauceid done it a hundred times before but it still brought me a sense of calm especially with chub playing at my feet and rascal dozing in the corner of the kitchen where i kept a stack of old blankets for him to sleep on gram laughing at something tyra banks said on her show farted loudly and i thought for the thousandth time how glad i would be when chub and i left this house for good i knew you werent supposed to feel that way about your grandmother grandparents were supposed to be overprotective and hopelessly out of touch but you were still supposed to love them they were supposed to listen to your troubles and offer you advice from all their years of experience something weird happened at school today i said as i stirred the ketchup and onion soup mix into the skillet gram had never given me a single piece of advice worth remembering and as i started to speak i already knew it was a mistake but i had to talk to someone about milla milla swanson got hurt in gym uhhuh gram said without taking her eyes off the television i mean like hurt pretty bad i think she was unconscious for a while a head injury mmm but i well i think i might have um the thing is i just wanted to help you know because ms turnbull went to call and what did you say grams voice sharp and shrill startled me i set the spatula into the pan and looked at her to my surprise she was struggling to push herself out of her chair grunting with the effort just that milla fell off the vault and hit her head i went to help gram she seized my hands and pulled herself up her back cracking was there blood skin cut bone showing what did you do grams questions had an edge to them an urgency i had never heard from her and i wondered what she knew that i didnt it wasnt really any big deal just a bump you said she was unconscious there was excitement and accusation in her voice and her eyes were bright and intent well maybe for a minute and you touched her um yeah on her head well yes i mean first her hands and then i guess mostly on her hair what did you say what did i say its not a hard question hailey what did you say when you were touching her i didnti dont know i mean i might have said her name and something like dont worry or its going to be okay i really dont remember but as i answered gram something stirred in my mind there had been something a strange sound track whispered nonsense syllables barely audible over the rushing of my blood thats all you didnt say anything else no nothing else i was a little frightened by grams intensity especially when she closed one of her clawlike hands around my forearm her long fingernails digging into my flesh have you done this before hailey she asked leaning close enough to me that i could smell her breath a foul combination of cigarettes and rot i had to resist the urge to pull my arm away done what her burning eyes searched mine and i felt like she was looking for signs that i was telling the truthand for something else as well something i couldnt understand we stood that way for what seemed like a long time and i felt fear unwind inside my gut fear that fed on my confusion and the high emotions of the day i think you know gram finally hissed squeezing my arm with a strength that surprised me you know what you done all this time i been waitin on you i finally gave up and now you gone and done it i yanked away from her my heart pounding hard dinners going to burn i mumbled i picked up the spatula and stirred the mixture in the pan my face hot in the rising steam i could sense gram standing behind me watching she was scariest when she was thinking id rather have her hit me or yell at me any day than stare at me like that when i didnt have a clue what she was thinking about it dont change nothin she muttered so softly i almost didnt hear her by the time i dared to turn and look she had shuffled back to her chair and her eyes were half closed as she watched a lawncare commercial i made three plates of food and got chub set up at the table with a paper napkin and a glass of chocolate milk i took gram her plate and a fresh beer and set it on her tv tray she barely grunted a response but i kept an eye on her as chub and i ate dinner she ate carelessly bits of ground beef falling to the tray or the floor where rascal would find them later after a while she rubbed her napkin across her mouth and tossed it on top of her halfeaten dinner and i breathed easier hoping shed forgotten the confusing conversation she was expecting customers that night while i did the dishes she muttered to herself now and then raising her voice as though she was having a conversation with someone i was passing by her chair on my way to put chub down when she shot out her gnarled yellownailed hand and grabbed my wrist you know youre the future hailey she said lips twisted in a grin that revealed the gaps where shed lost teeth gram wouldnt see a dentist so her teeth were gray in places and several were missing youre the one whos gonna carry on the legacy i tugged my wrist back but gram held on tight shed said things like that before it was nothing new years ago id asked what she meant and gram had got all coy and winked and said id know soon enough it gave me the creeps the way she stared at me with her milky eyes bright almost hungrylooking you got titties now girl dont you gram said instinctively i covered my chest with my hand it was barely even true i was still skinny through the hips and it was clear id never be curvy the way jill kirsch and stephanie lee were the way that caught the boys attention as they walked down the school halls but it was horrifying to think that gram had noticed that she had been looking at me that way and your monthlies she continued wheezing and coughing into her sleeve i hadnt made an effort to keep it a secret when i got my period a few years earlier i knew what to do from eavesdropping on other girls at school and i stored my box of tampons in the bathroom medicine cabinet but hearing her say the words made my stomach roil and i jerked my hand so hard that her fingers bounced off the arm of her chair as i backed away gram only laughed a croaking sound that sent spit flying some of it landing on me i couldnt get away from her fast enough whatre you so shy for hailey gram wheezed your mama was sure hot for it want right in the head and couldnt talk sense but that didnt keep her from sashaying around like a cat in heat when she got grown that stopped me cold gram never talked about my mother all i knew about her was that she had died in childbirth and that she wasnt right in the head i thought maybe that last part was why gram wouldnt talk about her some sort of grief that had got all twisted up into ugliness and silencegram wouldnt even tell me her name and there were no pictures of her in the house whatwhat i stammered and grams lips curved up in smug satisfaction she had me i hated her for it but she had me oh so now you got time to talk to me gram said yes indeed you dont need to know anything about your mom othern she was ripe as an august peach and lookin to get picked got knocked up with you soons the fellas come around sniffin at her that one did who i started and then i licked my dry lips hating myself for the question i was about to ask id asked often enough before to know that she would never tell who was my father grams laughter turned into a coughing fit but the tears she wiped from her rheumy eyes were full of mean amusement that she began then gasped her way through another round of coughs thats quite the question aint it could be anyone i had learned a few things about gram living with her for sixteen years i didnt miss the narrowing of her eyes the way she drew her lips in gram was lying to me only i didnt know why what was she hiding sometimes it seemed like we werent even related to each othershe was so frail as though her body was just waiting to die and i had never been sick a day in my life but she also knew me better in some ways than i knew myself i hated that i couldnt help thinking of the conversation earlier the way shed asked all those questions about milla as though she had some secret knowledge about what had happened one thing was sure though nothing would make gram tell me anything she wanted to keep secret it was pointless to keep talking to her i tried to walk away but gram stopped me whats your hurry hailey she said she stubbed out her cigarette in the ashtray id already emptied twice that day and held out her arms we got callers here git me up only then did i hear the sound of a car in the yard i did as she asked seizing her hands and pulling harder than necessary so gram stumbled as she stood i let her lean on me as she cracked her knuckles and worked her neck one way and the other when i was sure she wouldnt fall i took chub to get ready for bed ordinarily id bathe him but grams callers were likely to start drinking beer and need the toilet before long i brushed chubs teeth with a softbristled brush and the strawberryflavored kids toothpaste id splurged on i wiped him down with a clean cloth and changed his pullup he was four way too old to still be in diapers id tried everything i could think of to get him to use the toilet but nothing worked as i wiped down the sink he wrapped his arms around my thighs and said loo hayee he said this from time to time and i was convinced it was i love you hailey even if i didnt have any way to prove it i knelt down on the floor and hugged him breathing his sweet baby scent me and you i whispered always in two more years id be eighteen id graduate from high school and the social services people would stop coming around checking on me and if we were lucky wed go so far away that theyd never be able to find chub on the other side of the door i heard voices and i recognized the loudest dunston acey not good i tried to slip quietly to my room but before i reached the door his whiskeyrough voice came after me hailey come out here sos i can see you i froze trying to decide if i could pretend i hadnt heard him but grams voice followed git the boy put down quick girl we got company i did as they said once id sung to chub and rubbed his back and his breathing had gone deep and even with sleep i couldnt put it off any longer theyd only come into the room and turn on the lights and wake chub up nothing stopped gram and her customers when they were partying i walked into the kitchen and said hello with as little enthusiasm as possible three pairs of eyes regarded megram and dun and another man who was standing in the shadows in the far corner when he stepped into the light i saw with a sinking heart that it was rattler sikes of all the sorry and mean and nogood men who came through our house rattler was the worst he was one of the only ones who didnt do drugs or as far as i knew drink alcohol but once in a while hed show up in the company of some of the others and stand in the corner of the room watching and saying little everyone knew the stories about him rattler was one of the few people in trashtown who got talked about by the rest of gypsum probably because the sheriff had been trying to nail him for years only he never managed to make any charges stick they said rattler did things to women terrible things things that left them messed up on the outside and the inside alike it was only trashtown women that he went after and maybe that was part of why the sheriffs department couldnt bring him down as long as trouble stayed inside the borders of trashtown gypsum people didnt care much about what went on there they said that women would go out with rattlerit was hard to imagine they went willinglyand then theyd be found wandering back into town in the early hours of the morning sometimes barefoot sometimes nearly naked always unwilling or unable to talk about what had happened none of them ever wanted to press charges but those women were never the same again my youre looking fine today dun said raising a bottle in my direction before taking a long drink gram had a policy that anything a customer drank or smoked in the house was freefor the price of a few beers and some weed she kept them entertained and happy and if she tacked on a premium for the harder stuff they never complained i got to git down to the basement gram said sighing and fixing a look on me i knew what she wantedfor me to go down and get whatever it was that dun was buying tonight but that was the one thing she couldnt make me do i refused to get involved with her dealing i wouldnt touch the pill bottles wouldnt read the labels wouldnt help her sort and bag the weed she got from a guy who drove it up from the ozarks once a month i wouldnt do any of it and whenever she asked i reminded her that all i had to do was make one phone call and she was done of course i was bluffing i would never do anything to bring the authorities in because that would mean that chub and i would be split up gram was stupid about some things and this most of all she should have known what chub meant to me instead she got up sighing and snorting and shuffled off to the basement stairs it would take her a while holding on to the handrail and taking the steps one at a time before she was back with their stuff i saw the pile of wadded cash in the middle of the table it would stay there until dun checked his purchases and slid them in his pockets and then gram would stuff the money into her purse on the counter that was how it was always done i took the only empty chair and waited gram expected me to make small talk but that didnt mean i had to come up with sparkling conversation nice shirt dun said aint that a purty shirt rattler i felt myself blush my shirt was nothing special a plain green scoopneck top id bought secondhand for fifty cents but it was old and getting a little tight across my chest after that dun asked me about school and my grades and what i was watching on tv these days he didnt seem to mind that i gave him the shortest possible answers now and then he asked rattler what he thought but mostly he seemed content to do all the talking and drink his beer popping the top off a fresh bottle when he finished one after what seemed like ages gram came clumping back up the stairs she had two brown paper bags clutched in her hands their tops folded down she set them on the table in front of dun and the mood in the room changed no one was looking at me anymore everyones eyes were on the bags as dun unrolled the paper and peered inside after a second he reached in and pulled out the plastic bottles he examined the labels squinting he looked like he wanted to eat them plastic caps and all when he was done checking the bottles he stuffed them in a big flap pocket of his plaid shirt he crumpled the brown bags and tossed them toward the trash can in the corner where they bounced off the edge and landed on the floor i waited what i thought was a safe amount of time and then got up and slid my chair in well good night i said trying to sound cheerful as i passed by dun he reached out and grabbed the waistband of my jeans off to bed already sweetheart he drawled and i caught a whiff of his tobaccostinking breath you need some company aw dun gram cackled and slapped him playfully on the shoulder dont be pestering the child she aint no child no more dun said winking at rattler aint that right you know shes got to get her schooling gram sounded serious now her voice scolding looks to me like shes got herself plenty of schooling on on how to be smokin hot dun cracked up at his own stupid joke not even trying to hide the fact that he was staring right at my chest i jerked away from him hard gram laughed along with him as i raced to my room and slammed the door chapter it was their anniversary an entire year since their first official date that was why she was going through his things other women did that didnt they snooped around their boyfriends apartments to find the velvet boxes containing bracelets and earrings glittering tokens of love it was so hard to know what normal was even though she worked at it all the time she shopped where other women shopped dressed as well as any of them she got her hair cut at a salon where they brought you champagne while you waited why not she had plenty of money now that hadnt always been the case it took six years to put herself through college working fulltime and weekends too six years of living in a sleepdeprived caffeinefueled haze before she finally graduated six more years of research jobs after that in labs all over the city taking classes whenever she could to supplement what she learned on the job fulltime graduate school was out of the question when she was still paying off her debtsthe lab jobs didnt pay enough for her to save much money even though she kept her expenses down by living in a tiny apartment in a bad part of town those were lonely years even if she had time to date the memory of her first love stayed in her mind every waking moment her heart did not heal yes it scabbed over the agony dulled to a low ache that was as much a part of her as breathing but she never forgot she wanted to atone her life became an effort to make up for that early mistake if she could just find a way to use her gift to help peoplebut the scientific community was not interested in the work she wanted to do until the day she met him of course he was only her boss for the first couple of years hed heard about herheard about her reputation for hard work and reliable results but more important hed heard about the research she conducted on her own after hours and the thing she could do that science could not yet explain she had told almost no one about that part and stillsomehowhe found out and offered to pay her three times her salary to come work for him and now in his laboratory she worked the longest hours of all but that didnt matter did it because they were together and they shared a vision a dream they were going to change the world that was what she told herself every morning as she steeled herself to go through the doors of the building where the lab was located it was unmarked with no sign out front nothing to indicate the expensive equipment inside the experts he had hired from around the world but he was disciplined that wayhe didnt flaunt it but he insisted on the best and he said she was the best without her he often reminded her their work would be in vain he said that studying her was a privilege so why had it become so hard to return his affection his touch lately it was her fault because relationships were so much harder for her than for other women she tried to push the thought away as she finished looking in the drawers of his dresser and considered the sleek ebony desk in the study of his beautiful penthouse apartment with its view of lake michigan because of what had happened to her all those years ago maybe it was inevitable that it would take her so long to love again and she did love him she reminded herself as she shifted objects around on the desk careful not to disturb the placement of the papers and pens and sticky notes and binder clips the desk was the only messy thing in his life this private work space in his home the rest of itthe sterile lab the gleaming kitchen with its stainless steel appliances the pressed shirts and suits hanging in the closetswas so neat and orderly it was as though no real human lived there she suppressed a little shiver that was not the way she ought to be thinking about her beloved especially since there was a chancehed hinted around enough hadnt hemore than achance a likelihood that he was going to propose tonight that somewhere in this apartment was the ring he would slip on her finger a beautiful ring because he insisted on the best of everything and then they would be united in marriage in addition to their passion for their work and she would be the happiest woman in the world so why was she feeling sick inside nervesthat was all it was she chastised herself quieting the resistant voice inside she just had to see the ring because seeing it would confirm what she suspected and if she confirmed that suspicion she could prepare for it when he got down on one knee later tonight shed be ready with the proper display of delight and surprise and hed never know that inside her a gnawing fear was growing a certainty that something was wrong wrong wrong she had to master that fear to hide it away where no one would ever see it if she ever wanted to live normally to marry to have children perhaps she would never find anyone more accomplished than her boyfriend he was wealthy and intelligent and powerful and he had chosen her this was real love mature love and if she found herself thinking about that other love it was only because of the terrible way it had ended shed fallen hard the very first time but what had felt like love had probably just been infatuation real love was what she had now the product of shared interests and a cautious escalation of intimacy over time her beloved had been patient as their working relationship slowly grew into something more so she would not allow the doubts in not today today was special the day every woman dreamed of right as she opened the file drawers next to the desk she forced the nagging fears back to the far corners of her mind so he had recently made a few errors that werent like him everyoneeven the most brilliant peoplegot distracted the inconsistencies in the lab reports shed mistakenly read the test models and control populations that didnt look anything like what they had discussed even the files that contained references to funding sources shed never heard aboutall of that could easily be explained she had only a bachelors degree after all everyone else in the laball the unfriendly staff who showed up without introduction and dove into the work without ever sharing any personal informationthey were so far ahead of her that she barely understood what they were doing she riffled through the files in the last drawer suddenly she stopped her heart skipping as she read and then read again the files label written neatly in his handwriting her name her real name the one no one had used in years behind her she heard the door open and the click of her boyfriends italian shoes on the polished wood floors she didnt move couldnt move she held the file in her hands a file thick with papers and stared at the name shed thought she buried forever ah his deep cultured voice came from behind her he didnt sound angry so much as amused looking through my private files are you my darling the germ of doubt inside her grew and she began to shake but still she held on to the file as she slowly turned to face him he offered his hand without thinking she took it and allowed herself to be guided to the leather sofa where they sat together knees touching his hands were warm and even though the voice in her mind screamed in horror and fear the part of herself that she had trained so carefully to be like everyone else like normal women did not pull away we have a lot to talk about he said in a way your timing is excellent see i recently made some discoveries about you yes you dont look so surprised darling you know i have always found you fascinating who could blame me for wanting to find out everything i possibly could about the woman i love and now i can share it all with you oh yes because i found out something that you dont even know about yourself something wonderful i think something exciting that will mean great things for both of us and for our work and then he called her by her real name and the careful shell shed built up through the years shattered into a million jagged shards and she realized that she didnt really know this man at all chapter i didnt sleep well that night and it took longer than usual to get ready in the morning because someone had spilled a beer on the kitchen floor i didnt want chub sitting in it so i scrubbed the floor clean before i left i fixed him toast and dressed him in a cute pair of overalls then got him set up with his stacking blocks i fed rascal and put him out in the yard for the day maybe it was because i was so tired but i didnt see the car across the street until the bus pulled up it was cold for april and i was squinting against the morning sun and blowing clouds of breath on the chilly air when i heard the bus coming and looked up ten yards down the road on the opposite side was a dark gray sedan with tinted windows our house was the only one on this stretch of road between gypsum and trashtown and anyone who came to see us just drove into the yard no one ever parked on the road like that i boarded the bus then slid in next to coby poindexter leaning across him so i could look out at the sedan the driversside window was cracked a few inches but i couldnt see inside as the bus pulled back into the street i twisted around and tried to see the license plate but all i could make out was a lexus emblem could it be the cops undercover watching our house because of grams dealing but cops wouldnt drive a lexus would they hey coby said hows things in whitetrash land i ignored him today for some reason i felt something inside me slipping it wasnt that i was feeling any braver almost the oppositelike i was falling apart at the edges the way dun had treated me the night before the mess in the kitchen this morning the strange car across from our house it was all too much it didnt leave me enough energy to keep up the mask of indifference i worked so hard at shut up coby i muttered it wasnt much of a comeback but he seemed surprised i could sense him staring at me the rest of the way to school but i didnt pay any attention when we pulled up in front of the school i bolted out the door before anyone else could talk to me and went looking for milla she wasnt hard to find she was standing near the secondfloor water fountain with two other morrie girls who could have been sisters their blond hair in greasy clumps around hollowcheeked faces with sharp jutting chins i thought one was named jeanshed been in a few of my classes over the years excuse me i said louder than i intended i was nervous i wanted to talk to milla about what happened but the other girls closed ranks in front of her as though theyd practiced the move she would have escaped down the hall except she tripped over her backpack and dropped the book she was holding it fell to the floor pages fluttering open i reached down to pick up the book just as she did and bumped my forehead against her shoulder she yanked herself away from me with such force that i left the book on the floor ever since my first week of school when i sought them out at recess and lunch i had found myself drawn to the morries maybe it was just that we were equally pathetic all of us badly dressed and ragged and friendless but it felt like something more i feltand maybe this was no more than an orphaned childs longing for familylike we were related somehow like i was one of them id asked gram about it long ago and shed burst out in one of her breathrattling laughs spittle forming at the corners of her mouth you aint no morrie she said youre way bettern any morrie girl dont you forget it now i must have looked unconvinced because she reached out her nicotinestained thumb and forefinger and pinched the tender skin on the inside of my arm she could pinch surprisingly hard making hot tears jump to my eyes but i didnt make a sound those morrie boys now theyre a whole nother matter she added but thats for later and dont you pay them no mind ill let you know when thats what there were no boys around now i looked into millas watery eyes and edged closer almost enjoying the way she shrank from me what happened yesterday i demanded i dont know what youre talking about you were unconscious i saw i felt it i didnt say that her hands her forehead beneath my fingers felt worse than unconscious they felt wrong empty dangerous broken hurt didnt you come to my house once i asked in a voice that was little more than a whisper last year with that guy you know the one with the tattoos it wasnt much of a clue since many of grams customers had tattoos but the man i was thinking of had blue crosses circling his neck disappearing into his stringy gray ponytail i could see in millas eyes id hit a nerve wasnt me she mumbled lips barely moving as she spoke yes it was yes it was no im i was why are you so scared of me i demanded leaning close to her face the bell rang loud over our heads and i could see the kids cleans and morries alike scattering off to class but i didnt move milla shook her head eyes open so wide i could see the pale pink veins in the white parts i aint scared of you she tried to slip away to the side but i put out my arm and blocked her my hand flat against the wall anger traced whitehot trails along my nerves i itched to hit milla i could feel my palm tingle where i imagined smacking it against her bloodless cheek but when she dodged in the other direction i let her go she backed away with little shuffling steps her book forgotten on the floor i aint scared she said again and i knew she was about to turn and sprint down the hall to sit in the back of some class with the other morries i aint scared she said one final time giving me a look that was part triumph and part impossibly sad but maybe you oughta be i couldnt pay attention the rest of the day i had done something to milla that had fixed her i wasnt sure what or how and my mind danced around the memory of yesterday trying to make sense of it there had been a second when my fingers pressed against her damp stringy hair when it felt as though something had shifted inside me as though some hidden piece had broken free and now rode the currents of my bloodstream electrified by my heartbeat and changing me from the inside out i wasnt at all sure i liked the feeling being me wasnt exactly paradise but i wasnt sure i was ready to change either i thought of gram and the brief time when shed turned almost human when we first got chub she had changedor at least i thought she had for a while she was almost like a real parent asking me about my day about what i learned at school she wasnt great at itshe didnt listen to my answers and i still had to do most of the chores but when i watched her working with chub there was a light in her eyes and that was more than id seen in her before or since and now she was worse than ever was that what was in store for me would i end up like her bitter and mean id tried to help millai hadnt planned it and i didnt understand it but i had tried and now i wanted to make a connection with her no the connection was already therei just wanted her to acknowledge it and instead shed made it even clearer that she wanted nothing to do with me i was still lost in my thoughts when i walked to the drugstore after school and i left without the one thing i really needed chubs baby shampoo i turned around after a couple of blocks and headed back when i had almost reached the store i saw something that made my heart lurch the car that had been parked outside our house that morning was pulling into a parking space two men got out of the car they were medium height with short hair wearing sunglasses and dark jackets they moved fast and looked strong and muscular under their clothes and they didnt smile or talk they could be anybody i told myselfit was probably just a coincidence that id seen them twice they could have pulled over in front of our house to check a map or to pee behind a tree or something and as for going into the drugstore everyone in town shopped there on the other hand i had never seen them before i knew pretty much everyone in gypsum by sight and these guys definitely didnt look local if they were cops they werent from gypsum but if someone had caught on that gram was dealing drugs maybe the local cops had called in some other agency likei racked my brain trying to remember what wed learned in civics there was the bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives but was dealing drugs a federal crime and who would have turned gram in one of her customers maybe theyd given up information in exchange for a better deal if theyd been arrested for possession or something i knew the penalties for dealing were fierce way more serious than just getting caught with stuff but if they already suspected gram why didnt they just get a warrant and come to the house maybe that was what they were doing nowtrying to get enough evidence to justify a warrant well they wouldnt get it from talking to mr hsiaoall id bought today was a box of trash bags eyedrops for gram and a threepack of soap i needed to find out more i waited until the men entered the shop then walked quickly to the car trying to look casual i peered through the windshield there was nothing inside but a styrofoam coffee cup in the cup holder i went back into the shop slipping into the aisle farthest from the cash register i studied the shaving cream and razors and strained to hear what the two men were saying to mr hsiao come in regularly a deep voice with a slightly flat accent no like i told you shes as like to come in one day as the next these kids they dont stick to a schedule you know you mind telling me what this is about an incident at her school a new voice said smoothly cant give the details at this point we appreciate your cooperation and you keeping it under wraps and you said you were from thats right mr hsiao find out who they are i telegraphed silently state services the first voice said here my identification there was silence for a moment then mr hsiao spoke his voice only a little less skeptical well ive told you what i can you could probably catch up with the girl talk to her yourself if you like a moment later they were striding back out of the store i spotted the tops of their heads going by and ducked i counted to two hundred before leaving the store careful not to let mr hsiao see me i wasnt convinced the men were from any state agency they were too anonymous for one thing plus mr hsiao didnt sound like he thought much of whatever id they showed him could they be some sort of competition drug dealers from the next town over maybe all the way from kansas city or had gram got into something even worse did she owe money had she stolen something valuable cheated someone important the car was gone but for all i knew it was on its way to our house i needed to get home but there were stretches of the road with no houses along them no one to notice if something happened to me but i had no idea what these men would want with me i didnt care much what happened to gram but i couldnt let anything happen to chub as i hesitated torn between running home and trying to keep the men from seeing me sawyer wesson came around a corner walking with milla sawyer was a morrie but he wasnt like the others he was quiet and careful and kept himself clean wed never spoken but id noticed him watching me a few times during lunch or in school assemblies milla saw me first and her mouth tightened into a hard line she put a hand on sawyers arm but he was in the middle of saying something to her as he tossed his cigarette to the ground and stepped on it sawyer i called panic made me bold sawyer could you please walk me home only after the words were out did i realize how they sounded i was frightened that was all and i just wanted some company in case anything bad happened sawyer was tall and broadshouldered with narrow eyes and black hair that reached almost to his shoulders if you didnt know him it would be easy to be intimidated by him he stopped and regarded me he looked surprised then wary his eyes clouding with doubt i meani didnt i started to explain but what could i say that i thought i was being pursued by government agents or members of the mob or or i had no idea who thatd be okay sawyer said and then i saw something id never seen before his smile it was surprising how it changed his face making him look almost sweet you were comin to the burger king with me or did you forget that milla spat she refused to look at me i never said whynt you just go on with her then seein as youre so forgetfuln all you probly forgot who she is if it was a bluff it wasnt much of one since sawyer walked over to me without a backward glance i had no idea what milla meant by who she is was she referring to what had happened in gym to the fact that i was an outcast whatever she meant sawyer either didnt know or didnt care and i felt smug satisfaction as milla stalked off the way theyd come defeated we walked half a block before i managed to think of something to say and then at the very same moment sawyer started to talk too so how are what do you and then we were both laughing and saying you first no you sawyer kicked at a stone and it went flying across the road hitting a tree trunk deadon and i thought about how it was for me in gym class did you ever want to play sports i asked sawyer didnt answer for a moment sometimes i thought im pretty good you know at throwing i thought maybe baseball but he didnt need to finish i didnt know what his home life was like but it was safe to assume it had certain things in common with mine i changed the subject and we talked about classes and teachers i was surprised to learn that he was considering trying to get into ap american history hed be the first morrie id ever heard of to get into an advanced placement class he asked me what i liked to do after school and i told him about chub and sawyer listened and nodded and even laughed when i told him the way chub followed rascal around the yard like he thought he was part dog hey he said when my house came into view i just want to say im really sorry about you know milla and what she said she dont mean anything by it i doubted that was truewhatever milla thought about me it seemed like she felt it strongly i tried to think of a way to ask about her and the morries in general without offending sawyer the way hed agreed to walk with me so readily the way he looked at me at school when he didnt think id noticei was pretty sure he had a crush on me and it felt good id never been wanted by a boy before and i didnt want to mess it up by making him uncomfortable i always wondered why milla and i were never friends i said carefully i was trying to figure out what to say next when a car pulled up behind us and gunned its engine we scrambled off the shoulder into the weedy edge of the woods when i turned around to look i saw that it wasnt a car at all but a battered old green ford pickup the driver rolled the window down and hung out an arm it was rattler sikes cold fear shot through my body as rattler leaned out the window and looked straight at me but when he spoke it was directed at sawyer git on in the truck boy he said and i could see that his teeth were surprisingly white and straight his eyes were a brown so dark they were almost black flinty and sparking some strong emotion maybe curiosity maybe rage i dontshe asked me to sawyer started his gaze darting between me and rattler i didnt ask you a question did i boy rattler said his tone stayed even but there was a threat in it a shadow of violence that reached into me and curled around my heart no sawyer mumbled his chin lowered aint gonna tell you agin sawyer glanced at mehe didnt meet my eyes just gave me a quick view of his face which was cast in misery and it seemed to me apology he trudged around to the passenger side and got in inside the cab he stared straight ahead rattler continued to watch me as uncomfortable as it was to be the focus of his attention i didnt look away there was something in the way he looked at me something that kept me from running rattlers voice lowered even further a raw whisper you take care hear hailey girl the truck pulled away slowly the tires crunching gravel and spitting up loose rocks and dead leaves rattlers eyes tracked me and just when it seemed like he would run off the road he smacked the side of the cab with the flat of his hand and turned the wheel back straight on the road he sped up and i smelled the exhaust from the hanging corroded tailpipe i walked toward the house and rascal came bounding across the yard ears flying happy to see mebut rattlers voice stayed in my head so low i thought again that most people wouldnt even be able to hear it but i could hear i could hear him just fine chapter she almost didnt stop outside of town but at the last second she took the exit that led past the showme trading post before heading out to state road shed left first thing in the morning after the longest night of her life lying in the dark and replaying that horrible scene over and over the things she had learned about her boyfriendand the one surprise hed saved for last so much would have been different if she had only known it didnt help anything to think about what might have been but deep in the night when the silence was most profound and the dark reached all the way into her soul it was hard to resist today she would start to put things right the showme trading post was even more rundown than she remembered a ramshackle cinderblock building with gaudy displays in dirty windows hardly the place to buy someone a gift but she was worried that the girl who would never have heard about her either might be skittish maybe a small token a gesture to show that she wanted to help could smooth things over for their first meeting there was nothing on the shelves that felt right though she considered a cardboard stand displaying fruitflavored lip gloss a cheaplooking bead bracelet kit a rack of fashion magazines before settling on a generic mp player with earbuds she could buy the girl something nicer lateronce they were together once she had proved that her intentions were good as she slipped the player off its hook on a pegboard rack near the back of the store the door jangled and two men walked in caps pulled low she shrank back slipping into the shadow of a tall refrigerator that held soft drinks and beer she had seen those men before at the lab they sometimes came to meet with her boyfriend in private they didnt look like scientistsnot with their genericlooking dark jackets that did not entirely conceal the holsters underneath their visits were brief and afterward her boyfriend usually grew distant for a day or two saying little staying in his office late and monitoring the highres displays in his office that were tilted so that only he could see them one of the men talked to the cashier showing her something small and flat the cashier a brassyhaired woman with glasses on a chain around her neck answered in a voice loud enough to hear in the back of the store no dont blieve so she said indifferently more murmuring as the man gestured insistently while hiscompanion glanced around she edged back into the corner between the refrigerator and the wall and flattened her body into the small space so that she couldnt be seen from the front of the store no never the cashier repeated but then again i aint from town i live twenty miles down to casey so i wouldnt probably know her now would i the man tucked the photo awaybecause that was what it had to be wasnt it a photo of the girland slid a bill onto the countertop glass then flipped a card on top of the money call if you remember anything later he said in a louder voice her heart pounded as she watched the two men turn and make their way out of the store so he hadnt waited then he might have believed the story she gave him last night her terrified attempt to convince him that finding out about the girl meant nothing more to her than good news for the research he might have believed her lies but it hadnt stopped him from sending the men down to gypsum clearly he was determined to move forward immediately she had to stop him but she couldnt just go bursting into the house and demand that the girl leave with hernot when there was no telling what the old lady had told her nofirst she had to build trust she looked at the cheap trinket in her hand and slowly slid it back on the hook a gift wouldnt help bribery wouldnt help neither would demanding or threatening or pleading or begging she poured a cup of stale coffee with shaking hands she paidthe cashier who barely looked at her as she counted out the change then stood in the parking lot drinking the bitter liquid before she got back into her car and drove the oncefamiliar streets to the house where she had grown up a place she had hoped never to see again she had a nearimpossible task ahead of her and the only weapon she had was the truth chapter after rattler drove away i stood outside for a minute and waited for my heartbeat to slow down to normal before i went into the house i said hello to gram and she grunted in my direction judge judy was blaring from the television chub was on his stomach scribbling with a fat crayon in a coloring book when he saw me he jumped up and ran over and threw his arms around my legs like he did every day hollering hayee i usually loved that moment it was the best thing in my day getting home and making sure that chub was safe and knowing that there was one person in my life who was always happy to see me today though it was hard for me to return his hug without letting him see how shook up i was i got chub a snack and drank a glass of milk and then i settled in with my homework though it was almost impossible to concentrate i kept thinking about the men in the car and milla and sawyer and rattler afternoon faded into evening and i fixed dinner and gave chub his bath i toweled him off and dressed him in his pajamas but it was a little early for him to go to sleep i knew i ought to read to him but i was still feeling upset and distracted so i did something to help me calm down i visited the words id found them a few years ago carved with care into the wall of the closet in the bedroom i shared with chub you couldnt see them unless you actually went inside the closet and since gram used to keep it jammed full of junk i didnt find them until i got old enough to organize the closet myself i had taken everything out and was washing the walls one saturday when i found the words near the bottom of the wall carved into the old wood paneling clover prairie those two words sparked something inside me almost like recognition i wondered what they meanti imagined a field full of clover swaying gently in the breeze the sun shining brightly but even as i pictured the scene i knew it wasnt right i traced the words with my finger someone had taken care maybe using a penknife or a sharp screwdriver going over the blocky letters until they were grooved deeply into the wood i wasnt the first person to trace them i could tell the edges were smooth without splinters or rough edges i returned to the words almost every week something happened when i touched them some small peace entered me calming my anxiety and my fears i let my fingertips drift down the wall until they rested on the baseboard but something wasnt right the piece of baseboard extending only two feet or so along the left wall of the closet was loose it separated slightly from the wall wobbling under my fingers i tried to shove it back feeling for the nail that had popped out thinking id get a hammer and fix it but there was no loose nail instead the bottom came away from the wall and i realized that it wasnt nailed at all only kept in place by the tension between the other walls in fact this board wasnt mitered like the others i tugged at it and it came away in my hands as i felt along the edge i realized id come upon a hiding place the paneling had been cut away in the middle making a little hideyhole about a foot long and a few inches deep how had i never noticed this before i reached cautiously inside the hole and touched something and the strange sensation of familiarity got stronger i knelt down and shined the flashlight into the tiny space with my cheek pressed to the floor i could see that there was a bundle wrapped in cloth and papers rolled and tied with a ribbon i took everything out and spread it on the floor in the room where the light was better chub had crawled up on my bed and was turning the pages of his favorite board book humming and running his fingers over the pictures he could entertain himself that way for hours i picked up a tarnished metal frame containing a picture of a young smiling blackhaired woman it was one of those photos from a long time ago when they first started printing pictures in color the colors were all too bright the yellow of her shirt the red of her lips her hair was done in an oldfashioned style curled close to her face but her skin was smooth and unlined and her eyes sparkled as though she had just heard something funny i turned the frame over and there was handwriting on the back mary she didnt look like anyone i had ever met but at the same time she was somehow familiar i set the frame down and unfolded a piece of fabric that had gone yellow with age inside a rectangle of white lace had been carefully rolled around a necklace hanging from a silver chain was a multifaceted red stone surrounded by fancy silver scrollwork it was beautiful and it looked very old the rolled pages were delicate made of a yellowed paper that felt rough to the touch and covered with rows of flourishy writing the handwriting was faded and it looked like it had been written with a brush or a fountain pen i couldnt read all the wordsthere were womens names and dates on one side and on the other side were a few lines of writing in some language that wasnt english i studied the names they started with lucy hester tarbell and the year i read through the names sarah beatrice tarbell rita joan tarbell helen davis tarbell when i got to the end i sucked in my breath at the final name alice eugenie tarbell i stared at grams name until i realized what was wrong if these were birth dates it meant that she was fortynine years old but that was impossible gram was bent and arthritic and had trouble breathing and getting out of a chair true shed never told me her age but id always assumed she was eighty or something as old as i could imagine could the date be something else a marriage date maybe or i racked my brain for possibilities maybe something religious gram never went to church never even mentioned god but i had learned in school that families sometimes recorded names births and deaths and marriages things like that in a family biblecould i have stumbled on pages torn from my family bible i turned the pages over and tried to read the lines of writing tá mé mol seo draíocht na anam an corp cara ár comhoibrí i had barely read the first two lines when i found that my lips moved with ease that i was pronouncing the unfamiliar words as though id been speaking them all my life line after line it felt extraordinarily good and right and i didnt stop my eyes clouded over but i kept chanting my voice tapering off to a whisper when the words ran out i blinked a few times to clear my vision and saw that i had recited the entire paragraph or poem or whatever it was that had been written with such care on these pages i could have stoppedit wasnt like id been possessed or anything like thatbut the words were there inside me and reading just the first few brought the rest to my conscious mind i found myself wantingneedingto speak them aloud i scanned the page a second time and marveled at the beauty of the words and at the way id been able to make the strange sounds and the accent that went with them and then i realized i had heard the words once before when i had touched milla in the gym when my vision had gone dark when the sounds of the gym had faded away and left me completely focused on the rushing feeling and millas wounded body under my fingertips my mind hadnt been completely silent there had been a whisper of a voice saying these same words or perhaps it had been my own voice i couldnt be sure only knew that they had unfurled like a ribbon fluttering in a breeze there and then gone i ran my fingertips over the words as though touching them would answer my questions would somehow reveal what i was supposed to do because i felt certain that i had been chosen for something and that milla was part of it and all the morries and gram and rattler sikes and dun and even chub all of it fit together in some way that i didnt yet understand and the thought was frightening but compelling i picked up the necklace and held it in the lamplight deep red flashes danced into the corners of the room as though the stone had an energy that splintered into pieces when the light touched it chub noticed the sparkling stone and dropped his book on the bed clapping his hands preeee he said laughingit almost sounded like pretty i slipped the necklace on fastening the silver clasp with care and then i sat next to chub on the bed and let him look at it he touched the stone gently and murmured and crawled into my lap and i held him tight and rocked him i loved to sing to chub everything from songs from cartoons to my favorites from the radio today i just hummed a sad wandering melody that came into my head chub sighed and leaned into me and the humming turned to words the words from the verse if chub found them strange he didnt let on i sang and we rocked and when the need to replay the verses over and over finally faded he had fallen asleep in my arms i carried him to his crib and tucked him under his blanket i slipped the pendant under my shirt so gram wouldnt see it and rolled the scrap of lace carefully and put it in the back of my tshirt drawer along with the frame and the pages when i left the room chub had a fistful of soft cotton blanket pressed to his chin smiling in his sleep chapter i was sliding into my usual seat at an empty lunch table the next day when i saw him sawyer was sitting with milla and a few other morries poking at something in a tupperware container with a plastic fork only there was something wrong i could see it from twenty feet away his eye was swollen and there was a purple bruise shading his cheek i suddenly wasnt hungry i threw my luncha sandwich and apple from homeinto the trash and then walked as casually as i could past his table up close it was worse he had a black eye and the other eye had an ugly red cut along the brow in addition to the bruise on his cheek there was something wrong with his nose it was swollen and tilted to the right as i passed i couldnt help gasping everyone looked up except sawyer who dropped his chin even lower and stared at the table whatcha lookin at him like that for hailey gomez jones demanded youre whose fault that is you done that to him i couldnt let him say that not in front of sawyer ii milla slammed her hand down on the table angrily making the trays and silverware jump why cant you just leave us alone yeah bitchstay away another girl muttered i was getting tired of the way they treated me especially considering what i had done for milla youd be dead if it wasnt for me maybe you should try being a little grateful oh right cause you saved me and all right millas face twisted up in fury so im supposed to kiss your ass i donti never said i dont need you none of us need you you think youre above the rest of us but youre not youre not you and your grandmother youre broken youre freaks to my horror millas eyes filled with furious tears and she bolted from the table after a second of silence sawyer pushed back his chair and went after her not looking at me happy now the girl said as gomez and the others started gathering their things how many of us do you want to get hurt none of this would happen if you would just stay away i stood frozen to the spot after theyd all left i didnt understand i had neverneverheard a morrie girl stand up to anyone outside their group not in my whole life i backed slowly away from the table her words ringing in my ears when i bumped into a chair i turned and walked out of the cafeteria as quickly as i could stay away id broken some rule when i talked to sawyer yesterday and hed paid for it i didnt bother asking myself who had done that to himit had to be rattler though i couldnt imagine why i didnt blame the morries for being afraid of himi was plenty afraid of him myself when i got home chub was curled up on the couch asleep how longs he been down i asked gram not long she said stabbing out a cigarette in the ashtray and reaching for her pack then crumpling it when she saw that it was empty i think or maybe a while i dont know she had no idea i could tell all she cared about unless she had visitors was her programs i reached for the full ashtray carried it to the trash and wiped it clean before setting it back on the arm of her chair i went to her room to get a fresh pack of cigarettes from where she kept them on top of her dresser but when i closed my hand on the pack i noticed that it was sitting on a plain manila folder curious i picked the folder up something fell outa white business envelope and to my amazement a stack of bills secured with a rubber band i flipped quickly through the bills my heart raced as i realized they were all hundredsthere had to be thousands of dollars in my hand i set the money on the dresser as though it was on fire then picked up the white envelope and slid a piece of paper out after scanning it i realized that it was a plane ticket dated two weeks from now it was for a flight from stl to dub saint louis to where before i could examine the ticket more carefully i heard gram coughing my name from the living room i jammed the ticket back in the envelope and slid it and the money into the manila folder in the living room i handed the cigarettes to gram and tried to look like nothing was out of the ordinary i smoothed an afghan over chub and kissed his cheek im going for a walk be back in a bit gram didnt respond i didnt expect her to i didnt bother with the leash rascal didnt need ithe heeled and sat whenever i came to a stop as we walked along the road i tried to make sense of what id found neither of us had ever been on a plane and id never seen that much money in my life it had to have something to do with the men in the car but what was she planning to make a run from the law what had she done i was so intent on my thoughts that as we rounded the curve a quarter mile from our house i almost missed the familiar sound of the hostess truck it was a noisy thing with muffler problems that came along every tuesday and friday on its way to the walmart in casey rascal loved to chase it usually he wouldnt leave my side but there was something about the brightcolored truck that set him hurtling after it ears flying tongue hanging out taking pure joy in the chase i didnt worry about himhe was a smart dog and fast and he loved to give the truck a run for its moneybut i hadnt counted on the curve the driver couldnt have seen rascal who heard the trucks approach before i did and spun around in the gravel on the shoulder just as it rounded the bend ive replayed that moment a thousand times in my mind i dont want to i wish i could forget the sound rascals body made when the grill of the truck struck him when he narrowly missed being dragged under the wheels when he went flying through the air and slammed into the hardpacked dirt bank i ran but it felt like my arms and legs could only move at half speed and my scream was stuck in my throat i know the driver pulled over and got out and called to me but i dont remember what he said somehow i made it to rascals side it was bad it was worse than bad i wont say what i saw the damage that can be done during a single instant of innocent joy in the second that it took for me to kneel down beside rascal and put my cheek to his head i was covered with blood behind us the driver was yelling at me to put him in the truck and wed drive to the vet to move fast there might be a chance but i knew there wasnt any chance not if we went in the truck not if i didnt do what needed to be done the rushing was already building in my body the quickening in the blood just like it had in the gym but i couldnt do it here not in front of the trucker i stripped off my jacket and laid it flat on the ground and as gently as i could dragged rascals body onto the jacket with tears welling up in my eyes and making it hard to see i folded the fabric over rascals poor torn body and lifted him he didnt protest he was already slipping away i dont remember what i said to the driver i dont know if i said anything at all the driver was a kind man and i think he knew that rascal was nearly dead and he didnt want to intrude on my last moments with my dog i know he drove away after placing a heavy hand on my shoulder and telling me he was sorry but i was already turning back toward home i laid rascal on the porch still nestled in my jacket i put my face close to his and waited for his breath against my cheek but it didnt come i put my hands to his torn flesh the blood cooling and starting to crust under my fingers i closed my eyes and let the feeling come roiling rushing unstoppable and the sounds of the afternoon fell away and the darkness turned to blindness and my fingers became electric as the thing inside me built and crashed and flowed from me to rascal tá mé mol seo draíocht na anam an corp cara ár comhoibrí did my lips move did i speak out loud did the words carry on the chilly spring breeze across our ruined yard out to the street down to trashtown where frightened girls hid behind grimy windows girls who knew more about me than i knew about myself girls who cursed me i dont know but as the words mixed with the urgent need i sensed that it was all connected that what i was doing was not of my own making that it came from a source that bound us all in some way and as the rushing slowed and my senses returned with a prickly sharp sensation i tried to push back the nagging feeling that i was in over my head that i was invoking powers i couldnt control and then none of that mattered because rascals body twitched a small hitch just a tiny jerk of his paws i blinked sight back into my eyes and saw that his lips were curled away from his teeth but under my fingertips i felt his heart beat faintlya weak and irregular pulseand i realized that he wasnt dead i hugged him as gently as i could and then i sewed him up thinking of it now i cant believe i found the courage but i fetched the sewing basket from the back closet easing past gram without waking her from her afternoon nap i washed my hands and squirted bactine from the bottle i kept in the bathroom i got a carpet needle and strong waxed thread and i lined up the edges of the tear in rascals body as well as i could i apologized before i took the first stitch im sorry i whispered i know this is going to hurt but rascal never twitched or showed the slightest sign of pain he didnt look at me his eyes still unfocused and i made a neat row of overcast stitches knotting them off at the place in the soft white fur on his chest where the wound began i dribbled more bactine onto the ragged stitches and when i was finished i carried him inside to the mound of blankets in the kitchen where it was warm i talked to him some more and even then i think i knew something was wrong he didnt look at me he just lay there though his breathing was even and strong i cleaned up the blood on the porch with rags and windex and then i carried the rags and my bloodied jacket to the burn barrel out back and stuffed them into the bottom into the ashy remains of the last fire back inside chub was waking up from his nap he must have had a nightmare because he blinked hard and started to wail and pulled at the blanket id covered him with he was getting big too big for this kind of thing but i went to him and he wrapped his arms around me and hugged me hard slowly his sobs diminished to whimpers and he pressed his face into my neck his tears mixing with rascals blood chapter rascal spent that night lying on the linoleum floor close to the front door in the morning i examined his stitches the pink line of his scar was so faint that it was practically invisible punctuated by the bits of thread id used to stitch him even more amazingly fur was already growing over the area how could flesh heal that fasthow could fur grow that fast earlier in the moments before my alarm went off it had flashed through my mind that i had dreamed his injury now i was really starting to wonder but the black threads were proof that it had happened i went to the front door and called his name he got up obediently without any stiffness or pain that i could see and trotted outside and did his business then came back in and returned to his blankets i got grams embroidery snips with tiny pointed blades and a pair of tweezers i said rascal come and he followed me to my room where chub was just beginning to stir under his mound of blankets yawning and humming softly rascal sat when i told him to his pose showdog perfect erect and still when i gently pressed on his shoulders he lay down exposing his scar he didnt complain as i cut the threads and tugged them out with the tweezers it was almost as though he didnt feel it i wondered if somehow the accident had damaged his nerves had taken away his feeling without hurting the rest of him and i prayed that he was healing on the inside as well as he was on the outside i gathered up grams tools and threw the bits of thread in the trash then shooed rascal out of the room behind me chub coughed and then mumbled sleepily hayee mockingbird i turned around rascal forgotten in my amazement chub had said a wordone hed never said before three entire syllables as clear as a bell what did you say chub i asked slowly my mouth dry mockingbird he repeated youyou want me to sing sing you the mockingbird song he rubbed at his eyes nodding maybe it was a fluke maybe he hadnt said mockingbird at all but some other word but strange things were happening milla sawyer rattler nearly losing rascal the money and plane ticket in grams room the things i had done without even understanding what i was doing as i lifted chub out of his crib and hugged him tight the words from the pages played in my head a whispered sound track that seemed almost like it had been running the sound turned down all my life but chub wanted me to sing so i lay down on my bed and held him and rested my chin on his downy hair and sang his favorite lullaby until he had enough and wiggled out of my grasp and ran out of the room to find rascal and then i lay there a few minutes longer wondering what was happening to me to us at school i skipped lunch to go to the library and use the internet id gotten pretty good at doing research online trying to figure out what was wrong with chub not that it helped much there were so many things that could be wrong with him i felt like the more i read the less i knew i didnt have much more luck when i tried to research what was wrong with rascal i didnt know exactly what to search for fast healing brought up natural remedies and healthfood sites searching on rascals symptoms brought up catatonia which involved repetitive movements and ignoring external stimuli but that didnt seem to be exactly what was wrong with him i gave up and unfolded the piece of paper on which id copied a few lines from the pages i found in the closet i smoothed it out and entered the words in the search engine soon it became obvious that the words were irish and after poking around in an online irishenglish dictionary for a while i had a pretty good idea of what the lines said i commend to this magic the souls and bodies of our poor countrymen heal this withered flesh these torn and cursed limbs this tainted blood i wished i had copied the whole page i had no idea what kind of magic the author meant but i felt a strange excitement building inside me healing could it really be a coincidence that id found the words after the thing that happened to milla in the gym and right before rascal had been hit by the truck before i left the lab i looked up the airport code from the ticket id found in grams room dub stood for dublin ireland how could the words from the pages in the closet be related to what was happening now to the plans that gram was making in secret i didnt know who had written those words or hidden the pages in the closet i didnt know what prairie clover meant but it still felt like those words held the key i had to find out more even if the one person who could help me hated me for reasons i didnt understand there had to be a way to make her talk to me i waited until school was nearly over when the last bell rang i bolted out of class and ran down the hall to the lab because i knew milla had science last period when she shuffled out of the classroom head down at the end of the stream of kids i stepped in front of her and blocked her path i opened my mouth to ask if we could go somewhere to talk but her expression changed from wariness to recognition her eyes widening and her lips parting in surprise whered you git that she whispered what the necklace my fingers went to the red stone pendant i hadnt taken it off since i found it in the closet id kept it under my shirt at home so gram wouldnt see it but at school id let it hang in front ii found it did your grandmother give it to you i wasnt sure what to say if i could have thought of a lie that would keep her talking to me i wouldnt have hesitated but i had no idea what she wanted what would hold her interest all i could think of was to ask her if shed go somewhere to talk to me somewhere private look could you could we milla shook her head already backing away i dont have anything to say to you but i have to talk to you to someone imi dontill give youill give you money if you want i dont have a lot but i can get more i could sense that in a second she would turn and run down the hall away from me the necklace ill give it to you dont take it off she snapped i dont want that thing anywhere near me i wasnt sure what it was what it could do but it clearly had an effect on milla i held the stone delicately between my finger and thumb and twisted it in the light coming through the high windows the sun bounced off the stone and danced across millas face in bloodred streaks her expression went from wariness to resignation you wont let it drop will you she sighed so lets git this over with we went to one of the practice rooms by the band room a musty space with old acoustic tiles lining the walls and music stands and a scarred piano there was only one chair so we sat on the floor our knees pulled up the sound of someone practicing scales on a cello reaching us faintly i didnt tell her everything i told her about the men in the car about my fears that the authorities would separate me and chub i didnt tell her about rascali didnt want her to think i was crazy i told her about the men who came to the house the deals gram did out of the basement when i talked about rattler milla dropped her gaze to the floor and went still what is it i demanded frustrated what is it with him milla didnt answer for a moment but when she did her voice was so flat and quiet that i could barely hear it seems like you might know me why ive never done anything to him she jerked her head up and there was anger in her eyes it aint about what you done dont you git that aint any of us banished got any say in things its all laid out banished i dont that necklace youre so proud of milla said jabbing a finger at me might interest you to know that it aint the only one theres three of them come over and theyre all cursed how do you think your grandmother got the way she is anyone who wears its cursed too i touched the stone protectively i couldnt say why but it seemed to me the opposite was true that the stone was a charm keeping even worse things from happening to me i dont believe you i whispered really well your mom had one of them and look what happened to her that one you gots probably hers your grandmother traded hers is probably the only reason shes still alive only one missing is your aunts and who knows what happened to her my what your aunt hailey come on dont act stupid i dont have an aunt you know you do and i dont have to sit here and listen to you sayin whatever comes into your head like you think im an idiot like you think ill believe whatever you feel like sayin ii know youre not stupid i said quickly placing a hand on her arm trying to calm her down but she jerked away from my touch i dont mean to you know make you feel bad or whatever but i really dont have an aunt my mom died in childbirth and i stop she wrapped her arms tight around herself as though she was cold just stop your mom went crazy and killed herself and you know it bad enough your grandmother got the taint and now aint no one supposed to so much as say your name dont you get it it would be better for everyone if you had never been born hailey her voice had gone cold and nasty you think youre a healer but who knows what you done to me you probably cursed me my mother didnt kill herself i whispered i could have said a dozen different things but that was what came to my lips she died having me milla stood and pointed a shaking finger at me her lips twisted in rage i cant she started and then she backed away from me if you really dont know ask your grandmother shell make you believe it wait wait ask her what ask your grandmother milla said and then she flung the door open and ran and i was alone with only the mournful sounds of the cello for company chapter when i got home there was a car parked in the yard it wasnt the darkwindowed lexus or rattler sikess truck it was a beatup brown volvo and i knew from experience that was a whole other kind of bad news a car like thiswell maintained even if it was old boring but socially responsiblescreamed social worker the department of social services family support division sent people out to check on us from time to time in theory they were supposed to visit every month in truth i never knew when to expect them so i could never prepare for their visits i bolted across the yard ignoring rascal who was sitting on the porch i let myself in the front door and hurried to the kitchen it was worse than i feared gram hadnt bothered to do anything with chub and he was sitting on the floor wearing only a diaper that looked like it was about to burst crusty bits of lunch on his cheeks when he saw me he jumped to his feet and came running throwing his strong little arms around my legs and pushing his face into my thigh saying hayee hayee in his happy voice gram hadnt bothered to ask the social worker if shed like some tea or coffee she had her cigarettes in front of her and judging by the butts in the ashtray she hadnt stopped smoking since our visitor arrived last time one of the social workers came she made a big deal out of grams smoking i thought it would be a bigger issue that we still didnt have smoke detectors and the porch stairs were still just a nail or two away from collapsing that chub was still barely speaking and wouldnt use a toilet and gram was still refusing to let him go to preschool it was time for damage control hello i said loudly pulling chubs arms away from my legs im hailey tarbell the woman seemed to tense at the sound of my voice she had shiny dark brown hair that came to little below her shouldersno one id seen before but that wasnt unusual they came and went from this job all the time she pushed her chair back and stood up and turned toward me and started to speak then she stopped and we both just stared at each other the face looking back at meit was my own i dont mean her face was a mirror image of mine but she looked like me if i was older and had money for nice clothes and makeup and a good haircut she had eyes like minemore gold than brown tilted up at the corners her eyebrows were high and arched like mine though id bet she paid good money to get hers done in a salon she had my mouth thin top lip and full bottom lip she had the high sharp cheekbones and the wide forehead i have my auntthis had to be the aunt i never knew i had after staring at me for a few seconds she did something that surprised me even moreshe turned back around and smacked her hand down on the table so hard grams ashtray jumped spilling ashes and butts it had to hurt her hand but she curled it up into a fist for a moment i thought she was going to hit gram but instead she just squeezed her fist so hard her skin turned white i realized i had stopped breathing the same instant that she put both her hands flat on the table and leaned down until her face was inches away from grams and said in a low and threatening voice if you ever lie to me again alice ill kill you with my bare hands then she turned back to me and all of the anger drained from her expression leaving her looking sad and tired my names elizabeth blackwell gram tipped her head back and laughed an awful hacking laugh that showed her long yellow teeth we both stared at gram finally she ended on a skidding series of gasping coughs and wiped at her eyes with her hands now whos lyin gram said the visitor blinked once hard then she took a deep breath like she was trying to get her courage up to jump off the cliffs over boone lake okay she said in a voice so soft i knew it was meant just for me im notwho i said my names prairie and im your aunt my throat went dry prairie clover what was my moms name i said my voice barely a whisper what my mother your sister what was her name clover my aunt said didnt alice ever tell you that suddenly my head felt both tight and dizzy the words on the wall the way they felt under my fingertips the invisible pull they had on me it was my mothers name there i wondered if she had carved the letters herself the dizziness escalated into something more like my whole self had lost its moorings and gone drifting away im going to get some air i went out the back screen door for some reason when i heard her following me i wasnt surprised she stayed a couple of steps behind me while i walked toward the woods away from the road where rascal and i had walked together just yesterday a short path met up with the crisscrossed web of trails through the woods that connected the farms out past the creek to trashtown in one direction and gypsum in the other i went straight and in a few minutes i was at the creek it was nearly drywed had little rain or snow over the winterand there was a flat rock half submerged in the lazy flowing water id come here to sit on the rock a hundred times thinking and tossing pebbles into the water i went there now dangling my feet over the edge do you mind if i sit too prairie asked i shruggedits a free country she settled next to me and picked up a long skinny twig that had blown into a crevice in the rock holding it loosely in her hand she traced designs in the air for a while neither of us said anything dozens of questions went through my mind i kept thinking of the names carved into the wall if youre my aunt where have you been all this time i blurted out it wasnt what i meant to say and all of a sudden tears blurred my eyes and threatened to spill down my cheeks i wiped my sleeve hard across my face oh hailey prairie said and her voice wavered i had reasons for leaving when i did i didnt know about you i meant to come back for your mom but by the time i could she well she died i never even knew she was pregnant but you you left my mom here alone with gram and then she killed herself i didnt bother to keep the accusation out of my voice even though i wasnt sure i believed what milla had said i know prairies voice got softer thats something i have to live with every day of my life i considered telling her that id never leave chub with gram never didnt anyone come looking for you i asked instead gram didnt report me missing prairie said if she was bitter she covered it well i was never officially a runaway and the police had better things to do than search for me butwhy didnt you come back you know later after i was born i heard the crack in my voice and i hated it hated that prairie heard it too i didnt know hailey alice said your mom she hesitated and i saw that she bit her lip the very same way i did catching the right side of the bottom lip between her teeth she never let me know about you why should i care my mother was nothing to me i had no memories of her as far as i was concerned id never had a mother at all it doesnt matter anyway i muttered chubs my family now were fine we dont need anyone else prairie nodded more to herself than to me i thought i see you found your moms hiding spot prairie said gently her what prairie put her hands to the back of her neck and twisted the clasp of a thin silver chain as she closed her fingers on the pendant i knew what i would see its just like yours she said when i saw it on you well your mom never took it off neither of us did maryour grandmothershe gave them to us theyre very old she said they would protect us she handed the pendant to me still warm from her skin i had noticed that the stone in the necklace i wore absorbed my heat and held it almost like it carried energy the necklace in my hand was identical to the one around my neck right down to the twisting curling scrollwork that held the stone in place the looping bale through which the chain ran i handed the necklace to prairie it would have been nice to believe there was magic in the necklaces but i wasnt counting on it i guess we should go back i said we didnt talk but the silence felt all right when we got to the house gram was still sitting in her kitchen chair she gave us a calculating smile and blew smoke in our direction look what the cat dragged in im taking hailey out to dinner prairie said well be a while this was news to me chub who had been playing with his plastic magnet letters on the fridge came over and pushed his face into my legs again for just a second i was embarrassed for prairie to see that chub wasnt like other kids gram stared at prairie with her eyes narrowed down to slits prairie stared back i found myself hoping gram would blink first fine gram finally said i could tell she was thinking hard she had that look a lot no matter what else you could say about her she wasnt stupid i couldnt tell you how many of her customers came to our house thinking they could put one over on her shed give them that look and sure enough theyd leave a lot more of their cash on the table than they had planned if they didnt like it shed tell them to take their business somewhere else which they hardly ever did i thought of the money and the ticket again and wondered what she was up to dont wait up was all prairie said as she took her keys out of her purse we need to bring chub i said i wanted to find out what prairie was really doing here but i felt bad about leaving chub tonight i could tell he was upset the way hed hugged me so hard chubs not going anywhere gram said i think hes catching something i dont want him taking a chill outside i knew she was lying but i also knew hed be all right for an hour or two i followed prairie out to her car we didnt talk she drove straight to nolans taking the shortcut back behind the napa auto parts and i was surprised shed picked the only fancy restaurant in town i was afraid the hostess wouldnt seat us since i was wearing jeans but prairie gave her a smile and said well need some privacy please would you find us a table thats a little bit out of the way the hostess put us in a nice booth along the far wall away from the waitress station and the kitchen she kept sneaking looks at prairie and now that i had gotten over the surprise of how much our faces looked alike i could see why prairie drew attention i was tall and skinny but prairie was tall and elegant thin but with nice hips and breasts and her brown hair was shiny and hung exactly right smooth and straight and curving under just a little where it went past her shoulders her jacket plain and cut low enough in the front to show a little bit of her silky top underneath fit her so perfectly it pretty much said money with a capital m i guess the hostess was thinking the same thing there were very few rich families in gypsum almost everyone was just trying to get by i was going to order the chicken sandwich i read all the prices on the menu and added up in my head what dinner would cost part of me wanted to order the most expensive thing just to see what prairie would do to see if there was a limit to her concern for me or maybe to see if i could get her to crack and show me who she really was like if under this nice exterior she was just waiting to tell me what she really wanted and it would be something bad but when the waitress came around to take the order prairie said the filet mignon sounds really good doesnt it hailey it was twentythree dollars but i hadnt had a steak in as long as i could remember and i just said yes it did when the waitress walked away neither of us said anything for a minute prairie fiddled with her knife spinning it back and forth tell me about your dog she finally said if you dont mind that caught me off guard rascal wasnt something i felt like talking about theres nothing to tell its just that i can tell hes that something happened to him her face went soft and her eyes were sad where did you get him um gram got him from a guy she knew alice traded him for drugs prairies expression didnt change yeah i shrugged like it was no big deal probably hailey i saw the scar whats left of it anyway on his stomach i blinked this morning the scar had almost disappeared you had to push the fur to the side to see the faint pink line i wanted to ask prairie how she knew but i didnt want her to think i cared too much caring about things made you vulnerable he got hit by the hostess truck a few days ago was he badly hurt he i swallowed remembering the way rascal looked but i didnt want to tell her what i had done didnt want to have to try to explain how hed healed so well in one night no just a little cut prairie watched me carefully i bet you must have given him good care hailey what did you do her voice was so kind that i had to look away i swallowed hard and took a little sip of my ice water i um i just cleaned it with antiseptic and you know kept him inside did you talk to him did i what while you were cleaning up his injuries i mean maybe he was scared i know how that can be you must have wanted to make him comfortable she knew somehow she knew that id healed rascal that something id done to him after the accident had fixed him just like id fixed milla during gym i felt my face go hot it was like she could read my mind i dont think i said anything special i answered her carefully while i was taking care of him prairie nodded all right well im glad hes better yeah it um i mean he has that limp you probably noticed but thats all the waitress came along with our salads we thanked her and just as i was about to pick up my fork prairie took a deep breath i have some things to tell you hailey she said im sorry to have to do it now when weve only just met but i think its necessary bad news then she was about to tell me what she really wanted from me but honestly how much worse could my life get whatever i said now i wish id ordered a drink prairie said smiling a little a really strong one okay where to start how about thisalice isnt as old as you think she is what do you mean i think shes turning fifty this year prairie said lets see ill be thirtyone and she was nineteen when she had me so yes shes still fortynine barely i thought of the old pages the names and dates written there alice eugenie tarbell but gram was oldshe had the wrinkled face the thin gray hair the bent fingers that elderly people have and she was weak she could barely get up and down the stairs to the basement she couldnt do chores which was why it was always me who mopped and swept and washed the windows and shoveled snow and carried the laundry and the groceries and she was sickly she caught colds constantly lying in her bed for days at a time getting up only when her customers came calling i found her hair in clumps in the shower drain and her nails were yellowed and cracked if she bumped into the furniture shed have purple and yellow bruises every time she lit up a cigarette she hacked and coughed as though her lungs were about to fall out thats impossible i finally said prairie sipped at her water i wish you could have known your greatgrandmother my grandmother mary alices mother i thought of the photo in the cheap frame the womans bright red lips and sparkling eyes my greatgrandmotheri could barely imagine it she died when i was ten prairie continued but she was beautiful and strong and fun and smart so smart most of the women in our family are what happened to gram then well heres part of what i need to tell you hailey tarbell womenall your ancestorsare incredibly healthy and strong itswell its our birthright i guess you might say in our blood tell me i bet you hardly ever get sick right uh not much and youre strongstronger than the other kids and more coordinated right i just shrugged well like i said its in our genes except that every so often maybe every five or six generations there is an aberration a what someone born who doesnt fit the genetic pattern like alice where the rest of the tarbell women have phenomenal genes alice has been in poor health her entire life shes aging much too quickly her tissues are decaying i dont imagine shell live to see her fiftyfifth birthday i thought of milla and what shed said about the necklaces about how they were cursed how do you think your grandmother got the way she is i didnt say it but if it was true and gram had been cursed i wasnt sorry gram could die tomorrow for all i cared i did the addition in my headid be twenty twenty and free of grammy heart lightened at the thought an idea came to me a missing piece of the puzzle of my life that maybe prairie could supply did you and my mom have the same dad do you know who he is prairie shook her head id wondered sometimes looking at gram with her withered skin and bent body if she had ever been young if a man had ever loved her it didnt seem possible alice never talked about that part of her life what about my dad i asked like maybe my mom had a boyfriend or something prairie gave me a look that was so full of sadness i almost wished i hadnt asked clover was my younger sister when i left gypsum she was only fourteen she was already pregnant with you i never knew fourteen i couldnt believe it i mean i knew it was possiblethey talked about it in health enough she would be twentynine i said barely old enough to be a mother of a kid much less someone my age yes clover your mom she was very shy she didnt really have many friends at school and nothing like a boyfriend so she was like me then i knew what it was like not to have friends but maybe gram knows something prairie pressed her lips together for a moment as though trying to figure out what to say next if she knows im afraid shell never tell why not i know how hard it is to live with alice prairie said gently i remember she doesnt have the power that she wishes she had and the way she is its left her angry and bitter maybe even unable to love anyone i think it was hard on your mother harder than it was on me clover was sensitive and sometimes i think it bothered her more when alice was mean to me than when she did something to her i just steeled myself i guess i decided a long time ago i wouldnt let her hurt me and for the most part it worked i knew what she meant though i didnt say it you told yourself her words were nothing when she refused to talk to you you reminded yourself that you didnt care you shut off the part of your heart that wanted a mother a grandmother and you made it through by remembering every day that she couldnt hurt you if you didnt let her if you didnt make the mistake of caring too much my mother hadnt been able to do that whose child is chub prairie asked i felt my face get hot we got him from one of grams customers hes grams foster child for the state money prairie said thoughtfully right i nodded surprised that she figured it out so quick yes but i think she also wanted him to be like a project something she could fix he has um problems i mean hes slow hes really great and all but he isnt really developing as fast as he should be i felt disloyal saying it i waited for prairie to say something mean about him to make some careless criticism and i was ready to hate her if she said the wrong thing but she just nodded her eyes sad he seems like a sweet boy you take very good care of him that must be hard no the word came out harsher than i intended i mean i dont mind its not hard its fun i didnt tell her how gram had acted different for a while after she applied with the state i didnt want to admit that id been dumb enough to hope things had really changed during that brief time when gram kept the house clean and cooked real meals and didnt do any business out of the cellar that i had almost believed she could change chub do you know his real name prairie asked gently i stared at my plate no just chub id thought about changing it charlie id suggested to gram but shed laughed and said she guessed he had a good enough name already and the thing was chub knew his name he answered to it i figured he had enough confusion in his life that we didnt need to go adding any more thats fine prairie said what about a last name gram knows it but she never let me see any of the papers i said she just says hes a tarbell now prairie nodded she had that look again the one i was pretty sure meant a lot of thinking and figuring was going on the waitress came with our dinner and i dug in i couldnt believe how good the steak was tender and buttery and saltythe best thing id ever tasted prairie barely touched hers she sighed and sliced off a tiny corner and slipped it into her mouth she chewed and swallowed but it looked to me like she didnt even taste it as hard as she was trying to seem calm i could tell she was uneasy almost frightened i wanted to know why i set down my knife and fork why are you here what do you want from me prairie looked me right in the eyesomething hardly anyone had ever doneand took a deep breath im taking you with me she said you cant stay here with alice anymore my heart did a little flip at her words leavingeven if it wasnt the way i planned even if it was with a strangerthe thought was almost irresistible i wanted to say okay fine lets do it to hell with school with the stupid cleans whod made fun of me forever to hell with our fallingdown house the weedy yard the long walk to the grocery anywhere would be better than here i was tempted to say sure lets go right now before she changed her mind instead what i said was i cant leave chub prairie didnt look surprised she dabbed at the corners of her mouth with her napkin and set down her fork look she said ill admit i hadnt planned on chub i was actually hoping to leave tonight this complicates things a bitbut were still leaving well just go a little later than i planned and well take him with us she said that last part kind of fast as i started to protest butbut what about she held up a hand to stop me try not to worry i want you to let me handle the details at least for now okay look i know you probably arent sure about me yet and you may not completely trust me and thatsthat stands to reason it does i understand but i justim not doing this lightly hailey after you get to know me a little more youll understand that i dont take anything lightly the way she said that it sounded like a promise but even more than a promise like something shed worked hard to convince herself of and now shed do anything to keep it true i cant just you can prairie reached across the table and patted my hand but i pulled away from her i have resources that ill tell you more about later i have some money we can stay the night at the house and you can gather up a few thingsnot many just one small suitcase and we cant let alice see you packing she doesnt know i told her that i was moving back to gypsum so i could be closer to you i told her i was going to look for a house here in town you told her there was no way gram would believe that there was no way anyone would believe a person would come back here to live if they had a choice i dont have a suitcase a box then whatever you and chub need we can buy and then what where would we go i knew it was crazy but it was so tempting to believe in prairie in what she said she could do i dont want to say just yet she said i know im asking a lot from you hailey but i promise you that soon ill tell you everything right now i just need to focus on getting us all out of here and you need to help me make alice believe what i told her do you think you can do that i didnt say yesbut i didnt say no either chapter when we got home i saw that gram had made a few plans of her own dun aceys truck was pulled up in the yard the back fender hanging a little lower since the last time id seen it the result of some accident that had probably been worse for the other guy prairie pulled the volvo into the yard about as far away from the truck as she could whose truck is that she asked voice neutral but i could hear the tension underneath her words thats dun acey what a surprise she muttered as if it was anything but you know him i knew some aceys she said the name like it was poison she walked ahead of me i let her glad to have a buffer between me and whatever waited inside in the kitchen dun was tilted back in a chair across from gram at the table rattler sikes was standing at the sink a lit cigarette in one hand he was pouring a glass of water down his throat he gave me a tiny nod and then slowly lowered the glass to the sink leaning against the counter he put the cigarette to his lips and drew in on it and smirked as the smoke streamed lazily out of his nostrils there were eight beer cans on the table and i knew without having to be told that six were empty and dun and gram were working on the others hello hailey dun drawled letting the chair legs slam down on the floor with a thud youre lookin hottern august and whos this you got with you behind him rattler laughed an abrupt rasping sound accompanied by a ghost of a smile dun looked prairie up and down the way he usually looked at melingering on her breasts and her legs dun and rattler were both probably about prairies age but dun had always looked old to me with a couple of missing teeth and greasy hair falling all around his face after hed stared her up and down he gave a low whistle prairie tarbell he said drawing out the syllables id know you anywhere you look even better than the day you left i could feel prairie tense up next to me hello dunston she said her voice steely rattler damnyou recognize us after all girl didnt think you would now you gone all uptown on us but i guess you just couldnt stay away from us local boys forever dun laughed as though that was the funniest thing hed heard in a long time gram laughed with him lighting up a fresh cigarette and ending on a hacking cough i remember you prairie practically chewed off the words alice tells me youre moving back here aint that nice course if you come back to try an git in my pants youre a lil late duns words were slurred from the beer i got my eye on another girl gram laughed again and they both looked at me lucky her prairie said icily now if you all will excuse us hailey and i are tired and im meeting with a realtor first thing tomorrow to look at a house so were heading to bed hailey and i are tired gram repeated in a high singsong voice she did that sometimes when she was drinking mimicking what i said something told me it was a mistake to do it to prairie though i waited for her to snap back at gram like she had earlier but she said nothing she put her hand on my arm and steered me toward the hall come on she whispered goin to bed are you prairie rattlers voice came from behind us i could sense prairie tense even more but she didnt say anything just practically dragged me down to my room once we were inside she shut the door firmly and leaned back against it i went to check on chub he was curled up in his crib and i was grateful gram at least had managed to get him put down his little fist was pressed against his cheek he always got hot when he slept his face taking on a rosy color i put my hand lightly on the back of his neck and felt his heartbeatstrong and regular only then did i turn back to prairie if dun and rattler knew about you and probably a whole lot more people knew too how come nobody ever said anything to me keep your voice down hailey prairie said softly a lot of people are scared of alice or else alice makes it worth their while to keep their mouths shut besides other than alices customers not that many people in town would remember alice sent us to school in tipton because she didnt want us mixing with the local kids and its not like we ever had friends over what about dun and rattler seems like they knew you pretty well there were a few families that alice socialized with the aceys and the sikes a few others from trashtown her customers they werent always customers butyes alice knew they had a taste for illegal substances and she figured out how to capitalize on it she had to find a way to make money after all prairie sighed and smoothed down the fabric of her jacket the memories clearly taking a toll on her but you got out i said and i almost didnt say it i bit my lower lip and considered staying quiet letting the past rest it was probably the right thing to do but in the space of a few hours i had learned that i had lost more than i ever knew i had so when i spoke again my voice was bitter and you left my mom here to deal with alice by herself like me prairie recoiled as if i had slapped her hailey iit wasnt like that you have to know that i loved your mother more than anything in the world i would never have left ifif if what the thing that happened it would have been dangerous for both of us if i stayed what could have been so bad that she had to leave town did you kill someone or something sharp anguish flashed across prairies face and for a second i regretted asking if she was a murderer maybe i didnt want to know no she said quietly nothing like that but what i did made it impossible for me to stay here you just have to believe me and i was going to come for your mom its easy to make promises i said you told her youd come back for her and you didnt now youre trying to come in here and what rescue me because you feel guilty about what happened to my mom i could feel my heart squeezing and hear my voice going high and thin i knew i should stop but it would be way too easy to give in to what prairie promisedand way too dangerous if i made the wrong decision it wasnt just me that would be hurt it was chub too before prairie could answer i turned away from her forget it i dont want to know im going to bed hailey if youre still here tomorrow not that i expect you to be i didnt finish the sentence because i didnt know what to say the truth was that i desperately wanted to believe in her i wanted her to rescue me but i was afraid that if i let myself trust her shed disappear like every other good thing id ever wished for suddenly i was tired very tired hailey we can go as soon as rattler and dun leave alice wont wake up once shes out you know that prairie sounded desperate what i know is that i dont want to talk about it anymore i said edging past her to the door im going to go brush my teeth when i came back prairie took a small toiletry kit from the bag shed brought with her and went to the bathroom without saying a word she looked exhausted while she was gone i fixed up a bed for her as well as i could i put my sleeping bag down as a pad and added some old quilts and gave her my pillow i made myself a pillow out of a sweatshirt when prairie came back into the room she looked at the makeshift bed and gave me a little smile there was one more thing i needed to doi had to see what gram and dun and rattler were up to before i could sleep i slipped into the hall and peeked around the corner into the kitchen the beercan pile had grown and dun was slumped way down in his chair rattler was sitting at the table with an ashtray loaded high with butts drinking another glass of water gram was saying something to him low and serious but his expression was stony i wasnt sure dun was even awake as i watched something strange happened rattler suddenly raised his head and stared straight ahead right toward where i was hiding his eyes lost their focus and he squinted as though it hurt and he held up a palm to gram to make her stop talking who knows im here he demanded nobody gram said chugging her beer some dribbled down her chin no therestheresyou got that back door locked yeah somethings not right a car nah thats just her car gram yawned not bothering to cover her mouth that damn foreign thing rattler shook his head men its men in it gram reached for a fresh beer untangling it from the plastic rings that held the sixpack together even that effort was almost too much for her i was always amazed that as frail as she was she could drink so much youre rusty gram said aint nothin happened around here in so long youre seeing things rattler shook his head impatiently and scowled i shrank back into the halli couldnt believe gram wasnt scared of him i aint rusty you damn woman okay then youre just plum wrong it happens it happens to the others alicenot me gram cackled a sound i knew well when she was drunk she thought plenty of things were funny i eased backward as quietly as i could my heart pounding in my room prairie was sitting on the floor a quilt pulled up over her knees prairie rattler was talking to gram he says but what had he said exactly nothing specific but i was thinking of the rumors the women stumbling home barefoot in the chilly dawn hes just so creepy i whispered prairie nodded she didnt seem surprised i dont want you to worry about him let me worry about it id lay odds that duns passed out by nowis he i nodded my heart thudding in my throat i think so okay so one down and alice probably isnt far behind rattlers going to get bored sooner or later i wish hed just leave i know she said me too but let me worry about them you need to rest if you can i couldnt think of anything else to do i lay down and prairie turned the lights out but there was enough moonlight coming in the window that i could still see her outline she lay on her back and i could see her chest rise and fall steadily as she breathed good night hailey she said im glad were together i didnt answer at first her words had a strange effect on meeven though shed brought even more chaos into my life her voice was soothing and there was a part of me that wanted very much to believe shed come to help us that i had some sort of family besides gramreal family the kind that cared about one another like other people had good night i finally mumbled a little later before i drifted off to sleep i peeked at prairie she wasnt lying on her back anymore she was leaning on her side up on her elbow and staring at the doorknob i closed my eyes again the next thing i knew a scream tore through my dreams chapter it was coming from the other side of my bedroom door and it sounded like gram prairie bolted to my side clapping a hand over my mouth before i could protest she leaned in close and whispered quiet take chub in the closet and close the door and stay there dont come out but do it hailey please chub was a heavy sleeperonce he was out he could sleep through anything i picked him up which took some effort because hed gotten so big and he snuggled in next to my neck his skin hot and damp i glanced back but prairie was gone the door to the room was open a few inches my heart thudded as i went to the closet i yanked a bunch of clothes off their hangers put them on the floor and laid chub on them covering him with a long sweater that i tucked in like a blanket i kissed his cheek and then left the closet closing the door almost all the way as i crossed my room i heard a man yell stop right there and a pair of sharp cracks and then prairies voice speaking softly something i couldnt make out i had to find out what was happening i wasnt worried about gram exactlybut i had to know what kind of trouble prairie had brought with her i tiptoed down the hall flattening my back against the wall and peeked around the corner so i had a view into the kitchen and the living room what i saw made me suck in my breath a man stood a few feet from the door pointing a gun at gram and prairie it was one of the men from the car id seen at the drugstorei recognized his gray jacket and his blond buzz cut gram was sitting in her chair and i could tell from the drool trail that still shone wet on her cheek that shed passed out like she sometimes did she was blinking fast and patting at her hair nervously prairie stood behind her hands held out at her sides dun was exactly where id last seen him slumped over the table except there was a leaking pool of red coming from his mouth prairie looked furious i wanted to signal to her somehow but i knew i couldnt do it without the guy with the gun seeing me you the man said in a clipped calm voice old lady get down on the floor lie on your stomach with your hands straight out to the sides you aint supposed to gram protested i suddenly smelled urine sharp in the air and i knew she had peed her pants a movement in the corner of the kitchen caught my eye as it flashed past i realized that rattler must have hidden behind the refrigeratorbut why was he helping the man with the gun somehow before i could even finish the thought rattlers arm came up and there was a flash of metal as he buried grams chefs knife deep below the mans shoulder i screamed i tried to scream anyway but what came out was more of a choked gasp get back hailey prairie screamed at me rattler let go of the knife handle he didnt wait for the man to fall but threw him onto the kitchen floor as he scrabbled at the knife sticking out of his shoulder then rattler reached for prairie get chub prairie yelled now run i turned and sprinted for my room i got chub from the closethe didnt even stir in his sleep from the other room i heard a crash and glass breaking i looked toward the window and considered jumping out with chubit was only a few feet to the ground wed be finebut i realized that without prairie and the car there was no chance we could get away it was a long way across the yard to the woods and we wouldnt have any cover andi didnt want to leave prairie as i ran down the hall there was another loud crack and then a man yelled get back i skidded to a stop just before the corner and looked around it again shielding chub in my arms dun had slid out of his chair and onto the floor leaving a smear of blood on the table the guy with the knife in his shoulder sat next to him making gasping sounds his bloodcovered hands around the knife handle a second man stood in the doorway pointing his gun at rattler it was the other man from the car slightly shorter than his partner with black hair and eyes and wearing a black track jacket he stepped neatly over the pile of splintered wood and glass that had been our storm door and placed himself squarely between prairie and rattler for a second i had the crazy idea that he was protecting prairie that they had come here to save us from dun and rattler and gram but then the man spoke never taking his eyes off rattler who slowly sank to his knees and raised his hands in the air looking not so much afraid as amused on your stomach arms straight out or i will shoot you the man barked and rattler complied i saw prairies hands scrambling on the counter behind her knocking against a glass a dirty plate a box of cheezits the toaster was just beyond her reach i wanted to scream at her to grab it and throw it at the guy nail him in the head but i couldnt speak i was clutching chub so tightly that he was whimpering into my neck i didnt know if i should run back down the hall and take our chances with the window after all or try to help prairie before i could decide gram pushed her chair back and struggled to stand stop right there lady the man said down on the floor like your friend here arms out but gram lurched toward him her gray stringy hair plastered to her drooldamp chin her hands paddling the air at her sides but im the one who down he yelled as his arm swung toward her i could see what was going to happen in the split second before the gunshot echoed through the room as gram kept lurching forward straight for him except it wasnt a single gunshotit was two one right after the other and gram flew back through the air a misting red hole in her back then rattler hurtled up off the floor the first guys gun in his hand the shooter took longer to fall than gram did rattler had shot him in the side but it didnt look that bad he stumbled putting his hands to the wound and sucking air rattler didnt have any more patience with him than with his partner and he caught him under the chin with the butt of the gun the man fell to the sound of his own jaw breaking there was a second of perfect silence i took everything in gram on her back with her eyes wide and staring dun lying next to the two men rattler had wounded and in the center of it all rattler if id thought his eyes were frightening in the past they were ten times more frightening now as i watched from the darkness of the hallway he slowly lowered the gun to his side dangling it loose in his hand ladies he said drawing out the word as though he was tasting it that was sloppy of me what i git for doubtin myself wont happen again prairie guess well take your car were not going anywhere with you prairie spat rattler shook his head now prairie dont you fret i aint gonna do nothin besides take you somewheres i can keep an eye on you prairies eyes widened and i saw fresh fear there i couldnt believe there could be anything worse than thisfour people lying in a sea of blood on the floor rattler threatening us with a gunbut prairie looked terrified it was her fear that finally made me move i remembered the kitchen scissors in a mason jar with the spatulas and spoons next to the sink and i ran for them i waited for the slam of the bullet even as my fingers closed on the handles of the scissors and my hip hit the counter hard there was an oof behind me and the gun went off andwas i hit was prairie hiti whirled around and rattler had disappeared and prairie was still standing and i was still standing now hailey now prairie screamed i didnt have to be told twice chub wailed in my arms struggling against me i dropped the scissors and ran holding him as tight as i could and followed prairie out the door crunching glass under my feet slipping on the blood and then we were in the yard sprinting for her car rascal was sitting in the center of the yard his eyes glowed golden in the moonlight it looked eerie and i couldnt figure out why he was so calm when strangers had been breaking in shooting trying to kill us why hadnt he come tearing after them snarling and barking and snapping the way he did when he treed a squirrel or chased a rabbit i didnt have time to dwell on that now though prairie i have to get rascal i screamed i thrust chub at her and she took him protesting as i ran and picked rascal up i tightened all the muscles in my back waiting for the impact of a bullet as i ran to the car but none came rascal was warm and soft in my arms and he didnt protest at being bounced around i almost dropped him as i opened the car and when he landed on the floor of the backseat he nearly fell but there was no time to worry about him prairie had got the seat belt across chub and it looked like it would hold him in for now she got in the drivers seat and started the engine and i barely had time to jump in the backseat with rascal and chub before she started rolling across the lawn accelerating as if she meant to plow straight through the speed of sound the speed of light as if she meant to put an eternity between us and the wreckage of my old life part two running chapter we hit the road with a squeal of tires prairie yanked the steering wheel and the car fishtailed back and forth before straightening out something was wrong with chub his cries turned to hiccups and i felt a widening pool of damp along his leg his corduroy pants warm and wet when i closed my fingers on his shin he shrieked in pain oh my god chubs hit before i got the words out prairie braked hard and headed for the shoulder we had gone only a few hundred yards down the road but she jerked the car into park and hit the dome light with the heel of her hand twisting in her seat toward me give him to me she commanded i was terrified and didnt know what else to do i lifted his heavy body feetfirst he was coughing and crying at the same time and my muscles strained with his weight but prairie helped me slide him onto the front seat she straightened his leg gently the bloodstain black in the dim light and then she did something that stopped my breath she skittered her fingers up and down chubs leg and then stilled them ducking her head she started chanting i only had to hear a few words to know that she was saying the lines from the pages id found in my mothers hiding place it didnt take longjust ten or fifteen secondsand as prairie murmured softly chub snuffled and sighed and finally quieted she took her hands off his leg and carefully rolled his pants up and ran her fingertips over his skin then she rolled the pants down again hes all right now she said hell be fine she gently handed him back to me and i took him into my arms his little hands went to my neck and he slumped against me i could feel his long eyelashes brushing my cheek i felt along his leg the sticky hardening blood and the torn place in the fabricand underneath where his skin was smooth see if you can buckle him in again prairie said and eased the car off the shoulder and onto the road picking up speed as the tires spun gravel we were headed east and as i fumbled with the seat belt we blew past the bargain barn the kfc the old peace angel baptist church that theyd tried to turn into a restaurant for a while and now was nothing at all what just happened i asked when i had chub more or less secured what did you do but i already knew the answer even as i fought back my hysteria it was what i had done to milla what i had done to rascal prairie was silent for a moment the outskirts of town blowing past in a blur of mailboxes and gravel drives and leaning shacks finally she took a breath and slowly let it back out and when she spoke she was as calm as she had been when i first saw her sitting at our kitchen table that afternoon im a healer she said and so are you its in your blood i knew it was true yet her words still stunned me i hadnt yet put a name to it im it isnt i know you healed rascal prairie said gently i felt my face go hot i thought about denying it but there didnt seem to be much point prairie already knew and in a way i wanted her to know i needed someone else to understand was he your first prairie asked um i looked out the window at the farmland flying by the barns and outbuildings dark shadows rising from the fields i almost didnt tell her and then i did i told her about rascals accident about the blood and the terrible damage to his body about the way it had felt to carry him home to put my face to his fur about the rushing needful urgency of the energy inside me flowing through my fingers into his wrecked body i told her about milla about how i barely remembered running to her side about the words in my head about ms turnbull shoving me to the floor and the way my senses came back with a prickling abruptness about watching milla roll over and throw upand how she was fine after the gift is strong in you prairie said a note of awe in her voice when i finished ive never heard of anyone being able to do it without someone guiding them your mom and i practiced for hours with mary in secret so alice wouldnt know but it took us months before we could use the gift but milla says were cursed i said hot shame flooding my face that were freaks no prairie corrected me sharply you have a gift hailey you can do something that others cant that made me feel a little better just days ago id thought there was something wrong with me one more difference between me and every other kid but prairie made it sound like something to be proud of but that didnt change the fact that we were running from killers that the kitchen floor was soaked in blood that gram was dead who were those men at the house were they there because im a healer was it my fault those men were professionals what does that even mean like hit men more like trained investigators i guess youd call them theyre killers when they need to be but i dont think that was their main objective she was so calm it made me panic even more what did they want im pretty sure they wanted you hailey me why would they want me because youre a healer but how would they know that i only just found out myself prairie sighed thats a long story i work for a man not a good man though i didnt know that until very recently his name is bryce safian we were doing research in a lab outside chicago trying to find ways to use my healing gifts to replicate them so they could be used to fight disease what do you mean like turn normal people into healers well more or less we analyzed my full genome and compared it with a control population to isolate the element that controls the gift the next step would have been to figure out how to use a special process to change a persons dna to match mine i thought all that dna stuff was like i tried to remember what id learned in my science class earlier in the year wishing i had paid more attention that its still not understood all that well that its mostly a mystery yes thats true to a great extent but bryce is very well funded we had access to the latest research we had a laboratory equipment a team of scientists we were at the very forefront but that all sounds like a good thing not like a reason to kill someone yes but bryce had other plans other ideas about what to do with the research once we isolated the healing gene to put it in simple terms what do you mean i demanded he had figured out a way to use the healing gene in warfare in a battle setting what like to heal wounded soldiers to fix up their injuries so that they could keep fighting thats well something like that prairie said hesitantly the point is that he was willing to sell the research our results to the highest bidder he didnt care who it was as long as they paid her words sank into my mind you mean like other countries possibly prairie said quietly anyone who would pay but i still dont understand why he needs me if he already discovered how to do it using all your research its not quite that simple you cant really decode the dna without a population which means more than one person and bryce was desperate to find another subject so he investigated me and he found out things that even i didnt know she gave me a small sad smile like for instance that i have a niece someone who could be predicted to share the gift so he had those guys spying on me those men that were at grams i said it had to be they were following me around i saw them outside the house one morning and in town talking to people yes i think thats what happened bryce must have hired someone in chicago to find out everything they could about my background once they figured out i was using a fake identity they tracked down who i used to be who i really am and once they got to gypsum it was just a matter of talking to the right people you know how it is in a small town everyone knows everything about everyone else and if they offered money everyones broke i finished the thought people in gypsum tended to mistrust outsiders but if money was involved it probably wouldnt take a whole lot of convincing before they started telling everything they knew but nobody knew about the healing i mean i never did it beforei didnt even know about it myself im afraid bryce knew that it was hereditary because i told him prairie said her voice heavy with regret i just never imagined that there was anyone left i mean besides alice and she cant heal so if your boss knew that gram was weak that she didnt have the gift thats why his men didnt think twice about shooting her she was useless to them all they wanted was you so they came here and someone in gypsum led them to us for a few bucks i felt the bitterness build inside me hot and sharp i doubt anyone had any idea what it would lead to these were professionals hailey they would have had some story some compelling lie that would make people trust them and besides the money bryce would have offeredit would have been hard for anyone to resist your boss has that much money he has more than you can imagine hailey prairie said flatly so if hes so rich and powerful and all how did you get away from him i mean how did you get here without him stopping you prairie glanced at me her expression troubled even in the glow of the dashboard i could see the worry lines etched between her eyes a man can be a genius in some ways and completely dense in others bryce was my lover hailey and even though he managed to keep me fooled for a very long time about who he really was i guess there were ways that he didnt really understand me either you were in love with him i demanded i thought i was but when i realized what he intended to do well lets just say i came to my senses fast so fast that i was able to come up with a plan that would let me get to you first i convinced him that i thought it was a great idea to find you to involve you in our work i pretended i didnt know about the worst of his plans i told him i needed a day to buy a few things for you for your room the room he had already prepared for you at the lab and instead this morning i drove like hell to get to alices praying the whole way i would get there before he gave the order to pick you up but i first saw those men three days ago why did they wait until tonight to try to take me my guess is they werent allowed to do anything without the goahead from bryce and that they were trying to find a way to take you without drawing too much attention ideally without getting the law involved bryce wouldnt have wanted that kind of trouble so how did he figure out you ran away prairie sighed a long sad breath that seemed to weaken her i dont think he did bryce is so confident i dont think it would have ever occurred to him that id go against his wishes but his men must have recognized my car and tracked me to the house i was sloppy i didnt stop to think that bryce would have given them details like that and i bet as soon as they reported in he gave them the goahead to come and get us oh i thought about the two men breaking into our house about the way a gun looked when it was pointed at you about the way bodies looked when they were dead and i couldnt believe wed escaped that we had been attacked and gotten away gram hadnt gram was dead for all i knew dun was dead too and the two attackers i searched my mind to see if there was some delayed grief if i was upset about gram and it just hadnt hit me yet but i came up empty if id ever loved gram that love had died a long time ago now all i felt was relief relief and horror at the blood that had flooded our kitchen floor at the way her eyes stared out at nothing at the knife sticking out of the blond mans shoulder his fingers struggling to close around the handle to keep from focusing on those images i checked on chub he was sleeping contentedly and i stroked his soft hair smoothing it over his warm forehead it was only because i was turned around that the sudden headlights behind us cut directly into my line of vision they came out of nowhereone minute it was all black behind the volvo the next minute twin beams lit up the road the distance between us closing fast the other carbig sleek blackhad to have been trailing close behind but i hadnt noticed it and i knew that prairie hadnt either hold on prairie said now i did i couldnt see past the blinding light into the other car but i grabbed the back of the front seat with my right hand hard to brace myself prairie jammed her foot down on the gas and we shot forward i heard the whine of the volvos engine straining under the pressure but the lights of the other car got steadily brighter prairie swung the wheel to the left into the passing lane and then she hit the brakes so hard the tires squealed and i could feel the rubber screeching across the pavement trying to keep hold of the road there was a terrible jolt as the car behind us hit our back fender i was thrown against the passenger seat and my forehead slammed into the headrest connecting with the hard plastic then i was thrown a second time into the door and my seat belt pulled up hard across my collarbone as prairie hit the gas again and steered into the spin flooring it and coming out of the turn in the direction we had come from how was going through my mind and i even moved my lips to say it but nothing came out my face hurt and i could feel warm blood trickling out of my nose and realized i had smacked it against the headrest but i was too scared to care hang on again prairie ordered and i braced myself and checked on chub he was awake and he looked surprised his big eyes blinking slowly one fist rubbing his mouth but the seat belt held him in place and he was unhurt behind us i could see more of the other car as it backed up into a turn one wheel going off onto the shoulder it lurched then leapt forward and shot off the other side onto the shoulder before correcting and starting toward us my teeth clacked together hard as prairie yanked the wheel again and we headed off the road into a field the lowgrowing cropalfalfa maybe or strawberriesthudding against the undercarriage prairie urged the car through the furrows the wheels finding purchase between the planted rows and biting into the earth the other car fought against the rows i could tell the mistake they were makingtrying to cut across at an angle coming after us the shortest way but the foliage was too tall and it smacked against the car as it was mowed under we had a chance prairie increased the distance between us and the other car as they struggled for control plants and clumps of dirt spinning up into the cars wheel wells and axles i leaned forward to say something i dont know what exactly and the words died on my lips as i saw that prairie was steering us straight toward a leaning structure silhouetted against the inky night a big old barn with a sloped roof prairie i managed to get out terrified i reached for herto do what im not sure push the wheel away maybe out of the path of the collision that would kill usbut prairie spoke first just as a cloud scudded in front of the weak moon and everything went even darker leaving only our headlights cutting into the field ahead trust me hailey chapter i guess i didnt trust her i squeezed my eyes shut and groped for chubs hand if we were going to die i wanted to be holding on to him when it happened i pitched forward again as prairie slammed on the brakes before we reached the barn and then we hit the volvo took the impact in its solid metal frame and even though the jolt slammed me hard against the seat belt i knew right away that the barn hadnt stopped the car wed hit it going about thirty i guessed and the big flatsided wood doors splintered and went flying inward prairie pumped the brakes a couple more times and i had the impression of a dark tunnel the insides of the barn full of crazy angles and hanging rafters and spinning bits of hay in the headlights beams i could make out empty stalls on either side and then we drove through the other side of the barn and it was like the first time a thudding crash and wood flying everywhere i had time to scream prairie what are you before she yanked the steering wheel one last time sharp to the left the wheels bounced over ruts and rocks and spun engine screaming for a second another a third before they caught and the car jerked ahead suddenly everything went dark as prairie cut the lights and ignition and the car shuddered to a stop next to the ruined barn what are you i tried again but prairie clapped a hand over my mouth and twisted around in her seat to look out the back as i did the same i heard the roar of the black car and it came bursting through the hole we had made in the barn faster than we had hurtling past us and then suddenly tilting up its front wheels lifting off the ground for a moment it looked as though it was going to go airborne and then it made a sickening lurch and the back of the car rose up in the air it seemed to go in slow motion the back end flipping over the front in a crazy somersault before it disappeared down down and there was a horrible crash and a bright flash sparks orange in the night and then a series of smaller echoes whered it go i asked forgetting to keep my voice down i think i might have screamed it chub started to wail but prairie was already undoing her seat belt out of the car she said now get chub i didnt have to be told twice but when i turned to him i saw that hed somehow been thrown clear of the seat belt onto the floor of the car next to rascal he was making short choked sounds as though he was trying to cry but couldnt i grabbed for him but when i touched his arm my fingers brushed against sharp bone poking from the skin and he screamed terrified i carried chub from the car as carefully as i could in the moonlight i could see that his arm was broken above the elbow as my heart plummeted his cries became even sharper with pain hes hurt hes hurt i shrieked at prairie she ran to my side and stretched out her arms to take him but i held him even tighter i can fix him prairie said no ill do it but youre just starting youre not ready yet i need to do it i insisted my fingers were already closing around the injury carefully avoiding the protruding bone gently finding their place on chubs fevered skin for a moment prairie said nothing but our eyes met and there was almost a glow around us an energy that bound the three of us all right prairie finally said i closed my eyes for a moment and willed my thoughts to slow down my mind to empty and soon i could feel the energy begin to flow from me to chub tá mé mol seo prairie murmured and i joined in my lips forming the words that seemed as familiar as if id been saying them forever our voices blended and twined together until they were almost one i felt chubs pulse go slow and steady and then his whimpers eased and he was quiet the torn flesh met and closed beneath my touch and i felt the shift of his arm bones as the broken place mended i brushed my fingertips along his skin and found the ridge where it had split but even that seemed to smooth out as the seconds passed i healed him i said in wonder yes there was something like awe in prairies voice you are a true healer hailey a natural even your mother had to work hard at it and she was twice the healer ill ever be but you youre something even more rare through the haze of my focus on chub i heard the black car sparking and sputtering in what i could now see was a dry creek bed the land behind the barn led to the creek bank and stopped abruptly the banks had been carved by the rushing waters of years of spring floods leaving behind craggy dirt walls that dropped several feet in places we have to go prairie said taking my arm and pulling me away from the volvo and the barn and the wreck of the black car tell rascal to come only then did i notice him sitting by the car he didnt look frightened or even particularly interested in the commotion come on boy i said and he got to his feet without hesitation and trotted to catch up with us i looked past him at the wreck and wondered if the men inside had survived shouldnt we see ifi mean what if they need help they were trying to run us off the road hailey do you really want to give them a chance to catch up with us no i quickened my pace to keep up with her glancing back to see if our pursuers were clambering out of the car someones bound to call this in soon prairie added the smokes got to be visible for miles she was right the smoke pouring from the wreck was an ugly cloud spreading across the pristine starry sky i forced myself to look at the ground in front of us it wouldnt do to trip over something and drop chub hed already been hurt and healed twice in one evening i figured that was plenty where are we going we were on a faint path a trail of flattened weeds running parallel to the creek bed far off to the left up a hill and past a neat vegetable patch surrounded by chicken wire was a square farmhouse the trail was narrow enough that we went single file prairie leading then me and chub with rascal taking up the rear were nearly to tipton prairie said softly this is the burnetts place old man burnett well he wasnt that old back when i knew him i knew his youngest claude i recognized that name claude burnett was a man in his late thirties and people said he wasnt quite right he came to gypsum some saturdays in a clean shirt tucked into pants pulled up too high his father leaning on him and leading him at the same time with a flash of regret i remembered id once teased claude id offered him half of a milky way bar id been saving he was waiting in the shade outside the drugstore while his dad picked up a prescription or something i showed him the candy bar and when he put out his thick hand for it i whipped it around behind my back you didnt say please id said relishing the feel of my heart pounding under my tshirt i was eight or so and it was such a novelty to see someone who made people even more uncomfortable than i did i know him i said now he was your moms friend she was always nice to him she taught him to talk what do you mean prairie shrugged he didnt talk much only a couple of words clover got him saying whole sentences just another kind of healing i guess i played here too when i was little mary used to bring us theres a shortcutjust a little ways prairie said or at least there used to be here i think this is it she led the way off the path down to a series of flat stones set into the creek bed barely visible in the moonlight we didnt need them to cross since the creek was dry but i stepped carefully so i wouldnt twist an ankle as we eased down the bank i was thinking about claude and about chub who was also not a talker could chub be healed that way prairie led us up the other bank this comes up on ellis land you know the ellises i dont think so their kids went to school with me and your mom but here yes i think this is it the path continued on the other side a trampeddown narrow trail that led up over the bank and toward a cluster of lights far ahead as we drew nearer i saw it was another farmhouse with a barn and some sheds set back a few hundred yards how did you know to do that i demanded how did you crash into the right part of the barn and all how did you know the car would break through and not like hit a beam or something luck prairie said and i could almost hear a faint smile in her voice dont you think we were due for some luck besides barn doors hailey theyre just big pieces of wood but how could you see the doors i could hardly even see the barn but you had to have hit it just exactly right or or wed be dead prairie slowed turned on the path in front of me i just remembered she said simply i thought about clover and how she and claude liked to play cowboys here and i shut my eyes and tried to picture it in my mind where the doors were you shut your eyes i was dumbfounded she flashed me a grin and it only lasted a fraction of a second in the weak moonlight it seemed like a good idea at the time the thought of prairie flying across the field with her eyes closed was terrifying and maybe just a little bit thrilling at least that was what i figured the zip of sensation was that snaked up my spine prairie continued on the path striding confidently and for a crazy moment i wondered if she had her eyes shut now if she was leading us away from trouble with nothing but a feeling to guide her i dont know why i didnt feel more frightened weirdly the thought almost made me feel a little safer chub was so heavy in my arms that everything from my wrist down had gone numb but at least he had quieted his sweatdamp forehead radiating heat against my face i reached out and touched prairies pretty tailored jacket and then i gripped it tightly and closed my eyes and willed my feet to walk in her footsteps rascal staying right behind me if she noticed she didnt say anything she never stumbled and neither did i as we approached the cluster of buildings the ellises barn was in better shape than the burnetts barn with hay stacked high in the loft and a couple of tractors parked neatly gleaming in the moonlight when prairie and i opened the door stay here she said ill try not to be too long i didnt even ask her where she was going i sat on the seat of the smaller tractorreally more like a big riding mowerand it felt good to relax my arms aching from the effort of holding chub rascal lay down next to the tractor ignoring the scrabbling and scratching of creatures in the barn i used to be scared of things like that mice and rats and bats now i was happy for the company i closed my eyes and tried to sort through the emotions swirling in my head i felt as though my defenses were starting to fall apart at the edges the past few days were like some sort of horror movie and i couldnt quite believe that i was a part of it that any of it had even happened but i had blood on my clothes to prove it gram was dead a lot of people were wounded in our kitchen and in the wreck of a car less than a mile away and the life i had led beforethe one i had hated so muchwas in the past i wondered how id stayed calm enough to get through the past few hours maybe i was in a state of shock or maybe i had just gotten so used to dealing with the challenges of life with gram that id built up more defenses than an ordinary person would have in a situation like this but i wasnt sure how long i could maintain my calm what would happen if i started letting things bother me again if i let myself start feeling things the thought was terrifying at least as terrifying i realized as i sat shivering in the dark barn as being shot i dont know how long i sat there but when prairie slipped back into the barn and said my name softly i jumped lets go she said her voice full of urgency i lifted chub and followed her to the front of the barn where a gravel drive led to the road a car idled there exhaust billowing up white against the first pink streaks of dawn i was surprised to see the car waiting but prairie did things she got what we needed i didnt know exactly how but at the moment it didnt matter is this the ellises car i asked she frowned her eyebrows pinching together yes yes it is im sorry we have to take it hailey we wont damage it and theyll get it back but she didnt finish the sentence but she didnt have to we needed the car we needed to get away even if i didnt understand exactly what we were escaping from i understood that when i opened the door rascal jumped into the car and lay down on the floor and i got chub settled under the seat belt i was getting good at strapping him in but as prairie drove slowly down the gravel drive toward the main road she shook her head and said we have got to get that boy a car seat i sank down low in the passenger seat and watched the farmhouse as we rolled by the ellises had a carport so it would have been easy enough for prairie to take the carexcept she would have had to unlock it and start it unless she knew how to hotwire it and if that was what she did i didnt want to know not quite yet anyway i wanted to think of her as someone who worried about chub having a car seat because if she was thinking about chub he would be that much safer as far as i knew i was the only person who had ever cared about him and i knew he was a hard kid to fall for he was behind in so many ways but prairie cared about him and as we pulled out onto the main road and picked up speed i was grateful i was so tired riding in the ellises buick you wouldnt think a person whod been chased and shot at who had watched people die would be able to lie down and sleep but that was what i wanted more than anything just to sleep prairie didnt look so good her mouth was pulled down in a thinking frown and her hands gripped the steering wheel tightly we should make it in about seven hours she said six and a half if we really push it hard where are we going prairie was silent for so long i thought she wasnt going to answer me but eventually she gave me a smile that looked like it took a lot of effort home chapter when i woke up the sun was streaming through the buicks windows and i had to go to the bathroom were in illinois coming up on springfield theres a walmart in twenty miles or so prairie said we need to pick up a few things can you wait that long um okay i was hungry too but decided not to mention it somehow it didnt seem like something i should admit to after a night like wed had who thinks of food i did which made me wonder on the one hand i felt like i should feel worse like maybe in shock from the horror of it all or something i kept waiting for the guilt to sneak up on me but it just didnt happen i even felt a tiny sense of anticipation despite everything that had happened we were going somewhere new id never left missouri before id only been out of gypsum a few times on school field trips to hannibal and st joseph to see mark twains childhood home and the pony express museum but id never been to a city my stomach growled again to cover the sound i asked prairie something that had been bothering me how could you not have known my mom was pregnant prairies jaw tensed and she didnt look at me she hadnt slept at all and it showed in the faint lines under her eyes and around her mouth when i left gypsum i moved to chicago i wrote to clover almost every day she finally said i knew there would be trouble if alice ever found out that clover knew where i was so i told her to make up a story that wed had a really bad fight and that we swore wed never speak to each other again why would gram care she had plans for me just like i think she did for you her words filled me with dread what do you mean you have to think about who alice was when she was younger she tried to be a healer for a long time before she gave up mary told me that alice was devastated when she finally had to accept that she didnt have the gift she never got over her failure and to cope with it she turned all her misery into blame blame but who could she blame for that alice decided that the reason she was damaged was that the tarbells had mixed their blood with outsiders that theyd married and bore children outside the families and that had corrupted the lineage what do you mean the families what families our ancestors all emigrated here together the morries the tarbells were all descended from the same village in ireland were irish yes prairie smiled but it didnt reach her troubled eyes our ancestors lived in the same village for centuries when they came here they started over new names new skills new homes but the plan was always that they would stay together they were known as the banished and they wait i cut her off what had milla saidaint any of us banished got any say in things why were they called that no one remembers anymore i mean there were all these stories when your mom and i were little mary would tell us bedtime stories about faeries and blessings and curses you dont believe in them i prairie hesitated choosing her words carefully its not that i dont believe the blessings were real even if i cant explain them even if they dont fit neatly with what science tells us the banished are united by some powerful things mary always told me that we tarbells were meant to serve the banished to heal them when they needed us but that wasnt the whole story the rest of the women had a responsibility to keep the village the people together after they left ireland thats why we can sense each other why we are drawn to each other at last an explanation for the way i felt when i was around the morries even if it sounded crazy a part of me was relieved that i hadnt imagined it that it might be real even if it was something out of a fable what else well when they left ireland the men were all given the gift of visions they could see into the future or see things that were happening elsewhere it was meant to protect them from enemies disasters even things like storms that could damage the crops the morries have visions i thought of the boys at school their shadowed faces angry stubborn bleak all but sawyers not much anymore that gift that power is mostly gone what happened to it prairie sighed a few generations ago everything started to fall apart i guess it came from marrying outside the banished it weakened the gift mary said she remembered the first broken healer when she was a little girl a tarbell daughter born like alice sick and weak and mean but she didnt grow to adulthood mary said the strongest healers were pure banished i think it broke her heart when one of her own daughters was damaged and alice could never accept it i think she always believed that if she could just go back to the source of the gift she could somehow heal herself go back to the source to ireland my pulse quickened as i thought of the airplane ticket to dublin theres something i havent told you i said and explained about the folder id found in grams room hailey frowned so alice really meant to go she used to talk about it sometimes only i cant imagine it would have made a difference i dont know how it could change anything just to go back to the village if it did then all the morries could be fixed prairie said gently it doesnt work that way hailey the changes in the banished theyre deep in the foundations of who they are now they are afraid of each other of what theyve become the men theyve lost their their moral compass i guess youd say a lot of them are addicts they dont want to work they dont take care of their families but not all of them i said thinking of sawyer oh definitely not there are still banished men who are born with all the determination and idealism of the ones who first settled here but in general well i guess thats how it got to be called trashtown you know i saw a picture once that mary had it was almost a hundred years old and you wouldnt even know it was trashtown little houses all fixed up flower beds happy families everyone dressed up and smiling i thought about the morries at school their patched and dirty clothes the sickly malnourished way they looked i thought of milla the combination of fury and fear she wore on her face i dont understand why they hate me so much now the morries its fear hailey they think that after alice was born damaged that the gift was turned into a curse they dont believe you truly have the power to heal just like they never believed clover or i could theyre afraid that if you try to heal someone youll end up cursing them instead you never healed anyone when you lived here alice wouldnt let us she made us go to school in tipton so we wouldnt be around the morries mary taught us in secret alice always said shed beat us if she ever caught us healing why i think because she never got over being damaged she tried to heal you know when she was young mary told me and she couldnt bear the thought that her daughters could do something she couldnt and so you just didnt i tried to imagine resisting the urge now that i knew what i could do i took care of people sometimes but usually i didnt even tell them you knowa friend with a strawberry birthmark another one with bruises from when her stepfather beat her we rode in silence for a while each lost in our own thoughts did you ever know your dad no and alice never told me who he was i never even knew if clover had the same father i couldnt imagine gram young couldnt imagine a man falling in love with her wanting a child with her what about your grandfather no he died young not long after alice was born and mary never talked about him all alice ever told me about him was that he was mixed blood was he yes there werent very many purebloods left even a generation ago and marys husband was part cherokee and part german how can you be sure about that prairie gave me a quick sad smile before returning her attention to the road i studied genetics when i finally went to college and then i worked in a lab by the time bryce hired me id traced my origins pretty thoroughly you can tell all that just from blood youd be surprised the tests are a little complex but you can track your heredity with considerable accuracy i thought for a moment could you test me i mean could you figure out what my dad was not the way youre thinking hailey unless you were doing fullon dna testing and looking for genetic paternity or something like that and besides if youre wondering about the healing it doesnt matter alice was wrong as long as a healers partner is part banished she will pass on the gift nine times out of ten you can tell that from your testing i demanded surprised no that i learned from mary its not exactly scientific but i have no reason to doubt its true mary told me that some healers are more powerful than others depending on the blood of their fathers and other factors too some of which i doubt well ever understand like alice i dont know why the gift was corrupted in her i sometimes i can almost feel pity for her for the way she was born with the powers stunted along with her body but then she didnt finish the sentence but she didnt have to i guessed we both had our memories of grams meanness her cruelty yes it was possible to feel compassion for her until you remembered who she was so gram wanted to make sure you married one of the banished i guessed so your children didnt end up like her thats right prairie said but it went further than that alice started to feel that she was responsible for ensuring that the tarbell line continued she used to say that when i graduated from high school shed choose one of the purebloods for me and when you left there was only clover and ive always wondered it took only a moment for me to figure it out you think gram chose someone for my mom once she realized you werent coming back yes prairie said softly i think she didnt want to wait until clover graduated and i think shecloverdidnt have any choice in the matter that hewhoever he washe must have as prairie struggled to find the right words i realized why her pain showed through whenever she talked about clover about my mother gram had sacrificed her had handed her off to one of the morriessomeone like the crueleyed shadowfleeting boys i knew from the halls of gypsum highso that she could be impregnated by a pureblood so that her child would carry on the tarbell legacy and be a true healer horror washed over me closing my throat so it was difficult to breathe i was the child of a violation of someone even younger than me when i thought of my mother alone having lost the one person who cared about her who could protect her my heart fractured did she die in childbirth i asked i had to know oh hailey prairie took a deep breath no clover killed herself she but i couldnt speak i had always thought of my mother as a stranger until i met prairie gram had said she was mentally disabled and i had believed her and somehow that made my mother less real to me i felt like i had been born of nothing in a way like i had just appeared one day in the house i grew up in you were a few weeks old when she died prairie continued quietly bryces investigators found the records at the county office and he told me a few days ago i was devastated thinking about how frightened clover must have been how did she you know she hanged herself hailey in the bedroom closet bryce found the police reports my closet no wonder i had been drawn to that tiny space no wonder id found the secret hiding place it was her presence id felt there her sadness but why i think she felt like she was out of options she was too ashamed to tell me she was pregnant and i think she knew that if she had told me i would have come back i think she was protecting me in her own way but what about i swallowed the lump in my throat what about me i was thinking didnt she care about me didnt she want to make sure her baby was all right you must never think that your mother didnt love you prairie said fiercely clover loved you with all her heart but she knew that alice would have taken you from her like she tried to take everything alice saw you as the future of the tarbells and that was all she cared about a last chance for her to get it right a last chance to purify the bloodline you are the future hailey and she wouldnt have allowed anything to interfere with that i am sure that she would have put clover out on the street before she let her raise you i could barely absorb the full horror of what prairie was saying i thought of all the times gram whispered and laughed with dun acey the way he looked at me with his hungry eyes i wondered if he was the one gram had chosen for me the man who would father my child the pureblood banished who would ensure that my baby was a healer i thought i would throw up i made a strangled sound in my throat and prairie looked at me in alarm hailey are you all right the exits coming up in a minutecan you make it i think so i said swallowing hard just tell me the rest all of it how did you find out my mom was dead what did you do when she stopped answering my letters i got worried i had saved a little money by then so i took a bus back to gypsum to get her but when i got to the house she wasnt there and alice told me she had killed herself i was just going to leave all i could think to do was get out of there out of the house away from alice but she stopped me she told me that she could make people think i did it she said clover had been talking about the huge fight wed had the one you told her to make up when you wrote to her yes and she said id better not let any of the authorities find out i was in town or theyd take me in for questioning or worse now i understand she was just trying to make sure that i never came back because if i ever found out about you i might fight for you and she was not about to lose you that was the final piece of the puzzle now i had the whole story of why id grown up without a mother she hadnt abandoned me on purpose and if prairie had come for me long ago i wouldnt have chub i looked over the seat at him rosycheeked in sleep his mouth a sweet little o until chub i had grown up with no love at all but he had given me a reason to keep going to keep trying prairie had saved me last night i thought as we reached the exit but maybe chub had saved me first we coasted off the highway almost directly into an enormous parking lot i was starving and i knew chub would be too the minute he woke up were going to eat here im afraid so theres a mcdonalds in the walmart ill pick up what we need while you take chub and get breakfast for the two of you what about you prairie smiled unexpectedly and genuinely if you would get me a sausage and egg biscuit i would be very grateful i havent had one of those in ages oh and some hash browns maybe and an orange juice and a giant coffee all right she pressed some money into my hands and i closed my fingers over it how do you like your coffee blacks fine listen hailey youve got some bruising it might be better if you she reached out and pushed my hair across my forehead arranging it so that it hung over the side of my face prairie had taken off her jacket at least there was no blood on her silk top shed combed her hair and put on lipstick but she still looked like shed been up all night i need to walk rascal i said leaning over to check on him he was lying on the floor of the car head resting on his paws okay ill get chub ready by the time i had taken rascal for a quick trip to a grassy median prairie had chub out of the car he was pointing to the giant store and making excited noises i opened the car door and rascal jumped obediently into the backseat as we walked through the huge parking lot i decided two things first today was the day i was going to start drinking coffee and second i too would drink it black cream and sugar were things that could slow a person down by now back in gypsum the ellises would have realized their car was missing wouldnt they they would have gone out to get the paper or let the cat in and if they glanced over to the carport although it was saturday maybe they were sleeping in a quarter mile away if the cops hadnt already been called to the scene old man burnett was waking up to discover a giant hole in his barn and a car crashed in his creek not to mention prairies car that old brown volvo abandoned behind the barn i wondered how long it would take for someone to stumble on the carnage at our house gram was well known to a few people in gypsum and the surrounding county but they werent the kind to call the authorities it would probably be someone elsesomeone selling aluminum siding or checking the water meterwho would end up making that awful discovery inside the store an old man with a bright blue vest shoved a shopping cart toward us welcome to walmart he said thanks i were just going to uh have breakfast i said certain he would see how nervous i was and know something was wrong but as prairie slipped into the crowd of shoppers he turned away from me and pushed the cart at the people who came through the door after us i saw a sign for the restrooms and dragged chub toward them inside there was one of those changing stations that pull down from the wall i wondered if it would hold chub who weighed fortytwo pounds now according to grams old peeling scale in here i said pulling him toward the largest stall there were two other women at the sinks one washing her hands one putting on lipstick i hoped they would just assume that chub was using the toilet himself i realized i didnt have any diapers or wipes with me how i was going to clean him he was bound to be soaked i grabbed a handful of paper towels and wet them at the sink before we went into the stall chub said something i didnt understand and tugged impatiently at his elastic waistband i helped him out of his damp diaper and then to my amazement he clambered up on the toilet a dozen times at home i had put him on the toilet promising to read him stories or get him a cookie anything i could think of to get him used to the idea of using itand he always scrambled right back down and ran away but now he had done it on his own he finished up climbed back down and pulled up his pants i helped him wash his hands at the sinkhe loved the foaming soap dispenserand as we were drying our hands a short woman with frizzy red hair turned to me and said oh hes sure a sweetheart is he your little brother and before i even really thought about it i said yes maam she gave us a big smile and as we followed her out of the restroom i thought well why not there wasnt anyone who was going to argue we could be related both of us with pale freckled skin and later if he grew up looking totally different if we were in the habit of thinking of each other that waymaybe it wouldnt matter maybe we had a chance to be normal after all at mcdonalds i ordered myself the same thing prairie had asked for and hotcakes and sausage for chub we ate quickly and i tried not to look around at the other customers i figured if i didnt look at them they wouldnt look at me when prairie wheeled up with her shopping cart full of bags i was feeling better we made our way back to the car and she handed me a large box heres a car seat she said see if you can get it figured out while i put the rest of this stuff in the trunk it ended up taking both of us to set the seat up prairie reading from the instruction book and me fiddling around with the straps and the seat belt rascal didnt seem at all interested in the process barely looking up as we worked chub patted the plastic sides of the new seat with a thoughtful look on his face i crawled back into the front seat prairie stuffed the instructions and the packaging back in the box and tossed it in the backseat then she pulled a plastic bag out of her purse i thought she said and then hesitated she reached in the bag and took out a small blue stuffed giraffe with glossy yarn forming a loopy mane down its long neck the legs were loose and floppy and it had a sweet face with long eyelashes embroidered above little button eyes she handed it to chub who held it close to his nose turning it this way and that raff he said prairie raff giraffe he really was talking how was this happening was it because of me could i be healing him somehow without even trying id healed three times milla rascal and chub all in the past few days maybe it was now such a part of me that i couldnt turn it off it didnt seem possible but so much of what had happened was unbelievable i handed prairie the paper sack with her biscuit and hash browns i fixed the coffee cups lid so she could drink folding back the little plastic tab just like id learned to do twenty minutes earlier when id drunk my first cup of coffee prairie nibbled at the food while she drove slowly out of the parking lot and back onto the interstate she consulted her phone now and then and i realized she was following downloaded directions where are we going i asked as she turned onto a multilane road lined with strip malls well thats a little complicated she said keep your eyes out for aoh there it is she turned into a parking lot in front of a row of lowslung buildings and passed a dry cleaner a thai restaurant a bakery she parked in front of a hertz car rental agency then turned to face me with a serious expression this is going to sound a little strange she said but we have to make it look like were renting a car make it look like but were not really renting it yes how can i okay remember when i told you that banished men used to have visions that they could see the future yes a prickly feeling had started at the base of my spine i sensed that what was coming was more bad news and i wasnt sure i was ready to hear more but what choice did i have purebloods can still do it some of them anyway well a few she bit her lip and stared at her hands which were clasped tightly rattler can rattler sikes as if there was any other rattler just saying his name dialed up the prickling to fullscale fear prairie nodded rattler and i have a history when we were kids he used to like to follow me around even then he had visions and they just got stronger over time but that means he knows exactly where we are the thought made me want to jump out of the car and run it doesnt work quite like that he cant see all of the future or even choose what parts to see he just opens his mind and he gets flashes pictures pieces of the future sometimes he has visions of things happening at the same time but in a different place i remembered his unfocused gaze in the kitchen the way he went very still as though he was focusing in on something no one else could see somethings not right a car men its men in it hed had a vision of safians men but what are we going to do i demanded panicked prairie laid a hand on my arm stay calm hailey thats why were here were going to create a few scenarios throw him off well make it look like were renting a car well drive to the bus station ill take a few different routes make it look like we could be going south or west we just need to confuse him so he doesnt know which way to come after us but eventually hes going to stop prairie said gently but firmly dont get ahead of yourself rattler can only see me when were connected when theres some energy between us right now were scared and were bound by what happened at alices but we will get past that well put it behind us and the connection will be broken and he wont be able to find us i dont understand what do you mean youre connected the banished were drawn to each other like i told you before and theres an energy around that but if you were to leave that energy would slowly fade your mind and your heart would focus on other things and the attraction would die down the connection would be broken not forever but youd be functioning on your own outside the influence of the other banished thats what i did when i went to chicago the energy faded for me and rattler was a part of my past and he couldnt see me anymore but when you came back to gypsum it opened it all up again the connection the energy but we can fight it ive fought it before ive gotten away from rattler before there was strong conviction in her voice but edged with something i didnt like at all something dark and terrifying it almost sounded like she was trying to convince herself but it wasnt like we had any other options what can i do you and chub take rascal for a walk theres bottled water in the trunk and a plastic bowl give me five or ten minutes i did as she directed glancing in the plateglass window as i took care of rascal she was having a conversation with the man behind the desk who was consulting his computer monitor chub was happy to be out of the car and he walked along beside me picking up rocks and sticks that caught his eye in the bright light i could see that rascal had blood along his neck and back and i realized that chub must have bled on him in the volvo i wiped him off with some of the bottled water and a handful of tissues from the box the ellises kept in their car he didnt mind didnt even seem to notice i put my hand in front of his face to lick but he just stared at the lanes of traffic whizzing by i wondered if he was thinking about chasing cars but he didnt seem interested he hadnt wagged his tail or perked up his ears at all and i wondered again if he was having some sort of reaction to his accident if something inside him was broken but when i said rascal come he trotted along right away and jumped back in the car if there was something wrong with him it wasnt brain damage when prairie came back out she seemed a little calmer one down she said after consulting her phone again she pulled out of the parking lot next stop the bus station prairie i asked after wed driven for a few minutes what happened to rattler at the house oh that prairie said a ghost of a smile flickered across her face i uh take kickboxing that was a roundhouse kick were not supposed to use it in class well anyway i always wanted to try it i guess it worked yeahi guess so rattler wasnt dead hed sold us out and nearly gotten me kidnapped and as far as i knew his only injury was from being kicked by prairie i wished he was deadand then i wondered if he was seeing us even now it made me shiver with fear and revulsion i barely paid attention as prairie took smaller and less crowded streets driving through a series of neighborhoods that grew shabbier and dirtier before she turned into the parking lot of a bus station this time well all go she said we left rascal in the car with an opened can of dog food that prairie had bought at walmart we were gone for about a half hour pretending to buy tickets what really happened was prairie asked a lot of questions about when buses were leaving for various places and at the end she took a couple of folded paper timetables and tucked them into her purse we sat in uncomfortable chairs for a while i read an old magazine that someone had left behind and prairie got chub a lemonade from a vending machine it didnt take long to get boring that surprised me i figured id never be able to relax but when prairie murmured that it was time to move on i was relieved next was the airport that was a little more interesting though springfields airport was tiny and didnt look anything like the ones in the movies still there were people milling around carrying bags dragging suitcasesit made me wish i was flying somewhere id never really thought id have a chance to but now it seemed possible now that i was with prairie it wasnt just that she had money and experience either she made me feel like i could do things id never considered doing after the airport prairie took us into springfields downtown there were enough tall buildings to make it seem like a real city we circled for a while sometimes barely moving in traffic and by the time prairie headed back out of town it was late in the afternoon the final place prairie took us was a motel an unremarkable place in a beatendown neighborhood near the interstate okay she said as we pulled into the lot i have got to get some rest before we go any further im going to get us a roomstay here okay i didnt argue i didnt want to admit to prairie that i had never been in a motel before gypsum had twoa super and a motor court called the skyview id walked past them hundreds of times wondering what it would be like to have a room to myself everything clean and neat chub was napping so i left him in the car and walked rascal nearby i watched prairie go through the glass doors and into the lobby where i could see her talking to a man behind a counter after a short while she returned i got us a room near the back she said as she drove the car around the corner of the motel to a space that was partly hidden behind a dumpster i didnt tell them about rascal well have to sneak him in youre worried about the cops looking for this car arent you and the guys bryce hired she nodded i smeared mud on the plates this morning before we left so the numbers hard to make out i helped her get the bags out of the trunk chub held my hand and yawned as we followed prairie to the last door on the first floor then i went back and carried rascal in with my sweatshirt draped over him not that anyone noticed us our room had a view of the end of the parking lot and a dennys next door beyond on the other side of the fence was the back of another restaurant with more dumpsters and delivery doors and trash blowing along the pavement a man sat on an upturned bucket smoking a cigarette i knew what motel rooms looked like from tv this one had a smell not bad but both chemical and musty i set my backpack down on one of the beds and watched prairie unpack the walmart bags i hope youre up for a new look she said and i could tell she was trying to sound cheerful despite her exhaustion she laid out a box of loréal couleur experte on the nightstand between the beds next came a plastic comb and a pair of scissors she upended the two largest bags and a pile of tangled clothing fell onto the bed the last bag contained a handful of little plastic makeup cases plus an enormous pair of sunglasses with white frames is that all like a disguise i asked yes we need to do what we can to make ourselves invisible so we can get back to chicago and then find somewhere we can be safe safe from things i never knew existed before today from ancient magic and curses and dark secrets things out of a twisted fairy tale and at the other end of a spectrum from a man who wanted to use me to experiment on a scientist i thought about the science class id never be attending again realized to my surprise that there were a few things id miss about my old life after all chub was wandering around the room touching things exploring he found the phone and pushed at the buttons prairie sank down on one of the beds beside her purchases and massaged her temples with her fingertips seriously hailey we need to sleep just for a couple of hours or so she took her cell phone out of her purse and pressed the keys im setting an alarm ill get us up in plenty of time to do what we need to okay okay i said sighing it wasnt worth fighting her over and i knew she was probably right anyway even though i felt wired now i was bound to crash soon enough come here i said to chub nap time nap time he repeated but instead of getting into the other bed he climbed up with prairie she must have been mostly asleep already because she just made a sighing sound and looped an arm around chub who snuggled in close before even a minute passed i could tell by his breathing he was asleep i tried not to be jealous to be glad that chub was as comfortable around prairie as i was and mostly i was glad except that now i was alone and i didnt want to be the fears the anxiety were simmering inside me and i was afraid that if i was left alone with my thoughts theyd bubble up and take over i looked at rascal who was sitting motionless next to the door cmere boy i said and he got up and trotted over to me up i said and he jumped up onto the bed i wrapped my arm around him and pulled him a little bit closer he didnt smell very good a combination of wet dog and something else something unfamiliar but he was still better than nothing i was worried that he wasnt back to normal yet but now wasnt the time to obsess over it i switched off the lamp with the heavy drapes pulled shut the room was as dark as if it was midnight there was a hum coming from the ceiling a fan circulating the strangesmelling air prairies cell phone glowed on the bedside table i was sure id never get to sleep with everything i had to think about but the next sound i heard was prairies alarm chapter rascal was curled up against me oblivious to the cell phones beeping my mouth felt dry as a desert as i slid out from under the covers in the other bed prairie sat up and turned off her phone she rubbed her eyes and yawned i went to the bathroom drank two glasses of water and splashed cold water on my face when i came out prairie had gotten up and lined up her purchases on her bed well hello sunshine she said cheerfully what are you so happy about nothing much other than i think we managed to throw off rattler i mean if he hasnt showed up yet i guess were doing okay you think that worked all that driving around hes not here is he so it seems to me he must have gotten sidetracked by one of our visits for all we know hes on a bus to texas she gathered her supplies i know a shower would probably feel great right now but how about if i color your hair first youll need to rinse out the color after it sets so you might as well wait to get in the tub the sleep had done prairie good in the light of the lamps shed switched on i could see that the dark shadows had nearly disappeared from under her eyes i ran a hand through my hair it was almost perfectly straight rich brown with natural highlights i knew people paid a lot of money for color like that uh all right i finally said my hair was the one thing about me that i always knew was special but if it meant our safety id get over it what color i thought wed try to match chubs make it look like youre brother and sister i glanced at chub who was rolling over and sighing in a tangle of covers his hair was so pale it was almost white with a wash of gold i couldnt imagine that color on me i need to cut it too prairie said apologetically i wouldnt ask if it wasnt so important while she mixed up the dye filling the room with an acidy smell i stripped down to the tank top i was wearing under my flannel shirt let me cut some first prairie said after she spread a sheet from her bed on the floor in the center of the room then put the desk chair on top of it just get some of the length off then ill shape it when the colors done okay i sat in the chair and she ran her hands through my hair she gathered it into a ponytail and twisted it i shut my eyes and tried to relax the first cut left my head feeling strangely light i didnt want to think about my hair falling to the floor so i asked prairie something id been wondering how could you not know that bryce wasnt who you thought i mean you were you know sleeping with him i thought but didnt say prairie paused i could feel the heat from her skin her hands inches from my face i think deep down i knew something was wrong but its amazing what you can convince yourself of when youre in denial here im going to start with the color okay she began to dab it onto my hair starting at the roots and working out to the ends it smelled terrible and stung my scalp what did you like about him i asked i mean at the beginning a little bit of the dye dribbled toward my eyebrow well for one thing i thought he was hot i brushed the dye away in what way kind of a i dont know cleancut look he dresses wellreally well he likes expensive clothes and hes always worked out a lot hes a little compulsive about it i guess you could say hes average height but hes got a naturally athletic build broad shoulders strong arms light hair or dark brown kind of a medium brown i guess and brown eyes he didnt sound bad but he also didnt sound all that special what else well hes incredibly smart i think that was the biggest thing to tell you the truth he has a doctorate or at least he says he does though now i dont know how much of what he told me was true and how much was lies i thought about that the smartest guy at gypsum high was mac blair but it would be a pretty huge stretch to call him hot he wasnt a geek exactlyit was just that his mind was always on something else usually some random fact hed picked up online how did that make you like him prairie didnt answer for a moment her hands on my hair were confident and efficient distributing the dye evenly over my head part of it was i guess that i hadnt known anyone like him before most of the guys id knownwell you know how it is in high school its not like anyone was even all that curious about the world outside gypsum and i went to this little junior college and night school anything i could do to get enough credits to graduate and it wasnt like i was around geniuses there either even when i was working in the labs a lot of the guys i met they werent really all that happy to be there they werent committed to the work not like bryce but it was also i wanted so badly to do something with my gift i wanted to matter and bryce seemed like he could make that happen i guess it was a little bit of a power thing you know you thought that if you were with bryce he could open doors for you get you a better job more money stuff like that no not exactly more like with his background and resources he made me think the things i dreamed about were actually possible that they could happen in my lifetime i mean now i know i was only seeing what i wanted to see and believing what i wanted to believe but it was just so easy to put my faith in bryce this incredibly successful guy and i was blinded by the fact that he wanted me but what about other people the people you worked with didnt any of them get suspicious about him if they were closer to the data didnt they wonder what he was researching well yes about six months ago bryce started replacing a lot of the employees whod been there a long time he brought in people from all over the country even a couple from other parts of the world they were his inner circle and when they werent meeting with bryce they kept to themselves i think they knew exactly what was going on i think theyre in on it he cant do this on his own not without getting caught what about the people he fired werent they angry or suspicious about what he was doing bryce gave them a lot of money made them sign all kinds of nondisclosure documents and most people knew about my relationship with bryce and kept their distance so i didnt stay in touch with the ones who left i did have this one friend she smiled at the memory he was hilarious his name was paul and he was our tech guy just this brilliant geeky guy who could make you laugh he only left a few weeks ago i think bryce had trouble finding someone who could do what paul could he was a genius at security and computers and all that werent you mad when bryce fired him prairies smile faltered yes i guess i was i mean when i think about it now i am since he was the only person besides bryce whod have lunch with me or get coffee or whatever and i dont think he really trusted bryce he made me a backup of some of the security systems without telling bryce said it was in case anything happened to him maybe he had a crush on you prairie laughed maybe he was always blushing when we talked his only hobbies were paintball and computer games but you know he probably would have been a better boyfriend than bryce guess i need to work on that my taste in men as she finished dabbing the dye around the crown of my head i wondered if id ever have a boyfriend and if so whether id pick a good one maybe being banished we didnt have the common sense other people did we were attracted to people like us and as far as i could tell most of the men werent great although bryce wasnt banished and prairie had still made a mistake did you ever think about dating paul he never asked i dont know if he had maybe things would have been different i liked him a lot he was shorter than me not that it matters and he had a ponytail so if you like that but its a good thing we were friends because he made me keep a spare prox card when they rekeyed the lab the familiar anxiety stirred in my gut why is that a good thing prairie didnt say anything for a minute as she wound the dyecoated strands of hair on top of my head it will let me get back into the lab this wont be over until i destroy the data i cant let bryce move forward with what hes doing how are you going to do that i tried to keep the hysteria out of my voice but all i could picture was the killers in our kitchen you think hell let you just walk in there and dont get ahead of yourself prairie said gently we need to focus on the moment on is that why were going to chicago cant we go somewhere else somewhere he cant find us we will i promise as soon as we do this last thing well go far away and start over but hailey neither one of us is going to be safe as long as bryce is still active but couldnt we wait a while let things die down you could get your friend paul to help you and when it was safe you guys could i dont know sneak back in or something im afraid it would be even more dangerous to wait prairie said i dont know how far bryce has gotten they were close to some key breakthroughs but hailey you really need to try not to worry about that right now just relax while the color sets while prairie cleaned up i watched spongebob with chub until it was time for me to rinse on the sheet she had spread out my hair lay in glossy piles but i tried not to think about it i undressed in the bathroom and stepped into the shower making the water as hot as i could stand it i spent a long time lathering and even longer rinsing standing under the shower with my head tipped back when i was finally done in the shower i felt both worse and better worse because now i understood what was driving bryce and we were headed right back into it better because i was finally starting to believe that prairie wouldnt abandon me i dried off and wrapped the bath towel around my body then i took a washcloth and wiped away the steam on the mirror i was shocked my hair was a pale pale shade of gold nearly all the color was goneand it hung in a heavy straight line below my ears i felt my eyes fill with tears and swallowed hard it was ridiculousmy appearance was the least of my problems but i still looked away from the mirror as i got dressed when i came out of the bathroom prairie pointed to the walmart bags theres a new shirt in there go ahead and keep your shoesi didnt know your size and people wont be looking at those or your jeans so really its just the top i unfolded the shirt it was black with gray sleeves and printed on the front was a silver skull with a leering grin flames shooting out of its sides i know you hate it prairie said sorry i thought wed do kind of a rocker look for you its not so bad i lied i have these she rooted around in the bag and came up with a pair of earrings that looked like pieces of bicycle chain she also had a black leather cuff with snaps and rivets and a silver ring with a skull on it if its any comfort i picked this because i thought it was the opposite of your look i mean youre so pretty like your mom her voice faltered and i turned away partly to let her have her privacy and partly because i was kind of shy about changing in front of her i found underwear and socks in another bag and slipped them on then pulled my jeans back on and put on the new top it smelled like the walmart clean and chemicaly and it was tight enough that i had to tug on the sleeves to get them to sit right on my arms i yanked off the tags and dropped them in the wastebasket very nice prairie said with a smile that looked genuine hayee chub who had been tucking his giraffe into a pillowcase seemed to have just noticed me hair what happen i touched my newly short hair its all right chub its just a different color its nice chub liked his new clothes the nubby sweatshirt and corduroy pants as he went back to playing with his giraffe prairie got to work on me there was a lot of snipping but it went fast bits of hair flying to the floor as prairie worked finally she stepped back and checked out the results she snipped a little more and then got the motel hair dryer out of the bathroom i wish i had a little product she said she ran the dryer for a few minutes pushing my hair this way and that oh she said when she was done i really like it haileyi think it suits you i mean you can always grow it back but well i hope you like it too i went in the bathroom and stared in the mirror dry my hair was a shiny platinum blond it was cut so the front curved just a little past my chin and then it got shorter in the back with choppy layers i could feel with my fingers a few chunky bangs were smoothed across my forehead it was amazing it was better than anything you could get in gypsumi knew that instantly for a second i wished i could go back to school just long enough for everyone to see i looked likei caught the thought and held it for a secondlike someone in a band like someone everyone else wanted to be happy with your new look prairie asked smiling when i came out of the bathroom before i could answer her chub jumped up from the floor where hed been playing with his giraffe bad mans he mumbled and pointed at the door then he pressed his face into my jeans and hugged my legs hard prairie crouched down next to him where are the bad men chub she whispered are they close by chub nodded his lower lip stuck out in a pout outside she gave him a little hug and stood up grabbing her purse off the bed and pulling out a little black canister how um accurate is he she whispered with these predictions these what i mean he only just started talking he never even went to the potty by himself until yesterday if prairie was surprised she didnt show it get that prairie whispered pointing at the last of her purchases a pale pink backpack with the tags still attached pack up i jammed our things into it our dirty clothes and the walmart purchases prairie grabbed her plastic bags and stuffed them into her oversized purse im really tired she said in a loud voice i think i might lie down for a bit hailey could you get my purse i left it in the bathroom she was shaking her head as she talked gesturing at the opposite side of the door i grabbed chubs hand and pulled him with me when prairie crouched down across from me i did the same prairie felt around frantically on the wall until her hand found the outlet never taking her eyes off the door she yanked out the electric cords plunging the room into semidarkness and then grabbed the table lamp holding it by the narrow top of the base she held a finger to her lips i could feel my heart pounding under my new shirt chapter when the door burst open i jumped splinters of wood flew toward me and chub there was a crash and a man lurched into the room landing on the floor go prairie screamed she gave the desk a shove and it slammed down on the mans head i didnt wait to see if he was hurt i picked up chub and hurled myself out the door prairie right behind a skunky smell followed us i could feel my throat seizing and i started to cough when we were outside i sucked down fresh air the sun was so bright i was blinded for a moment but prairie pushed me hard toward the car rascal i screamed come here boy he trotted out of the room looking unconcerned prairie had the keys in her hand and the locks clicked open as i reached for the handle i didnt bother trying to get chub settled just pushed him and rascal into the backseat and jumped in front as prairie backed up the tires screeched as she twisted the wheel and aimed for the parking lot exit a couple walking across the lot jumped out of the way the man yelling and giving us the finger but prairie paid no attention she pulled into traffic wedging the buick between a fastmoving compact car and a dawdling truck full of lawn mowers and then shot across a couple of lanes making a uturn on a yellow light then we were racing back toward the onramp and onto the highway id only inhaled a little of the pepper spray or whatever it was and i managed to get my throat cleared and my breathing back to normal i leaned over the seat and helped chub get buckled in car seat he said on top of everything else he was adding new words faster than i could keep track of thats right this is your special seat i said you did good chub good boy they found us prairie repeated she switched lanes again pulling to the right and cutting off a slowmoving sedan she veered onto an exit that led to an oasis of fastfood restaurants and gas stations what are you doing keep movingi felt the urgency in my gut to put as much distance as possible between us and the guy in our motel room bryces men tracked us down prairie said and it wasnt the car it couldnt have been come on bring the backpack she pulled in to the first restaurant a wendys and parked crookedly in a spot near the entrance i grabbed chub and the pack leaving rascal in the car and followed prairie in she went straight for the ladies room and tried the door good she said its a oneperson come on in i felt strange following her and checked around but no one was paying attention there were a few customers in line knots of two and three people at the tables a hum of lateafternoon conversation prairie locked the door behind us my turn prairie said digging into her purse for a walmart bag she stripped off her top pulled a sweater from the bag and put it on it was an ugly thing brown with leaves and pumpkins embroidered on it it was too big and it disguised her slim body here she said handing me a small plastic bag of jewelry and makeup put this on the earrings and all and do your makeup lots of eyeliner really thick i did as she said starting with concealing the purplish bruise on my cheek watching her out of the corner of my eye as i worked she took a wide headband out of the bag and slid it into her hair so that all the layers were pulled away from her face then she added lipstick exaggerating her mouths natural shape i focused on my own makeup doing my best to apply it the way id practiced a few times at home for fun purple eye shadow dark liner several coats of mascarai stepped back and looked at myself in the mirror wow prairie said i hardly looked like myself at all i guessed that was the point prairie had swept on blush and some eye makeup with the sweater and headband she looked like a soccer mom wow yourself i said back um not your best look prairie arched an eyebrow at me and then we both burst out laughing we were in so much trouble but laughing felt good chub looked at each of us in turn and then he surprised me by pounding his little fist against my leg he wasnt laughing prairie knelt down in front of him chub honey are they here in the restaurant the parking lot chub shook his head rubbing his mouth with a little fist not here okay but back thereback at the motel bad mans he said again looking like he was going to cry prairie put her arms around him and he went willingly burying his face into her shoulder she patted his back and murmured until he calmed down i felt awkward watching them chub had always had meonly me i wasnt sure i was ready to share him but he turned from prairie to me and hugged my legs hard as i wet a paper towel to wipe his hot tearstreaked face i knew he was still mine my little brother if that was what it was going to be the person who loved me for me as i finished patting his face clean prairie turned her purse upside down on the counter the contents spilling out there wasnt that much a set of keys on a simple silver key ring her cell phone and a couple of pens a square black wallet a small black leather case which she unzipped taking out a lipstick and comb and a compact theyre tracking us somehow prairie said softly at least they havent followed us from the motel yet you mean just because of what chub said hes a seer hailey prairie shut me down with her words i tried to process what she had said sure chub had done an amazing amount of growing up in the past few days something important was going on with him definitelyi was pretty sure no other kids on record had learned to talk and pottytrained themselves overnight but prairie wanted me to believe that on top of all this chub could see into the future the men were all given the gift of visions shed said when she told me about the banished they could see into the future to protect them from enemies a thought was tickling around the edges of my brain i shut my eyes and tried to focus on days grams customers came calling a lot of times chub would stop what he was doing set aside his book or toy and come to me putting his face against my leg and holding on tight which was what he had always done when he was scared or upset and then a few minutes later i would hear the sound of a truck driving up onto the lawn the slam of car doors the shout of some halfwasted loser maybe it was true maybe chub was a seer anyway prairie said i think weve got to assume the thing whatever theyre using to track us is here with me or on me she unzipped the wallet took out her credit cards and drivers license and cash and stuffed them into a pocket of her jeans she slipped a couple of keys off the ring and jammed them into her other pocket she handed me her cell phone then she put the key ring as well as the rest of the things on the counter back into the purse and dropped it into the trash she took her phone back and gave me a gentle push lets move she said in the parking lot she bent next to the front wheel while i got chub settled into his seat and took rascal for a quick walk what did you just do i asked as we pulled out of the lot and back onto the highway going at a normal pace now drove over my cell phone anyone trying to track us on that is going to find a pile of rubble in a wendys parking lot she was smart she hadnt done anything yet that you couldnt learn from watching tv but i was still impressed there were moments when i felt the panic rising in my gut and i had to force it back with all my will but id managed to do what needed to be done to keep up with prairie to keep looking out for chub i was hanging on i wondered if it was a result of having grown up on constant alert i was always watching outwhether for kids playing pranks on me when i was little or for gram taking a swipe at me as i walked past orworst of allfor the customers with their roving hands and hungry eyes i was always thinking one step ahead prairie i said uh thanks you know for the haircut and the clothes and everything she smiled not taking her eyes off the road think ive got a future in it you know like i could be a stylist to the stars or something um not looking like that i dont think so i said pointing to her sweater you look like youre going to a pta meeting prairie laughed and we rode along in companionable silence so i said after a while how do you know how to cut hair i worked in a salon i thought you said you were a waitress yes i did both what happened was when id been waitressing for a while i went for a walk one day and found myself in a part of town i didnt know in front of a salon i felt a compulsion to go inside i couldnt resist so i went in and met the woman who owned it she was from poland and her name was anna we hit it off right away she gave me a job i worked there while i went to school learned the trade then after i graduated i got a research job and we lost touch i could tell there was more to the story from the way prairie chose her words with great care what arent you telling me prairie bit her lip and i waited you remember how i told you that i got a fake identity yeah anna was the one who helped me with that she knew a guy who could get what i needed anna helped me become a new person why couldnt you just be yourself gram would never have come after you you said it yourself but i never stopped worrying after i found out about clover i was done with alice i wanted no part of gypsumnone of that i saw what the people there had become i thought i could take the healing gift with me and leave the rest behind the men grams customers their visions had clouded most of them couldnt see the future anymore and there was so much crime and violence i saw how they treated the women and i knew if i ever went back id get sucked into that life again why i demanded i mean i hate gypsum too but youre acting like you didnt have free choice once you turned eighteen the banished are bound together prairie interrupted havent you seen that felt it the morriesthe way you feel drawn to them i felt my face redden it was as though she could see inside me its not your fault prairie said her voice softer it was ordained but i knew i had to be away from all that so i became someone new only for a moment she said nothing and then she laughed softly but there was more hurt than humor in the sound anna was banished too what its not just gypsum hailey there were others from the village in ireland they lived there hundreds of years before the famine came and threatened to wipe them out one group went to poland anna came to the united states years ago after her mother died so theres people like me all over the world not exactly there were only a few original healer families i dont know exactly how manymaybe just us and the one that went to poland maybe a few more but the banished who went with them yes there are people like us out there are they all like the morries well anna isnt annas i loved her she said it with a hitch in her voice and again i wondered why theyd lost touch and she told you all of this anna filled in the gaps for me i knew some of it from my grandmother annas pureblood when she saw me the day i went in the salon she knew she could sense it that i was banished the ones who went to poland they kept the history alive better they learned to recognize one another though now she shrugged eventually the story gets lost but how did she know how could she tell its not hard hailey prairie said youll learn i learned fast youll see it in people sometimes not often and its almost always weak in them when the banished left ireland they started to drift just like what happened in gypsum they married outside the men lost the visions very little is left of the bloodline but anna showed me someone would come in someone with banished blood and she helped me see it or not see it exactlyits a a sense i guess youd say usually they dont even know it themselves in a man there might be some premonition like sometimes things happen and they know in advance only they talk themselves out of it or chalk it up to coincidence people can convince themselves very easily you know when they want to its human nature was anna a healer no she says no one knows what happened to the healer line in poland whether it died out or whether the healers emigrated somewhere else for a while neither of us said anything it was so much to absorb so i guess anna did her job then i finally said for some reason i felt bleak she found you a gold star for her two pureblood banished in a city the size of chicago if prairie minded my tone she didnt mention it no hailey not two three threewhat do you mean anna has a son part three chicago chapter it was twilight by the time we reached the outskirts of chicago the skyline a sparkling row of towers off in the distance stretching out impossibly far in both directions we left the highway on a looping cloverleaf crowded with speeding traffic despite the brief nap in the motel i couldnt keep my eyes open i must have drifted off because when prairie gently shook my arm to wake me we were parked behind another motel this one huge and new and anonymous backing up to a wide avenue across from a car dealership i didnt even ask where we were i went through the motions of getting chub who was fast asleep as prairie took care of rascal in the room i collapsed with chub and didnt wake up until late the next morning when the sun was streaming in the windows i sat up disoriented by the unfamiliar surroundings the room was almost a copy of the one from the day before but reversed the television on the opposite wall chub sat on the edge of the bed swinging his legs watching tv with the sound turned low he was already dressed and his hair was sticking straight up prairie stood at the window clutching the fabric of the drapes in her hand staring out into the parking lot rascal sitting at her side staring at nothing when i said her name she jumped good morning hailey she said are you feeling better today to my surprise i was i felt rested and strong and the events of the past few days had faded in my mind like a movie id watched but would someday forget not that i would ever lose the images of the wrecked kitchen of gram on the floor but as i washed up and packed i felt like it was all in the past like that phase of my life was over i felt the faint stirrings of hope it was almost one in the afternoon by the time we walked rascal and put our things in the car we went to a diner next to the motel for lunch my appetite was back and i ordered a burger and fries and a big glass of milk even prairie ate most of her chicken salad and the worry lines around her eyes had smoothed so i said as i finished the last of my fries i guess it worked huh the thing you did so he wouldnt be able to find us i didnt say his name could barely stand to think it rattler the image of him plunging the knife into the man in the gray jacket flashed through my mind and was gone leaving only a shadowy outline of the terror of that night prairie nodded thoughtfully and sipped at her coffee if he was going to be able to track us she didnt finish the thought but i knew what she was thinking he would have found us by now if his visions were able to lead him to us i wondered if prairie had slept or if shed stayed by the window worrying all night waiting for his old truck to roll up in front of the motel waiting for him to come crashing through the door the way bryces men had the day before i felt guilty because id collapsed and slept like a rock leaving all the guarding and worrying to her i almost apologized but i couldnt quite find the words so he probably stayed in gypsum i said hopefully prairie nodded mmm with any luck i can finish what i need to do tonight and we can move on she was looking not at me but out the window i had so many questions she said we but did she mean all three of us and i had no idea what she meant by move on or where we would go next how we would live what do you have to do tonight i asked she looked at me directly and chose her words carefully i need to destroy bryces research how are you going to do that i have some ideas first thing is to get into the lab and for that ill need my key its too dangerous to go back to my house but i keep spare keys at my neighbors dont you have a key with you prairie pushed her salad around on her plate without looking at me this is a special key hailey its a prox card for an electronic lock and im pretty sure that by now bryce has changed the code so i cant get in but i have a master key at my friends place does she know youre coming no prairie hesitated and bit her lip i could tell she was trying to figure out how much to tell me i thought it was best that i didnt call or do anything that might tip someone off i do have a key to her house so i can let myself in the quicker i get in and out the better i she said i not we panic stirred in my gutpanic at being left alone left to defend chub against any threat that came along im going with you i said quickly my tone harsher than i intended were going together i dont think that please we can wait in the car itll be better this way we can watch for for i didnt finish my sentence but i figured prairie knew what i meant i could watch for the men bryce had sent or for rattler or for any of the other threats id never thought to worry about threats that until a few days ago hadnt existed for me but that had changed the course of my life id argue with prairie if i needed to i wasnt going to let this drop she had saved me from bryce and gram and rattler and i was grateful but she couldnt leave us now i wouldnt let her i didnt have any other choice all right she finally said and i let out the breath i hadnt realized i was holding you can come with me to pennys but after that when we get to the lab i go in alone i wasnt going to argue thatyet one step at a time she wanted to wait until dark to make the trip to her neighbors house so we spent the afternoon in a park chub played on the swings and the slides and dug holes and tunnels in a sandbox with a plastic shovel someone had left behind i tried to interest rascal in chasing a stick but he just walked beside me and sat whenever i stood still late in the afternoon prairie drove us north of the city to evanston the suburb where her apartment and the lab were she parked near the lake and we walked out on a strip of land from which we could see chicago to the south the setting sun glancing off the windows of all the highrise buildings making it look like a city made from gold and mirrors chub was more interested in throwing rocks off the pier than at looking at the city but i couldnt take my eyes off the skyline and the sun sinking toward the inky blue of the lake at last it was nearly dark prairie drove around for a while before choosing a parking spot on a quiet side street near an alley cars were jammed in tight on both sides of the street but a red acura pulled out just as we were cruising past it took several minutes of careful maneuvering to get the ellises big car into the spot but when prairie finally shut off the ignition she seemed satisfied i wish we had a leash for rascal prairie said hell stay close he wont run off yes but there are leash laws here well well just make do when we get to pennys house he can come inside she loves dogs we started walking and entered a residential area prairie set a quick pace cutting across a wide street and into an alley that ran behind a row of houses we made our way down a few blocks hurrying across when we came to an intersection i tripped over a hose that had been left coiled behind a garage we had to hush chub several times he was tired from skipping his nap and stumbled along half awake rubbing his eyes and mumbling prairie put her hand on my arm and pointed at a small shingled coach house set back from a bigger house that fronted the street i squeezed chubs hand and he leaned against me his face pressed into my legs he was so exhausted that he started to cry silently small sobs muffled by my jeans we had stopped under the lowhanging branches of an elm that was leafing out for spring and i hoped we were hidden from anyone who happened to look out their bedroom window is this pennys place i whispered yes i dont want to knock because shell turn on the porch light but she wont mind me letting myself in we have an arrangement we water each others plants when we travel that kind of thing prairie didnt look as confident as she sounded she dug for the keys shed pocketed in the wendys bathroom i picked chub up as she turned the key in the lock he stiffened in my arms and i hushed him holding his body tighter i realized only after i heard the gentle click of the door opening that i had been holding my breath waiting forwhat a gunshot back in gypsum i was always on edgei never knew what id come home to who id find slumped at the kitchen table but this was different the things i worried about in gypsum all seemed kind of stupid nowkids making fun of me or gram being in a bad mood or dun acey trying to grab my butt when i walked past him i guess she went to bed early prairie said as she stepped aside to let me into the dark foyer of the coach house rascal following she slid her hand along the wall i could barely make out its outline in the moonlight coming through the door there was another soft click as prairies fingertips found the light switch and the room was illuminated by the soft light of a lamp on a low table a few feet in front of us an elderly woman in a pink quilted housecoat sat in an overstuffed chair her feet out in front of her at an odd angle one of her satin slippers upside down on the wood floor for a second i thought shed fallen asleep then i noticed a dark stain that ran down her neck and into the folds of her housecoat and when i took half a step closer the reason became clear her skull had been bashed in chapter prairie made a sound next to me a cutoff little cry i pushed chubs face hard against my shoulder shielding him from the sight of the dead woman when hed been crying moments earlierhed known that something bad waited inside i saw that bits of shattered white skull showed through the womans ruined scalp and bloodmatted hair and i took a step back my foot hit something on the floor and i tripped nearly dropping chub instead i staggered sideways and managed to stay on my feet i looked down to see what id tripped over a skillet an old black one with a wooden handle welcome home came a deep rough voice another lamp switched on and i could see a man sprawled lazily on a floralprint couch one arm slung along the plump cushions the other hand dangling a handgun it was rattler sikes a purple bruise showed through the stubble on his jaw but otherwise he looked none the worse for wear my heart sank all our efforts to throw him offthey hadnt worked had he seen every move wed made as if reading my thoughts he chuckled softly bet youre surprised to see me you really thought you could get me off your trail with that wildgoose chase you must of forgot i aint got any quit in me rattler prairie said her voice choked with fury what have you done before you go lookin around for something you can throw at me prayree you might ought to consider i got a gun and you got a little boy with you aint done anything to anyone the way rattler said her name it was like he was mocking her with it and i got a itchy finger sos if you so much as make me nervous why im liable to go twitchin and i know none of us wants that right youll have to shoot me first i turned so my body was between rattler and chub hold up there rattler said i aint shootin nobody just yet dont you want to know how i came to meet your friend here prayree she werent any too hospitable though i gotta say how could you she saw me knockin on your door and come over wearin garden gloves and waving her pruning shears and askin me all kinda nosy questions liked to have pruned me to death way she was lookin at me and i got to thinkin maybe id just wait for you from her house here nice window i could look out of make sure i saw when you got home and now look it must be my lucky day cause you gone and come to me she never hurt anyone hey alls i asked her to do was leave me be and set quietly in this here chair while we waited on you all i wasnt fixin to kill her or nothin then i tell her to git me some tea and she come back with a skillet and shes ready to haul off and hit me on the head with it only she didnt move quick enough guess that didnt work out too well for her now did it i thought about how frightened the woman must have been when rattler forced his way into her home his grip on the gun looked sloppy but i knew better he could hit a can on top of the trash in the burn barrel in grams backyard while standing in the middle of the field next door id watched out my bedroom window one summer twilight as he and a few of grams customers took turns shooting the other guys hit the barrel or missed entirely but rattler nailed the can every time now he was staring at prairie with an intensity you could light fires with and she stared back there was something between them all right something crackling with tension and danger something almost alive you slowed me down girl he said so softly that i knew he was speaking only to her i might as well have not even been there but you cant stop me not when im coming for you my fear curled and stretched into something new a realization that rattler didnt want to kill ushe wanted something worse it was as if he wanted to own prairie and i realized that i was more frightened of rattler sikes and the other banished men than i was of the professional killers whod been chasing us more frightened of rattler than all of those guys put together you shouldnt have come here prairie said but there was a tremor in her voice and she shrank back from him it was like the twisted energy around him diminished her suddenly rattler laughed and the spell was broken now lets get back on a friendlier track rattler said his voice oily set on down girl i think you ought to be comfy enough in that chair we got a little talkin to do fore we all git on the road were not going anywhere with you prairie hissed but rattler only shrugged im gonna take you girls home where you belong you can go easy or you can go hard up to you hailey go on take the kid and git him settled in one of those bedrooms and take that mangy hound with you i didnt need to be told twice i edged through the room avoiding looking at the dead woman rascal at my heels i wished he was a better watchdogit was like he didnt care at all that rattler was threatening us my heart was pounding so hard it seemed like everyone ought to be able to hear it in the hall a door stood open to a small room with a tidy bed made up with a quilt and a pile of embroidered pillows as i put chub on the bed and slid my backpack off my shoulders i tried hard not to think about the woman with half her head leaking out in the other room i like how you look all eased down in that chair i heard rattler say from the other room youre lookin real good prairie i had to do something to stop rattler i unzipped the backpack and dumped everything out i handed chub his giraffe and sorted frantically through the rest of the contents bedtime chub asked yawning i want my bed even through my terror i noticed how well he was speaking how clear his words were evidently he had forgotten his fear or maybe he was simply too tired to care you can just nap here for now i said pulling the quilts and covers back from the pillows i could hear prairie murmuring something okay good night chub got up on his knees to hug me and i kissed the top of his head chub started to wiggle under the covers but suddenly he sat up frowning i dont want to watch what sweetie what dont you want to watch bad mans eye i dont want to watch my nerves were so skittish it took some effort for me to smooth the hair off chubs forehead and kiss him gently and get him to lie down again you dont have to you just go to sleep kay he closed his eyes his long lashes casting shadows on his soft cheeks in the other room prairie and rattler talked in low intense voices there was nothing i could usejust my old clothes and prairies purchases i glanced around the room but saw only framed snapshots a fancy silver comb and brush china figurines a basket of dried flowers there was a chest of drawers pushed up against the wall and i ran my hand along the top of it you cant tell me you dont remember how much fun we used to have rattler said his voice rising you used to love skinnydippin with me and the rest of em i never loved it prairie snapped i hated it that aint true you know you an me should of been together everyone knew it no no i yanked open the top dresser drawer slips and camisoles folded tissue i tried the next drawer scarves a soft pile of scarves lengths of silk in every color of the rainbowbeautiful but nothing i could use my heart plummeted only you didnt do like you were supposed to rattler continued i waited i followed your moms rules even if you didnt you think i didnt know about you and that boy from tipton he was you thought you were so smart sneakin around with him thought nobodyd figure it out just cause you kept it from your mom well i knew i knew i was shocked at the bitterness in rattlers tone was he jealous was that possible i stuck my hand in the drawer and seized the scarves and pushed them to the side my fingers brushed against something hard and sharp i picked it up it was made of pale bone or ivory with two delicate long curved points at one end and a pearly fanshaped decoration carved at the other some sort of hair ornament i guessed i picked it up and held it in my right hand so that the long curved points lay against my wrist then stepped into the other room dont matter anyway rattler said specially since your sister beat you to the big prize i heard prairies sharp intake of breath what do you mean rattler laughed bitterly only that once you took off your mom said she guessed clover was old enough to date after all it took some convincin like to hurt my feelings the way she kept turnin me down but i finally got her to see things my way i guess i had a mighty fine time with dont say her name ill say what i want prayree rattler hissed you need me to spell it out i stepped into the light rattler glanced at me and for a split second his face was open to me his expression unguarded and i saw something there i would have never imagined in a million years pain because of prairie it wasnt lovei refused to believe a man like rattler could lovebut a longing so strong he wore it like a second skin and it was suddenly easy for me to believe that their connection went back not just generations but centuries the thing binding rattler to prairie knotted tighter the more it was resisted but when rattler saw me staring at him the hurt vanished and was replaced with something else something sharpeyed and crafty amused even little hailey girl he said look at you practically grown up you neveryou couldntshe wouldnt prairie gasped for words and looked like she was going to come out of her chair and attack him but rattler raised his gun hand without even looking and leveled it at her go easy prairie he warned his voice barely more than a raw whisper then he looked at me fullon his eyes glinting green sparks in the dim light one corner of his cruel mouth quirked up you know who i am dont you hailey girl he said softly and suddenly i didi knew and my hand clutched hard at the handle of the hairpin as the knowledge thundered in my brain im your daddy i lunged at him and raised my hand clenched that hairpin tight and the sound when those elegant curved points found their mark wasnt like much of anything at all like sliding a knife into a melon but the sound that came out of rattler made up for it a sound that was neither human or animal but something in between a wild something a furious something as he clawed at the thing that was sticking into his right eye prairie i yelled i whirled around and saw her bolt out of her chair i ran to the bedroom and yanked back the quilts chub was propped on his elbows his little face winding up for a scream of his own he wasnt all the way awake i could see thatit happened sometimes when he was startled out of a deep sleep it was like a sleepwaking nightmare its me its me chub i said as i yanked him out of the bed stuffing everything back in the backpack and shrugging it over my shoulders he started to wail squirming in my arms as i ran out of the bedroom rattler had got the hairpin out of his eyeblood covered the hand he had pressed against itand he raised his gun hand and swung it from prairie to me then he shot at me i waited for a jolt of pain that didnt come but there was a crash from the bookshelves behind me down prairie screamed and pushed me away from her but i stood my ground as she raced for the kitchen and jerked open a drawer and pawed frantically through the contents rascal i screamed and he appeared in the hall looking uninterested sic him boy the change in rascal was astonishing in a flash he went from standing still to snarling and hurling himself at rattler teeth bared he clamped down hard on rattlers shin and the sound coming from his throat was guttural and feral rattler yelled in pain as he brought his gun hand down on rascals skull the gun went off again and prairie stumbled against me she didnt say a word just made a sound like unh are you im fine prairie said yanking on my hand and pulling me toward the door rascal come on i yelled and we ran as rattler hopped back clutching his leg where rascal had attacked him when we reached the porch prairie stumbled and barely caught herself youre not fine i said heart pounding did he shoot you i saw the spreading damp of her blood and the jagged tear in her sweater the awkward angle at which she was holding her arm ahh she said breathing hard all right im hit but we have to get out of here its not just rattler hailey there were lights on in my house that werent on before didnt you see bryces men are over there and they must have heard something going on but theyll come here hailey to see what happened and then theyd come after us again howwhat can i just help me run we can get to a pay phone theres one a couple of blocks back i remembered her cell phone crushed under the buicks tire if there was a moment for me to be strong this was it prairie had taken the lead since the moment wed met and id followed not always willingly and i hadnt always believed or trusted her but i followed now though she needed me and i had to set aside my doubts my questions my fear i set chub down yanked my old shirt out of the backpack and tied the sleeves tightly around her arm above the bullet wound to slow the blood flow she stood still and pale biting her lip but not making any sound i held chubs hand and supported prairie with my other arm half dragging her retracing our steps down the alley toward town rascal followed docile again any traces of the vicious attack dog hed been moments ago were gone i listened for footsteps behind us the sound of tires on gravel but there was nothing we reached a shuttered drugstore and i could see the pay phone in a pool of light at the edge of the parking lot i hesitatedwed be a visible target for anyone who came along a taxi cruised slowly by i jumped into the street id never hailed a cab in my life but i held my hand high and waved it hard for a moment i thought the cab was going to pass us by but at the last minute it slowed i cantmy arm prairie said we can cover it prairie shook her head no its too dangerous if he sees blood he might insist on taking us somewhere a police station or a hospital would that be so bad come on prairie youre shot you need a doctor she shook her head hard no you dont understand bryce is connected in more ways than you can imagine im sure hes got people covering the police scanners the highway patrolif we end up with the authorities were as good as dead besides we cant take rascal but the cabbie rolled down his window excuse me miss you coming he asked in a thick accent prairie shook her head again i made a splitsecond decision i just need to use your cell phone sir please well pay the cabbie narrowed his eyes and frowned no ride no im sorry i just really need to use your phone he muttered something i couldnt understand and started to roll up his window no please frantically i gestured for prairie to give me some money she dug in her pocket and handed me a roll of bills i peeled off three twenties here just for a few minutes i promise well give it right back the cabbie hesitated then sighed and reached into the pocket of his coat he handed me his phone and i passed him the money you stay right here he said stabbing a finger at me yes okay i handed the phone to prairie she stepped back into the shadows while i waited next to the cab rascal sitting calmly at my side chub watched the transaction closely from my arms his eyes wide and worried phone he said prairie call thats right chub we borrowed the nice mans phone so prairie could make a call i glanced at the man hoping his expression would soften when he saw how sweet chub was but he stared stonily ahead arms crossed it didnt take long prairie shuffled back and handed me the phone she was trembling thank you i said as i gave the phone back to the driver he didnt respond but took off wiping the phone on his shirt i talked to anna prairie said she had started to shiver all over shes coming we need to stay out of sight i told her wed be in that first yard she pointed back the way wed come a compact bungalow was separated from the street by a row of mature trees and a thick hedge with luck the trees would keep us hidden before i could reply prairie started to sway i grabbed her good arm and steadied her then half dragged half carried her chub walked behind us hanging on to my jeans belt loop a low stone retaining wall ran along the side of the yard there were no lights on in the house i prayed that the people who lived there were heavy sleepers once i got prairie settled on the stone ledge i looked at her arm again i couldnt tell in the dark whether it was still bleeding but the makeshift tourniquet was wet with blood isnt there something i can do i asked you know heal it prairie shook her head healers cant help each other hailey but why i dont know its just how its always been but were strong stronger than most im going to be fine her shivering eased as we waited but the stone was freezing beneath us and the night seemed to be getting colder with each passing moment chub burrowed against my knees sleepy he murmured and i ran my fingers through his hair over and over the way he liked the minutes ticked by the occasional car passing just a few yards away finally a car pulled along the curb it was small and in the light of the streetlamps i could see that it was old and dented the man who got out of the drivers seat was tall and broadshouldered he stood silhouetted against the streetlight fists clenched at his sides as he looked around i couldnt see his facehe had a hood pulled up over his headbut something stirred inside me the deep intense feeling i sometimes got around the morries of longing and loss and connection and fear all run together could it be one of the other banished men how could he have gotten here so fast prairie saw the man too and i could hear her surprised murmur terror shot through my veins when i saw that hed spotted us i got ready to run even though id never be able to move fast enough not with prairie and chub but prairie put her hand on my arm to stop me its all right she whispered its kaz annas son chapter he crossed the lawn in a few long strides and barely looked at me before giving prairie a careful hug i cant believe its you she said wrapping her good arm around his shoulders youre so tall i think you were only twelve last time i saw you lets get to the car he said urgently momll kill me if i dont get you home fast aunt eliz he stopped and shook his head like he was embarrassed i mean prairie sorry mom told me its okay prairie said i was elizabeth for a long time dont worry about it yeah its just i mean anyway im kaz he said finally turning to me and offering his hand i couldnt make out his features in the darkness but the faint light from the streetlamp glinted off his teeth as he smiled when i took his hand i felt the electric connection i often experienced around the morries it wasnt as strong as when i touched milla but it was alive with energy kazs skin was chilled by the night air and his fingers were rough and callused but his hand felt good in mine and i held on for a second longer than i meant to and in one way he was different from any of the morries i knew except sawyer he felt safe im hailey i managed to say and this is chub and thats my dog rascal nice to meet you he nodded then turned his attention back to prairie we can talk more at home but moms got everything ready and it looks like youre going to need it how did you get here drove prairie said gritting her teeth but the cars fine where it is no one will notice it for days and does the dog come if its okay with you i said quickly hes good i couldnt leave rascal after hed come so far with us doesnt bother me my cars seen worse okay prairie how bad off are you it looks worse than it is if you say so he took her good hand and pulled her carefully to a standing position id offer to carry you but considering i used to read you elmo books that might take a little getting used to she said with a weak laugh i followed carrying chub who was nodding off when we got to the idling car kaz helped prairie into the passenger seat and fastened her seat belt while i got chub settled next to me in the backseat rascal in his usual spot on the floor kaz pulled away from the curb and accelerated fast we didnt talk much on the drive winding through tightpacked streets to the core of the city kaz took a road that curved along the lake and suddenly there it wasall of chicago laid out like a sparkling wonderland on the right the black emptiness of lake michigan on the left i couldnt take my eyes off the view but soon we were back in a grid of city streets beautiful old buildings rose up all around us but as we went farther they gave way to plainer neighborhoods with rundown buildings almost home kaz murmured hang in there he turned down an alley and into a tiny garage behind a little house tucked between others just like it as soon as he turned off the engine he got out and went around to help prairie easing her out of the car id better get her inside he said almost apologetically chub had fallen asleep again and i tried to unbuckle him without waking him i finally got him out and found myself on a neat concrete walk in a tidy square of shrublined yard tall fences separating it from the neighbors rascal followed me and made an efficient tour of the yard three steps led to a brightly lit back stoop where a woman waited silhouetted in the door yet another new thing to face i took a deep breath and headed for the steps hailey the woman said softly she was about my height with softly rounded curves and pale hair curling around her shoulders i am anna welcome you come in dog too is okay the door opened directly into a kitchen it was warm and cozy and smelled like bread and spices prairie was seated at a round table and kaz was setting a steaming cup in front of her he had pulled his sweatshirt hood down so i could see his face he had sandy brown hair that was just a little too long and a strong jaw when he smiled his eyes glinted like blue ice youre safe here he said and i felt his words as well as heard them his low voice skimming along my skin my nerves anna went to the sink and began scrubbing her hands with a small plastic brush and a generous amount of soap please do not think i am rude i think i must fix elizabeth now i mean prairie yes then we talk we have tea kaz said milk for chub if you think hed want any uh i dont think hes going to wake up i said a clock on the wall read i couldnt believe it had gotten so late but a lot had happened already tonight i was exhausted down to my bones and chub was unbearably heavy in my arms i longed to sit but the kitchen table was covered with firstaid suppliesgauze scissors plastic bottlesand i was afraid id be in the way anna turned from the sink and shook her hands droplets sprinkling the air kaz show hailey their room this handsome boy chub i said his name is chub id carried him for hours and my spine felt like it might never be straight again i could smell the stink of my sweat and fear even worse i felt the hot pooling of tears that threatened to spill onto my cheeks chub anna repeated lets get boy to bed okay you and chub have kazs room tonight prairie will stay with me i have big bed i will take good care of heri am studying to be nurse so no need for worry i cant take your room i protested but the hitch in my voice was obvious even to me oh oh ukochana you poor child go with kaz now anna pursed her lips as she settled in the chair next to prairie then she took prairies arm gently and began to cut away the shirt i had knotted in place prairie stayed silent but her skin was pale and shiny with sweat and she had purple circles under her eyes her hair hung in greasy clumps and her mouth was set in a bunched line come on kaz said do you want me to take him before i could protest he lifted chub out of my arms and laid him over his shoulder chubs face tucked into his neck i slid my backpack off and dangled it in my hand my muscles numb from carrying chub anna was dabbing at prairies wound with cotton and there was a strong smell of antiseptic in the air the skin around the wound was black with blood but the cotton came away bright red i shivered and turned away i hoped anna knew what she was doing the hall was narrow at the end i could see a tidy living room on one side were a bathroom and another room with its door slightly ajar and a lamp glowing softly inside kaz opened a door on the opposite side im uh sorry about the mess he said i didnt have a lot of time to clean before you got here it wasnt cluttered or even messy like kids rooms on tv shows or in the movies i had been a neat freak my whole life but i knew it was due to the rest of my life being so out of control and kazs room wasnt like that either it was comfortably disordered with an ipod and books lying open on the desk and an empty soda can on the floor near a big beanbag chair on the shelves books were lined up neatly along with lacrosse trophies and a compact set of speakers posters of lacrosse players lined the walls as well as pennants from johns hopkins and syracuse and a few other teams crates on the floor held geargloves twice the size of an average persons hand rolls of tape and elbow pads and other things i could only guess at a blue and white helmet sat in a place of honor on top of the dresser along with more books and a mac laptop the bed was madebarely a quilt pulled crookedly over a lumpy comforter and pillow if you pull back the covers i can set chub down and maybe he wont wake up kaz said youre good with him i said as we got chub settled i babysit for a family down the street he said with a shrug they have four kids i like this age theyre so determined you know i did know it described chub perfectly and suddenly i wanted to tell kaz all about him about our life with gram about the way it had all ended i felt like i could talk to him for hours without the staggering shyness i usually felt around kids my age maybe there would be a chance later but right now i had other things to focus on i need to go see how prairies doing in the kitchen anna had finished cleaning the wound and stopped the blood flow but i had to look awaythe sight of prairies torn flesh was more than i could handle i knelt in front of her grabbing her free hand and squeezing i wanted to do something morebut i didnt know what i knew that if all the bad things hadnt happened she would never have let me see her weak or scared the way she looked now but what was i supposed to do prairie and i had saved each otherwell mostly she had saved meover and over again she had proved herself to me ill be good as new soon she said trying hard to sound cheerful anna clucked under her breath and poked black thread through the eye of a curved needle the smell of antiseptic was almost overpowering anna took the bullet right out it was just a little thing bulletthat word did it i laid my face on prairies knee my shoulders shaking prairie patted my hair my neck whispering that it was going to be all right that made me cry harder but i was afraid that i would jostle her when anna was taking a stitch and besides my nose was running all over her pants and even though they were grimy from the past two days i still couldnt stand the idea of messing them up so i got to my feet shaky and stumbling wiping my nose on my sleeve and swallowing my tears down hard hailey there are tissues on counter anna said her voice calm but kind please help yourself i did i blew my nose and splashed water on my face from the sink and washed my hands and dried them on a pretty yellow dish towel and then even though i was afraid to look i sat down and watched anna close up the wound with tiny careful stitches the line of black xs the only proof that prairie had been shot just a few hours before kaz had wandered in without me noticing chub went right to sleep i left your backpack in there you can uh use the bathroom or go to bed or whatever when youre ready you can use my moms stuff yes of course anna said thank you kaz hailey please make yourself home there are towels in closet in hall okay thank you i knew i was filthy and that i probably smelled and i was embarrassed for anna and kaz to see me like this but i wasnt ready to leave prairie i stood behind her chair and watched as anna finished up so hailey you are sophomore in high school anna asked glancing up from her work and giving me a smile um yeah though it seemed unlikely id ever be setting foot in gypsum high again kazimierz is junior at saint michaels that is polish name we call him kaz saint michaels is nice high school lot of good teachers you do good in school me ino haileys smart like her mom prairie said her voice soft she had closed her eyes and rested her head against the chair back is she going to be all right i asked worried oh yes there is nothing to worry about i think she is just very tired this little wound mostly i just make sure no germs no bone chip bullet comes very close to bone here see i looked where she was pointing at the neat stitches in prairies arm but all good i have to poke around a little that does not feel very good for prairie but i give her something strong to drink make her relax make her feel little bit sleepy i watched anna finish the stitches and carefully bandage prairies arm i wished i could just put my hands on her and heal her like i had with milla and chub but the rushing urgency wasnt there and i knew it was truei couldnt help her anna banished like us was using thread and a needle and medicine traditional tools and in comparison they seemed so inadequate and i understood how prairie could have been tempted to try to use her gifts to heal as many people as she could how she could have gotten dragged into bryces crazy scheme if she believed that she was going to find a way to share the powers i had prairies hand in mine and i could feel her pulse slow and steady in her wrist i thought she might have gone to sleep but when anna started to pack her supplies back into the case prairie sat up and blinked a few times anna i dont know how to begin to thank you no need to thankwe are family i figured that whatever had caused their rift it couldnt have been that bad if anna still considered prairie family anna turned to me and patted my knee your aunt has told me all about your grandmother alice i am so sorry you had to live with her in poland there were stories among the blogoslawiony thats what they call the banished in poland prairie said yes the people who came from old country anyway after they left ireland sometimes a healer woman is born who is not right the gift is too much for them they are not strong enough to use it right way they turn mean families have to lock them up usually very sick die young gram was i couldnt think of what to say she was so many things all of them bad anyway now you are with aunt with our elizaour prairiemuch better prairie sighed and reached out to touch annas hand i owe you so much you were right you told me to leave that job and you were right i dont know what else to say except that im sorry that must be it the reason theyd grown apart anna shook her head eyes cast down after a moment she squared her shoulders and met prairies gaze there is no need to speak of it again but all those years i thought id lost you and kaz hes a man now kaz looked from one of them to the other thats what you argued about prairies job dont be angry at your mother prairie said its my fault your mother asked me what we were doing at the lab and i lied i felt terrible about it but bryce made me sign a confidentiality agreement he said we were getting funding from the university i didnt find out it was coming from the government until a few days ago and he told me what to say told me to tell people we were working on a vaccine for livestock i can tell when you lie anna said sadly kaz too you are not good liars but mom how could you send prairie away like that kaz was angry now i had to anna said she was trying to do science with healing gift there is no good in that bajeczny powers were meant for one village only czarownik cursed those who left banished maybe should die out since the people left ireland the men lose the visions there is fighting and crime the women are weak they forget history what about me what about dad and prairie and hailey he looked at me as he said my name do you wish we hadnt been born of course not well do you want us to do something good with our lives something important or do you want me to be an accountant or a shoe salesman or something there is nothing wrong with honest trade anna shot back i could see how they escalated each others tempers be shoe salesmanbe good shoe salesman i dont care you didnt marry a shoe salesman kaz muttered angrily your father was warrior you know that he was hero in iraq and prairie is a leader an innovator kaz said she cant help it if her boss is crazy thank you kaz prairie cut in but i made mistakes and i have to make up for them terrible things are happening because i was stubborn because i refused to see what your mother tried to tell me now i have to fix them this is conversation for tomorrow anna said now is time for everyone rest tomorrow is sunday salon is closed everyone get some sleep what about i asked as welcome and safe as i felt in annas house as relieved as i was that prairie was going to be all right i couldnt stop thinking about rattler seeing him holding his hand to his face blood streaming through his fingers what if rattler comes after us there was a brief silence anna and prairie glanced at each other i could tell they were troubled that they werent saying what they were thinking please i whispered hoarsely dont keep things from me i have to know i think we are safe for now prairie said carefully the injury i wouldnt be surprised if rattler loses that eye the blood loss alone will be enormous he wont be able to do much of anything until he gets some help even if he tries to just rest and wait until hes well enough to travel its not going to be tonight your aunt she describe what you do anna made a stabbing motion with her hand and i flinched the memory of the hairpin going into his flesh more than i could bear she say it went in far to eye is possible there is damage to brain possible he gets much worse after you are gone you are very brave girl she added quickly i knew what she was worried about that i would fall apart if i thought id killed rattler or even disabled him but that wasnt going to happen i wouldnt grieve over him i hoped he was lying on the floor even now his blood leaking out until he was too weak to say his own name and i also felt deep inside where instinct worked against reason that he wasnt dying that whatever damage id managed to do to him it wasnt enough that after he healed he would be as strong as ever and as determined and that when that happened he would come after us again but i had bought us some time for now that would have to be enough prairie allowed me to help her stand up kaz rushed to her other side and together we helped her down the hall anna in the lead anna opened the door to her bedroom where a pretty comforter was turned down on the wide bed i will help prairie freshen up she said i have nightgown and robe now you two go to bed kaz offered to take rascal out for me while i brushed my teeth and washed my face they werent gone long and kaz gave rascal an odd look as he said goodnight i closed the door glad for the solitude all the tension from the day welled up in my heart and i knew i was close to breaking down instead i climbed into kazs bed and patted the mattress next to me come rascal i said and he jumped up and lay down it felt good to put my arms around his warm body to feel his heartbeat strong and regular under his fur it almost didnt matter that hed lost his personality that he didnt ever play anymore i closed my eyes and remembered the way he used to be and as i stroked the soft ruff of fur around his neck i felt a little better until my fingers touched something that shouldnt have been there i worked my fingertips through the dense fur and found a small hard object embedded in the skin anxiety raced along my nerves as i rose up on one elbow and switched on the bedside lamp i parted rascals fur and looked closer a little bit of black metal protruded from a swelling where the skin was growing over the object i felt its outlines with my fingers small knobby a bullet i jerked my hand away and sucked in my breath scrambling away from him my legs were tangled in the sheets and i half fell half crawled out of kazs bed shock mixed with disgust as i wiped my hand against the carpet hard making my skin burn no no no i heard myself whispering and when i closed my mouth and tried to stop the words became a desperate moan i remembered rascal waiting in the yard at grams with blood on his backhe must have been shot when bryces men first came to the house they must have tried to kill him to keep him quiet maybe it had been a superficial wound just a minor injury that rascal was healing from on his own i clung desperately to that thought even though i knew it was unlikely as i forced myself to look at him he hadnt moved he was lying still and indifferent on the mattress i had to know nausea roiled through me as i approached the bed on my knees staring at the place in his fur where the bullet had entered trying not to look at his expressionless eyes i gritted my teeth and reached with a shaking hand and touched him and when he didnt respond i felt like i was touching evil itself and my entire body resisted my heartbeat pounding a crazy tempo i almost couldnt do it i squeezed my eyes shut and felt hot tears leaking down my face and still i couldnt stop making sounds quiet little sobs of desperation and horror but i made myself trace my fingers through the fur around his torso finding two more dented places where bullets had gone into him one i could barely feel lodged deep in the muscle but one had entered his body far enough that i couldnt feel it at all right over his heart rascal had been shot three times he should be dead but he wasnt bullets couldnt kill him because he was already dead because i had made him into a zombie i was cursed i was no healeri was a zombiemaker id known it all along deep inside the accident came rushing back and images freezeframed through my head in rapid succession all the blood his organs spilling from his body the way his eyes rolled up a final time their emptiness when i brought him back i brought him back from the dead and now he couldnt die hed been shot and the bullets were in his body as proof theyd ripped through skin and bone and his very heart and yet he soldiered on a robot of a dog a zombie of a dog i screamed and pushed him from the bed as hard as i could his body fell to the floor with a thud and he got up slowly and stood there unblinking staring at nothing i scrambled to my feet and started backing toward the door and when the wailing didnt stop i realized i was still screaming the door pushed open and strong arms circled me from behind practically lifting me off the floor i fought and kicked and tried to break away as kaz dragged me down the hall to the living room stop hailey he commanded but he didnt try to protect himself slowly i ran out of energy and stopped fighting him and my screams turned to sobs and he held me tight against him i heard a door open and prairies and annas voices what happened is hailey all right hes not healed i cried letting go of kaz and running to prairie i wanted to throw myself into her arms but i knew how fragile she was so i just hugged myself shaking all over i turned rascal into a zombie chapter you have to tell me the truth i said as anna tucked an afghan around me and prairie we were sitting together on the living room couch all of it kaz had taken rascal out to the yard after i insisted i couldnt stay in the house with him for another second he put water on for more tea and the four of us huddled in the living room chub thankfully slept through the whole thing we never i dont know if zombie is really the right word prairie began hesitantly thats what rascal is i burst out he cant be killed he came back from the dead i was struggling to control my breathing and my hands were shaking so badly that i jammed them together just please tell me how it happened tell me what i did tell me milla wont end up like this tell me ill never do this to chub this wont happen again prairie said carefully she exchanged glances with anna whod said little since i woke everyone up they both looked so worried that my anxiety threatened to bubble up again i felt the scream building inside me so i squeezed my hands even more tightly together the knuckles going white how can i be sure its only you must never heal someone who has died thats the one rule mary taught us that from the start me and your mom before we ever healed anything even a lizard she wouldnt even let us heal a dead squirrel or mouseshe made us promise prairie reached for my hands and tugged at them gently until like a chunk of ice thawing i relaxed my grip and let her lace her fingers through mine i am so sorry you didnt have anyone to teach you to explain it all to you you know youre the future hailey grams words the dozens of times shed given me that strange hungry lookthey chased each other around my head trying to take hold to grow into fullblown terror i fought back focusing on the feeling of prairies warm hands on mine after a moment i realized somethingthe bandages were off her arm and the wound that anna had stitched closed already looked better healers cant help each other but were strong that was what shed told me i was strong i grabbed that thought and held it tight so explain it all to me now theres not much more to tell just the one rule you must never heal someone who has died their body will come back for a while anyway but their soul is gone they dont feel love or pain or any emotion at all they respond to basic stimuli and will eat and even sleep though they dont dream they cant make decisions for themselves though they can hear and process instructions and will do whatever they are told rascal does what i say if i tell him to come or stay oryou knew didnt you i yes i was pretty sure from the moment i saw him thats why i went looking for scars on him how could you not tell me how could you know what i had done to him and and let me keep him in the car with us let me keep touching him hailey im so sorry but i didnt know how to tell you without upsetting you without upsetting me im so far past upset i cant believe i had to keep you calm prairie cut me off i truly am so so sorry hailey but you werent ready to know we were silent for a moment and i realized it was true i had been so close to falling apart these past few days one more thing might have tipped me over the edge how long have you known about what happens if you heal after mary used to tell us stories prairie said horror stories i guess meant to scare us so we wouldnt be tempted when she was a little girl one of the other healers couldnt help herself and she brought back a cat a pet she loved and it was just like rascal it frightened all the children the way it just sat on the porch not moving people wouldnt walk by the house what happened to it prairie bit her lip mary said it started to well its body began to decompose the bodies of the healed dead cant sustain life forever oh my god i cried fresh horror surging through my brain would rascal start to decompose was his body rotting already one day someonethey never found out whobroke the cats neck it was a blessing mary said but i thought they couldnt be killed there are a couple of waysthe brain stem has to be destroyed a decapitation would work crushing of that area of the brain a sharp break of the vertebrae could accomplish that if well you get the idea it was good person compassionate person anna cut in i noticed kaz in the doorway and realized hed been listening a pair of steaming cups in his hands he came forward and set the cups down his eyes met mine and there was sadness in them im sorry about rascal he said quietly but its not your fault it is i did it no one else i didnt add that at some level i had known that what i was doing was wrong when i felt the energy rushing from me to rascals lifeless body even before i knew i was a healer how long i asked when nobody spoke the decomposition takes longer than it would in a normal death prairie said carefully depending on the health of the personor animalit can take up to two or three times as long for the tissues to fail and other conditions affect it too of course heat i thought and humidity and insects all the things wed learned about in science i felt like i was going to throw up i hadnt noticed anything yet except the bad smell and rascal had been a young healthy dog but how long until his fur began to fall out and his body filled with gases and his skin began to break down i pulled my hands away from prairies and covered my face trying to keep the tears at bay i cant stand to see him i whispered dont make me look at him hes outside kaz said youre here with us its all right i wanted to believe him he knelt in front of me and anna leaned in and we all huddled together their hands comforted me patting my shoulders and squeezing my fingers and it helped i felt closer to anna and kaz than to people i had known my entire life and as for prairiei couldnt imagine life without her now but i knew i was still alone in one important way id done the thing that must never be done the thing prairie and my mother had been warned about since childhood id done the unforgivable and i couldnt help wondering how many ways i would suffer for it i thought of prairie when her face clouded over with private grief i recognized the solitary pain at her core she carried a secret with her too and i wondered if i would be like her someday marked with a kind of suffering that other humans couldnt understand what did you do i asked her i had to know if it was connected to the things that had happened to the thing i had done why did you leave gypsum her face went pale but it wasnt surprise i saw on her face almost the oppositea kind of resignation not tonight she said exhaustion making her voice husky theres been enough to deal with tonight for all of us stop putting me off i protested you owe me the truth ill tell you in the morning i promise after weve all had a chance to rest the sun will be up in a few hours and we wont be able to do what needs to be done unless we get some sleep i wanted to fight her but fatigue was winning despite the shock of learning about rascal despite having a whole new nightmare to worry about i was desperate to close my eyes and let sleep steal in and erase everything if only for a few hours promise i begged in a whisper i promise she looked directly in my eyes when she spoke and in the pale green depths i saw reflected a shadow of myself she stayed in kazs room with me for the rest of the night i insisted that she take the bed and when she protested i curled up in the nest of blankets with chub i was asleep before she finished telling me not to worry chapter in the morning she was gone the bed neatly made and sun streaming through the window when chub and i woke up i found her in the kitchen after id taken chub to the bathroom and washed my face and brushed my teeth before i could demand that she keep her promise and tell me the story she handed me a travel cup of coffee theres someone i want you to meet she said grab a bagel and you can eat on the way anna will watch chub anna came into the room just then her face pale and tired but she gave me a smile that looked like it took some work there was no sign of kaz in the house and it seemed smaller without his presence go go you two she said giving my arm a little squeeze im making gulasz well have big lunch when you get back i wasnt hungry but i took a bagel from the platter anna had set on the table it had been split and spread with cream cheese studded with dried apricots anna pushed a paper napkin into my hands i dont want to go out there i said hating the way my voice went high and thin but the horror of last night was stirring and threatening to return i was desperate to keep the panic under control but i knew if i had to walk past the creature that used to be rascal id lose it all over again i cant see him i just cant its all right prairie said gently hes gone hes at rest what do you mean i demanded what did you do to him i did it anna said she stepped forward and placed a hand on my shoulder and gave me a look that was kind but firm it was humane hailey i am nurse i know what to do kaz is burying body in park a place where there are trees nice place forest when you come back it will all be over i started to shake and tears dotted the corners of my eyes i put my hand up to annas covering it trying to find a way to say thank you but i was afraid my voice would betray me all right i managed to get out anna is letting me borrow her car prairie said lets go and we can talk on the way we didnt talk much though annas car was only slightly newer than kazs and it sputtered at every intersection as though it was about to die prairie fed it gas revving the engine as we made our way through the neighborhoods away from the lake back to the cloverleaf and onto the highway where are we going i finally asked as she headed north away from the distant skyline not far now a few minutes later she exited into a neighborhood of tidy brick bungalows and the occasional church or tavern there were no signs on the brick building she pulled up to it had neat white shutters at the windows and tulips pushing their way up from planters out front long sloping ramps were the only clue to what kind of place it was is this a nursing home i asked as we made our way to the front doors which glided open at our arrival a convalescent home prairie said a very good one with some of the top doctors in the country on call ms gordon a woman at a desk called out cheerfully vincents having a good day hell be so glad youre here prairie exchanged a few words with the receptionist as she signed in looking over her shoulder i read susan gordon in a neat script and who have you brought with you today the woman smiled at me with open curiosity this is hailey her family just moved to the area and joined the church shes interested in doing outreach ministry too oh thats wonderful hailey we love our volunteers here and so do our patients especially the ones who dont have family visits just do them a world of good what was that all about i demanded after prairie thanked the receptionist and guided me across the lobby we were buzzed through a set of doors and walked down a hallway with a shiny waxed floor and rooms opening up on either side that held hospital beds many with patients in them some sat others appeared to be asleep none looked our way i visit every week i use a fake identity as you saw they dont ask a lot of questions when its church people visiting and ive been coming to see vincent for years so theyre used to me whos vincent she slowed as we reached the end of the hallway and took a deep breath then she gestured for me to enter the last room on the right vincent was my boyfriend she said as she followed me into the room a man sat in the bed a thin blanket covering his body his hands folded neatly on its surface there was something wrong with him his skin was puffy with an oily sheen and his color was off he had a network of fine scars on his face and also on what i could see of his arms below the cuffs of his shirt his dark hair was thin and it hung lank in his face but the worst part was his eyes they stared straight ahead at nothing blinking slowly every few seconds they were the emptiest things id ever seen there was no emotion no evidence of dreams or hopes or plans or disappointments in their depths as we entered they flicked over and looked at us without a trace of interest or curiosity and i had to fight an urge to run from the room and get as far away from him as i could i never told you why i left gypsum prairie said softly i never told anyone but anna and i lied to you earlier when i said i never healed someone who died the truth is that i did i healed vincent i was sixteen and we were in love we were going to run away togetheralice never knew we were just waiting until we had enough money to get someplace far enough away that alice could never find us and we were going to take clover with us she walked to vincent and put a hand to his face i couldnt imagine how she could stand to touch him he didnt seem to notice we had an accident on prom night prairie said adjusting the collar of vincents shirt before she stepped away from the bed he was thrown from the car and he died and unlike you hailey i should have known better i had been warned about what would happen if i ever tried to bring someone back how could you i loved him i thought i would die without him i wished it i actually wished i was dead too but i didnt have the courage to make that happen so i brought him back instead i think there was a part of me that believed if i prayed hard enough if i wanted it badly enough that just this one time it would work that god would take pity on me and let him live a real life not this but of course that didnt happen and once i realized what i had done i left that part was all true the only thing i didnt tell you was that i took vincent with me how did you get him in here i asked horrified we came to chicago by bus on the night of the accident i had a little money enough to get a change of clothes and the bus tickets it was the next day when we finally got there all night long all he did was stare ahead sitting in that bus seat but what about his parents when he didnt come home didnt they freak im sure they were upset hailey but unlike alice they knew about me and vincent they knew he loved me and hed told them if they didnt give their blessing he was leaving with me anyway as soon as we graduated theyd argued about it they wanted him to go to college not to spend all his time with me but he wouldnt listen i think theyeveryone who knew usjust assumed wed run away together and im sure they looked for us for a while but vincent was eighteen legally there wasnt anything they could do they must have been heartbroken i said imagining how his parents must have worriedafter all this time if they were even still alive they had no idea what had happened to their son from the misery in prairies eyes i knew it was a thought that haunted her as well where did you go when you got to chicago i took him to a hospital the best in the city i made sure of that i spent almost the last of the money for a cab and took him to the emergency room there was no one there so i sat him in a chair i pretended to be there for myself which wasnt hard since id been in the accident too and unlike vincent my cuts and bruises werent healed i told them my parents were undocumented and they treated me as an indigent i stayed around long enough to eavesdrop on what they were doing with vincent wait so they didnt know you were together no and he couldnt tell them he didnt even look at me once after that i kept track of him which wasnt easy since i was trying to find a room and a job but i found ways i learned to be creative and convincing one of the doctors on er rotation was a young resident who studied immune disorders thats what they think he has by the way after all this time they still think vincent has some rare immune problem and theyve got him on all these clinical trials they can do that just experiment on him like that technically its not allowed since no one ever claimed him and they never made contact with his family hes a john doe but he had an id bracelet with his name engraved on it so theyve always called him vincent i used to find that a comfort anyway as youll learn yourself someday when moneys involved lots of things are possible the doctor i mentionedthe one who studied immune diseaseshad plenty of funding and arrangements were made she shrugged theyve found ways to keep his skin and organs functioning all this time but how the miracles of modern science prairies voice was heavy with regret its ironic ive often wondered what would happen if the doctors here got together with bryce what they might be able to accomplish but i could never tell them about each other they work at crosspurposes i guess you could say what do the doctors here do to him i asked my throat dry theyre doing research into cell regeneration she said his systems have responded well i guess i should thank them she didnt look all that thankful i didnt blame her what must it be like to see someone she loved here kept alive artificially i tried to imagine him at kazs age full of life laughing but all i saw was an empty shell made of skin what does he do i asked hes very good at simple tasks like sorting beads and solving shape puzzles but hes completely nonverbal they keep hoping i dont know if thats worse here watch this she stood in front of the bed in vincents line of vision vincent clap three times without any change to his blank expression the man raised his hands and slowly slapped them together once twice three times then he let his hands fall back on the covers his eyes never focused watching him sent a chill through me but i didnt want prairie to know how horrified i was you cant blame yourself you couldnt have known prairie shook her head miserably i did understand and i did it anyway i have to make sure this doesnt happen again and that means i have to stop bryce no matter what i couldnt stand to see her this upset dont worry if people know what happens when you heal a dead person they would never do it not on purpose even if bryce manages to make more healers he wouldnt make hailey prairie cut in sharply you dont understand this is exactly what bryce wants to make things like this he wants to sell them to the highest bidder the healers are just a tool like an assembly line i looked at vincent who was staring at nothing a faint shiny bit of drool pooling at the corner of his mouth i didnt understand what could he possibly want with prairies face darkened she grabbed my wrist and pulled me to the bedside until i was standing only a few inches away from vincent vincent hit yourself she whispered and he immediately started to smack himself on one side of his face and then the other his palms flat and hard the sounds of flesh on flesh sharp prairie turned to make sure i was watching and the pain in her eyes was staggering harder she whispered and the thing that used to be vincent curled his fingers into fists and now each blow caused his head to jerk and roll but still he kept at it stop i cried please vincent stop dont dont hurt yourself and just like that the vincent creature the zombie that lived in the ruins of his body put his hands back in his lap his face bore fresh bruising and a few cuts his lip was beginning to swell but there was no sign at all that he noticed much less cared prairie backed away from him her eyes shining with unshed tears why because you can send them into battle hailey she said her voice cracking with emotion you can load them up with explosives and tell them to blow themselves up tell them to walk into shopping malls or schools and theyll never think twice never blink an eye no i whispered horrified no one would yes a dozen of them deployed the right way could bring a major city to its knees but bryce couldnt he wouldnt i saw it i saw the list on bryces desk unstable governments overseas there were half a dozen or more and he doesnt care who he sells to as long as they show him the money first but where would he get the i stopped unable to come up with the right word raw material bryce would need the newly dead and a lot of them if he was going to manufacture enough zombies to sell prairie laughed bitterly hes smart hailey hell find people that wont be missed there are so many more of those than youd ever imagine the homeless and mental patients people abandoned by their families and that doesnt even scratch the surface if hes getting help from inside our government and i have strong reasons to believe he is he could go to veterans hospitals soldiers killed overseasthe remains shipped home could be faked while the real corpses were taken you cant think our own government would be involved in something like this no of course not not officially but theres corruption at every level hailey bryce used to get visits from men who looked official i never paid much attention since i assumed it had to do with our funding but thinking about it now you could totally tell they had once been in the military they had that air about them there was someone he just called the general and we used to joke about that in privatebut now im thinking that was his principal contact but why would they let him sell to enemies of the united states the governments on the list their battles are on their own soil theyre extremists terrorists at war with each otheror with their own people ive wondered if that wasnt part of the plan that some rogue branch of the military might want them to exterminate each other zombies terrorists shadowy operators working outside the control of our own government funding this study in horror it was too much especially when i thought about the fact that without even knowing it i was one of the keys to its success a day ago i would never have believed that there could be something worse than being hunted by killers but now i knew different there was something much worse and it was in me chapter when we got home kaz was in the backyard with chub teaching him to throw a lacrosse ball hailey watch me watch me chub shouted waving the stick around his voice clear and distinct the improvements in his speech growing every day kaz waved grinning but i raced past them with nothing more than a mumbled hello anna had been cooking as promised and the house smelled wonderful but i couldnt bear to talk to her i went straight to kazs room closed the door and lay down on the bed and pulled the pillow over my face trying to block out the images in my mind vincent in the hospital bed staring without seeing rascal after i found the bullet wounds and pushed him to the floor unhurt and uncaring zombies walking straight into battle unfazed by the sights and sounds of war public squares full of people erupting into explosions and flames i didnt know how long i lay there trying not to think there was a gentle tap at the door i pulled the pillow off my face but didnt answer may i come in i couldnt very well keep kaz out of his own room so i sat up and pushed my fingers through my hair hoping i didnt look too messed up come on in he opened the door hesitantly and gestured at the beanbag on the floor mind if i its your room i said blushing i mean i should be asking if you mind he sat strong forearms draped loosely over his knees and looked at me i mean really looked at me in a way i wasnt used to prairie told me about vincent and everything wow thats a lot you know to find out im sorry i shrugged yeah i guess at least the healing well i was kind of getting used to that part but the rest it um i cant i tried to think of a way to describe how i feltalmost like i was guilty of something because if bryce did manage to find me i was pretty sure he could force me to go along with his plan the zombie thing just i dont get how anyone could do that on purpose yeah did you know about rascal no i mean i thought there was something wrong with him and i was kind of surprised i knew prairie could heal animals because she fixed our cats leg once when it fell out of a window a long time ago and when i met you i could tell you were a healer too so i thought it was strange that you werent able to fix your dog but i never knew about the reanimated dead thing until prairie told me just now reanimated dead i grimaced well thats what prairie said i think she has a hard time saying zombie but kaz if youd seen him hey its okay with me you can call them whatever you want i mean decomposing flesh walking around thats kind of the definition of a zombie he flashed me a tentative smile and i felt a little bit better besides other than that little issue i think its cool what you can do your gift that surprised me but then i remembered that hed grown up knowing he was banished what about you i asked do you you know have visions sometimes usually only when something really bads going to happen like when i was a kid i had this vision of our garage burning down i made mom go look and some paint rags had caught fire in the corner or when our downstairs neighbor had a heart attack i saw it a few days earlier how she was lying on the floor of her apartment dead stuff like that can you make yourself have a vision of something you want to see like whether a crazed oneeyed redneck is coming after you kaz shook his head no it doesnt work that way you cant you know summon it or whatever it just happens sometimes i get a dizzy feeling and then theres a sort of extra layer on top of my vision that fades in and out if i close my eyes i just see the vision otherwise it makes me feel like im going to hurl like motion sickness so you dont want to have it while driving or something yeah that would be bad kaz grinned at me and i realized hed done the nearly impossible hed lifted my spirits thanks i said for taking care of burying rascal oh that was no big deal no problem for a minute i thought he was going to say something else about it but then he just stood offered me his hand and pulled me up off the bed you missed lunch i saved you some after all that unbelievably it was a good afternoon prairie and anna were having a serious conversation when we came out of the room and chub had managed to corner annas cat and was trying to pick it up and hug it an experiment that ended with him getting a couple of scratches on his forearms which made him cry i thought about healing them but then i decided that healing should be reserved for when it was really necessary chub still needed to experience the little hurts and challenges of childhood so he would grow up strong and selfsufficient after kaz microwaved me some lunch we all walked to the park kaz carrying a couple of lacrosse sticks and a duffel bag he tried to teach me how to throw and catch and we lost a few balls in the hedges circling the park we pushed chub on the swings and fed stale bread to some ducks and by the time night was starting to fall id managed to forget for a while which was what i suspected anna and prairie had intended on our way to a pizza place that anna and kaz raved about prairie caught up with me im going up to the lab tomorrow early theres only one guard on duty on sundays im thinking i can wait until he goes to the bathroom or something and get past him then i have the prox card to get in the lab she didnt look all that confident i figured there was more to the plan but that she didnt want me to worry do you want me to come along no i think its best if i do it alone i didnt argue maybe i should have but it had been so nice to not think about it for a few hours and i wasnt ready to give that up instead i tried to put it out of my mind telling myself there would be plenty of time to worry later but when we returned home and got chub bathed and put to bed i was exhausted i hadnt had more than a few hours of sleep in days and it hit me hard i crawled into kazs bed chub on his nest of blankets on the floor and fell into a dreamless sleep i woke to someone shaking my arm hailey wake up it was kaz whispering his face hard to see in the moonlight theres a problem ill get prairie meet me in the kitchen i got up quietly so as not to wake chub i splashed water on my face and went to the kitchen when prairie and kaz came in a minute later she looked completely awake as though shed never gone to sleep youve been through so much already she said when she saw me kaz i wish youd let her sleep she has a right to hear this what i demanded as a door opened down the hall and anna came into the kitchen what are you all i had a vision mom kaz said they need to know anna tensed up and i remembered that kaz said his visions always signaled something bad what is it she whispered her face going pale bryce hes medium height brown hair going gray here kaz gestured along his hairline yes i saw him in a room looked like a motel room or a dorm room there were people in the beds hurt people hurt bad prairie they werent even conscious what was he doing it wasnt what he was doing he was just sitting there taking notes or something on his laptop what was it prairie demanded her voice going high and thin what did you see im sorry prairie hes got another healer chapter what do you mean another healer i couldnt see her all that clearly she had long hair and she was leaning over them chanting or talking i couldnt hear i dont hear anything with the visions what made you think she was healing them well first of all it was so obvious they were dying kaz hesitated i mean they were unconscious and one of them had his head shaved and what looked like a recent scar and the other one had a breathing tube and a body cast young guys military prairie said had to be only question is whose and the healer this woman she put her hands on them on their faces kaz demonstrated cupping the sides of his face with his hands and after it was hard to tell because the visions jump around but after they ah woke up woke up prairie repeated sharply yes they moved you know opened their eyes sat up that was about it all i saw prairie was silent but i could tell she was thinking hard who could it be anna asked after a moment there was no one else in your village you are sure no one prairie was vehement clovers dead haileys here alice is broken marys dead theres no one else i dont see where he could have found one one of ours then anna said the healers must have made it out of poland after all we have to go now it was me speaking to my amazement prairie we have to stop him you have to destroy the research we cant let him find her we cant let her make zombies but we cant there isnt much time i insisted isnt that right kaz how much time between your visions and what happens kaz looked from me to prairie i dont know maybe a day or two maybe less there still might be time i pleaded ill help kaz said pushing his chair back from the table the three of us will go mom can take care of chub you will wont you mom what do you mean to do whatever needs to be done to stop that bastard kaz anna snapped there is no need for that no need for what mom no need to call prairies boss what he is shes righthe has to be stopped we have to destroy everything what is this we anna demanded sharply there is no we im going with her kaz said she cant do it alone do not talk crazy anna was shaking with fear or anger or some combination of the two emotions im not crazy kaz said prairie is right we have to destroy the research and stop this guy this man is dangerous kazimierz he hired people to kidnap hailey they kill all those others papa went to war kaz said there was killing there but you didnt stop him i saw that he wouldnt back down and i had a feeling no one was going to be able to tell him what to do i could relate no one was ever going to tell me what to do again either anna prairie said softly i understand ill go alone you cant i protested you cant go alone bryce will kill you not if i plan prairie said but i could tell she was grasping at straws not if i come up with a strategy strategy is not enough kaz interrupted his voice hard as steel you need help i can see things especially if im there if im close it might make a difference i cant ask you that prairie said she raised her shoulders and let them fall her arm i saw moved easily bandage or no bandage its my fault all this happened and im not letting you go alone i said were going with you kaz said he turned to anna mom you didnt raise me to be afraid my father was brave you tell me that every single day of my life you cant deny that your father is gone kaz i cant lose you too i cant annas face reflected a mothers agony prairie too looked uncertain but i knew i knew that kaz would not be stopped if something happens if kaz gets hurt well be there too i said urgently to prairie praying she would understand we could heal himhed be safe with us there anna looked at me carefully her eyes narrowed then she looked at prairie again what do you think she asked softly i cannot ask anything more of you prairie said even this even taking me and hailey in this is so dangerous she was right bryce didnt care about the innocent people who got in the way he wouldnt stop he didnt care how many people died for his research for the chance to study prairie and me and learn how to use our gifts to turn people into killing machines everything this man touched seemed to be about killing he wanted to use me as a tool a way to make him stronger and richer and more powerful while other people died there was silence in the room kaz went to the picture window and stared out into the dark streets with his arms folded across his chest tense and ready after a long moment anna nodded slowly i could tell the decision had been made wed won this round kaz and me we were going with prairie ill guard him like my own prairie said softly hailey too i will do everything i can to bring us back from this unharmed anna nodded and then we were gone kaz drove prairie sat up front with him not saying much she had slicked her hair back into a ponytail and was dressed in jeans and a sweatshirt with an old pair of annas sneakers dressed that way she looked more like a college student than the elegant woman who had first appeared in grams kitchen kaz drove smoothly along lake shore drive the way wed come only last night tonight the moonnearly fullhung over the water near the horizon its reflection shimmering beneath it when we got to evanston i suddenly wished the drive had been longer i didnt feel ready prairie murmured instructions she took us through a neighborhood of stately old homes that got smaller as we drove farther from the lake until they were mostly squat little bungalows we crossed the commuter train tracks and i could see evanstons downtown ahead on the next block there was a cluster of lowslung modern office buildings pull in prairie said park over here by the dumpsters kaz did as she directed we were shielded by a row of trees the civic nosed in under lowhanging branches there were plenty of cars in the lot customers of the thai restaurant and the laundromat across the street heres what im thinking prairie said the data is on computers in the secure lab the prox card will get us in the main part of the lab do you think bryce could be in there i asked possibly but whats more likely is hes got extra security guarding the place with instructions to bring me in if i come poking around by force if necessary although i doubt there would be anyone here in the middle of the night let me go kaz said alone they wont be expecting a man prairie shook her head no i have to go with you what about me i demanded prairie closed her eyes for a moment when she opened them they were clouded with doubt there will be a guard in the lobby she said a night guard unless theyve hired someone new it will be an older man who likes to nap on the job still hes a danger he can trip an alarm that will shut the whole place down and bring security running from offsite and bryce may have paid the guard to contact him first you want me to distract him i asked prairie looked uncomfortable i dont see any other way i thought maybe you could pretend to have some emergency i dont know like maybe youre hurt or something as soon as were in you get out figure out any excuse tell the guard you were mistaken whatever you need to do and then you come back and wait where you can see the car she dug into her pocket and handed me a cell phone this is annas kazs number is on it press and hold the three key and it will dial him direct call if you see anyone coming in the building after usanyone at all or if theres any kind of trouble i didnt like being left behind but i didnt see an alternative what are you going to do to the computers i have full administrative access to all the servers paul gave it to me along with the master keys weve got to hope that bryce never found out im sure he locked me out but he might not have changed the admin login i just need to get in and start the wipedisk program how much data is there anyway kaz demanded because it takes hours to wipe a big disk iim not sure it doesnt matter kaz said his voice edgy and low its going to be fire we both looked at him what do you mean i saw it a vision tonight will end in fire chapter you had a vision i demanded but prairie interrupted fire oh my god i should have thought of that what the walls all around the inner offices theyll burn i brought some stuff from the garage kaz said to use as an accelerant i didnt want to say anything in front of momshe would have lost it if she knewbut it should help spread the fire no what i mean is the walls are flammable bryce had us working with volunteer subjects who claimed to have predictive powers we had a few who kept hitting it off the charts seers you know i was sure of it and bryce was researching ways to block their visions for the military application kaz broke in for the what i was lost but the two of them were practically running over each others words like if the other side had seers youd want to block them right you wouldnt want them to be able to sense your next move only its very hard to do prairie said the only thing we found that seemed to impair the subjects was iron but it wasnt like bryce could put up iron walls in the lab so he found this guy who came up with a way to embed iron filings in polyurethane foam the kind you spray you know that expands only its like a hundred times more flammable than wood so he hired these guys off the books to spray it in all the drywall one weekend last fall thats perfect kaz said perfect for destroying the building i thoughtbut not for getting out alive what sort of accelerant did you bring prairie asked i got a couple of cans of lighter fluid and some paint thinner and matches okay good prairie sighed youve got this all figured out havent you uh yeah but dont tell mom shed ground me for the rest of my life we got out of the car kaz carrying his backpack filled with supplies i stayed back leaning against the car while they slipped off toward the building they kept to the edge of the parking lot as though they were strolling along the street toward downtown when they got to the building they cut over and edged along the front wall barely visible in the shadows it was time i took a deep breath and touched my fingers to my necklace the red stone felt warm to my touch i closed my eyes for a second and tried to empty my mind of everything other than what i had to do then i sprinted across the parking lot and slammed into the glass doors at a flatout run smacking my palms against them and shoving i didnt take a chance on looking for prairie and kaz in the shadows the doors swung open and i was into the buildings lobby to the left was a bank of elevators and to the right was a curved desk where an older man with a brown uniform sat reading a folded newspaper he looked up his eyes wide with surprise as i ran through the lobby to his desk i leaned on it panting i need help i yelled a carit was driving byit hit someone it ran up on the sidewalk by the parking lot i think theyre hurt bad the man lowered the newspaper more slowly than i figured the situation called for youre saying theres some kinda accident out there yes please can you come out i need they got procedures the man said gruffly i read the name on the gold rectangle that was pinned to his shirt maynard i got to call theres no time i was shouting now fear making me loud and careless if he called for help it would ruin everything the police would come and prairie and kaz would never be able to get into the lab please just as soon as i but that was as far as he got because when my hand shot out over the desk and came down gently on the side of his neck his eyes went very wide for a second and his body tensed up as though hed touched a power line then he slumped over on his desk id had no idea that i was about to do what i did and at the same time i had somehow known exactly how to do it powerful the word thrummed in my mind as i backed away from the desk the gift that i had doubted that i had resisted that i had finally used and claimed for my ownit was more powerful than id allowed myself to realize i knew the guard wasnt dead or even hurt what id done was like a surge of calming energy that overrode the circuits of his brain and shut him down temporarily like sleepreally deep sleep i knew it in my blood in the understanding that flowed somewhere inside me where it had lived since i was born since i was conceived even in the violent union of my mother and father the source of my gifts descended from the first families behind me i heard the whoosh of the doors being pushed open i saw that prairie said i just nodded then i remembered we cant leave him here not if theres going to be fire kaz jogged around behind the desk picked up the guard and slung him over his shoulders as though he weighed nothing prairie hesitated only a moment before pointing down the corridor well put him out the back door hell be hidden thereand safe then she turned to me youre done for now hailey go back out wait for us i watched them head down the corridor the guards head bumping gently against kazs back prairie had only just come into my life and i didnt want to lose her i didnt want anything to happen to her but we would always be in danger unless we finished this bryce would keep chasing us as long as he thought we were useful to his work i followed around a couple of corners in the hallway was a reinforced door with no identifying sign prairie held up the little plastic prox card and when the lock clicked she pushed the door open i ran to catch up when kaz saw me he hesitated only for a second before holding the door for me hailey no prairie hissed she deserves to be here kaz said as i pushed past him i grabbed prairies hand and squeezed hard im not going back she stared into my eyes for a moment and then nodded once all right all right you two start dousing the edges of the room along the walls im going to start the wipedisk program i doubt i can get in the server roomthat requires a retinal scan and im sure ive been blockedbut i can do it from my workstation and take this just in case she pressed the prox card into my hand and i pocketed it prairie snapped on a bank of lights and i saw that we were in a huge lab with workstations and sleek monitors and equipment i couldnt begin to name there were roboticlooking devices in various states of assembly on platforms and banks of blinking boxes with cables running in and out in loops more cables snaked along the floor the one thing that was missing was a human presence other than stacks of papers and coffee cups and a sweater or two left over a chair it was as if the people who worked here brought nothing of themselves with them there were no photos no kids drawings tacked to cubicle walls no plants or paperweights or figurines prairie disappeared down a corridor at the other end of the room and kaz dug in his backpack then handed me a can of lighter fluid shouldnt take much he said just concentrate it along the drywall we set to work stepping around the equipment at first i was cautious but then i followed kazs example and shoved things out of the way pushing desks aside to reach the walls the acrid smell of chemicals filled the air stinging my eyes and making me cough and adrenaline pumped through my veins i thought i heard somethinga slam a muffled cryfrom the corridor prairie had entered kaz heard it too and we both went still looking at each other and trying to listen over the hum of the equipment then we were both running toward the source of the sounds we were barely into the hallway when there was a crashing of metal on wood and a heavy door rebounded off the walls a few feet in front of us prairie stumbled into the hallway followed by someone else bryce safianit had to be a wellbuilt man with closecut brown hair and a starched buttondown shirt was holding a gun jammed against prairies back kaz reacted before i could absorb the scenehe rushed forward and slammed between bryce and prairie knocking her to the floor he grabbed for the gun and it went off and a split second later he grabbed one hand with the other wincing blood dripping between his fingers hed been shot in the hand and now bryce had the gun aimed straight at his heart kaz backed up slowly as prairie crawled out of the way and got to her feet the mans eyes met mine narrowed and then relaxed he smiled a cruel and calculating expression that wasnt all that different from the way gram used to look when she thought dun or one of her other customers had said something funny you must be hailey im bryce safian please call me bryce his smile grew wider its a good thing i decided to come check on things in the lab when i heard that my employees had managed to let you slip away yet again you should be congratulated on your ingenuity remarkable really your hand i choked out watching kaz bleed onto the floor dont worry about him bryce said dismissively hes not worth your time you know hailey if things had gone differently i might have been your uncle bryce i looked from him to prairie i had never seen her look so angry bryce followed the direction of my gaze yes thats right i had been thinking of proposing to your aunt that is until she made it clear that we had profound ah you might say fundamental character differences you have no character prairie spat you have no shame youreyoure inhuman bryce laughed a rich and cultured sound thats pretty funny coming from you darling seems like it might be you that deserves that title did you know he said conversationally tipping his head to me that your aunt has chromosomal abnormalities so severe that technically she shouldnt even be alive in any condition known to science oh dear he added creasing his forehead and pretending to be sorry i shouldnt have said that seeing as youand your young friend here too i take ithave the same deficiencies kaz raised his bloody hands as though he was going to go after bryce again but bryce swung the gun between me and prairie and back at kaz his gun hand was steady dont get any bright ideas he said to me you all bleed regular bloodand i should know considering all the testing weve done here presumably losing enough of it will kill you just like it would any normal human and i know you cant heal this one without touching him i could feel the rushing that signaled the need to heal i couldnt take my eyes off kazs shredded hand my fingertips pulsed with the compulsion to touch him to find the wound and let my energy flow to it but i couldnt reach him bryce would never let me get to him and without touching i couldnt heal milla rascal chub id had to lay my hands on them to feel the energy from my fingers go into their bodies kind of funny really bryce went on if you could get to big boy here you could probably fix him up but ive got lots of extra clips so id just keep shooting holes in him no doubt whod win that race huh sunshine you have no idea what youre doing prairie muttered oh but i do whos been running those tests for all these months hmm id say im intimately familiar with just how your special little powers work wouldnt you in fact i think id be able to hurt your young friend here just badly enough that youd have a very difficult choice to make isnt that so prairie she looked stricken a choked sob dying in her throat i remembered her promise to anna ill guard him like my own it doesnt matter anyway bryce went on smiling lazily i dont need you anymore i found someone new shes not as pretty as you and i doubt shell prove as amusing but shes cooperativevery cooperative considering shes become lets say a permanent guest of the laboratory and now that i have hailey the two of them are all i need to get the last of our work done its a shame really that you wont be around to share in the glory so kazs vision had been real bryce had found another healer and locked her up here just as he intended to lock me up my heart sank as i realized that all our work might have been for nothing bryce planned on keeping me alive but he clearly didnt intend to keep prairie or kaz around i felt despair overtaking the determination id started the night with you wont live that long prairie said surprising me with her fury she stepped toward bryce unafraid shoot me if you want go ahead i dare you your new girlfriends never going to make zombies for you thats not what was ordained and you cant fight it bryce chuckled genuine mirth crinkling his eyes at the corners oh prairie such idealism its so refreshing ive always loved that about you if you only knew knew what where do you think i found out about your little niece here prairie hesitated and i saw uncertainty flicker in her eyes the guys you hired i said trying to edge closer to kaz your men your dead men bryce laughed harder that is so amusing to me you see because once they traced prairies true identity we found an unexpected ally someone who was willing to tell us everything we ever wanted to know about you little hailey for a price someone willing to set up the perfect opportunity for my men to come and get you someone who not only wouldnt miss you but would make sure no one else did either a murmur started inside my ears and built quickly into a roar i shook my head and whispered no but i knew exactly who he was talking about your grandmother hailey bryce said barely able to conceal the smug satisfaction in his voice alice tarbell gave you up for five thousand dollars and a ticket to ireland oh and the promise that not to be indelicate when it was time for you to procreate we would furnish you with one of your own kind kaz shot forward launching himself low against bryces torso trying to knock him down but i could see that kazs injury had weakened him made him miscalculate bryce stepped neatly out of the way and his finger tightened on the trigger almost in slow motion i heard the shot and saw kazs injured hand fly out at an odd angle and bang against the wall in a spray of blood chapter the hole in kazs bicep stayed neat and round for a second before blood began to leak from it i could see now that his hand was badly damaged the fingers bloody and bent at odd angles his index finger hanging by a thin strip of skin a wave of nausea rolled through my stomach followed by shame i was supposed to be a healerhow could i be so weak prairie reached for kaz but bryce jammed his gun under her chin and drove her back against the wall kaz sank to the floor his face going white as he tried to squeeze his uninjured hand around his arm above the bullet wound and stop the flow of blood bryce sighed i told you we could do this the hard way or the easy way elizi mean prairie i stepped toward her but bryce swung his arm around and aimed at me thats far enough hailey it might be wise for you to remember that your aunt wont be a bit of good to you if you get hurt kind of an interesting arrangement wouldnt you say its going to be fascinating to study that healers natural resistance to each others gifts im certainly looking forward to that research prairie was inches away from bryce backed up against the wall and the second he turned away from her she tensed i could tell she was going to attack him i shook my head and tried to form the word no because i knew bryce would kill her but i also knew that she was past caring as she lunged at him i waited for the sound of the gun a silent scream building inside but bryce surprised me he brought the gun crashing down against prairies skull above the temple and she crumpled to the ground like a puppet with cut strings but he didnt kill her when he looked up there was something in his expression i recognized it was part longing and part defiance it had something in common with the way rattler had looked at her the ancient blood connection was missing but in that second i realized that bryce too had loved her in his way enough that he couldnt shoot her and i realized that love could be dangerous dont think i wont enjoy killing her slowly bryce said but now we knew he had a weakness and for the first time i saw uncertainty in his eyes he kept his gun trained on me but he knelt beside prairie and felt for her pulse if only there was a way to use his weakness against him i glanced at kaz his eyes were squeezed shut with pain i could tell that he was starting to lose his balance a shocking amount of blood was leaking from his arm the bullet must have hit something important the need to heal surged hot and demanding inside me pulsing its way along my nerves to the tips of my fingers and my desire to put my hands on kaz on his wound was irresistible i willed him to open his eyes and look at meand he did the second his eyes found mine i felt it again the connection id noticed when he first took my hand only now his life depended on it all of our lives i stared deep into his eyes and tried to shut out everything except the gift that was a part of my lifeblood kazs eyes flickered his lips parted slightly i could feel my heartbeat slowing and then i sensed my breathing diminish to almost nothing something happened to my vision too the edges fell away replaced with a haze of shimmering shadow and there was nothing but me and kaz my vision began to fade and my lungs screamed for air but it was beautiful too exquisite and so sharp that it felt like it might tear my heart in pieces this link between us that was more powerful than either of us could ever be alone i fell i didnt realize it was going to happen until i collapsed onto the floor at prairies feet bryce yelled something and turned his gun from prairie to me and i braced for the impact of the bullet wondering where hed shoot me wondering whether it would be better if he merely disabled me and kept me alive in his laboratoryor if he killed me and then bryce slammed into me hard it took me a second to figure out that kaz had shoved him that he had found the energy a last reserve of strength to attack get away get away from him kaz yelled i tried but bryce was so heavy and he was scrambling on top of me heavy knees and elbowsgod it hurtand what about the gun he still had the gun and then he was pulled off me and slammed into the drywall and that was kaz kaz whose good arm was plenty good kaz whose bad arm was good enough because id healed it not very well because it was damn hard to heal without putting your hands on someone but enough enough kaz kicked bryce and the gun went skittering out of his hand and down the hall i pushed against bryce as hard as i could and managed to roll out from under him i tried to reach prairie but i knew i couldnt do anything for her now i couldnt heal her couldnt wake her up kaz was fumbling in the backpack that lay open on the floor pulling out the last can of lighter fluid holding it in the crook of his wounded arm while he twisted the cap off the smell hit me hard as kaz shook the can over bryce the clear liquid splashing his clothes and his face and he clutched his eyes and started screaming a scream of rage that turned to terror when kaz lit a match so much screaming i had finally found my voice and it joined bryces i backed away from the fireball that bryce had become dragging prairie with me watching the trail light up like a sparkler in the dark bryces scream turned into a horrible yowl of pain as he rolled toward the door hed come through kaz grabbed my arm and pulled me upright you dont have much time he said urgently check the server room make sure she got the program started just in case it doesnt all burn ill take care of prairie until you get back dont wait for me i said already backing down the hall just go take her with you but our eyes met and held and dark energy passed between us and i knew he wouldnt leave i wouldnt have either i bolted down the hall smoke rolled down in hot gritty clouds after me and i knew the fire must be raging in the main room the last thing i saw before entering the server room was kaz bending low next to prairie pulling his shirt over his mouth and i prayed there would be enough air for them the door was open to the smaller inside server room it was still cool and dark in there where the fire hadnt yet reached and glowing numbers scrolled at lightning speed along the single monitor on the desk so prairie had succeededthe data on the disk was being scrubbed out of existence it was about time for some good news i emptied the lighter fluid around the equipment and had turned to go to run back to prairie and kaz so we could try to race the fire out of the building when i noticed a door along the other wall of the server room it was a heavily reinforced door like the one to the main lab with a scan pad set into the wall next to it i hesitated the fire was burning and the data was being erased it ought to be enough but the door was locked something in there was important enough that bryce had secured it separately more data specialized equipment and then i remembered what he had said shes become a permanent guest of the laboratory his new healershe was imprisoned somewhere nearby and this was the last place we hadnt looked fear shot through me i had to find her and get her out of the burning building to save her if i could i didnt have a gun didnt even have any more lighter fluid but i pulled the prox card from my pocket and jammed it against the pad i heard the click of the lock releasing without thinking i grabbed the door handle and yanked it what i saw struck me with such blinding horror that i nearly fell back into the raging flames a scream started in my throat and burst from me with the ragged howling desperation of a trapped animal i tried to run but my legs werent workingmy terrified brain couldnt control my movements as electric panic shot along my nerve endings and adrenaline threatened to drown my conscious mind inside sitting motionless on a dozen folding chairs were a dozen men dressed in plain tshirts and khaki pants as i blinked away smoke and gulped the poisonous air deep into my lungs i saw that these were no ordinary men they were decomposing their skin ranged from pasty white to gray and purple and in a few cases it had started to separate from the bone the smell hit me next worse than anything i had ever smelled and bile rose in my throat some of the men werent wearing shoes the flesh swollen and splitting from the bones of their feet the one closest to me had stains on his shirt with a wave of nausea i realized that his torso was leaking bodily fluids worst of all were their eyes empty as though the souls of these men had been sucked out through the sockets their heads slowly turned to me one by one they rose from their chairs and started toward me arms outstretched they were zombies and they were coming for me chapter for a moment i couldnt move my legs still frozen in place from the shock then the closest zombie stumbled in front of me and its fingers scrabbled at my arm they were crusted with black filth and the skin covering its hands had started to separate from the bone i screamed and backed away but not before i saw that its eye sockets drooped with rotting flesh that its gums had shriveled back from broken teeth that its hair was coming out of its head in clumps the smell was so strong that i gagged on my own vomit i turned and bolted for the door but the zombie managed to grab the back of my shirt i was yanked backward and i realized the zombie wasnt weakened at all by decomposition a second gruesome hand reached for my neck and spun me around and i saw that they were all converging on me their hands out their mouths slack and open i screamed and shoved at the reaching hands i screamed harder when my own hands touched flesh that was wet and slick and loose a hand snaked around my face and pressed against my nose and mouth cutting off my air i breathed in the stench of rot my screams turned to fury as i fought to pull away from the bodies pressing in on me but there were too many i bit down hard my teeth closed on a finger as i threw all my strength into fighting i heard a soggy crack and the finger separated from the hand i spat it out and kept screaming my voice going hoarse i stomped on the shuffling feet around me but there were too many another hand replaced the first and then another tugging at my hair thumbs poking at my eyeballs i was going to die the zombies had been ordered to destroy meto destroy anyone but bryce i guessed how long had he been building this ragtag army judging by the state of their bodies it must have been days weeks even given what prairie had told me about decomposition slowing even longer if bryce had been working on ways to retard it i was going to die but my rage kept me fighting my fingers found flesh and they shoved and poked and fought undaunted even when they sank into rotting tissue i knew i couldnt kill the zombies their pathetic bodies would keep going until all the flesh had fallen away and they were nothing but skeletons and only when the last of the tissue had rotted would they be truly dead i on the other hand would die as a human dies they would squeeze the breath from my throat and twist and crack my limbs and take me to the floor to kick and pummel the life from me hailey kaz burst through the door he hesitated only a second taking in the scene and then he picked up one of the folding chairs wielding it in front of him he charged the zombies they were clustered in front of me for some reason lacking the instinct to circle behind and surround me and kaz slammed into them knocking several down right away and then with stunning force going after the ones that remained he jabbed and slammed the chair the way id seen him use his lacrosse stick in the park with deadly accuracy and the force of all that hardbuilt muscle their hands fell away from me one by one they were slow to adapt to the change of circumstances and they bumped into one another and hesitated their hands closing on air their expressions unchanged the ones that had been knocked down were getting off the floor and coming at kaz and i knew i had only seconds until they adapted to the new threat i put all my energy into kicking and clawing i managed to tear my arms free as i delivered a kick to the legs of the last one holding me and its feet slipped and it went down now i screamed and grabbed kazs arm and pulled him toward the door he threw the chair at the advancing zombies and we both fell through the door as i pulled it shut hard theyre locked inside i said as much a prayer as a statement kaz grabbed my hand and we ran back into the smoky hall there were flames licking along the floor and i realized that the fire would reach the server lab in seconds prairie i asked choking on the smoke got her to the lobby kaz said try not to breathe until were clear i took a last lungful of breath and held it we ran until we couldnt see through the smoke and then we put our free hands to the walls and guided ourselves that way following the corridors until we were running through fire the flames licked against us and i knew that if our clothes caught fire we were doomed then suddenly we burst into the lobby where the smoke was thinner and i saw prairie laid out along the floor near the guard desk she looked dead her head lolling against her outstretched arm and my heart plummeted shes going to be all right ill get her kaz managed to wheeze and he slung her over his shoulder much as hed carried the guard earlier i coughed hard trying to clear the smoke from my lungs and when i followed him through the doors out into the chilly night i breathed the sharp cold air greedily before i could catch my breath kaz grabbed my arm and pulled me away from the building into the shadows of the trees lining the street we need to hurry he said what about the healer i said my voice hoarse and raw shes still trapped in there somewhere that was when i heard the sirens kaz heard them too he looked back at the building where flames were now pouring from every window then he looked at me with such pain in his eyes that i knew there was no hope the healer would die alone and in agony alongside the horrible creatures she had been forced to create prairie moaned softly and stirred we need to hurry he repeated and i knew we wouldnt speak of the healer again by the time we got prairie settled into the backseat police and fire vehicles were hurtling down the block toward the lab i turned away from the burning building and stared out the windshield into the night as kaz drove us away chapter prairie woke up right before we reached the house she had a wicked bruise on her scalp but otherwise she seemed all right kaz filled her in on the terrible discovery id made in the room behind the lab and described how wed escaped i couldnt bring myself to talk about it yet i kept feeling those cold hands grasping at me and i knew i would never be able to forget the sensation of my fingers sinking into the ruined flesh of my attackers anna got a muchcondensed version by unspoken agreement we spared her the worst of the details kazs wounds looked like little more than scrapes nowfull function had been restored to his hand and the hole in his arm closed overso we didnt tell her the extent of his injuries we skipped the zombies entirely she had the news on though and she nearly cried with relief that wed escaped the fire which had turned into an inferno that was expected to consume the entire building crews had come from up and down the north shore and they were trying to save the adjoining buildings there had been two survivors one was the security guard who had been found wandering around the back of the building dazed and disoriented but otherwise unharmed he was unable to supply any details about the start of the fire because his memory of the nights events ended at the sandwich hed had on his dinner break the other survivor was taken from the building on a stretcher we saw the same footage played several times none of us could look away its him prairie said the first time as the paramedics carried the stretcher past the news crews to the waiting ambulance those are his shoes there was only one shoe though it was an expensive leather loafer that had blistered and peeled in the heat but stayed attached to bryces foot his other foot was bare and it was clear his pants had burned away the blackened flesh of bryces leg was visible in the instant before the camera cut away burns over eighty percent of his body the reporter confided in tones that barely concealed an undercurrent of excitement it was a story that would lead for days that much was clear especially as breaking details about the lab revealed it had been carrying on important scientific efforts endorsed by the university though reporters were having trouble getting confirmation we drank strong coffee while we watched anna set out a plate of sandwiches as the first hint of morning colored the edge of the sky but no one touched them i wondered if id ever sleep through another night if dawn would become a familiar sight for me as i was beginning to doze off leaning against prairie an announcer cut into the broadcast there it goes folks he said barely containing his excitement as predicted it looks like the buildings a totaloh my god would you look at that we all leaned forward as the building fell in on itself in slow motion the upper floors collapsing like papiermâché i reached for prairies hand they have to be dead i whispered we both knew it was a question she nodded they said the temperatures got well over a thousand degrees and now this they wont find anything by the time its finished burning maybe some bone fragments i nodded and snuggled a little closer praying she was right praying zombies burned like everyone else and trying not to think about the healer trapped inside a moment later though she stiffened we forgot she said tugging at the blanket that covered us both we forgot his apartment weve got to get over there and destroy his papers and his backup i sat up straight kaz was already getting to his feet anna tried to pull him back down this is not the time she said youre exhausted everything is destroyed there bryce is in hospital probably going to die but she hadnt seen the zombies we had the argument was cut short when kaz hugged anna hard i love you mom he said every syllable a promise and well be back safe the trip back to evanston was harder than the one before even though there was nothing left that could hurt us it had all been destroyed in the fire but we were no longer fueled by the energy of our quest this was a sad trip the culmination of a journey that had as many losses as gains and we barely spoke at all except for prairies occasional directions we found a spot on a crowded street kaz eased the little car into a tiny space the apartment building was only a few years old a ritzy gleaming brick and steel and glass tower whats in the documents anyway kaz asked as we got out of the car hed brought his backpack but this time it was to take things with us prairie said there was less than a single filing cabinet drawer of documents plus bryces laptop we planned to shred the documents back at annas and destroy the laptop there too from what i could tell it was mostly his notes to himself he may have transferred them to electronic files later but these were handwritten lists like the one i told you about with his contacts in foreign militaries i dont really know whats there but i figure we need to be safe in the gleaming lobby the guard nodded and smiled at prairie clearly he recognized her from past visits bryce must not have told the guard that she was no longer welcome as we got to the elevators prairie leaned in close to me close enough that i could see the fine network of lines around her eyes the deep purple smudges beneath them she looked so tired its almost over she said quietly and i wondered if she was trying to reassure herself as much as me the elevator glided smoothly to the top floor we walked down a softly lit carpeted hallway there were only two apartments the penthouses prairie slid her key in the lock and the last possible obstacle was removednot that bryce would have had time to change the locks but i had learned to take nothing for granted the door opened on a beautiful if sparsely furnished apartment the midday sun sparkled off tabletops wood floors a vase of tulips sleek furniture was arranged around a richly patterned rug everything looked normal inviting even my shoulders practically sagged with relief at last it felt like we had reached the end of our journey ill just be a minute prairie said going to the desk in the den off the main room and starting to gather up papers kaz put out his arm and i leaned into him letting him support me breathing in the comforting scent of clean laundry and soap as my eyes fluttered shut i wondered if it would be possible for me to fall asleep standing up because i felt like i could sleep forever that was when the voice called out mr safian it was a womans voice heavily accented like annas but far closer to its speakers polish roots i froze as kaz stiffened at my side prairie dropped the papers in her hands the voice came from behind a closed door in the apartments long hallway i looked at prairie questioningly guest room she whispered i started toward it but she stopped me a warning hand on my arm shes banished i said i sensed it even through the closed door even across the distance the stirring of the blood the heightening of my senses it was all there mr safian the voice said again now wailing you leave me all night mr safian its her kaz said the one i saw in the vision it has to be we dont know prairie said we cant be sure you not come back you promise come back you not come back i am so scared the voice broke down in sobs as prairies hand tightened on my arm please dont be angry mr safian we will do your work no more fight no more resist we do what you ask now you bring my sisters yes now you bring my sisters back to me about the author sophie littlefield is the
