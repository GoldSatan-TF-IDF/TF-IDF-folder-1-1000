bios by robert charles wilson prologue the regulator lay deep in the flesh of the girls upper arm a pale egg in a capillary nest anna chopra pared away the tissue with careful strokes of the hemostatic scalpel her small expert hands wanted to tremble she willed them to be steady this was she knew an act of sabotage she was performing a surgical intervention without consent worse she was interfering with an instrument of the trusts violating the law if not perhaps her hippocratic oath she was alone with the unconscious and sedated girl and that had been part of the temptation in any operating theater on earth she would have been surrounded by colleagues and students on earth one was always surrounded here at least for the moment she was surrounded only by mute machinery and surgical tools dangling on coiled wire in the nearweightless environment no audience hence no witnesses she was trustworthy or so the trusts believed the thymostat had been installed in the girls arm years ago it had gone about its business flawlessly and showed no sign of failing now the thermostat of the soul her professor at calcutta had called the common bioregulator it was in effect an artificial gland monitoring blood levels and maintaining selfsynthesized doses of n euro transmitters and inhibitorsleveling moods sustaining alertness suppressing fatigue anna chopra wore one herself as did most terrestrial technicians and managers but this girlyoung woman really though she looked like an infant from the perspective of annas seventy yearsthis zoe fisher was different zoe fisher was a creation of the devices and personnel branch of the trusts she had been bred and modulated for her work on the distant world of isis she was essentially a human machine her bioregulation was spectacularly thorough anna did not doubt that the girls every bad dream and brief ecstasy had been monitored calculated and soothed by this small but complex thymostat well before she learned to speak the bioregulator had put tendrilssamplers and dripsinto the brachial artery and the ulnar collaterals anna chopra severed the connections neatly and professionally watching as the remnant pieces selfsuturing merged into the arterys pulsing wall the thymostat itself about the size of a robins egg and plump with blood she pushed into the intake of a wastedisposal chute stray blood droplets drifted toward a gurgling air drain why this small act of sabotage why now maybe because a life rime of obedience had left anna chopra feeling stale and futile maybe because this girl reminded anna of her sisters three of whom had been sold into the state brothels in madras as a result of her familys financial reverses brothel inmates were happy everyone saidthoroughly trained and exhaustively bioregulated young zoe fisher had probably never been near a brothel but she was just as surely a slave and her thymostat might as well have been a leg iron or a steel collar since she left earth anna chopra had met many technicians from the kuiper republics none of whom wore regulators of any kind and she had come to envy their spontaneity their wealth of moods their rawness she might have been such a person herself given the opportunity given another lifetime let the trusts find out what happened when one of their marionettes woke up without its strings oh most likely the theft would be detected and a new regulator installed but maybe not zoe fisher was bound for isisthe farthest outpost of human exploration far beyond even the isolated kibbutzim of the kuiper republics a frontier where the power of the trusts was limited anna chopra closed the incision and sealed it with a gel rich in regenerative nanobacters finished with her act of sabotage and instantly guilty about what she had doneanna proceeded to her real work rotating the girls unconscious body in its surgical sling cutting into the abdominal muscles to replace a depleted blood filter zoe was full of new technology mainly immunesystem enhancers of a kind anna had never seen before bloody white biomodules clustered around the abdominal aorta like insect eggs on milkweed anna ignored these mysterious devices she replaced the defective renal filter and closed the muscle tissue with more gel and was finished she instructed the anesthistat a hulking black tractible robot to bring zoe up to a natural sleep state and maintain the analgesic drip at last she stripped off her gloves and stepped back from the surgical sling now her hands began to shake in earnest annas seventy years were about half the average lifetime of a senior manager or a member of the families but she was a mere level three technician and her telomerases were rapidly running out according to her career schedule she would be in a terrestrial geriatric hospice before the end of the decade where she could allow her hands to tremble freely while she waited for degenerative disease or quota euthanasia to end her lifeher functional perfect life as a good citizen of the trusts and servant of the families barring the occasional act of defiance she glanced reflexively over her shoulder but of course there was no one to witness her criminal act this small cometary objectthey called it phoenixwas very nearly uninhabited now all but the vital staff had left in preparation for the higgs launch nor was physical evidence a problem before very long nothing would remain of phoenix but scattered radioactive particles and cherenkov radiation embers and ashes the thought was soothing somehow her rapidly beating heart began to slow all that persisted anna told herself were embers and ashes sparks and dust it was the kuiper technicians who had named this planetisimal phoenix even a small world they insisted ought to have a name before it ceased to exist phoenix rolled around the sun well beyond the orbit of neptune and above the plane of the solar eclipticthe desert of the solar system in a matter of hours now phoenix would die in the most dramatic possible fashion and when phoenix vanished from the solar system so would zoe fisher the technicians suiting zoe for the launch seemed in awe of tier though they had rehearsed this act countless times in awe at least of the forces to which zoe would soon be subjected if they could zoe thought they would write their names on her body like twentiethcentury war pilots autographing a missile but she was not a missile she was simply cargo five and a half feet and one hundred and thirty pounds of cargo no different from the three other human beings several hundred clonal mouse and pig embryos and sundry supplies also bound for isis soon enough they would all be loaded into the catacombs of the higgs sphere buried in the icy core of phoenix the prelaunch supervisorhe was one of those longfaced terrestrial kachos who serviced starships and their cargo but would never dare dream of riding one himselfapproached zoe where she sat halfembedded in her armor his lips were pursed into a frown theres a call for you citizen fisher this late in the launch sequence zoe thought it must be someone with a great deal of clout someone highly placed in the trusts or at leastdare she hopein the devices and personnel branch the lower half of her body was already entombed in the bulky journeyrig steel sheaths too massive to lift under any kind of spin without the help of powerful hydraulics she felt like a knighterrant about to be winched onto her horse helpless who is it your dandp man from the diemos installation theo of course she grinned float me a monitor please he made a sour face but brought her a screen the suiting room was cramped but so was every chamber inside the cometary fragment much of phoenix had been excavated to contain the fusion launcher and payload the small worlds waterrich debris vectored off to reclamation points nearer the sun these pressurized chambers were essentially makeshiftwhy waste labor on a habitat meant to be vaporized the room around her was as stark as the turing constructors had left it medical and technical gear strapped randomly to the flat white walls at least her hands were free zoe touched a finger to the identity pad of the monitor avrion theophilus appeared at once theo was an older man well into the first decade of his second century his hair was white but thick his skin pale but supple he greeted her in high english causing the kuiperborn technicians to exchange uneasy looks he apologized for the interruption i wanted to wish you luck not that you need it time is short i know too short or not short enough zoe couldnt name the odd hollowness she felt in her stomach thank you she wished he could be here to say goodbye in person she missed her mentor she had left him more than a year ago in a sun garden on diemos theo couldnt come to phoenix because he would have brought his intestinal flora with him phoenix was cleanat the moment the cleanest inhabited environment in the system zoes own benign bacteria and other biological hitchhikers had been systematically eradicated replaced where necessary with sterile nanobacters even the technicians from the diseasefree kuiper colonies had been deconned for service on phoenix be brave little one theo said it looks crowded there the chamber was crowded crowded with technicians as close as cattle in a pen all of them waiting impatiently for zoe to finish her conversation they treat me as if im radioactive she whispered youre not but they will be if they dont evacuate on schedule i dont doubt it makes them nervous we ought to let them get on with their work im glad you called it was good to see him again his high family face so calm and proud avrion theophilus was the only human being zoe had ever fully trusted and the hardest part of this missionat least so farhad been her separation from theo was that a paradox she had been bred and regulated to endure solitude but theo was different he wasnt ordinary people he was well theo the closest thing to a father she had ever known travel safely zoe he seemed to hesitate you know i envy you i wish you could come with me someday with any luck someday soon that was cryptic but zoe didnt ask what he meant theo had always wanted to see isis and in a sense he was going with her you cant take much baggage across the bridge to the stars theo used to say but memories were massless and her memories of theo were deeply held she wanted to tell him so but her throat closed on the words he gave her an encouraging smile and as suddenly as that was gone a technician took the monitor away time ebbed quickly now the journeyrigs containment ring snapped shut around her throat immobilizing her head this part would be uncomfortable though she had rehearsed it a number of times she would have to endure paralytic confinement and absolute darkness at least until the medical system was activated and the suit began to flood her body with narcotic and anxiolytic molecules i will sleep zoe thought inside this steel box she waited for the massive helmet dark and enclosing her heart hammered at the cage of her ribs the remaining technical staff anna chopra among them left phoenix in a small armada of reaction rockets anna had not forgotten her small act of defiance though she wished she could it had been of course stupid a gesture a whim without utility and in all likelihood without consequence she was tempted to confess and have done with it better an early euthanasia than another ten years in a geriatric ward although she took a deep and private pleasure at having finally at her age a secret worth keeping had she done the girl a favor she had thought so when she applied scalpel to flesh but she doubted it now when zoe fisher woke up without her neurochemical safety net the change would not be obvious it would take weeks perhaps months for her neural receptors to perceive and react to the absence of the thymostat symptoms would set in gradually maybe gradually enough for zoe to adapt to the unregulated life she might even learn to like herself that way but sooner or later the trusts would find her out her thymostat would be replaced and whatever new essence zoe had distilled in herself would be drained away and that would be that but still everything born had to die the trusts perhaps excluded and if life meant anything then even a brief life was better than none deep inside herself anna liked the idea of this zoe fisher this devices and personnel bottle baby wrenched out of the grip of the trusts even for a day do something zoe anna thought do something gaudy or foolish or grand weep fall in love write poetry look wildeyed at this new world of yours she adjusted her cabin screen to the exterior view of phoenix already a faint point of light in a well of empty space she had decided she wanted to see the launchthe bright bloom of the fusion event the brilliant aurora as it faded comatose and immobilized zoe became one more inert object to be ferried by tractible into the deep core of the launch facility and harnessed inside the payload sphere which was suspended in turn by enormous pylons from the cored massif of rock and ice lenses of exotic matter surrounded the sphere like huge octagonal crystals the lenses would be destroyed along with the rest of phoenix but only in the femtoseconds after they had served their purpose the cometary body was rigged for inducedfield fusion neither zoe nor the tractible robots were aware of the countdown ticking away in phoenixs supercooled processor arrays the detonation would be triggered by processors in the payload capsule itself as soon as the failsafe sequences were satisfied it was the third interstellar launch this terrestrial year each launch as costly as creating an entire new kuiper habitat or a martian airfarm a measurable fraction of the solar systems economic output had been channeled into this project not since the ancient days of apollo and soyuz had exploration been so enormously difficult to manage and finance all irreversible now microswitches poised for months fell at last into their final alignment zoe slept and if she dreamed she dreamed only of motion a separation as ponderous as the calving of glaciers in her dreams the light was fiercely bright part one one decanted unconscious into the almost windowless environment of the isis orbital station zoe longed for a glimpse of her new world wanted it so badly in fact that she was contemplating a serious breach of protocol she could prompt the image of isis onto any local screen of course and she had seen such images for much of her life often dailyimages either relayed to sol from the ios or captured by the planetary interferometer but that wasnt enough she was here after all scant hundreds of kilometers from the surface of the planet itself low isis orbit she had traveled farther in an instant than a conventional spacefarer could hope to travel in a lifetime she had arrived at the very edge of the human diaspora the dizzying brink of the abyssal deeps and she deserved a direct look at the planet that had drawn her so far from homedidnt she in the old days astronomers had talked about first lightthe fresh view through a brandnew optical instrument zoe had looked at isis through every kind of optical instrument barring her own eyes now she wanted that direct view her own personal first light instead she had spent three days in the ioss infirmary under useless observation and a week haunting her assigned cabin while waiting for a place on the duty roster ten days from decantation ten days without orders agenda or more than a brief word from management she had seen to date only the gently concave walls and steel floors of her cubby and the recovery ward in medical the sole official communications she had received were a list of meal hours an access code her residence number and a name badge consequently zoe summoned her courage and scheduled an appointment with kenyon degrandpre the outpost manager she was awed at her own impertinence probably she should have talked to her section chief first but no one had told her who her section chief was or how to find him the isis orbital station had been assembled from the shells of early model higgs spheres in a ringofpearls configuration the maps posted on the corridor walls reminded zoe of the benzene rings illustrated in chemistry texts with the outposts fusion bottles and heat exchangers projecting like complex side chains from the symmetrical core on the morning of her appointment with degrandpre zoe left her tiny cabin at the bottom of habitat seven and walked the ring corridor a kilometer spinward nearly half the total circumference of the ios the ring corridor smelled of hot metal and cycled atmosphere like a kuiper habitat but without the everpresent tang of ice in the air bulkhead doors loomed like massive guillotine blades the gangways were narrow and possessed arm nor windows this place was not as emotionally and culturally blank as phoenix had been but neither was it a typical kuiper world full of color and noisy with children the terrestrial esthetic prevailed linear functionality enforced by strict cargo limitations windows were a luxury zoe supposed according to the ios plan shed reviewed on her terminal the project managers office possessed one of the stations few accessible directview windows a wedge of threeinchthick polarized glass set into the exterior wall the rest of the stations windows were tiny ports cut into the docking bays an area for which zoe was not yet authorized but that was irrelevant she told herself she had business with degrandpre the window was just a perquisite from the name she had expected someone almost familywerent there degrandpres among the brazilian landholdersbut kenyon degrandpre was not a handsome or an imposing man a manager of some rank but never family his head was too long his nose too flat zoes experience with the upper echelons of the trusts had taught her that handsome managers might be capable of a certain generosity ugly menalthough degrandpre didnt quite fit that description either at least not by terrestrial standardswere more likely to read regulations and nurse grudges she knew for a fact had known all her life that rigid personalities were a staple in the bureaucracies of the trusts but surely the man who managed the isis orbital station in effect the isis project itself must be more flexible mustnt he maybe not degrandpre raised his big head briefly and waved zoe to a chair but his attention remained on his desktop zoe stood near the window instead it wasnt much of a window she supposed the brutal payload limitations of the higgs launchers made even this small luxury prohibitively expensive still here was her first genuinely direct view of the planet below unmediated light zoe thought excitedly first light the ios had just crossed the planets terminator the long light of dawn picked out clouds in vivid chiaroscuro across the dark zone lightning nickered embers on velvet zoe had seen planets before she had seen earth from orbit a view not dissimilar shed spent a year on europa learning pressure lab technique and the vast orb of jupiter had filled more of the sky far more dramatically but this was isis that glitter of sunlight came from a star not earths here was a living world that had never seen a naked human footprint a world strange and alive rich with biology a swarming waterdrop orbiting a foreign sun as lovely as earth and infinitely more deadly is there an issue degrandpre said at last or have you come to stare you wouldnt be the first citizen fisher degrandpres voice had the bite of terrestrial authority his english was finely honed zoe thought she heard a touch of beijing elite school in the understated consonants she took a breath ive been here ten days apart from the habitat seven physical regime director and the cafeteria staff i havent spoken to anyone in authority i dont know who to report to the people who are supposed to oversee my work directly are all onplanetwhich is where i ought to be degrandpre tapped his stylus and sat back in his chair his clothing was sere gray the inevitable kacho uniform a stiff black collar framing his thick peasant neck wooden chair wooden desk a plush carpet and a multilayered dress uniform all of this would have been shipped from earth at an expense zoe shuddered to consider he asked do you feel neglected no not neglected i just wanted to make certain that we havent forgotten you well yes manager degrandpre continued to tap his stylus against the desktop a sound that made zoe think of ice cracking in a warm glass he seemed as much amused as irritated let me ask you this citizen fisher in an outpost of this size with every gram accounted for and every sou budgeted do you really suppose people get lost she reddened i wasnt thinking of it that way in the last six weeks weve conducted four shuttle exchanges with the downstations each exchange calls for lengthy quarantine and elaborate sterile docking protocols flights are scheduled months m advance you people arrive thinking the higgs launch was the bottleneck and that a trip downside must be a holiday jaunt by comparison not so im aware of your presence and your purpose and you have a place obviously on the rotation est but our first priority has to be resupply and maintenance you must understand that but you knew i was coming zoe thought why didnt the schedule reflect that or had there been delays she didnt know about beg pardon manager degrandpre but i havent even seen an agenda when am i scheduled to drop youll be notified is that all well yes sir now that shed looked through the window degrandpre eyed his rapidly scrolling desktop i have a delegation from yambuku waiting outside people youll be working with you might as well stay and listen meet your colleagues he said this as if he had made a grand concession planned of course in advance it was one of those kacho maneuvers the bureaucrats loved so much surprise the opposition never be surprised zoe said yambuku downstation delta delta is called yambuku gamma is marburg yambuku and marburg were the first identified strains of the hemorrhagic fever that had devastated twentyfirstcentury earth a microbiologists joke most likely a kuiper microbiologists joke the terrestrial sense of humor was limited in that department sit degrandpre said pay attention try not to talk you may continue looking out the window if you like she ignored his sarcasm and did exactly that dawn had reached the scattered island chains of the western sea a dark plume of ejecta like soot trailed from an active volcano the greater continental mass wheeled into view dense with temperate and boreal forests sunlight glinted from an ancient blue crater lake here glanced off a fringe of polar ice there cloudtops white as cut diamonds and all of it as lethal as arsenic her new home two men and a woman shuffled into the room and occupied the conference table zoe continued to linger by the window she didnt need degrandpres advice to keep quiet she found crowded rooms intimidating kenyon degrandpre introduced the new arrivals as tam hayes elam mather and dieter franklin all from yambuku station all up on the latest shuttle zoe recognized hayes from photos he was the delta station manager and the isis projects senior biologistsenior in status not in age hayes was a relatively young man despite his five years on isis rotation handsome in a rough way he needed a haircut zoe thought his beard was eke tangled copper a typical disheveled kuiperborn scientist in other words the other two werent much different hayes thrust his hand at her zoe fisher we were hoping to meet you zoe took his hand reluctantly she didnt like touching people hadnt hayes been briefed on that or didnt he care her hand disappeared into his meaty grip dr hayes she murmured concealing her uneasiness please call me tam i gather well be working together you can get to know each other later degrandpre said to zoe dr hayes and his people have been vetting proposed archival material for transmission to earth zoe followed the exchange between hayes and degrandpre closely trying to sort out the conflicts the particlepair link to earth was such a narrow pipeline so severely bandwidthlimited that project downloads were hotly contested and had to undergo a kind of information triage degrandpre was the final arbiter so here was hayes the yambuku project leader delivering an impatient summary of his groups packet data and degrandpre playing the infuriating role of ultimate trust bureaucrat aloof bored skeptical he fiddled with his stylus and crossed his legs and periodically asked hayes to clarify some point that had been perfectly obvious to begin with finally he said show me the visuals holographs and photos were particularly expensive to transmit but they took the place of voucher specimens and were often popular in the press back home a large central screen unfurled from the ceiling the images in the yambuku packet were micrographs of viruses bacteria prions and biologically active protein chains all of them alc as hayes put it awaiting latin cognomen there was also a series of conventional photographs to illustrate a journal submission from one of his junior biologists degrandpre asked more exploding mice zoe had never heard the expression judging by the look on his face hayes disliked it liveanimal exposures yes ramp them up please dr hayes hayes used a handheld scroll to order up the images from the ioss central memory zoe caught degrandpre glancing at her curiously gauging her reaction if so why elam mather a thickfaced woman in lab grays stood up to narrate the images her voice was strong and impatient the concept here was to sort ambient isian microorganisms through a series of micron filters in order to evaluate their lethality and mode of action we took a sample of air from outside the station near dusk on a calm dry day meteorological notes are appended crude assay gave us a load of organic matter and the usual assortment of water droplets silicate dust and so forth one sample was forced through a filter and injected into an isolation chamber containing a clonal mouse of the cibathirtyseven strain an image came up on the screen zoe looked at it swallowed and looked away the result elam mather said was essentially the same as for unfiltered native air within minutes the mouse had spiked a fever and before two hours had passed it was bleeding internally systemic collapse bleedout and tissue deliquescence followed rapidly more than a dozen foreign microbial species were cultured from the mouses blood again the usual suspects the next sample went through a finer screening on earth that would remove all spores and bacteria but not viruses or prions the second exposed mouse also diedobviouslybut the onset of the toxemia was slightly more gradual the outcome however was the same a mix of fur and muscle tissue in a pool of deliquescent black liquid the ciba mouse might as well have been popped into a food processor probably zoe thought that would have been kinder the sight of the dead creature affected her more than she expected her throat constricted and she wondered if she might have to vomit she narrowed her eyes in order to avoid the rest of the photographs while pretending to look at them the research duplicated confirmed and extended earlier work there was nothing very novel about it either degrandpre had wanted to see it himself or he had wanted zoe to see it because im not a microbiologist zoe thought he sees me as some pampered terrestrial theoretician as if i didnt know what i was getting into even with microfine hepa filtration clonal mice eventually sickened after repeated exposure to native air in this case were looking at dusts and protein fragments perhaps triggering an allergenic reaction not the full hemorrhagic blowout but still a deadly hazard the man named dieter franklin said laconically the planet is trying to kill us but we proved that long ago the surprising thing is how hard its trying to kill us degrandpre shot zoe one more glance as if to say you see isis will kill you if you let it zoe remained expressionless she didnt want to give him the satisfaction of knowing she was afraid she ran into tam hayes in the cafeteria a day later the cafeteria was as spartan as every other chamber in the iossteel deck assembled by turing constructors welded seams exposed the chairs and trestle tables flimsy and makeshift this was inevitable in an environment where every manufactured object was either shipped in from earth at obscene expense or pieced together by turing factories on isiss diemossized moon at least the cafeteria had been decorated some artistic soul had grooved the flat inner walls with an assembly etcher wasting time and energy zoe supposed but not essential supplies the far wall was a celtic tapestry of knotted lines with kuiper clan signs worked discreetly into the design pretty enough she thought if vaguely subversive unfortunately the overhead lights were naked sulfurmicrowave dots they made the food look as bright and false as polystyrene morning dr fisher hayes came up behind her carrying a thermal bowl of glutinous flavinoid soup mind if i join you morning dinnertime by zoes clock im keeping yambuku time suns just coming up over the lowlands unless its raining youll see it soon enough yourself im looking forward to it i havent seen much from orbit theyre stingy with windows but the live relays are almost as good i saw camera feeds back home he nodded ios fever i know the feeling suffered from it myself once he settled into a chair opposite her you want the real thing but yambukus much the same im afraid isis is right there under your feet but youre still utterly isolated from it sometimes i dream of walking outsidewithout excursion armor i mean he added i envy you dr fisher sooner or later youll have that experience call me zoe he obviously preferred kuiperstyle informality or he wouldnt be here talking to her he offered his handagain she took it reluctantly his hand was dry hers was moist he said im tam she knew all about him from her prep reading hayes ran yambuku from the ground he was a technical manager and microbiologist exiled from some puritanical kuiper colony because he had dared to sign a contract with the trusts he was thirtyfive years old real years he hadnt taken rejuvenation treatments zoe found herself drawn to the wrinkles at the corners of his eyes amiable contour maps like theos eye lines but less harsh less etched you envy me she said but kenyon degrandpre seems to think im doomed well degrandpre ios politics mean nothing to me but degrandpre is old terrestrial stock no insult intended hes a manager a kacho hed be happy if nothing ever changed here keep the equilibrium balance the books save face thats his agenda dont expect sympathy from kenyon degrandpre it seemed like he was trying to frighten me did it work he meant the remark jokingly but zoe was startled because yes she was frightened she was now that she came to admit it so frightened that the food stuck in her throat and her stomach clenched like a fist more frightened than she had thought possible zoe hayes frowned across the table are you all right she controlled herself yes just waiting for her thymostat to do its work to wash her in some soothing bath of neurotransmitters it would happen zoe was sure if she was only patient enough the fear would go away and she would be normal again two traveling back to the surface of isis was ordinarily a tedious process at least in calm weatherand better tedious than excitingbut the shuttle had barely broken the cloud layer when tam hayes discovered he had a crisis waiting for him not that a crisis was unusual at yambuku either but this crisis might prove lethal hayes had left macabie feya in charge of the station mac was an accomplished engineer a reformed mormon needle clan out of kuiper body with a genius for micro and turing devices and as fine a grasp of sterile technique as a kuiper education could provide he was also an old yambuku hand with two years station time behind him and he should have known better than to venture outside with uncertified armor but that was exactly what mac had done and he had got himself into trouble out in open air a scatter of cirrus ran high across the western steppes the shuttle skimmed through overcast into watery daylight winds were light though a distant storm cell dropped curtains of rain a dozen kilometers north of the river valley eastward the copper mountain range was all but invisible in an upwash of cloud a few fingers of sunlight touched the emerald foothills yambuku was situated in a relatively dry forested incline in the heart of the western continent but isis was everywhere a wet world the rains came almost daily and winds were often a problem complicating shuttle schedules and shutting down mobile remotes hayes moved up next to the shuttles reserve pilot who nodded curtly not much in the way of details so far dr hayes theyre pretty busy with this i gather mac feya was outside the station doing maintenance and he suffered some kind of suit breach not a full breach but theyre hung up on decon plus hes stuck in place with an armor malfunction just get me there hayes said doing our best yambukus docking bay was the largest structure associated with the station a domed vault rising above the stations sterile core it opened for the shuttles vertical landing and closed agonizingly slowly over the landing pad the isian atmosphere was evacuated and flushed with sterile air from the exchange stacks then the chamber was triplewashed with aerosol sterilants ultraviolet light and radiant heat not much less searing than the reentry burn had been during the interminable washdown hayes spoke with cai connor ops chief while hayes was absent and mac was incapacitated connor an organic chemist was almost as seasoned a hand as mac feya hayes didnt doubt she was handling the emergency at least as well as he would have but he heard the catch of anxiety in her voice contact with mac is sporadic we have remote tractibles with him but hes noncooperative the decon is going to be tricky at best and we dont want to force a joint and open another breach take a breath cai from the beginning please all i know is that mac was out on a maintenance excursion it was another seal failure this one on the south tractible bay you know how these ring faults have been driving mac crazy frankly he shouldnt have gone out the alpha excursion suit was hung up in maintenance so he took the beta unit even though it hasnt been through a refit since the last walkabout i guess it needed it he was at the bay door taking samples from the bad seal and laying down a caulk bead when a servo in his right leg overheated suit homeostasis went crazy then that system locked too big big cascade failure the servomotor fused a hole through the exterior armor and the inner seal may or may not have been breachedwe have contradictory telemetry on that but it for sure cooked macs leg above the knee hes in pain even with the suit feeding him analgesics and the analgesics are about to run out plus hes incoherent so we cant count on him cooperating with any rescue effort hayes winced god help mac riveted to the ground by a bad motor seared and in pain not knowingand this must be the worst of itwhether his bioperimeter was intact or whether he was already in effect a dead man cai how deep in maintenance is the alpha suit hang on she consulted someone away from the transducer i fasttracked it as soon as macs alarms sounded its been through preliminary diagnostics and looks okay but none of the deep testing has gone ahead pull it out and prep it that might not be wise prep it cai thank you and get the tunnel out here okay its happening she sounded relieved to have him back in charge despite her misgivings youre about twenty minutes away from confirmation i want the armor prepped as soon as im through the tunnel in the meantime do whatever you were doingkeep mac as calm as possible and have the tractibles handy with a chordal brace and relay his telemetry let me see if i can make sense of it yes she said promptly station rank was informal cai a kuiper freewoman of the purest sort would never call him sir the way terrestrial scientists inevitably did but he heard the deference in her voice and felt the burden of responsibility shift squarely onto his own shoulders the new handzoe fisher the bottle baby whose novel excursion suit was still deep in stowage unfortunatelycame forward from the passenger cabin she was solemn frowning is there anything i can do you can keep out of the way it was the first thing that came to mind she nodded once and left the cabin hang on mac hayes thought yambuku didnt need another tutelary death isis had claimed too many lives already isiss day averaged three hours longer than earths and its axial tilt was less acute the seasons milder the sun hovered above the copper mountains as hayes encased in an impossibly bulky mass of bio armor left yambuku the surrounding forest was already dense with shadow the long isian nightfall was about an hour away a vast swath of vegetation had been cleared around the ground station the soil burned and salted with longlasting herbicides yambuku its core and its four coaxial rings sat embedded in this blackened wasteland like a lost pearl the burn zone prevented native plants from overgrowing the stations pressedaggregate walls fouling the exits and weakening the seals but it reminded hayes of something else the empty space between a fortress and a bailey a field of fire it did nothing to deter airborne microorganismsprobable cause of the continuing seal failuresand already the weeds were beginning to make advances green creepers twining out of the forest canopy like tentative fingers hayes sweating inside his isolation suit felt the familiar sensation of being in the landscape but not of it every sensationthe crackle of scorched soil under his feet the whisper of windtossed leaveswas relayed by suit sensors his touch was blunted by the armors fat gloves sensitive and versatile though they were his field of vision was blinkered his sense of smell nonexistent this river valley was as lush and wild as a summer garden but he could never enter it except as proxy robot halfman it would of course kill him at the first opportunity he passed the curved wall of the station rising like a limestone cliff in the slanting sunlight and reached the area outside the tractible port where macabie feya was trapped in his malfunctioning armor the problem was instantly obvious macs right leg had burned out below the hip leaving a flaring blackened gap in the outer shield primary and secondary hydraulics were hopelessly damaged below the waist he was locked in place frozen in an awkward crouch the accident had happened almost eight hours ago the suit itself had tourniqueted the leg and would even if necessary provide cpr and cardiostimulants it was a good machine even with its torso systems terminally cooked but eight hours was a long time to be injured and alone and the suits modest reservoir of analgesics and narcotics was close to exhaustion hayes approached his injured friend cautiously the suits legs might be locked down but the powerful arms remained mobile if mac panicked he could inflict serious damage two landduty tractibles rolled out of the way as hayes came closer cams glancing between hayes and macabie their eyes of course were yambukus eyes elams eyes in fact elam mather was working the remotes and how calm it all seemed in the late afternoon quiet aviants chattering high in the trees a black noonbug ambling across the ashdark clearance like some tiny victorian banker hayes cleared his throat mac can you hear me his voice was relayed by radio to macs headset we hear the insects more clearly than we hear each other hayes thought two solitudes semaphores across a microbiotic ocean there was no answer beyond the low hum of the carrier mac must have slipped back into unconsciousness hayes was close enough now to examine the suit breach the suit was multilayered its hydraulics and motors normally operating in isolation from both their moist human cargo and the abrasive isian biosphere the overheat had peeled back the outer layer of flexarmor like foil exposing a tangle of burned insulation and leaking blue fluidsa robots wound the soft nugget of mac feya lay deeper inside hidden but horribly endangered hayes needed macs cooperationor else he needed mac safely unconscious he queried elam about the telemetry far as i can tell tam his vitals are as stable as we can expect you want me to tell the suit to lighten his narcs take his drip down just a notch please elam sure you dont want to splint him first im already on it he unhooked a body brace from the nearest tractible and began linking it to macs upperbody armor the tractibles could have done this themselves if they had been larger or more flexible but this was isis and some terrestrial kacho had written weight and size limitations into the robot inventory without thinking much about the practical consequences hayes worked from behind mac socketing the brace into chordal ports the brace exchanging protocols with the suits surviving electronics the link was almost complete when mac woke up his scream rang through hayes helmet a sound he did not immediately identify with his friend macabie feya it was an inhuman roar overwhelming the audio transducers elam shouted over it his vitals are spiking hes not stableyou have to override his armor now grimly hayes forced the last brace connector into its socket on macs thrashing armor he was still trying to latch the device when macs elbow butted into him hayes staggered backward hurt and breathless his armor was bulky but in its own way fragile designed to protect him from the biosphere not from physical attack his ribs hurt the breath was knocked out of him and he heard the suit alarm clamoring for his attention tam you have an outerlayer breach get back in the airlock stat mac hayes said the engineers wordless keening dropped to a lower note mac you can hear me cant you elam dont do this tam mac listen youre doing fine i know youre worried and i know youve been out here too long and i know youre in pain were about ready to haul you inside but you have to relax keep still a little longer there was a response this time something about being fucking trapped listen to me hayes said he took a cautious step forward keeping himself within macs visual range gloves forward and open theres a brace on you but its not socketed up i have to make the connection before we can take you inside elam still hammering him i cannot guarantee your suit integrity unless you get back here now he took another step closer i think you broke one of my ribs mac take it easy all right i know it hurts but were almost home buddy mac croaked something repetitive choking on the words you understand me mac there was a silence he took for assent hayes grasped the brace jack in one glove taking advantage of what he hoped was a moment of lucidity mac reared back as the connection was made then the brace electronics overrode his voluntary functions clamping his arms at his sides in full static lockdown the motion must have been painful mac howled at his sudden new helplessness an awful sound two small tractibles approached clasped the wings of the brace and tilted it neatly backward now mac was a wheeled vehicle already rolling toward the tractible bays outer decon chamber hayes kept pace ignoring elams voice in his ear staying where mac could see him keeping the injured man company until the bay doors rolled down on the deepening blue of the isian dusk hayes put his helmet against macs as the harsh station lights came up mac whispered the wordsas nearly as hayes could make outwere too late he kept his helmet against macs as the decon began caustic antiseptics misting from the ceiling in a pale green rain mac stared back at him through moist glass hayes gave him a thumbsup hoping the insincerity of it wasnt ridiculously obvious macs eyes were blank and bloodshot his pores leaked blood in ruby teardrops tissue deliquescence and bleedout had already begun macabie feya was dying and there was nothing hayes could do about it three on top of everything else there was the question of how to spin this unfortunate death the problem preoccupied kenyon degrandpre as he reported for his monthly medical evaluation he was eager to speak to the doctor not that he was ill but the senior medical managercorbus nefford a bostonborn physician with a long career in the trustswas also the closest thing to a friend degrandpre had found aboard the ios nefford unlike the coldworld barbarians who dominated the scientific crew understood the rules of civil discourse he was friendly but mindful of the subtleties of rank deferential but seldom distastefully toadying nefford possessed a chubby aristocratic face that must have served him well in the professional sweepstakes back home he looked like a family cousin even in his modest physicians smock degrandpre stepped into the small medical station and stripped unselfconsciously like his uniform his body was an expression of rank and class he was nearly hairless his excess body fat chelated away his musculature defined but not boastful he wore a works trust tattoo on his left shoulder his slender penis dangled over the faint scar of his orchidectomy another badge of rank he stepped quickly into the diagnostic nook nefford sat attentively at his monitor never so gauche as to speak before he was addressed machinery hummed behind degrandpres back a whisper of hummingbird wings he said of course youve heard about the death the physician nodded a suit breach i gather tragic for the yambuku staff i suppose theyll have to replace the armor not to mention the engineer macabie feya arrived thirty months ago healthy as a horse but they all are at least when they first set foot on the ios he caused the accident himself i hear he was in open air in poorly prepped protective gear in that sense yes he brought it on himself but fault has a way of rising up the ranks surely no one could blame you manager thank you for the unconvincing show of support of course we both know better its not an ideal world weve lost two assets that will be expensive to replace theres no way to finesse that however yambuku is far from crippled they can still make vehicular excursions most of their tractibles are in decent shape and they have at least one suit of bioarmor that can be brought up to specification fairly quickly basic research wont be interrupted and nefford said they have the new gear that fisher woman brought with her is that common knowledge for better or worse the ios is a village people talk too much and too often but degrandpre expected a certain amount of gossip from corbus nefford because he was a physician and a section manager neffords rice bowl was virtually ensured he could risk saying things others might keep to themselves what zoe fisher brought with her is an unproven technology foisted on us by a rogue branch of the trusts the fisher woman comes with a vade mecum from personnel and devices and shes putting herself directly in harms way that worries me one death is attrition two would look like incompetenceon someones part the doctor nodded absently whispering into his scroll the diagnostics finished step down please degrandpre dressed himself still thinking aloud personnel and devices act like they can shuffle our priorities at will i doubt the works commissioners will put up with this kind of arrogance much longer in the meantime id like zoe fisher to survive at least until im safely back in beijing its not my battle frankly had he overstepped this is privileged of course of course not galley gossip in other words you know you can trust me kenyon he used the given name not as an impertinence but with downcast eyes to ingratiate thank you corbus a gentle rebuke so am i healthy nefford turned with visible relief to his desktop your bone calcium is excellent your musculature is stable and your accumulated radiation exposure is well within tolerance but next time i want a blood sample next time you may have one once every calendar month degrandpre walked the circumference of the orbital station from docking bays to sun garden his left hand on the holster of his quirt he thought of the walkthrough as a way of staying in touch with the ios keeping the maintenance crew on their toes citing works staff for uniform violationsin general making his presence felt in the case of dresscode infringements he had long ago given up on the kuiper and martian scientists he considered himself lucky if they remembered to dress at all problems that seemed distant from his chambers loomed larger from the deckplates and he liked the exercise invariably he started his inspection at the dimly lit cargostorage spaces of ten module and finished back at nine the garden he liked to linger in the garden if he had been asked he might have said he enjoyed the filtered sunlight pumped from fixed collectors in the ioss hub or the moist air or the earthy smell of the aeroponic suspensions and all that was true but not all of the truth to kenyon degrandpre the garden was a kind of pocket paradise he had loved gardens even as a child for the first twelve years of his life he had lived with his father a senior manager at the cultivar collection in southern france the collections greenhouses ranged over thousands of acres of rolling pastureland foundations tilted to the southern sky a city of damp glass walls and hissing aerators paradise was his fathers name for it in biblical mythology paradise was a garden called eden the edenic world was cultivated perfect when humankind fell from grace the garden succumbed to anarchy on the ios the garden was even more central as delicate and vital as a transplanted heart it supplied most of the stations nutritional needs it recycled wastes it cleansed the air because the garden was both indispensable and fragile it was at least in degrandpres eyes the paradise of the old testament restored orderly calculated organic and precise the gardeners in their buff fatigues acknowledged his presence by staying out of his way he walked the garden tiers slowly pausing in a glade of tall tomato plants to savor the smell and the leafgreen light he had entered the works with much of his fathers idealism still intact humanity had endured a wild earth for too long the price had been uncontrolled population growth climatic devolution disease kuiper radicals accused earth of wallowing in stasis nonsense degrandpre thought how long would a kuiper habitat or a martian airfarm last if it failed to regulate its ice and oxygen mining how long could the ios for instance sustain itself in a state of anarchy but there was nothing special about the surface of earth the issues were the same only broader more diffuse consider isis itself a garden never cultivated beautiful as freshly arrived kuiper enthusiasts never failed to point out and fundamentally hostile to human life he passed through the vegetable gardens and climbed a flight of stairs to a terrace where delicately engineered fruit vines thrived near the light gardeners and slim white tractibles moved like angels among the lush foliage and he savored the patient sound of dripping water home degrandpre found himself thinking five years now since hed seen it and god knows what had gone on during his absence the disastrous north african aquifer initiative had nearly cost him his career he had called in every outstanding favor just to save his works card he had accepted the isis rotation to demonstrate his adaptability it was the only post of any responsibility he had been offered and he hadnt done badly here but too much time had passed too slowly and he felt the separation from earth more keenly than he had expected it was as if his body registered on the cellular level every inch of the vast distance the higgs launcher had transected he was after all so far from home that the sunlight falling on these vines would not reach beijing or boston or the south of france within his lifetime his only real connection with the planet of his birth was the particlepair linka thin reed indeed but one to which he was obliged to attend his weekly report was due he would have to let the trusts know that one of their engineers had died bad luck or bad management or kuiper adventurism gone wrong yes that was it by midday he had queued his report for transmission and was tending to other business a summit of section managers arrived bearing grievances unfair tractible allotment and resource utilization the usual departmental jealousies the turing factories on isiss small moon had fallen short of productivity goals though another two factory units had been genned the question was one of balance no one would get what he wanted but that was inevitable the ios was an economy of scarcity the good news was that no truly critical shortages were pressing turing productivity had increased even if it had not met expectations and the ioss lifesupport systems remained in good shape most of the bad news came from the surface projects manager who reported a rash of seal failures maintenance calls and diminished redundancy particularly from the continental and deepsea outposts the small arctic station reported only routine maintenance this was potentially troublesome since the downstations used a daunting variety of exotic materials imported from home bringing stores and spares back to capacity would take some cargo shuffling on the part of the trusts never an easy sell but all in all things could be worse he soothed the junior managers with promises dismissed them at last and went to his cabin alone he hated the social isolation of the ios but the answer to that problem as always was discipline that was the mistake the trusts had made more than a century ago tinkering with the genes of kuiper volunteers rather than teaching them the practical arts of selfdiscipline the wall of his cabin showed a relay view of isis blue on black velvet he was supremely tired of it he switched the display to a neutral white luminescence keyed to dim as he fell asleep his personal scroll chirped waking him early the waiting message was tagged amber important but not urgent degrandpre let it wait while he showered and dressed then he dispatched a small personal tractible to bring breakfast from the galley he took up the scroll reluctantly the message was return traffic from the works trust perfunctory regrets on the macabie feya death revised launch schedules revised cargo inventories projected six months forward and in the tail of the message a small but lethal sting an observer had been written into the next personnel rotation a personnel and devices observer a man named avrion theophilus terrifyingly the mans rank wasnt specified on earth a man without a title was either very poor or very powerful a peasant or a family man and peasants didnt come to isis four zoe came to the common room to witness the burning of macabie feyas body tam hayes had called the downstation staff to yambukus common room which was large enough for zoe to join the crowd without feeling unduly claustrophobic hayes had cleared one wall and converted the surface panel into a screen with a view of the western clearances where remote tractibles had assembled a bier of native wood for the body to he on the effect was like watching through a big picture window but in fact the common room was at the heart of the sterile core of yambuku insulated from isis by onionskin layers of hotzone laboratories and tractible bays mac feya contaminated beyond rescue hadnt made it farther into the station than the tractible bay his body was compromised with isian organisms beyond number it had become in effect a supremely dangerous piece of biological waste elam mather had used a medical remote to sedate and anesthetize mac as he died a grim but thankfully brief process she had then extracted key tissue samples and processed them into the glovebox array before she returned the body to the clearing zoe didnt look at the body too closely mac feyas bioarmor had been stripped for salvage and he had been draped with a white sheet in an attempt to lend some dignity to his corpse but the body was obviously deliquescing under the shroud digested by isian microorganisms and processed with eerie speed into a syrupy black liquid just like a ciba mouse zoe thought she sat rigidly in her chair and tried not to take this death as an omen a warning perhapsthe isian biosphere would not be trifled with but there was nothing malignant here no deliberate attack on human life the problem was not isis but humanity were fragile zoe thought we evolved in a younger and less competitive biological domain were infants here when the first probes reached isis there had been a keen effort to protect the planet from human contamination but there was not a terrestrial organism the isian biosphere couldnt contain and devour its immense array of enzymes and poisons quickly corrupting the fragile protein envelopes of earthbased life the death of macabie feya was simply isis acting as isis must the planet doesnt hate you theo had once said but its intimacies are fatal zoe looked away from the body to the forest canopy beyond the bier the trees were sinuous thinboled raising their limbs like great green hands this after all was her realm or soon would be she had trained most of her life for protracted isolation in the isian woodlands if a native species had been named she could name it she could even supply tentative binomials for new species within a broad range of genera but this was not a textbook a filestack or a walkthrough simulation the reality of it was suddenly overwhelming even from the cloistered safety of the common room real breezes shaking the foliage real shadows eclipsing the forest floor she had come within a few thin walls of isis at last at last and in the midst of death real death the depth of emotion in the room was daunting dieter franklin had lowered his head to disguise tears elam mather was openly weeping and she wasnt the only one two mysteries zoe thought isis and grief of the two she understood isis better how would she feel if someone close to her had died but there was no one close to her there never had been only theo as severe and aloof as some blackwinged bird her teacher and savior what if it were theos body out there would she weep zoe had wept often when she was young especially during her dimly remembered time at the tehran orphan creche from which theo had saved her without theo well without theo she would be lost free some traitorous part of her whispered the thought was disturbing tam hayes tall and somber in his yambuku fatigues read a brief but dignified eulogy then a young biochemist named ambrosic the last reformed mormon at yambuku now that mac was gone offered a formal prayer for the dead on some hidden cue the attending tractibles doused the bier with hydrocarbon compounds and ignited it with a jet of flame an external microphone relayed the sound with horrible fidelity the whoosh of ignition and the slow crackle of the burning wood the heat lofted macabie feyas ashes high into the isian sunlight wind carried away the smoke his phosphates would fertilize the soil zoe thought season by season atom by atom the bios would have the whole of him zoe had been sent to isis specifically for the deepimmersion project but until the day she would step out of the station she was a yambuku hand and had to find a niche for herself she was neither a microbiologist nor an engineer but there was plenty of ordinary scutwork to dofilter changes cargo inventory schedulingand she made herself available for all these duties and day by day as the shock of mac feyas death eased she felt herself becoming what if not a member of the yambuku family at least a welcome accessory today a week since the funeral zoe had invested eight hours on cargo inventory which meant lots of physical labor even with the freight tractibles helping she took a quiet dinner in the refectory and retired to her cabin more than anything she wanted a hot shower and an early bed but she had only just dialed the water temperature when elam mather knocked at the door elam was dressed in afterduty clothesloose buff shorts and blouseand her smile seemed genuinely friendly ive got tomorrows duty roster thought you might want a quick look or just to talk are you busy zoe invited her in zoes cabin was small a bedroll and a desk and one wall with a screen function once a month or so compressed edits of terrestrial entertainment were fed down the particlepair link from earth tonight most of the station hands were screening the new novosibersk brevities in the common room zoe had linked her screen to an outside camera and the only show she wanted to see was the sleepy crescent of isiss moon as it fled across the southern stars elam entered the room as she entered all rooms brusquely arms at her sides tall even by kuiper standards im not much for light entertainment she said guess youre not either zoe wasnt sure how to react elam didnt flaunt her rank but she was one of yambukus key people second only to tam hayes himself back home it all would have been clear junior managers had deferred to her and she had deferred to her seniorsand everyone deferred to family simple elam dropped the roster sheets on zoes desk its a desert around here when the entertainment package comes in they say this one has good dancing uhhuh sounds like youre about as enthusiastic as i am im just an old kuiper fossil i guess where i come from dancing is something you do not something you watch zoe couldnt think of an answer she didnt dance elam glanced at the active wall screen zoe had maxed the resolution creating the illusion that her cabin had lost one wall and was open to the isian night yambukus perimeter lights picked out the nearest trees starkly bright against the velvetdark forest no offense zoe but youre like a ghost sometimes youre here but all your attention is out there its what im trained for elam frowned and looked away zoe added did i say something wrong excuse me ohno zoe nothing wrong like i say im just an old kuiper fossil you read my personnel file zoe guessed some of it part of the job i know how it must sound sole survivor of a clonal pod designed for isis duty lost in an orphan crib for three years mild aversion to human contact freakish and i guess very terrestrial but im really she began to say no different from anyone else but that was a lie wasnt it even on earth she had stood a little apart and it was part of her qualification for the job trying hard to fit in here i know elam said and i appreciate it i want to apologize if weve been slow about breaking the ice mostly its what happened to mac nothing to do with your history zoe noted the qualifier mostly but that was fair the majority of the scientists at yambuku were kuiperborn the oldtime commonwealth settlement ministry had populated the first kuiper body settlements with citizens genengineered for long isolation and the claustrophobically tight conditions in the water mines unfortunately it had been a faulty sequenceswap the undetected bug in their altered genome had been unexpected latelife neurological decay a congenital nervesheath plaque difficult to cure or contain of that generation of kuiper settlers those who survived the rigors of first settlement had died screaming in inadequate clinical facilities far from earth only a hasty program of sequencepatching had saved their children from the same fate most of them kuiper veterans would tell you they feared heavyhanded terrestrial genetinkering aimed at population control not the process itself but family history made it a ticklish issue zoe was a clonal birth whose life had been designed and tailored for trust duty her kuiperborn colleagues must find that distasteful what im saying zoe is that none of that matters much because youre one of us now you have to be were sitting at the bottom of a hostile biological ocean and yambuku is a bathysphere one leak and its over for all of us in that kind of environment we cant afford anything less than mutual trust zoe nodded i understand im doing my best elam but im not good with people elam touched her arm and zoe forced herself not to flinch the older womans hand was warm dry rough what im trying to say is if you need a friend im here thank you and im sorry if this sounds rude i look forward to working with you but i dont want a friend elam smiled thats okay i didnt say want the days passed each day a step closer to her liberation from the confinement of yambuku outside a week of rain gave way to vivid sunshine the stations device shop processed zoes excursion suit duplicating its files and testing its capacities greenlighting its function inventory item by item zoe spent the lag time patiently learning the first names of yambukus sixteen current residents of these she was most comfortable with elam mather and tam hayes the deviceshop engineers tia and kwame and paul and the planetologist dieter franklin were close to a goahead on your excursion technology tam hayes told her the technicians are impressed we were told to expect something novel this is more than novel zoe pushed a cargo cart down the long windowless enclosure of the south quarter the carts wheels rattled against the brushedsteel floor she tried to imagine how this place must have looked when the tractibles and turing constructors were assembling it a metal catacomb attended by mechanical spiders steel and metacarbon panels lofting down from orbit on guided parachutes today was mainly sunny and warm according to hayes not that she could tell from the timeless monotony of this walkway days like this hayes said we often send the dragonfly remensors out zoe looked up from her work hayes said interested yes very much your file says you can handle this kind of remote is that correct zoe adjusted the headset to fit her skull yes and you know the terrain from simulations okay well call this a training jaunt just keep me in sight at all times and do as i say yambuku operated its telepresence devices from a console room no larger than zoes cabin she was aware of tam hayes in the chair next to hers in yambukus ultraclean environment odors became more intense she could smell hima clean smell soap and laundered cotton and his own unique scent like spring hay and alas herself nervous eager she activated the headset and the room fell away from her awarenessthough not the scent hayes activated the remote and two dragonfly remensors rose from a bay at the periphery of the shuttle dock into the still noon air the remensors fragile wings glistened with photoelectric chiton cells microscopic prisms their elongated bodies curled downward for stability as the devices hovered in place zoe wrapped in the headset and hands on the controls saw what her rernensor saw yambuku from a height and the wooded rift valley infinitely deep and wide beyond it an unbroken canopy of green dappled with gentle cloud shadows her heart hammered another wall had fallen between herself and isis there were many walls but every day fewer and soon enough none soon enough only the insensible membrane of her excursion suit the two realms her terrestrial ecology of blood and tissue and the deep isian biosphere would come as close to physical contact as technology permitted she longed to touch her new world to feel its breezes on her body the feeling was startling in its intensity tam hayes spoke he was sitting beside her at the console but his voice seemed to ring out of the bright blue sky well take it slowly at first follow as close as you can if you lose sight of my remensor use the display target to find me and dont be afraid to ask questions ready zoe stupidly she nodded but with his headset on he could see only her dragonfly remensor a device identical to his own ready she said belatedly her hand trembled on the guide stick her remensor quivered responsively in the sunlight up to three thousand meters first give you the long view as quickly as that hayes remensor spiraled into a vertical ascent zoe promptly guided her own dragonfly upward not following him slavishly but keeping pace demonstrating her ability in the upper left corner of her headset an altitude readout flickered ruby iridescence at three thousand meters they paused the winds here were stronger and the dragonfly remensors bobbed like hovering gulls altitude is the best defense hayes said given the cost of these remotes we prefer to keep them away from insectivores the greatest danger is from aviants any large bird within a kilometer will toggle a headsup alert at least here in the open down in the canopy things are trickier keep your distance from trees if at all possible and stay at least five or six meters off the ground basically stay sharp and watch the telltales she knew all this where are we going to the digger colony where else just like that just like that zoe decided she liked this man tam hayes the dragonfly remensors relayed only audiovisual information as they moved westward there was no physical sensation of flight zoe remained aware of the pressure of the chair against her buttocks her solid presence in the remotesensor chamber but the images she saw were deep rich and stereoscopic and she could hear clearly what the remensors heard at this altitude only a gentle rash of air lower perhaps the trickle of water the cries of animals together they flew across the glinting ribbon of the copper river named by hayes predecessor for his kuiper clan large aviants and small predators had gathered to drink along the sandy shore where slower waters pooled she saw a herd of epidonts sunning themselves in the shallows beyond the river the forest canopy closed tight once more seed trees and spore trees undulating like so much green linen toward the foothills of the copper mountain range its all so familiar zoe whispered maybe it seems so hayes voice came from the empty sky beside her from this height it might almost be equatorial earth easy to forget that isis has a wildly different evolutionary history work weve done in the last six months suggests that life here remained unicellular far longer than it did on earth in terrestrial organisms the cell is a protein factory inside a protein fortress isian cells are all that but better defended more efficient far more complex they synthesize a staggering array of organic chemicals and exist in far harsher environments on the macroscopic levelin multicelled organismsthe functional difference is minor the complexity is what matters a carnivore is a carnivore and it relates to herbivores in the obvious way get down to the cellular level the fundamental bios of the planet and isis looks a lot more alien and more dangerous zoe said i meant the terrain ive flown this way in a thousand suns sims are sims surveybased sims even so its different isnt it when the landscape is alive under you alive zoe thought yes that was the difference even the best sims were only a sort of map this was the territory itself moving changing a passage in an ancient dialogue between life and time hayes escorted her lower she saw his dragonfly remensor flash ahead of her jewelbright in the noon sun the foothills lay ahead wooded ridges etched with creeks as the land rose the forest changed from waterloving vine and cup plants and barrel trees to the smaller succulents that thrived in the stony upland soil a dispersed ground cover opened fat emerald petals like the blades of aloe vera zoe recited the latin cognomens to herself savoring the sound of them but wishing the isian forest could have taken its common names from an isian language if there had ever been an isian language the closest equivalent was the cluckandmutter vocalizations of the diggers and whether these constituted language in any meaningful sense was one of the questions zoe hoped to answer the digger colony itself from the air was exactly like its sims a cluster of mud and daub mounds in a trampled clearance charred remnants of cook fires pocked the soil hayes circled the colony once then descended in a slow spiral watching the sky for predators attracted by the diggers refuse heaps but the sky was clear impulsively zoe dropped ahead of him hayes didnt rebuke her and she was careful to stay within his security perimeter she wanted to see the diggers only still images had been transmitted down the particlepair link to earth she had seen multiple photographs and more than that images from a remote autopsy performed on a digger that had been killed by a predator the carcass salvaged by tractible and dissected by surgical remensors bits of it were still preserved in yambukus glovebox arrayfrozen blue and red tissue samples zoe had heard recordings of the diggers vocalizations and had analyzed them for evidence of internal grammar the results were ambiguous at best she knew the diggers as well as an outside observer could know them but she had never seen them in vivo hayes seemed to understand her excitement her impatience his dragonfly remensor hovered protectively nearby just not too close zoe and dont ignore your telltales the diggers were the most widely distributed vertebrate species on isis they were found on both major continents and several of the island chains their settlements were often complex enough to be detectable from orbit they were moundbuilders and limestoneexcavators their technology was crude flint blades fire and spears their languageif it was a languagewas equally rudimentary they appeared to communicate by vocalizing but not often and almost never sociallythat is they signaled but they didnt converse any deeper study of the diggers had been hampered by isiss toxic biosphere by the impossibility of interacting with the diggers except through the intermediary of remensors or tractibles and by the difficulty of knowing what went on inside their deeply tunneled mounds where they spent a good portion of every day zoe descended past the treetops into a cacophony of birdsong flowers like immense blue orchids dangled from the high limbs of the trees not blossoms but a competing species a saprophytic parasite stamenate organs projecting from the blooms like pink fingers dusted with copperred pollen she moved lower still under the tree canopy and into a shadedappled space where fernlike plants unfurled from the damp crevices between exposed tree roots not too low hayes reminded her because a triraptor or a sun lizard might uncoil from some stump or hole and crush her remensor between its teeth she hovered in the generous shadowed space between two huge puzzle trees wings whirring softly and turned her attention to the digger colony the colony was old wellestablished it harbored nearly one hundred and fifty diggers by the last rough count the population was supported by stands of fruitbearing trees to the west plentiful game and a clear brookmore nearly a river in the rainy seasonrunning out of the high coppers to the west was a meadow of sunny scrub weed where the diggers concentrated their excretions and buried their dead the digger colony itself was a cluster of rock and redclay mounds each mound at least fifty meters wide overgrown with scrub and fungal mycelia the diggerholes were narrow and dark reinforced with a concretelike substance the diggers made from an amalgam of clay or chalk and their own liquid wastes two diggers were present in the clearing around the mounds hunched over their work like bleached white pill bugs one tended the communal fire feeding windfall and dried leaves into the flames the other scraped a point onto a length of wood a spear turning it at intervals over the fire their motion was laconic zoe wondered if they were bored flints and knapping rocks uttered the hardpack soil theyre not hayes said beautiful animals she had forgotten that he was beside her she started at the sound of his voice too close too intimate her dragonfly remensor wobbled in the shade one of the diggers looked up briefly black eyes swiveling it was at least fifteen meters away they are though zoe whispered but why whisper beautiful i mean not in some abstract way beautifully functional beautifully adapted for what they do thats one way of looking at it she shrugged another wasted gesture the diggers were beautiful and zoe didnt particularly care whether hayes could see that or not a harsher stronger evolution had shaped them one of the diggers stood erect in the sunlight and she appreciated the versatility isis had built into it a sort of living swiss army knife upright the digger was a meter and a half tall its domed gray head projected from a sheath of flesh like a turtles head its eyes black and immensely sensitive rolled in rotary sockets its upper arms the digging arms with their spadeshaped dactyls hung laxly from high shoulder joints one of its smaller manipulative arms grasped the new spear multijointed thumbs wrapped around the wood its cartilaginous bellyplates expanded and contracted as it moved giving it the look of something too flexible for its size like a giant millipede the diggers beakshaped muzzle opened it emitted a series of muted clicks which its companion ignored talking to itself thats old man hayes informed her pardon me the digger with the spear we call him old man you named the diggers a few of the most recognizable old man because of the whiskers long white curbfeelers everybody at yambukus been here by remensor most of us more than once and old man pays us a return visit from time to time he comes to the station why hadnt this been in the reports degrandpres information triage she supposed zoological data sacrificed to production statistics every few days long about dusk he skulks around the perimeter of the station checks us out stares at the tractibles if we have any running then theyre curious about us well this one is maybe or maybe were just an obstacle on the way to his favorite fishing hole you dont want to jump to conclusions based on one individuals behavior zoe flew her dragonfly remensor in a ragged circle trying to attract the diggers attention again old man swiveled his eyes toward her instantly the sense of being seen was almost frightening in her chair in the remensor cabin zoe shivered speaking of dusk hayes said the nocturnal insectivores start hunting as soon as the shadows get long we should head for home soon but thats where i am zoe thought i am home five they called hayes the monk of yambukupartly because he had been on isis longer than almost anyone else partly because his work kept him continuously busy he was diligent about management chores but essentially thought of them as a distraction what he relished were the rare momentssuch as this onewhen he found himself back in the lab with no pressing concern beyond the microanatomy of isian cells what life had achieved on isis it had achieved with dna like terrestrial life isian organisms used these longchain molecules to store and alter hereditary information but dna was an encodable molecule a blank book and in these similar books earth and isis had recorded very different histories there was no evidence of broad mass extinctions on isis early in its history the isian stellar system had been as violent as the environment around any young star cometary impacts had given isis its water and organic molecules but some later event or perhaps the simple presence of an enormous gas giant twice the size of jupiter in the outer system had swept away a great deal of aboriginal rock and ice at least as far out as the isis systems icy ring its own kuiper belt life had emerged on a world far more placid than the primitive earth life on isis was a longer deeper river its narrative was slow and complexly exfoliated punctuated not by ice ages or cometary impacts but by waves of predation and parasitism the isian ecology was an evolving armed detente its weapons were formidable its defenses ingenious which made the planet among other things a vast new pharmacopeia much of the cost of maintaining yambuku was paid for by terrestrial pharmaceutical collectives under the works trust and that was a problem too everything that came out of yambuku had to be justified to trust accountants there was no room here for pure science as the kuiperborn employees were made distinctly aware hayes supposed the trusts specifically liked him because he hadnt rotated back home and immediately published a score of articles in the independent academic journals giving awayas the trusts saw itwhat they had paid for he finished the work he was doing microdissecting a bacterial entity that had been growing on the exterior seals stored his results and tidied up the glove box for the afternoon shift he looked up as elam entered the lab by now he had learned to recognize her footsteps yambuku had a staff of sixteen most of them on yearly rotation though some chiefly himself and elam mather had lived at yambuku for most of five years now kuiper folk endured such close quarters far more easily than terrans or martians which meant that most of the yambuku hands were kuiper bornalthough they came to isis strictly as employees of the trusts fresh download from the ios elam said scroll in hand do you want to look at it now or later he sighed and gave up his glovebox station to tonya cooper a resident microbiologist who had been standing at a bench and tapping her foot impatiently we can do this over lunch i hope dont see why not elam brought her scroll to the lunchroom but set it aside while they ate food at yambuku consisted of uninspiring nutrient chunks of various kinds assembled from the subgrade output of the ioss gardens compressed protein elam called it or less kindly compost we need to find a more inert substance for the seals he said is that possible he shrugged ask the engineers as it is were spending more time on maintenance than on basic research and running unnecessary risks risking lives he thought yambuku seemed eerily quiet without macs roaring voice elam picked up the agenda and spread it out on the tabletop hayes scooted his chair closer item one elam said zoes excursion suit is ready for the walkaround test according to tia and kwame zoe of course cant wait to take it out what we want is a closely observed walk around the clearances accompanied by a partner in conventional armor and with heavy tractible support and what zoe wants is to roam around the forest until she feels like coming back you guessed he smiled i can talk her out of the long hike and ill partner her for the excursion uhhuh elam gave him a speculative look what does that meanuhhuh how much do you know about our zoe the basics shes clonal stock from the old genome collection raised by devices and personnel she is a device the way they see it put it together tam think of it from the trusts point of view they dont give a shit about the linguistic nuances of the diggers or the taxonomies of isian flora shes here for some other reason he didnt share her fascination with terrestrial politics devices and personnel doing another little dance with the works trust more than that i suspect the two factions have always been rivals but devices and personnel has been in eclipse since the turn of the century i suspect they see isis as their chance to steal a march on the works bureaucracy if zoes excursion technology performs as promised its practically a revolutionwe can expand the human presence on isis way beyond what it is now elam we cant even keep our external seals clean and thats the point zoes device isnt just a new technology its a dozen new technologieshighefficiency osmotic filters stressresistant thinfilm polymers more biologically inert than anything we have its a coup detat high praise no i mean literally the works trust has been foundering on isis for two decades and the problems only get worse if devices and personnel can step in and make isis a paying proposition in one swift stroke they might garner enough council support to oust the wt hardliners all this left hayes feeling impatient and uncomfortable earth politics elam what does it mean to us if it works it means we get a whole new crop of kachos with new priorities best case in the long run it might mean permanent settlements it might mean isis gets rapidly stripmined for its biological and genetic resources it would almost certainly mean a lot less kuiper involvement would it well why are we here partly because the works people can exploit our scientific savvy without being beholden to devices and personnel partly because were accustomed to living and working in small groups in enclosed environments if devices and personnel is prepared to open up isis to anyone with one of their environmental interfacesand if they can do that without a humiliating liaison with the kuiper republics then they blow the works trust out of the water and us besides not to mention the future of genuine science on this planet they wont disseminate knowledge theyll patent everything they learn and bypass us on the way to the stars you suppose zoe is aware of all this zoe is a catspaw she thinks its all an exozoology project but devices and personnel owns her read her file againthe fine print she was decanted and raised in a highclass d and p creche until the age of twelve then suddenly she was dumped into a tehran orphan ranch along with four clonal siblings a lot of people get shunted offline like that bureaucracy yeah but check the date august of thirtytwothe works trust has half the high staff of d and p arrested for sedition a power struggle september of thirtytwo zoe and sibs are dumped in tehran january of thirtyfiveanother staff shakeup this time in the works trust itself a bunch of devices and personnel kachos are reinstated hauled back from the rehab farms and declared heroes march of thirtyfive d and p collects zoe from the orphan farm just zoe her sibs didnt survive iranian orphan farms arent exactly the lunar hilton all zoe knows is that she was rescued they bought her loyalty cheap cheap for them it must have been traumatic for her cant you tell he nodded shes not exactly wellsocialized shes a victim and a tool raised on promises and theory and thymostats and bullshit some advice dont get attached im not attached hayes thought to anything shes a long way from home elam not as far as you might think she has a keeper a devices and personnel kacho named avrion theophilus he was her trainer her teacher and her surrogate father after tehran and according to this agenda hes coming to isis night fell reflected on a dozen screens throughout yambuku hayes had a session with dieter franklin the tall planetologist drank too much coffee and took his pet theories something about the microtubule structure of isian microcells out for a walk it was interesting but not interesting enough to keep hayes up past midnight the station was quieter after dark curious hayes thought how we all pace ourselves to these circadian rhythms even though the isian dayclock ran a couple of hours slow he walked the corridors of the core once around a caretakers gesture then went to bed zoe was excited over her first walkabout she was restrained during the suitup but hayes knew by the color in her cheeks and the flash in her eyes that she had imagined this moment for years the memory of mac feya rose up to dim his own excitement zoes excursion suit was impossibly flimsy elam was right this wasnt an improved bioarmor it was a whole catalog of new technologies carefully hoarded he supposed by the gnomes of devices and personnel and yes if it worked it would transform the human presence on isis zoe was ready and waiting by the time he had sealed himself into his infinitely more cumbersome bioarmor she appeared ember and free by comparison with nothing riding her body but a semitransparent membrane a pelvic sheath to recycle wastes a breathing apparatus that hugged her mouth and a pair of substantial boots elam mather supervising from well within the sterile core reviewed their telemetry and cleared them to leave the station they had already advanced through three layers of semihot exteriorring cladding now the final door a tall steel atmosphere lock slid open on naked daylight not sunlight a solid overcast hid the sun and made the nearby forest shadowy and forbidding zoe stepped past hayes in his massive armor and stood in the clearing looking ridiculously vulnerable she looked in fact almost naked her excursion suit gave her features a ruddy glow but concealed nothing her arms and shoulders moved without restraint her upper body was supple small taut muscles moving under blemishless skin her breasts were compact and firm hayes feared for her but zoe was fearless she moved awkwardly at first the leg and pelvic gear hampering her stride but with a coltish obvious joy slowly zoe he warned her this is a telemetry exercise not a picnic she came to a stop hands out chin uplifted tam do you feel it feel what she was practically giddy the rain the rain had begun imperceptiblyat least to hayesa gentle mist rolling out of the west raindrops spattered the dry clearance and rattled the leaves of the forest droplets began to bead on zoes second skin dewdrops jewellike toxic hayes had never been to earth the biotic barrier was simply too steep it would have meant countless inoculations and immunesystem tweaks not to mention a grueling wholebody decon when he moved back into kuiper space but he was a human being and a billion years of planetary evolution had been written into his body he understood zoes pleasure warm rain on human skin what was it like not like a shower in the scrub room he thoughtjudging by zoes helpless grin she turned and moved precipitously toward the wooded perimeter arms loose at her sides vine trees looped baygreen leaves above her head in the wet shade she was almost invisible hayes watched in consternation as she leaned down and plucked a vivid orange puffball from the mossy duff of the forest floor the fungus dusted the air with spores the danger was glaringly selfevident a single one of those spores could kill her in a matter of hours a cloud of them wreathed zoes head and she laughed through the respirator with childish delight he walked to her as fast as his armor would permit zoe enough of that youll overload the decon chamber its alive she marveled all of it i can feel it its as alive as we are id kind of like to keep it that way zoe she grinned and silver rain pooled at her feet h e coaxed her in at last after a halfhours stroll around the station perimeter back inside zoe had finished showering by the time hayes finally struggled out of his armor he joined her in the quarantine chamber decontamination was agonizingly thorough and there was no sign that the excursion gear had worked less than perfectly but yambuku protocols called for a day in isolation while nanobacters monitored both of them for infection two bunks a wall monitor and a foodandwater dispenser that was quarantine zoe stretched out on one of the cots reduced by these blank walls to something less glorious than she had been in the open air hayes filed a brief written report for the ioss archives then ordered up a coffee zoe occupied herself by leafing through the sixmonth itinerary the document elam had already shown him hayes found himself trying to imagine zoe as elam had described her as a d p bottle baby lost for two years in some barbaric orphan factory sole survivor of her brood group nothing quite so dramatic had happened to him but he understood well enough the emotional consequences of exile and loneliness hayes had been born into the red thorn clan hardcore kuiper belt republicans one and all red thorn bred a lot of kuiper scientists but he was the only one on the isis projectone of the very few red thorns on any kind of trustsponsored effort a lot of red thorns had died in the succession and the clans opinion of the trusts was roughly equivalent to a quails opinion of the snake that devours its eggs when hayes signed his isis contract he had been disowned by both clan and family he was tired by then of red thorn extremism and would not have minded the excommunication save that it included his motherherself an ice walker married to his father after a kuiper potlatch in ice walkers were equally hostile to the trusts but were reputed to value family above all else when his mother turned her back on him at the docks she had been trembling with shame he remembered the coralblue jumper she had worn possibly the soberest of all her brightcolored dresses he had understood then that he might never see her again that this humiliating operetta might be their last living contact after that putting his signature to a family loyalty oath had seemed an act as degrading as wading through excrement but it was the only road to isis how much worse though for zoe raised as a machine and brutalized when d p fell out of favor she had taken a loyalty oath too hayes thought but hers had been written in blood she turned the last page of the itinerary he saw her mouth congeal into a frown bad news she looked up what ohno not at all good news theos coming to visit avrion theophilus her teacher hayes thought her father her keeper six to a previously earthbound oceanologist such as freeman li the isian seafloor was a combination of the familiar and the bizarre in unpredictable proportions he would have recognized perhaps on any similar planet the pillowstone lava flows and the active volcanic ventsblack smokers feeding the deep water with bursts of heat and blooms of exotic minerals the powerful light of his benthic remensor picked out rainbow growths of bacterial mat on the surrounding seafloor thermophyllic unicells in a thousand variations almost as ancient as isis herself and this too was familiar he had seen such things in the deep pacific years ago away from these landmarks the isian ocean floor was powerfully strange highly calciferous plants rose in towers and obelisks and structures that resembled mosques swimming or moving among them were forms both vertebrate and invertebrate some of them large but most very small shining silvery or pastelpale under the unaccustomed light interesting as these creatures might be it was the simple monocells li had come to collect something in these most ancient forms of isian life might provide a clue to the big questions how life had evolved on isis and why in all its eonslong exfoliation that life had not produced anything that could reliably be called sentience behind this lurked the larger question the question li had chewed over so often with the yambuku planetologist dieter franklin the question so central and so perplexing that it began to seem unanswerable are we alone life was hardly a novelty in the universe isis was testament to that and so were the even dozen biologically active worlds that had been detected by planetary interferometer life was if not inevitable at least relatively common in the galaxy but there had not been for all of mankinds attentive listening any intelligible signal any evidence of nonhuman space travel any hint of a starspanning civilization we expand into a void li thought we call out but no one answers we are unique he stowed his cargo of bacterial scrapings in the remensors hold and turned back to the surface he had other work to do he was the oceanic stations chief manager and this excursion by telepresence had been a guilty pleasure there were reports to be filed complaints to be heard all the dreary business of a works trust enterprise to be hacked away like an infestation of barnacles until it inevitably grew back the remensor rose like a steel bubble toward the surface he watched the seafloor drop away but felt no sensation of motion only his own stiff spine pressing the back of the chair in the telepresence room running the remensor was so absorbing that he tended to forget to shift position he always left these expeditions with his chronic lumbar pains acting up he reached the point at which daylight became perceptible the waters around him turning indigo then sunsetblue then turbulent green the floating oceanic station was in sight a distant chain of pods and anchors like a string of pearls dangling from the hand of the sea when the alarm began to sound li handed over the remensor controls to his assistant kay feinn and scanned the situation report flashing on the remensor rooms main screen before he attended to his own rapidly flashing scroll general shutdown barriers up contamination detected in pod six the lowermost of the oceanic stations laboratory units had gone hot it took him another ten minutes trolling for information before the engineering crew determined that yes the pod had apparently gone hot and no the two men trapped inside it at the time of the alarm werent responding to repeated calls telemetry from the affected pod had also failed the structure was closed and blank the electronic failures were particularly perplexing faced with locked doors and no input the engineering people werent sure what the next step ought to be li knew what it ought to be he ordered the stations shuttle pupped for emergency evacuation in case of further problems he told his comms crew to alert the ios and ask for its advice he was trying to put through a personal call to kenyon degrandpre when kay still wearing the telepresence gear said i think you should look at this not a good time obviously im down at pod six kay said look he canceled the call and climbed back into the telepresence chair pod six had been disastrously compromisedthat much was obvious from the alarm sequencebut li couldnt see any physical damage from the perspective of the submersible remensor multiple beams of light thatched the ridges of pod sixs external sensor array revealing nothing huge translucent invertebratesfreemans staff called them church bellsdrifted toward the remensor in great numbers attracted by the light but they were a harmless nuisance mindlessly trawling the warm equatorial water for organelles a flock of church bells could hardly have shut down an entire laboratory kay what am i supposed to see the two men trapped in the compromised pod were kyle singh a kuiper microbiologist and roe devereaux a terrestrial marine biologist even if they had survived the initial biohazard whatever it was they might not survive the electrical failure even in isiss warm equatorial seas pod six was deep enough to shed heat quickly and the air recyclers would already have been overloaded revved by the alarm protocols into toxicemergency mode but almost certainly freeman thought the men inside were dead by now pod six was home to the deepsea alkaloid inventory lots of hot organisms were down there and if something had gotten out of the glove boxes and into their air supply devereaux and singh would have toxed out almost immediately below six there was only the anchor line and the blind deeps of the isian sea the water here glowed an inky turquoise circulating in a thermopause between the habitat of the pressureloving church bells and the busy phytochemistry of the shallows planktonlike monocells and snowflake colonies of bacteria sifted down from the surface waters a blizzard feeding the biologically rich benthic zones the pod seemed intact if dark devereaux had been complaining of algal films clouding the pod windows and external arrays but none of that was visible to freeman circle right kay said emotionlessly i thought i saw some outgassing at a window seal maybe we should get an engineer in here he played the remensors narrow beams across a portholelike circle of augmented glass there motion in the lamplight a string of rising pearls bubbles air lis stomach contracted with a more personal fear this wasnt an overpressure vent or a ballast exchange kay was right this was a leak he handed back the remensor gear called the ops room and told the crisis manager to have his men stand by the decouplers and keep the ballast detail alert in case we destabilize a fully breached pod six would have to be cut loose or it would drag down the rest of the pods with it it was a worstcase scenario drop the breached pod hope the tube seals held and try to keep the whole chain from going pendulum then he took back the telepresence chair and moved the remensor away from the crippled pod catching a second trail of air in the columns of his lights more leaks god he thought the lab was a fucking sieve and found himself watching with numb panic as the pod began to collapse on itselfquickly and utterly silently bimetallic seams geysered froth then twisted inward hemispheres of steel torn into ragged blades there was no soundhis remensor wasnt equipped for itbut the shock must have been tremendous the remensor bounced hard before it steadied images ghosting and fragmenting in freemans vision a tremor traveled up the pod chain and rattled the floor under him he ordered an emergency disconnect and watched it happen explosive bolts severed the pod from the rest of the station fragments of debrispolyester cushions glovebox lattices aggregates of clothing that might or might not have contained bodiesseparated from tangled metal and churned toward the surface the bulk of the pod simply sank caught in its own anchor chains as if a vast hand had reached up to claim it church bells faintly iridescent darted through the roiling water and fled into the deeps kenyon degrandpre hailed a transit tractible to the orbital stations ops room as soon as news of the disaster reached him he was afraid of what he might learn but he mustnt let that cloud his judgment deal with events now leave consequences for later he found the operations center crowded with junior managers competing for console space he sent away everyone of less than command status except for the engineers and told the communications crew to stay at their posts pending further orders better to have them begging for bathroom breaks than getting underfoot he kept four subordinates with him and ordered the main screen cleared of everything but traffic from the damaged oceanic outpost where everyone must be very busy only the standard telemetry channels were active even there the damage was obvious the deepest section of the undersea pod chain had imploded only minutes after a biohazard alarm shut it down obviously the two events were related but how with the pod itself lost answers might be hard to come by not that anyone was looking very hard for answers the outpost was working frantically to restore its own stability now that it had jettisoned the damaged lab degrandpre wondered whether the jettison had been truly necessary or whether freeman li might be covering something up but his engineers assured him it was an act of selfpreservation still but the most immediate question was whether the biohazard had been successfully containedor whether it might spread degrandpre ordered coffee for all hands in the ops room then waited with unconcealed impatience for lia terrestrial at leastto find time for a direct uplink waiting he felt impotent this would enrage his superiors on earth no matter what happened next he would have to redflag a report to the families and accept whatever responsibility he couldnt dodge and in the meantime in the meantime he could only pray that the event would be contained a junior brought him coffee the coffee was synthetic and tasted like ashes steeped in well water but he had drained two cups by the time li appeared on the screen at last his trust uniform disheveled and perspirationstained lis skin was as classically dark as degrandpres was classically pale both men would have been considered moderately handsome on earth though not in the kuiper settlements where a sort of muwallad brown was the fashionable skin color li said without preamble i want a full evacuation of the oceanic station degrandpre blinked you know you dont have the authority manager im sorry but time is important whatever it was that took out pod six it affected the men first the electrical systems second and then the structural integrity of the pod itselfall in less than an hour i dont want to lose any more staff according to our telemetry the problem was contained if you have any evidence to the contrary please share it with me with all due respect i dont have evidence of anything all i know for certain is that one of my laboratories is at the bottom of the ocean and two of my men are dead at the time of the accident they had bacterial plaques in their glove box i dont know if that contributed to the problem or not but we have similar organisms in just about every glove box in the station if it constitutes a threat you cant know that no i cant which is precisely why youre suggesting we abandon an extremely valuable resource because of one accident and your own surmise we can always reoccupy the station at an enormous expense in resources and work hours manager do you really want to assume that risk the bastard was trying to protect himself in case of more trouble degrandpre imagined li testifying at a trust inquiry although i requested an evacuation in unequivocal terms just give me any hard information you happen to have dr li and well proceed from there li bit his lip but knew better than to argue if youve been monitoring our telemetry you know as much as i do the pod went bad this morning no communication from the crew only siren i ordered the bulkheads sealed the pods electrical and lifesupport systems shut down shortly thereafter for reasons unknown an hour after that the pod lost hull integrity and collapsed under pressure thats all we know have you recovered any of the wreckage we dont have enough tractibles or excursion gear to recover solid wreckage all right make the shuttle bay ready for evacuation but wait for my order in the meantime try to gather at least some portion of any evidence that happens to be floating on the surface dont bring anything substantial past quarantine but archive samples for the glove boxes for the record i strongly recommend evacuating the station now and conducting any investigation by remote noted thank you for your opinion please do as i say he gave the com control to a subordinate when the initial report had been filed and the cleanup delegatedand in the absence of further alarmsdegrandpre put his assistant in charge and issued orders to alert him if the situation deteriorated by the clock he hadnt eaten for nearly ten hoursnor in deference had anyone else in the ops room he ordered a shift change and meals by tractible for anyone staying on duty then he walked to the command commissary where he found corbus nefford dining calmly on braised peppers and basmati rice the gardens grew a limited range of spices and the ios biosynthesized others but neffords dish smelled strikingly of fresh garlic and basil the physician regarded him with undisguised pleasure join me manager weary degrandpre found a chair opposite nefford i assume youve heard about the incident at the oceanic station a little because i would prefer not to talk about it the crisis is over yes was that wishful thinking the crisis is over two lives lost youre as wellinformed as i am apparently now talk about something else corbus or be quiet and let me eat the service tractible waited for his order he was hungry but he asked for something lighta salad with protein strips the chastened physician was briefly silent before a new subject came to mind there are fresh turing gens from earth i hear youre a font of good news i didnt know you took an interest in engineering only as it affects my future manager possibly even yours new turing gens i dont remember agreeing to a gen switch or are these next years algorithms brandnew gens apparently but engineering tells me they came with a priority tag were having a hard enough time meeting maintenance schedules as it is well have to modify our quotas unless this is an efficiency fix devices and personnel wants our turing factories manufacturing parts for a planetary interferometer nonsense they floated that idea years ago oh it will have to be done eventually a survey of the local stars possibly even higgs launches from the isis system but not in the near future an isian interferometer would be able to image worlds undetectable from the terrestrial system but all that was theoretical and would likely remain so for a long time rapid expansion into the galaxy wasnt a policy of the works trust or of the families the only voices calling for an increase in the pace of explorationwith all the fiscal sacrifice that would entailcame from dissident elements in devices and personnel unless could devices and personnel have become powerful enough to order new turing gens would the works trust really sit still for that he had been away from earth too long to guess manager nefford was almost salivating for a reaction degrandpre declined to give him one im sorry corbus i was thinking of something else the physicians features collapsed into disappointment youll excuse me degrandpre said standing manager what about your meal have it sent to my quarters eight hours later there had been no new development in the outpost crisis even freeman li had begun to calm down no longer demanding an immediate evac only pushing for a contingency plan not an unreasonable request degrandpre agreed to keep the shuttle bays on standby and ordered an immediate investigation sending the kuiper woman elam mather from yambuku to the oceanic outpost to oversee the process she was a competent worker in her own way and as an outpost scientist she would have the skills to supervise cleanup and isolation ops after a long session spent briefing the section managers he returned to his cabin to sort through a stack of recent transmissions from earth and yes corbus nefford had been correct here was an order specifying broad new protocols for the turing factories shunting valuable raw material into this scheme to build a largescale imaging interferometer devices and personnel wanted a functioning planetary imager established before the end of the decade plus a host of secondary probes to identify small asteroids and kuiper objects that might ultimately serve as higgs launchers madness but the works trust was cooperating and degrandpre could hardly resist the loss of the oceanic lab had already stained his record there was a time when he might have enjoyed this kind of intrigue when he thought he was good at it but the forces at work here were vast impersonal hegelian he would be crushed or he would not the outcome was beyond his control unless buried in the filestack of communiques he found a secured order to begin zoe fishers fieldwork with all possible speed he took it at first for a devices and personnel addendum but it wasnt it came with a works seal he was taken aback rushing the fisher womans walkabout might well produce another casualty another stain on degrandpres fragile career record and a setback for the radicals of devices and personnel was that what the works trust wanted this was delicate indeed the order looked innocuous the only odd thing about it was that it concerned a devices and personnel project but lacked the d p imprimatur significant or not one thing was certain the fisher woman mattered a great deal to all sorts of people she was as his father used to say a hinge that bears great weight her lifeor her deathwould surely affect his own seven zoe hurried to the common room as soon as she heard the news she found most of the yambuku family already gathered theregrimly huddled together many of them while the main plasma screen displayed fragments of telemetry from the oceanic outpost she had gone to bed early and was asleep when the first news broke by the time the allhands alert sounded singh and devereaux were already confirmed dead their lab crushed and swallowed by the equatorial sea isis had killed them hayes would say though zoe couldnt bring herself to think of the accident in those terms isis wasnt the enemy she believed that fiercely the enemy was carelessness or ignorance or the unexpected singh and devereaux had both rotated through yambuku during their orientation most of the yambuku staff had known them with the exception of the secretive ios technicians and the upperechelon kachos everyone on isis duty knew everyone else especially the handful of downstation crew the surface dwellers yambuku mourned singh and devereaux just as the staff of the oceanic labs must have mourned macabie feya three deaths in the time ive been here zoe thought were like soldiers in a battle zone we watch each other die tonya cooper had collapsed onto the shoulder of em vya a junior phytochemist both wept quietly zoe felt a swelling grief of her own she hadnt met the dead men but she supposed it must have been an awful death to be crushed under the brutal weight of the oceanlike macabie feya she thought lost to the lonely immensities of isis tam hayes stood silently in the east corner of the room next to the large global map of isis the globe had been one of mac feyas sparetime projects she remembered elam saying a work of art assembled from yambukus redundant suppliesa bubble of handblown silica now physical features read from survey maps in the icss archives and etched onto the globes surface by an assembly tractible the globe was iceblue and frostgray faintly translucent she watched hayes spin the bubble in order to locate the oceanic labs an infinitesimally small speck in the glassy turquoise of the southern equatorial sea she joined him following along as he traced a useless path to the nearest substantial land a chain of volcanic islands appended to the great western continent like a crooked finger five thousand kilometers away zoe felt she could read his thoughts in all that strange blue immensity more death she put her hand on his arm the gesture was impulsive and she didnt realize at first that she had done it her shock unfolded slowly hayes seemed not to notice though he looked up when she pulled away the sleeve of his shirt had felt warm as warm as his body were losing he said my god zoe gigadollars to bring us here to keep us here and were losing to the planet unasked he returned the touch put his hand on her shoulder and zoe was simultaneously aware of a number of things the scent of him the murmur of the room the midnight whisper of the stations homeostatics seen from outside yambuku would be a bubble of yellow light in a moonless dark the forests vacant rooms and random corridors reaching to the mountains the sea it goes beyond coincidence maybe dieters paranoia is justified the planets peeling away our defenses prying us open much more of this and theyll shut us down conduct research by tractible it was an accident zoe managed to say idiotic she thought the trusts dont care the families dont care but i care zoe thought and so does he though he doesnt want to say it so baldly elam mather came across the room dressed in crumpled sleep fatigues her eyes full of worry and an active scroll in her hand more news from the ios she said hayes gave her a wary look theyre shuttling me out to the sea lab elam explained to whats left of it they want me to find out what happened the crew drifted out of the common room as it became obvious that the crisis had stabilized zoe alert now and full of caffeine sat at a conference table bathed in the wan light of the active wall displays she waited until jon jiang the nightshift engineer gave her a baleful nod and left the room truly aloneand feeling almost furtiveshe switched the large westwall display away from its static readout mode to monitor the view from an exterior camera cool outside tonight according to the status crawl at the top of the display twentyone degrees celsius winds from the westnorthwest averaging five klicks per hour stars glittered like garnets in the heavy sky obscured by a cirrus haze she felt strange she couldnt name the way she felt she was reminded of the way she had felt years ago when theo had come to save her from the bleak hallways and morbid stone chambers of the tehran orphan creche that contradictory mixture of feelings dread of the future dread of this tall stranger in his crisp black uniform and at the same time a nervous elation a sweet suspicion of freedom her memories of tehran had been smoothedthe medical worduntil they were distorted and affectless she knew only that her jailers had raped and starved her sisters and had used her own body as they pleased she didnt forgive them but her rage was muted most of her tormentors would have died in the riots of in the fire that had swept out of the industrial slums and swallowed the creche complex they were dead and she was alive better still she had been given back the special destiny for which she had been born the stars why then did she shiver at every touch of the material world she had shivered outside in her excursion suit at the first cool drop of isian rain on her shoulder and she had shivered at the touch of tam hayes broad rough hand i dont like to be touched how often in her life had she repeated that small mantra it was a legacy the medical ontogenists had told her of the tehran years an aversion too deep to root out and anyway where she was going there would be no one to touch her no one human at least during her alone time in the isian wilderness but then why was she looking at the night sky with her eyes full of tears why did her hand stray repeatedly to her shoulder where tam hayes had touched her as if to shelter that ghost of his warmth why had memory begun to well out of her like some dark subterranean spring she knew only that something was wrong with her and that she mustnt tell anyone if they suspected she was ill they would send her back to the ios probably back to earth away from her work away from tam hayes away from her life two days passed the crisis at the oceanic outpost had been contained the mood at yambuku lightened somewhat though zoe noticed the biohazard people keeping their scrolls open on their desks alert for news she spent a morning doing a simulation walk through the lush terrain west of the copper river then took her lunch into the prep room of the docking bay watching the maintenance crew ready the shuttle for elams suborbital flight across the ocean maintenance was an engineering duty lee reisman sharon carpenter and kwame sen waved at zoe from the bay and kwame in particular stole a number of more frequent glances at her was he attracted to her sexually attracted the thought was unsettling zoe had studied with peers at the d p facilities back home but most of her classmates were heterosexual women or junior male aristocrats sporting orchidectomy badges and zoe hadnt cared the medical team had taught her a broad range of masturbation sutras because that was expected to be her permanent sexual modality it should have been enough but these days she was masturbating almost nightly and when she did well as often as not she thought of tam hayes elam mather entered the prep room and joined zoe at the table pushing aside a stack of checklists to make room for her coffee cup the older woman nodded at her abstractedly but said nothing only gazed at the shuttle work kwame kept his glances to himself zoe said i hope you have a safe trip hmm oh well dont wish me luck its bad luck wishing people luck it was the sort of bewildering thing kuiper people were apt to say certainly zoe had read all the histories she could recount the founding of the republics as well as any schoolchild in the system but none of that dry knowledge had prepared her for the reality of a kuiperdominated community like yambukuthe frightening fluidity of rank the unabashed sexuality kuiper males were never gelded no matter what their station in life and the result was rather like being caged with zoo animals these people made no secret of their urges their assignations their copulations were not so bad elam said zoe stared are you telepathic too elam laughed hardly its just not the first time ive worked with terrestrials you learn to recognize that expression you know that sort ofoh god what next zoe allowed herself a smile actually elam added youre adjusting very well for an earthbound hand im not earthbound any more than youre kuiperbound i mean were here arent we good point youre right were here were not what we used to be she returned zoes tentative smile i begin to understand what tam sees in you zoe blushed thinking he sees something in me she dreamed that night of her first homenot the horrid barracks in tehran but the soft cool devices and personnel creche of her years the creche was located deep in an american wilderness enclave the creche dome green as crystal seen from afar on picnic days had glittered like a dewdrop on the rolling prairie grassland the nursery wards and creche pads had been as plush as velvet all corners rounded the air itself sweetsmelling and cool and she had not known fear or doubt not in the creche each of the nannies many of them wholly human tended one special child and they were stern but kind fat ministering angels she had changed her green jumper every morning and every afternoon the simple cloth starched and bright and she had looked forward to the evening bath splashing with her sibs while lactating nannies with babies in their arms looked on indulgently from terraces above the steaming water in her dream she was back in the bath pool slapping waves at a yellow flotation ring but the dream became disturbing when great ancient treescycads or giant lycopodserupted around the pool a sudden forest the voices of her sibs were instantly stilled she was alone shivering naked in a woodland like no woodland she had ever seen she climbed from the creche pool onto a mossy shore black soil cushioned her feet the rocks were dressed in velvety green liverwort she didnt know how she had come here or how to find her way home she felt panic rising out of the clenched fist of her belly then a shade a shape appeared out of the humid fog it was avrion theophilus her own beloved theo in his crisp devices and personnel uniform but when she recognized him she turned away and ran ran as fast she could run ran uselessly while his footsteps thudded behind her she woke in the dark her heart was hammering it eased soon enough but the sense of threat and electricity continued to vibrate through her body just a bad dream zoe thought but she never had bad dreams she pushed the nightmare out of her mind thinking again of tam hayes of how she had touched him so unselfconsciously in the common room of the fabric of his shirt of his eyes holding hers for a fraction of a moment something is wrong with me she told herself again oh god as she reached between her legs and spread her labia with her fingers finding the bump of her clitoris like a small hard knot the orgasm came quickly a wave of fire she bit her lip to keep from crying out eight elam mather felt her usual lightheadedness as the shuttle lifted from yambuku into a watery sky isis fell away beneath her but not far enough this was a suborbital flight half a worlds journey to the damaged oceanic outpost several hours flying time at the best speed the cumbersome shuttle could make planets she thought were simply too large the shuttle crew were iosbased and most of them were kuiperborn pleasant enough but not talkative elam settled down in an aisle seat by herself her scroll tuned to one of the terrestrial pop novels occasionally dumped down the particlepair link for the presumed edification of lonely outposters this one titled e querns difficult decision was the story of a young girl from a mesomanagerial family in love with a family cousin who has mistaken her station in life alas a tragedy the young heir on learning that he cant decently marry our heroine volunteers for an orchidectomy and the girl slinks back to her commune chastened but wiser what crap elam thought in real life the meeting would never happen or if it did there would be no question of a love affair the aristocrat would fuck the prole and forget her name the next day certainly no such wellconnected male would ever consent to an orchidectomy gelding was a way to keep the salarymen away from high family daughters no more and no less kachos like degrandpre were proud of their scars but that was only because they had been bred to a life of glorified servitude the proles the great unconsulted terrestrial masses simply fucked or married as best they could and increased their numbers though the various unchecked infertility viruses helped keep the population within limits elam had taken much of her schooling on earth she was not naive about the planet unlike tam hayes or even a d p bottle baby like zoe fisher she turned to the window which wasnt a window at all but a direct video feed from a cam on the outside of the multiplyinsulated shuttle the continent fled westward beneath her isis looked heartbreakingly calm from this altitude the snowcapped copper mountains had given way to broad alluvial plains to prairie veined with skyblue rivers clouds scrubbed the grasslands with shadow and rivers broadened at last into swampy bays and salty inlets the vast eastern littoral where seabirds wheeled in flocks large enough to be visible even from this altitude all this more known than seen mapped from orbit glimpsed if at all from shuttle flights or through the eyes of longrange tractible remensors untouched all this elam thought in a sense no part of isis had ever been touched certainly not by naked human skin the planet was full of life but this was life older than earths by a billion years more evolved but also more primitive preserved from change by the absence of great waves of extinction room for all for all genera and every survival strategy save the human the sentient the terrestrial were such simple creatures she thought we cant tolerate these finely honed phytotoxins the countless microscopic predators shaped by a billion years of involution nothing in the armory of the human immune system could recognize or repel the invisible isian armies they lay siege to us elam mused she thought of the bacterial colonies eroding the seals at yambuku and of the algal films that might or might not have contributed to the deepsea disaster we dont recognize them but i do believe they recognize us we build our walls our barriers but life talks to life life talks to life that was the rule the grayblue continental shelf fell away behind the shuttle and for a time there was only the ocean to see cobaltblue wrinkled with white breakers or the cloud tops often turbulent tropical storms winding up in the stark sunlight like watch springs coiled with lightning in all the open sea there was no vessel or wake of a vessel nothing human not a nailed board or a bleached plastic bottle nothing down there she thought but the alien krill clumps of saltwater weed winddriven foam she thought of the barriers between isian and terrestrial life and then of the long quarantine between earth and the kuiper republics the dark days when earth had lost so much of her population to the plagues and the republics became truly independent almost by default the republics were an alliance of the most remote and hostile environments mankind had ever settledkuiper bodies asteroids oort mines the martian airfarms the hydrogen oxygen economies of the outer system had been severed from the smug waterwealth of earth itself humanity splitting like a parthenogenic cell but the division was never absolute life touches life the works trust had taken a troubled earth back into space but could not repair the old civil and political wounds earth had retreated into a system of bureaucratic aristocracy the kuiper republics were its unruly children making pagan or puritan utopias of their icy strongholdsnobody cutting off his balls as a gesture of for gods sake fealty and yet life touches life take tam hayes a true kuiper orphan excommunicated by the doctrinaire red thorns for signing up with a works project but signing up with the trusts was the only way to reach isis distant isis fabled isis the mandalay of the republic he had traded his history for a dream and zoe fisher as obedient a bottle baby as any that earth had produced no dreams allowed not for that female gelding but isis had stitched them together somehow it was obvious to everyone but themselves certainly to elam put them in the same room and zoe orbited him like a sun he followed her like a tractible antenna elam didnt approve of terrestrialkuiper liaisons most of them didnt last but here she thought was something devices and personnel might not have anticipated a small wrench in the harsh human machinery of the trusts life doing the unexpected she approved maybe she approved but there were things tam didnt know about zoe things elam supposed she ought to tell him she opened her scroll and began a message she could send it after touchdown she wrote until her attention was attracted by a string of volcanic islands passing under the right wing green to the rims of their ancient caldera reefs not of coral but deposited by a wholly different community of limestonefixing invertebrates teased the shallow water into multicolored foam the light was longer here making valleys of the low swells had she slept a crewman passing told her the shuttle was less than half an hour from docking and decon she adjusted her seat restraint tucked her scroll away and closed her eyes again thinking of hayes and zoe of the tenacity of life of the universal need to merge combine exfoliate and of the vulnerability of life too and of the sea of the large fish that eat the little fish and of the long reach of the earth the deepsea stations head kacho was freeman li a terrestrial whom elam had worked with both in training and on isis she liked him better than she did most terrans he was a flexible thinker a small barrelchested darkskinned man with sherpa ancestry and family in the martian airfarms a fussandworry type but he usually worried to good effect he was worried now he took elam directly from decon to the nearest common room a lowceilinged octagonal chamber between a microbiology lab and the engineering deck elam assumed she was under sea level here but there was no way of knowing the oceanic outpost was as tightly sealed as marburg or yambuku were the stations distributed mass and deep anchoring prevented it from moving with the swell though typhoons caused it to oscillate or so she had been told like a slow plumb bob there was no motion now ill be frank with you elam li said absently stirring a cup of black tea when this happened i told degrandpre i wanted a complete evacuation i still think thats what we should have doneand ought to do whatever killed singh and devereaux and destroyed pod six acted far too quickly for us to play with it arid there are still no obvious candidates for causative agent lots of toxic agents down there but much of that material is also sitting in glovebox arrays all over the station any agent unique to pod six could only have been a chemical isolate or extract not live biota caustic substances some of them extremely caustic yes and all highly toxic a significant release could easily have killed two men and triggered the biohazard alarm but the damage to the pod itself no no single agent or combination of agents could conceivably have done that as far as we know he shrugged youre right we dont know but were talking about chemical isolates at the microgram level any other problems prior to the disaster pod six had problems with algal gunk interfering with the samplers and sensor arrays but dont jump to conclusions elam weve had much the same trouble all up and down the station though it gets worse with depth it would be a tremendous coincidence if both things happened simultaneouslya toxic release inside the pod and a compromised seal serious enough to collapse the structure itself whatever caused the watertight seals to break down might also have taken out the glovebox array maybe probably and doesnt that suggest to you a hazard of the first order she thought about it all we have that would make pod six unique is a heavy algal infestation in the sensor arrays i dont know about unique its a matter of degree but in the sense you mean yes can i look at these organisms certainly freeman li had hedged degrandpres bet by confining his staff to the upper two pods of the chain where they could make a quick escape to the shuttle bay if the need arose the remaining three pods had been closed and sealed that cut into station productivity in general and interrupted at least two very promising research lines but li said flatly thats degrandpres problem not mine it was a laudably kuiperlike sentiment elam thought she followed him down a narrow access shaft to the lowermost of the occupied pods the bulkheads caught her eye as she passed beneath them immense steel pressure doors ready to snap shut in an unforgiving fraction of a second in that awful terrestrial novel there had been a passage about a mouse walking into a trap she had never seen a mouse or a mousetrap but she imagined she knew how the animal felt precautions in the microbiology lab never less than stringent under freemans watch had been tuned since the accident to a fine pitch until further notice all isian biota and isolates were to be treated as proven hot level five threats in the labs secured anteroom elam donned the requisite pressurized suit with shoulderpack air and temperature controls as did li and with his headgear in place he looked peculiar holloweyed somber he guided her through the preliminary washdown past similarly dressed men and women working at glove boxes of varying complexity through yet another airlocked antechamber and into a smaller unoccupied lab elam felt some of the terror she had first felt on entering a level five viralresearch lab during her training on earth of course it had been worse then she had been a naive kuiper student raised on crane clan tales of the horrors of the terrestrial plague years the great divide between earth and the kuiper colonies had always been a biological chasm deeper in its way than the simple distances of space the kuiper clans enforced a quarantine no one was permitted to arrive or return from earth unless he or she was scrubbed of all terrestrial disease organisms down to the cellular level terrestrialkuiper decon was grueling physically difficult and as lengthy as the long loop orbit from the inner system there had never been an outbreak of terrestrial disease on an inhabited kuiper body had there been the settlement in question would have been instantly quarantined and decontaminatedhygiene protocols that would have been impractical on earth with its dense and mostly impoverished population elam had gone to earth for her postdoc the way a fastidious social worker might consent to enter a leper colony squeamishly but with the best of intentions she was inoculated for every imaginable necrophage prion bacteria or virus nevertheless she came down with a classic fever of unknown origin that persisted through the first month of her orientation before it finally yielded to a series of leukocyte injections she had never been sick in her life before that day being sick being infected with some invisible parasite was well even worse than she had imagined after that her first attempt at sterile work had terrified her the university of madrid was a devices and personnel stronghold full of offworld students mainly martians but including several kuiper expats like herself novices werent allowed in the same room with live infectious agents she had already been introduced to anthrax hiv nelsoncahill and leungs dengue and the vast array of hemorrhagic retroviruses but strictly by telepresence virushandling of the kind required by terrestrial fieldwork was infinitely more dangerous here were all the antique horrors of earth predators more subtle and tenacious than jungle animals and just as lively still stalking the malnourished populations of africa asia europe shepherds crooks and rainbowcolored protein loops all brimming with death planetary ecology she had thought ancient and unbelievably hostile this was tams bios made tangible the involute residue of evolutionary eons but at least earth had accommodated mankind into the equation for all the deadliness of its plagues isis had brokered no such deal she watched as li put his hands into a glove box no telepresence here either barring the devices that translated his hand motions to the manipulators deep in the vaultlike specimen barrels a glovebox microcamera fed images to lis headgear and to a monitor where elam could watch his work the image of a linked group of living cells filled the screen this is the little bastard thats been fouling our externals grows in colonies a slimy blue film and yes there was an inert sample from this culture in pod six but i cant believe theres any causal connection as a matter of fact the image listed like a sinking ship li youre losing focus this gear is as old as the station degrandpres been sitting on our maintenance requests for more than a year afraid hell offend the budget people the timid bastard hold on better yes better elam peered at the organism onscreen fighting an urge to hold her breath the cell was multinucleated its spiky protein coat notched like a cog in a clockwork mitochondrial bodies more varied and complex than their terrestrial counterparts transited between the fat nuclei and the armored cell walls sparking quick osmotic exchanges none of the processes were as well understood as the microbiologists liked to pretend different bios different rules looks like our gunk elam said pardon me bacterial slimes on the external seals like this well not exactly yours are ocean dwellers ours are airborne i dont recognize those granular bodies in the miotic canali but the way they lock together is awfully familiar um li youre losing the image again freeman li said uncharacteristically fuck his shoulders straightened sharply there was a pause the image swam into an unrecognizable meshwork of colored pixels and this time it didnt resolve then li said in a brittle tone leave the chamber elam there was a sudden hissing sound she couldnt identify elam felt the first touch of real fear nowa tingle in her jaw a dull roar in her ears li what is it he didnt answer under his protective gear he had begun to tremble instantly her mouth went dry god li get the fuck out of here she moved without thinking her lab reflexes werent fresh but they were deeply ingrained he hadnt asked her for help he had issued an order on the authority of whatever it was hed seen in the glove box she ran for the lab door but it was already gliding shut a slab of oiled steel ceiling fans roared to life producing negative pressure and drawing possibly contaminated air up into series of hep a and nano filters a siren began to wail through the pod it sounded elam thought madly like a screaming child she moved toward the door as the gap narrowed knowing even as she ran that the margin of time was impossibly thin she was already in effect sealed inside she turned gasping as the bulkhead slid into place the pod was airtight now the fans stopped though the siren continued to shriek freeman li had taken his hands away from the glove box something had peeled away patches of his suit and gloves turned the impermeable membranes into scabs of onionskin whole sections of raw flesh were exposed and beginning to blister so impossibly fast he tore off his goggles his face was a mask of blood nostrils gushing freely his eyes already scarlet with burst capillaries he said something incomprehensibleit might have been her nameand collapsed to the floor elams heart raced she didnt scream because it seemed to her that the siren was already screaming on her behalf that all the dread in the world had been summed into that awful noise the floor of the pod seemed to slip sideways she sat down hard on her tailbone a scant meter from freeman lis twitching corpse she put her fingers to her own nose drew them back and looked blankly at the bright red spots of blood so this is death she thought all this red mess so untidy she closed her eyes nine the spin of the ios was fortuitously timed kenyon degrandpre was at his small office viewport and looking in the right direction when the latest higgs sphere arrived the effect wasnt spectacular he had seen it before a flash in the starry sky that was all brief as summer lightning a scatter of photons and energetic particles and then the afterglow a blue cherenkov halo a higgs launch tortured the vacuum around itself forcing virtual particles into unequivocal existence it was not simply a journey but in its way an act of creation the higgs sphere with its carefully shielded cargo was of course invisible at this distance a speck in the greater darkness still half a million miles away rendezvous tugs had already left the ios to retrieve it the spheres transponder announcing its location and condition but of course it had arrived exactly where it was expected higgs translations were accurate to within a fraction of a kilometer the works trust had supplied degrandpre with a cargo manifest he held it in his hand aboard that invisible spacecraft were a number of unfamiliar and ominous things radical new genetic algorithms for the isian turing factories small robotic probes to be launched into the outer system and far from least the new man the observer the cipher the threat avrion theophilus degrandpres rather dated book of the families described theophilus as a highlevel devices and personnel officer loosely connected to the psychology branch as well as a distant relative of the quantrills and the atlanta somersets which might mean well anything degrandpre turned to his scroll and called up zoe fishers file scanning it again for clues apart from the obvious connection with theophilushe had been her case managerthere was no hint of his hidden agenda or of hers assuming that this zoe fisher really was some kind of d p doginthemanger he couldnt imagine what terrestrial dispute might turn on the fate of one bottle baby for all her fine new technology and linguistic skills but history had often enough turned on smaller fulcrums a bullet a microbe a misplaced word restless he called ops for an update on the turing manifests what came back through his scroll was the sound of confusion until rosa becker his secondshift supervisor picked up a voice link sir were having problems with our telemetry degrandpre closed his eyes god no please not now what telemetry telemetry from the deepsea outpost its gone were blank herethe stations just off the map tell me its satellite malfunction only if we lost all our redundancies at once a pause another crackle of hurried conversation correction we have a single shuttle upbound from the pod chain reporting survivors on board but thats all what do you mean thats all according to the pilot another pause no other survivors just wreckage just wreckage freeman lis nightmare had come true sir and mine degrandpre thought i want that shuttle quarantined indefinitely he said facing the immediate threat postponing his own fear and sound the stations were on full alert but he felt like a dead man the occasion was zoes first solo excursion the final systems test before she attempted a daylong hike to the copper river tam hayes left his workgenemapping the monocell culturesand crossed the core quad to the north wing where zoe was already suiting up his thoughts careened between zoes excursion and his research in both cases mysteries outnumbered certainties cellular genetics on isis would remain a puzzle for years hayes was certain the biochemical machinery was infuriatingly complex what to make of organelles that also led independent lives outside their parent cells that reproduced as retroviruses or the tiled complexities of microtubules ringing the cell walls every question begged a thousand more most of them concerning isian paleobiology a field of study that barely existed apart from a couple of glacial core samples and freeman lis work with thermophyllic bacteria there wasnt any hard data only conjecture all those unbroken years of evolutionary recomplication had obviously bred ancient parasitisms deep into the mechanism of lifeevery energy exchange every selective ionization every release of atp was a fossilized act of predation complex symbiotic partnerships had arisen the way mountains rise from the clash of tectonic plates out of conflict collaboration out of chaos order the mysteries his mother had trained him in the mysteries had taken him to chapel every month both red thorns and ice walkers were primarily old deists a faith much given to philosophizing the monthly sermons had gone over his head but he thought often of the annual invocation in the observatory chamber he had been taken into that cold domed space to count constellations like rosary beads while the warm bodies of the congregation pressed against him voices joined in hymns as his mother clutched his hand so tightly it hurt was it entirely his fault then that he had fallen in love with the stars the red thorns had thought so he found zoe in the prep room struggling into her excursion suit tia and kwame tabbing the seams for her kuiperborn the two had never learned to respect terrestrial nudity taboos and they obviously didnt know or care why zoe flinched at their touch she looked at hayes with a rescueme expression he sent the two technicians down to the shuttle bay to give lee reisman a hand thank you zoe said meekly really i can do this myself they designed the gear that way it just takes time shall i leave too she thought for a moment then shook her head if you need help ask she drew on the leggings the active membrane as limp as plastic film until it found and matched the contours of her skin then it mapped itself in place pinkly translucent a second skin she bent to pull on the more conventional hip boots her small breasts bobbing she looked up caught his eye and blushed conspicuously hayes wondered if he should turn away what would a terrestrial do she pulled her arms through the filmy torso membrane and said something too quiet for him to hear he cleared his throat i m sorry it would be faster if you sealed the tabs he came across the room recognizing his eagerness to touch her and suppressing it she was easily frightened the tabs of the excursion suit were three bars of fleshy material where the seams met across the small of her back he touched her skin where it dimpled against the curve of her spine and felt an odd sense of familiarity she was practically a kuiper woman at least genetically her genome sampled from the stock that had settled the asteroids hardy raw material for a new diaspora he sealed the garment gently and watched the membrane form itself to her body heard her indrawn breath as the protective skin tightened over breasts nipples the base of her throat without the headgear without the wastemanagement pack she might have been naked his hand lingered on the ridge of her hip and she shivered but didnt object but when he raised his hand to touch her hair she ducked her head away whispered not there why not only where im protected she wouldnt meet his eyes was this what she wanted needed he put his hands on her waist and drew her closer protected she had said protected against contact he supposed or against the idea of contact he wanted to tilt up her head and say something comforting fie might have if the station alarm had not sounded zoe gasped and backed away as if stung hayes looked at the blinker on his pocket scroll something about the oceanic outpost no details but obviously more bad news it was the bios hayes thought closing in on him again part two ten zoe wasnt truly alone in the forest she was surrounded at all times by insectsized remensors and larger spiderlegged tractibles and she was linked to yambuku by extensive telemetry but she felt alone unspeakably alone especially after midnight this was what she had been born for this aloneness her hermetic impulse had been built into her dna the same gen mods the first kuiper colonists had carried into the emptiness beyond neptunea race of monks carving their hermitages out of frozen starlit massifs she was not afraid to be alone which didnt mean she wasnt afraid she found herself frightened of a number of things she woke well after midnight in the darkness of her tent the tent was a simple polymerandfoam geodesic designed not to protect her from the elementsher excursion suit did thatbut to disguise her from the native wildlife the excursion suit was a semiopen system she carried food and water in sterile containers with selfsealing nozzles but she excreted the inevitable wastes bluntly piss shit and c her wastes were scrubbed by the suits processors and nanobacters but even sterilized human waste was a magnet for isian predators solid and liquid wastes could be contained and buried but her breath and perspiration were harder to conceal the tent helped circulating external air slowly and bleeding her molecular signature through osmotic and hep a filters but no system was perfect the loss of the ocean station less than ten days ago had made that perfectly clear systems were imperfect or imperfectly adapted to the isian biosphere which led to the unhappy thought that she might even now be attracting nocturnal predators that had evaded her perimeter defenses that hushed woody rattle in the distance for example might be wind in the trees or it might be bullshit she sat up exasperated all hope of sleep fled she found it hard enough to rest in the excursion suit which faithfully reported to her skin the pressure of every twig and pebble under the gel floor of the tentbut it was worse to be afflicted with the midnight jitters an array of robotic remensors scanned her perimeter at all times for motion or telltale molecular signatures nothing larger than a grub could sneak up on her and her tent was if not perfect certainly grubproof so to hell with nagging fears she was just restless she pulled on her protective leggings opened the tent door and stepped out into the windy darkness of the cycadlike isian forest the only ambient light came from a sprinkle of stars above the leaf canopy but there was enough of it to give the suits photon multiplier something to work with the forest through her iris lenses appeared as a map of squat tree boles against a diffuse grid of windrippled foliage depthless eerie she adjusted her lenses to look for heat sources and saw nothing more than a few roosting aviants and timid scavenger voles hardly larger than her thumb nothing to lose sleep over she turned her face to the sky again the brightest star wasnt a star at all it was a planet named cronos by some unimaginative terrestrial numberbender when it was detected a century ago the isian systems enormous gas giant currently at the aphelion of its looping orbit cronos had contributed to isian geohistory by sweeping the system of its rocky and icy debris comets were rare in the isian sky less a titan zoe thought than a fat guardian angel her innerear com link came alive hissing faintly zoe tam hayes voice your telemetry puts you outside the tent and your pulse rate is up so i assume youre awake i dont walk in my sleep if thats what you mean but she was immensely relieved to hear his voice restless a little is that a problem no problem the smallness of his voice inside her head made her even more aware of her position alone in an alien forest true yambuku wasnt far away but yambuku was a sealed environment a fragile bubble of earth she had left that bubble and she was outside of it lost on isis on isis where there were no artificial lights no roads no amenities over the next horizon nothing over the horizon but more horizon parallax to parallel nothing between her and a planetary level five hot zone but a membrane a few molecules thick unsurprising then that devices and personnel had chosen to resurrect her genome from the old diaspora stock isis was at least as lonely as any barren kuiper object and much much farther from home zoe im here we have a large animal paralleling your position maybe fifty meters northnorthwest nothing to worry about but to avoid advertising your presence wed like you to sit still for a few minutes back to the tent well keep you outside and mobile for now though i do wish youd checked in before taking a walk just stay put please and let the tractibles do their work is this thing stalking me probably just curious quiet please she listened into the darkness but heard nothing what kind of large animal most likely a triraptor she supposed she pictured it eightlimbed quadripedal with four arms on its erect upper body and claws like tempered steel her excursion suit was tough enough to protect her from the bites of small animals and invertebrates but not from the industrialstrength carnage of a triraptor attack zoe she whispered i thought you wanted me quiet were okay as long as we dont shout can you make yourself comfortable out there she scanned the ground located a fallen tree trunk and sat down on it tiny insects from a disturbed nest swarmed over her footgear harmless things she ignored them comfortable is relative at least we can talk taking the night shift again midnight to dawn as long as youre on excursion she was flattered not to mention intimidated she had been thinkingcould not help thinkingof her encounter with hayes in the prep room how she had wept in his arms at the news of the oceanic tragedy and how she had found her way to his cabin that night of the way he had touched her eagerly but gently a way she had never been touched by another human being and she had permitted it encouraged it dreaded it little scary out there your pulse rates up again she blushedinvisibly thank god unless the telemetry revealed that too its just dark a long way in every direction understood a wind from the west turned leaves in the trees the same wind no doubt carried her scent deeper into the forest no dont think about that tam yes you grew up in the kuipers red thorn you said right red thorns a big kb habitat in the near oorts one of the oldest kuiper settlements threequarters g spin around the long axis so i didnt have to adapt much for isis happy childhood there was a pause happy enough creche or biofamily bio no creches in red thorn were conservative you miss the habitat often he was being careful she realized thinking of her of her difficult childhood you know it wasnt as bad for me as you might think being a creche baby before tehran anyway i liked being with my sisters my nannies miss it some things you cant get back that feeling of being where you belong nobody belongs on isis the skin of her excursion suit was exquisitely sensitive too much so she startled at the touch of a falling leaf on her shoulder zoe sorry false alarm theres a breeze up feels like it might rain soon she wondered why it should be easier to talk to hayes through the com link than facetoface i know what i must seem like to a kuiper person raised the way i was i mean none of us chose his childhood zoe like one of those oldtime chinese aristocratic women her feet crammed into tiny shoesdo you know what i mean bent into someone elses idea of beauty or utility zoe he paused old kuiper maxim a broken human being isnt even a good tool you couldnt have survived the way you did without something solid at the center of you something all your own now it was her turn to pause theo used to say youre playing hideandseek zoe hiding from me again but theo always ferreted out her secrets most of them hayes said quiet now zoe just a while longer the target turned your way again the tractibles will lure it away but dont call attention to yourself and switch off your night vision please zoe the lenses leak your eyes are glowing like a cats you can see me she wasnt sure she liked the idea im monitoring one of the remensors hush now ill keep you updated she sighed and switched off the photon multiplier instantly the dark became absolute she closed her eyes and listened the wind was stronger now clouds had obscured the stars a cold front was pushing in from the west according to this mornings meteorological report raindrops began to spatter the forest canopy there was a rustling sound in the undergrowth maybe a few meters away her pulse ramped up yet again hayes said thats a tractible guarding your flank i know you cant see anything but i need you to keep calm right now to keep as still as you can she couldnt see the triraptor nosing through the forest but her excursion suit reported its scentnot the actual airborne molecules of course but an electronic tickling of the appropriate receptor cells a faint echo of something acrid and bitter in her nose the animal was close nighthardened remensors buzzed around her she heard at last the unmistakable sound of something alive and massive moving through the brush steady zoe theo had taught her better discipline than this she opened her eyes wide and imagined she saw it the triraptorthe eyes of it at least glinting in a last wash of starlight from the eastern sky classic predators eyes chromeyellow and alert and gone keep still zoe chasing some spider tractible no doubt a while longer the sounds retreated cautiously she turned her face up to the misting rain i miss elam she whispered i know zoe i do too were running out of time arent we lets hope not eleven degrandpre had planned to give avrion theophilus the full tour of the ioswhen had there been such a guest as avrion theophilusbut the devices and personnel man was having none of it what i want to see this morning theophilus had said mildly is your shuttle quarantine and what a grand scion of the families this theophilus had turned out to be tall bonethin grayhaired aquiline of nose and fashionably pale of complexion degrandpres orchidectomy badge which so impressed his subordinates was nothing to this man but a servants tattoo no doubt theophilus had already sired a brood of young aristocrats strapping creatures with blue eyes and immaculate teeth admirable powerful and potentially very dangerous avrion theophilus was a devices and personnel functionary of unknown rank who conducted himself with all the arrogance of a works trust official and that in itself was deeply confusing the news from earth was equally troubling hints of turmoil among the houses and the families show trials perhaps a purge in the trusts but news through the particlepair link was heavily censored and although this theophilus must know far more about the crisis than anyone onboard the ios did he hadnt volunteered to talk about it and degrandpre dared not ask for fear of seeming impertinent it was all so maddeningly ambiguous should he court the favor of avrion theophilus or would that appear as a betrayal to his sponsors in the works trust was there a middle path an oppressive emotional atmosphere gripped the ios much as degrandpre tried to minimize it the loss of the oceanic station weighted heavily on staff even here by all accounts the surface personnel had grown brutally dispirited some saw it as the end of the human presence on isis and that it might well be although this theophilus seemed disturbingly indifferent your orbital station needs some maintenance theophilus remarked blandly the ring corridor is filthy and the air isnt much better the walls were dirty true cleaning servitors had lately been scavenged for the interferometer project replacements had not yet arrived from the turing factories as for the smellweve had some trouble with the scrubbers in our wastemanagement stacks temporary of course but in the meantime i apologize one grows accustomed to it perhaps not as easily as one might hope perfect aristocratic tone degrandpre thought insult and menace ill a single phrase he promised to see to the problem though he couldnt imagine what he could do except bother the engineers yet again no spares had arrived with the higgs sphere and he cynically wondered if replacements had been set aside to make room for the noble mass of avrion theophilus he escorted his guest as far as the massive bulkhead doors dividing shuttle quarantine from the rest of the ios theophilus proceeded to inspect the seals and the rivet heads in minute detail making degrandpre wait as im sure youre aware degrandpre hinted these are the standard bulkheads the sterile perimeter is inside nevertheless i want these bulkheads inspected daily by qualified engineers at degrandpres shocked expression he added i dont think the works trust will disapprove do you degrandpre palmed the admit button and the bulkhead door wheeled open inside a single kuiperborn medical engineer monitored the quarantine from a steel chair the four survivors of the deepsea disaster a shuttle pilot and three junior marine exobiologists had been languishing in containment for ten days now a monitor image from the isolation chamber filled the screen above degrandpres head two men two women all haggard in lab whites except for the pilot whose trust uniform was still relatively crisp theophilus asked the medical engineer pointed and knowledgeable questions about quarantine procedures redundancy failsafes alarm systems degrandpre took note but could infer nothing from the exchange except that perhaps devices and personnel had grown nervous about the sterile status of the ios but there had never been any question of that yes it would be disastrous if there were an outbreak aboard the orbital station the steel necklace of the ios contained and nurtured nearly fifteen hundred human souls and there was no plausible escape route for most of them the planet below was universally toxic and the single spare higgs launcher reserved for emergencies would carry a mere handful of managers at best but there had never been even the hint of such a threat shuttles from isis passed through the sterilizing vacuum of space and cargo and passengers were rigorously quarantined and scrutinized as the medical engineer patiently explained and further explained and continued to explain until degrandpre was forced to express his hope that the senior manager from earth wasnt overwhelmed by all this perhaps unnecessary detail not at all theophilus said crisply standard quarantine is ten days the medical engineer nodded and when will this one be finished just a few hours from now and no sign of contagion nothing at all theyve been through a lot these four theyre looking forward to release give them another week avrion theophilus said master theophilus degrandpre asked is there anything else you would like to see the gardens perhaps or the medical facilities isis theophilus said they always want a window i can recommend the view from the docking bays thank you but ill be needing a closer look than that degrandpre frowned closer you mean you want to visit a ground station theophilus nodded my god degrandpre thought hell kill himself on top of everything else this grand stupid family cousin will kill himself and the families will blame me twelve zoe slept late on the last morning of her threeday trial excursion her sleep had been irregular ever since the death of elam mather shallow and florid with dreams but exhaustion had tipped her into a black dreamless unconsciousness by the time she woke her am checkin from yambuku was more than an hour late are they letting me sleep zoe wondered or had there been some new crisis perimeter breach disaster she toggled her corneal display and called up a status report the customary yambuku telechatter scrolled past tractibles talking to tractibles but her personal com line showed a yellow hold tag she queried the system and got a prerecorded note from tam hayes he was involved he said in a conference with the ioss kachos he would talk to her shortly in the meantime she might as well finish packing her campsite for the days hike she stepped out of the tent into morning sunlight feeling vaguely abandoned her trial excursion had been an unqualified success all the peripheralstent tractibles food and wastemanagement systems com linkshad functioned so flawlessly that the yambuku engineers were frankly envious there was still hope for the human presence on isis even if the firstgeneration outposts had begun to fail she was fulfilling her mission goals and better than that she was in isis mobile in the bios just a stones throw from the rushing copper river and why did that seem such hollow consolation somethings wrong with me zoe thought she deflated the tent walls rolled the gel floors carefully and stored them on the back of a dogsized cargo tractible she packed her camp litterempty food containers a discharged power supplyalthough she could have buried it the litter was sterile but it would have been an intrusion an insult to isis somethings wrong oh nothing physical her perimeters were intact she was as invulnerable to the bios as a human being could be but something less tangible than a virus or a prion had begun to turn and move inside her the forest glistened with last nights rainfall water cycled from tier to tier of the tree canopy overflowing from cupped leaves and flower chalices in the shadowed spaces around the tree boles the moisture had drawn out dozens of fungal fruiting bodies mold spores swirled in the westerly breeze a fine sticky dust like charcoal should she speak to a doctor if all went as planned she would be back at yambuku by nightfall but her complaints were essentially minorrestlessness disturbed sleep and a host of uneasy feelings not the least of which was her sexual liaison with tam hayes mention that to a physician at yambuku and she would be in for a battery of endocrine and neurotransmitter tests and did she want that no she said aloud the sound of her voice veiled by the suit filters but loud in the whispery glade no she didnt want that and not just because of the physical inconvenience to be honest she was changing in ways that were as tantalizing as they were disturbing her feelings about hayes for instance she understood human sexuality well enough she had studied it extensively her bioregulators kept her on an even keel chemically but she was hardly sexless the tantra instructors at the middle school had praised her skills no what was shocking was that she had actually allowed him to touch her had wanted him to touch her had relished his touch the devices and personnel clinicians had told her she would never have a satisfying orgasm with another human being her years in tehran had built up too many negative associational paths and anyway her bioregulation damped the necessary hormonal feedback loops she simply could not experience pleasurable intercourse with an adult male or so they said so something was wrong so she ought to alert a physician but she didnt want to a physician might fix her and the odd thingthe really disturbingly odd thingwas that she didnt want to be fixed if they fixed her she might not feel this shiver of anticipation at the sound of tams voice the sudden weightlessness when he offered a compliment the shocking intimacy of his hand on her body madness of course but it had something of the divine in it she wondered if she had stumbled across some wisdom lost to the modern world an archaic emotional vector hidden under the stern sexual gridmaps of the families or the chimplike copulations of the kuiper clans maybe this was how the unregulated proles fell in love did love feel like this she wondered in the viral hotlands of africa and asia she dreaded the feeling and she dreaded the idea that it might one day stop by noon the camp was packed and ready still no word from yambuku she needed to leave within the hour or risk reaching the station after dark she left a callme memo for hayes with dieter franklin who was monitoring her stats and vitals luckily the forest was calm this morning no predators within her scannable radius white clouds riding the meridian like slow boats on a tide she assembled her party of sixlegged tractibles and set off westward the path beaten by machines in advance of her excursion followed the shore of the copper for a halfklick or so this time of year the river ran shallow the water had pulled back from its banks to reveal stony fords quiescent green pools and silt dunes where a few venturous weeds had taken root automated insect remensors followed her in a cloud like circling gnats some flew ahead monitoring the route the faint buzz of them was lost in the cacophony of bird and insect calls all of which sounded alike to her power lines buzzing in a heat wave her excursion suit tunneled beads of sweat from her skin to the membranes surface cooling her as she walked sunlight turned the membrane white she glanced at her arms she was as pale as a purebred daughter of some nordic family aristocratic white she had not traveled more than a kilometer when tam hayes opened a direct link to her about time she thought zoe wed like you to halt where you are for the time being cant she said not if i want to be back before dark youve been talking to the ios all morning time doesnt stop just because kenyon degrandpre is keeping you busy thats the point they want the excursion extended they she noted not we hayes didnt approve what do you me an extended specifically they want you to turn back cross the copper at the mobile bridge and break camp on the east bank remensors wall scout a path to the digger colony and the tractibles will trailblaze for you two days of traveling ought to put you just inside the animals foodgathering perimeter which was absurd i cant do fieldwork were still testing the excursion gear feeling at the ios is that your gear passed all the tests this pushes the schedule by at least a month somebodys in a hurry i guess she supposed she knew why the oceanic station had collapsed and all the other isian outposts had suffered worrisome seal failures zoes excursion suit might be performing brilliantly but without a staging platform like yambuku it was as useful as a rainhat in a hurricane the trusts wanted to maximize the use of her before yambuku had to be evacuated cross the copper river toward the foothills move deeper into the bios while yambuku staggered toward collapse was she brave enough to do that personally hayes said im opposed to the idea i dont have the authority to overrule it but we can always find an anomaly in your gear and order you back for maintenance but the suit is flawless you said so yourself oh i think kwame sen could be convinced to shade a graph or two if it came to an argument she thought about it tam who gave this order was it degrandpre he sanctioned it but no the order came from your dandp manavrion theophilus theo surely theo wouldnt let anything bad happen to her she capped her doubts keep kwame honest ill cross the river zoe are you sure about this yes no well im sending out three more tractibles with supplies and equipment they should catch up with you by dusk and as far as im concerned youre on immediate recall at the first sign of trouble any kind of trouble give me the word ill cover it with the ios he added ill be watching which made her feel both strong and weak at once and signed off zoe gazed across the placid copper her pack tractibles acknowledged a new set of orders from yambuku by circling back behind her ambling up the trail like dimly impatient dogs and waiting for her to follow the bridge over the copper river was a string of logs spun together with strands of hightensile monofilament and anchored at either end with spikes driven deep into the gravelly soil it was sturdy enough zoe supposed but makeshift not meant to last mild as the seasons on isis were another few weeks would see monsoon rains swelling the copper to its limits and this small specimen of tractible engineering would be washed away and dispersed the bridge crossed the copper at a broad and shallow place where if she looked between the slats she could see the polished river rocks and the quiet places where creatures not quite fish they looked like overgrown tadpolesswarmed and spawned she could have forded the river here she was certain without any bridge at all some of her cargo tractibles did just that managing the water with their javelin legs more surely than they could have navigated these loosely strung logs across the river the trail was less obvious it had not been as completely blazed as the path to the bridge by their nature the tractibles passed delicately over the landscape it took a great deal of mechanical effort to flatten a patch of grass much less to clear away tangled undergrowth she would have to proceed more carefully here the excursion suits membrane was strong enough to resist tearing under any ordinary circumstance but a sharp enough pressurea knife blade with some strength behind it a large predators claws or a fall from a heightmight open a seam she doubted she would have trouble with knives as for predators the tractibles and insect remensors would watch out for her and in any case these rocky foothills were not as inviting a hunting ground as the savanna that stretched to the south and west triraptors were dangerous but uncommon here the smaller faster carnivores were about the size of house cats and easily frightened away from something as large and unfamiliar as a human being that was perhaps one reason the digger colony had thrived here and as for heightswell she would be reluctant to press far beyond the diggers rangeland into the hills where the copper river ran in narrow fast channels among slatesharp rocks short of that she was confident of her footing what was left to fear any often thousand unsuspected events zoe thought not to mention her own state of mind not that she felt bad the opposite her moods had been mercurial but right now she felt surprisingly good felt solid walking in the sunlight and swinging her arms with a freedom she hadnt felt since creche the trail followed a low ridge eastward when the ridge rose high enough she was able to see the canopy of the forest sloping to the west as dense and close as a wellkept secret all of this touched hershe didnt have a better wordin a way she had thought impossible as if when she left yambuku she had not donned a protective membrane but stripped one away she was as raw as a nerve the simple blue sky made her want to weep with joy she could think of no explanation for these mood shifts unless she was deregulating could that be but thymostats were simple homeostatic machines she had never heard of a bioregulator malfunction anyway wouldnt it have shown up on her medical telemetry doesnt matter some traitorous part of her whispered she was alivetruly alive for the first time in many yearsand she liked it liked it almost as much as she feared it she halted well before dusk at one of the potential campsites mapped into the tractibles memory the ridgetop broadened here into a stony plateau tufts of green succulents poking through the topsoil between slabs of glacial rock pitching the tent was easy the tent was smart enough to do most of the work itselfbut anchoring it proved more difficult she drove stakes into stony cracks and soilfilled hollows tethering her shelter the oldfashioned way she queried yambuku for a weather report but nothing had changed since this morning skies clear winds calm isis was showing her gentle aspect she checked in with dieter after a hasty meal no real news dieter said except that this avrion theophilus the devices and personnel mystery man was due down on the next shuttle theo at yambuku zoe thought given her mood she guessed that should have made her happy she wondered why it didnt the sun drifted behind the copper mountains zoe finished the ungainly process of eating through the excursion suit and was ready to make another assault on the citadel of sleep when an alert popped into her corneal display the voice of yambuku this time was lee reisman who had taken over the shift from dieter we have a large animal on your perimeter lee said then oh its a digger she was instantly alert is it approaching the tent no according to the remensors its holding about a hundred yards off your location tractibles are positioned to intercept it but leave it alone for now zoe said zoe this isnt an appropriate time to initiate contact i just want a look she climbed out of the tent her vision augmented in the deepening dusk slate rocks radiated the days heat like embers she had thought the digger might be hard to see but she spotted it at once and increased the amplification in her membrane lenses accordingly itmake that hewas already a familiar presence this was the digger hayes had called old man she recognized the white whiskers the splay of tendrils under its eyes she looked at old man and old man looked back at her it was of course impossible to read any emotion into that face as much as the human mind wanted to try we project ourselves onto other animals zoe thought we see expression in the faces of cats and dogs but the digger was as inscrutable as a lobster the eyes she thought on any creature larger than a beetle the eyes are the primary vehicle of expression but the diggers eyes were simple black ovals in a bed of bony flesh bubbles of ink windows through which some dim notquitesentience regarded her coolly old man she whispered the curious one old man blinkeda flash of silver over shimmering black then turned and loped away thirteen what hayes had not told zoe was that cascading seal failures had kept him busy most of the day he could not help wishing that mac feya were still here to lend a handmac had been good at patching seals barring the one that had killed him lee sharon and kwame were more than competent engineers but they were overtaxed and running on minimum sleep for now the situation had been stabilizedreplacement seals installed and samples from the failed gaskets gloveboxed for analysis hayes had been following the work closely dieter franklin took hayes into his laboratory to look at adaptive changes in the bacteria feeding on the gaskets the increasing density of fibrillary matter in the body of the cell microtubules coiled like dna where a month ago there had been only a few stray threads the granular bodies on the cell surface were also novel synthesizing and excreting highly polar molecules digging into their environment dieter waved a hand at the screen he had called up its not the same organism we were looking at six months ago same genome hayes said same organism same genome but its expressing itself in a radically different way so its environmentally sensitive at the very least might as well say its trying to pry open the station and come inside dieter was gamma stone clan given to overstatement if theyre growing its because were feeding them theyre dying as fast as they grow true enough hayes had spent his share of time in excursion gear scrubbing decayed bacterial mats from the stations exposed surfaces kamikaze bacteria i dont think they literally want to kill us dieter that might be a dangerous assumption to make hayes was famous for the hours he kept people said he never slept lately that had been all too true he had personally supervised much of zoes ongoing excursion not to mention coordinating the seal repairs and a complete changeover on one of the big filter stacks he was averaging four or five hours of sleep per night and was often grateful to get that much sleep deprivation had left him testy and hypersensitive for the first time in his life he envied the terrestrial hands who wore thymostats he had to make do with caffeinated drinks and willpower the poor mans equivalent it was late when he left dieter franklins laboratory almost everyone but the graveyard shift had retired for the night at night the station seemed both too large and too smallthe echo of his footsteps came back to him as if from a vast space but the sound was flat contained a dosed space every avenue a dead end yambuku had never seemed so fragile his research notes lay untouched in his cabin he was tempted to go there now but a last task awaited him one he had been putting off this terrestrial d p kacho was due down in the morning and would need fresh quarters but there was only one vacancy at yambuku and that was the cabin elam mather had occupied cleaning it out for avrion theophilus was a simple enough chore no one on isis owned anything substantial the joke was you came to isis the way you came into the world naked and afraid and left the same way elam had left rather differently but she had taken nothing with her still the sheets needed to be laundered and the wall screens cleared of personal displays small work but not work he relished nor could it be delegated when a hand died the station manager always cleared the cabin he had done the same thing for mac feya any old hand would it was one of the few customs the isis project had developed he let himself into the cabin with his master key elams desk light winked on as he stepped inside then so did the wall screena live image of isis relayed from orbit was this how elam had liked to imagine herself out of the toxic bios above it all or had she simply preferred to take the long view he switched off the screen and dumped elams preferences back into the station pool then he collected and folded her sheets and took the issue garments from her shelves all were of the uniform ultralight charcoalcolored cloth imported from earth he put them outside the door for a tractible robot to pick up elams laundry would cycle interchangeably through the yambuku housekeeping system in a day or two he might be sleeping on one of these same sheets last he used his scroll to open elams personal memory cache in yambukus core memory mac had left his filestack full of random notes to himself letters home indecipherable notes elam was tidier than that likely all that remained to be cleared would be lists schedules and access numbers but when he asked for a global delete one item came up redtagged it was a message unfinished and it was addressed to him tam currently skimming over the ocean on the way to meet freeman li realized we hadnt had an opportunity to talk lately can we get together as soon as im back until then some thoughts no doubt you remember when i told you to steer clear of zoe fisher maybe i was wrong shows how much my motherly advice is worth i guess there is something special about that girl i agree but you have to understand tam her specialness makes her dangerous maybe very dangerous and yes i know shes innocent of any personal scheming just as obviously though shes a tool in some complicated devices and personnel power play this is bad news for her god knows and might be trouble for you too given the interest youve taken in her please dont be naive the trust uses people like zoe fisher the way you and i use toilet paper the only thing that protects us here is distance and even that might not protect us much longer isis isnt a republic its a trust property never forget that this avrion theophilus is suddenly on a cargo manifest from earth part of a planor worse a plan gone wrong watch out for him tam trust families dont send a fancy cousin like that on such a dangerous journey unless the stakes are very very high maybe he only wants to make sure zoe succeedsthat the excursion gear functions as promisedbut even if thats so it means there must be equally powerful people who want her to fail but here is the truly troublesome news i think zoes bloodware has been tampered with last night i found her in the cargo hold about an hour after midnight she thought she was alone and she was crying quiet helpless baby tearsyou know the kind i mean when i asked her what was wrong she blushed and mumbled something about a nightmare what struck me was the way she said it trying to sound casual obviously attempting to brush me off but weirdly sincere too as if a nightmare was a completely novel experience something she had only read about in books which it might well be given her d p background ask yourself tam why should a highly regulated bottle baby like zoe fisher suddenly suffer from nightmares or fall in love come to that after i calmed down zoe and chased her back to bed i woke up shel kyne shel is a competent physician but hes irredeemably terrestrial he didnt even wonder why i was asking all these questions about zoes bloodwarejust trotted out her charts miffed at the hour but happy to be consulted i dont know about you red thorns but among rider clan the unwarranted sharing of medical information is grounds for summary disenfranchisement earthlings i asked first whether emotional instability might be a sign of a failing thymostat yes shel tells me thats certainly possible though thymostatic disequilibrium can be subtle at the beginning emotional volubility doesnt usually show up until some weeks or even months after the thymostat switches off so i asked him is there anything wrong with zoes regulator he smiled and said he didnt know apparently zoe is loaded with novel bloodware most of it in germed gland sacs clustered around the abdominal aorta these devices are so newfangled that shels instruments wont read them and d p didnt send blueprints the most shel can do is monitor her metabolites for the major neurotransmitters and regulatory chemistry zoes serotonin dopamine norepinephrine and substance p do look a little odd apparently and shes negative for most of the common reuptake inhibitors but her regulatory bloodware is so unusual that shel cant decide if this is appropriate functioning or a major malfunction shel suggested we ask avrion theophilus about it when he arrives i lied and said i would i also advised shel to keep quiet about it until i spoke to him again you might want to edit his reports to the ios in the next little while so what does this mean it means i suspect that zoe is off her thymostat maybe for the first time in her life in kuiper terms shes practically a newborn a whole battery of new and difficult emotions to cope with and she doesnt understand any of it the zoe fisher youre so obviously falling in love with tam is a brandnew zoe fisher fragile probably scared and trying very hard to do the job shes been trained for i cant tell you what to do about any of this i dont know my only useful advice keep your eyes open watch your back ill do the same im saving this into my personal memory because i dont want it drifting through yambuku cyberspace if all goes well we can talk in person as soon as im back elam ps of course she likes you you idiot many of us do myself included were you too dense to notice or too polite to let on idle curiosity hayes read the message then he read it again enclosed in the silence of what had once been flams cabin as night rolled over the long valleys and the canopied hills fourteen when the redlight summons from the shuttles quarantine module appeared on his scroll corbus nefford was mildly scandalized there had never been a medical crisis aboard the ios during his healthmanagement watch and he fully intended that there never would be admittedly this didnt look goodan unexplained summons of the highest priority posted by ken kinsolving daywatch quarantine medic from the shuttlebay lockdown dire as that sounded however it was probably only kinsolving panicked by some crewmans gastritis attack or tension headache the alternative was unthinkable but he found a guard stationed at the shuttle modules bulkhead door and inside inside there was chaos two nursing assistants sat plugged into remensor hoods talking through their microphones in low urgent tones kinsolving gaunt in his drapery of medical whites waved nefford toward an empty control bay rios and soto are dead he said flatly raman is comatose and mavrovik is intermittently lucid we need help with palliative care and tissue samplesif you would manager kinsolving was a junior medic and not entitled to speak to corbus nefford quite so brusquely but this was an emergency after all nefford squirmed into the remensor chair he had put on some weight since the last time he operated one of these rigs but one did what one must what one was trained for and thank god for his training it supplanted the instinct to panic he imagined his thymostat registering the sudden torrents of epinephrine working to calm him without dulling his heightened alertness pathogens he found himself thinking isian pathogens aboard the ios it was the nightmare he had hoped never to face the remensor hood activated and he was suddenly inside the quarantine room with the victims his arms had become the arms of a medical tractible and his eyes were its enhanced sensors he oriented himself quickly the quarantine chamber was claustrophobically small never meant to be used as a hospital ward tractibles and remensors battled for floor space kinsolvings remensor rolled up next to him he identified the shuttle crewmen on their cots mavrovik soto raman and rios two male two female they had been the sole survivors of the oceanic disaster a pilot and three crewmen who had shuttled up from the outpost shortly before its final collapse and they had brought something with them apparently although they had been in quarantine with no observable ill effects for what was it most of a month now and didnt isian pathogens attack almost instandy an isian infectious agent with a long incubation period was unheard ofa threat almost too terrifying to contemplate he followed kinsolvings medical remensor to the bedside of the shuttle pilot mavrovik kinsolving had plugged fluids and hemostats into mavroviks exposed arm nefford added a pulmonary tap to drain blood and fluid from the pilots lungs mavrovik had been disrobed and strapped to the cot beads of sweat putrid and faintly yellow trickled down his shaved skull to his pillow what kinsolving had achieved here was a momentary homeostasis nefford plugged his own monitors into the shuttle pilot as the dayshift medic began to transfer control when a moment of peace presented itself he asked how long have they been ill first obvious symptoms manifested about three hours ago we had no real warning their blood gasses looked peculiar prior to that but still within normal limits nefford turned to watch as two tractibles shifted the stiffening bodies of rios a woman and soto a man onto gurneys and wheeled them out of the room there was a coldstorage facility with an autopsy chamber deep inside the quarantine boundary staffed of course entirely by tractibles and remensors the morgue was carefully maintained although it hadnt been used before today when he turned back he found mavroviks eyes open both pupils grossly dilated sweating inside his remensor hood nefford scrolled a survey of the patients vital signs the list was appalling gross edema internal bleeding as tissues softened catastrophically kidneys necrotizing liver function fading pulse erratic blood pressure so uncertain that even the hemostatic robots could barely maintain an acceptable count bottom line mavrovik was dying in a hurry kinsolving wheeled back his tractible arms going limp as he disengaged from the remensor hood do what you can for him he said flatly ill speak to degrandpre better you than me nefford thought he assumed full lifesupport function as kinsolvings medical remensor fell silent mavrovik was briefly stabilized but that wouldnt last the trouble was nefford had no effective treatment for this disease whatever it wasonly palliatives only bags of fresh artificial blood and coagulent nanobacters to seal the worst of the internal lesions all useless in the long run mavrovik was being devoured by an entity nefford could not even name and soon enough it would do irreparable damage to mavroviks heart or brain and that would be that as if he had overheard the thought mavrovik gasped suddenly and surged against his restraints nefford flinched fortunately his remensor ignored hasty autonomic impulses or he might have ripped an intravenous line out of the patient how i must look to him nefford thought a robotic head a cows skull dipped in chromium peering at him through ruby lenses but mavroviks eyes had closed his lips moved but he was talking to someone not present who are you the pilot demanded weakly his throat thick with bloody granulae be still nefford said corbus neffords voice was relayed with ultimate fidelity through the remensor that much of his bedside manner at least intact he added a tranquilizer to the broth of chemicals in the shuttle pilots drip but mavrovik would not be tranquil look at them his lips were flecked with blood look at them calm down mr mavrovik dont speak conserve your strength so many of them nefford sighed and tightened the restraints this might be was probably mavroviks final crisis he pushed the flow of opiates talking all talking together corbus nefford had not been in the presence of a dying man since his medical apprenticeship in paris death was the business of hospices and peasant medics not of successful family physicians he had forgotten how hairraising the process could be he peeled back mavroviks left eyelid expecting to find the pupil fixed and dilated instead the pupil contracted promptly at the light then mavroviks right eye opened and the pilot looked at nefford with a sudden frightening lucidity you have to understand this mavrovik said he rasped the words through a lace of bloody sputum like a dead man talking nefford thought well close enough there are thousands of them hundreds of thousands talking to each other talking to me nefford felt trapped by the sheer earnestness of this declamation he was aware of the patients plummeting vascular pressure capillaries weakened by the disease bleeding out in a massive wholebody collapse mavroviks face was banded with blue and black as if he had been beaten with a stick the whites of his eyes were shot through with scarlet mavroviks brain must be bleeding too nefford thought this monologue could hardly be sane but he heard himself ask thousands of what mr mavrovik worlds mavrovik said gently now as if to himself corbus nefford did not of course believe in ghosts he was a technician of the familiesin his own way a scientist only low people and peasants were frightened of ghosts or spirits nefford was frightened only of the trusts he had seen the damage they could inflict nevertheless he found himself regarding the dying man with something approaching superstitious dread mavrovik laugheda terrible sound it brought up bubbles of pink fluid robotic aspirators sucked his mouth and throat clean his arms flexed against his restraints as if he wanted to reach up to grasp neffordneffords remensorand draw him closer horrible thought were their orphans mavrovik explained his last words raman died too more quietly at about the same time with the deaths the quarantine room grew calmer though frantic activity continuedthe drawing of blood and tissue samples the containment of the bodies periodic cloudbursts of liquid sterilants and gases when mavroviks corpse was finally bagged and taken away nefford allowed himself to draw a long breath he wheeled his remensor back into its dock and removed himself from the hood he had been with the remensor so long that his own body felt clumsy and unfamiliar he had been sweating freely his clothing was soaked he recoiled at his own stink he wanted a long drink of water and a hot bath probably he should have been hungry he had missed breakfastbut the thought of food was repellent he found kinsolving waiting for him near the bulkhead door nefford asked did you talk to degrandpre i paged his scroll paged his scroll an event like this called for a personal conference nefford would have done it himself if he hadnt been busy with mavrovik manager degrandpre was already aware of the emergency i asked to meet with him but he had already issued an order expanding the perimeter of the quarantine kinsolving delivered this information meekly as if he expected to be beaten for it expanding the perimeter i dont understand quarantine extends all the way to the bulkhead doors the entire module is sealed tight kinsolving bowed his head no one is allowed to leave until further notice and that includes us fifteen the dreams were very badrain came down on the polyplex shelter in drumming bursts wind gusts confused the support tractibles which woke zoe periodically with false alarms misinterpreting the whipping wind as the movement of some ghostly predator zoe fell in and out of shallow sleep she was of course still alone she was as alone as the first lungfish to drag itself out of the shallows and that should have been all right the men and women who first sailed to the reefs of the solar system squandering their lives inside lightless ice caverns they had been alone too but isolation meant many things zoe had known people who longed for isolation and people who dreaded it on earth a person was never truly alone and it was easy to project a whole spectrum of fears and hopes into that unobtainable void a vacuum full of self it meant freedom or shamelessness or absolution or the simple loss of all direction fantasies alone zoe thought is listening to this rain batter the small membrane between herself and toxic nature alone meant memories swollen into nightmares in her dreams she was in tehran according to the trust doctors these memories had been safely buried but whatever was wrong with her seemed to have let slip the leash whenever she closed her eyes the awful images came roaring back the orphan creche was a cinderblock dungeon spread across acres of oily gravel and ringed with lethal glasswire fences it was like most of the charity creches scattered across asia and europe a leftover from the plague century it might once have been a humanitarian project one of the great social works of the first trusts but it had become little more than a collector for the state brothels lately its resident managers had realized that they could expand their personal profit margin by renting their charges on the public market or at least that segment of the market too impoverished or ill to patronize the licensed pleasuredromes the drawback was that the inmates at the tehran west quad educational collectiveas the sign above the gate proclaimed it werent offered the kind of medical supervision required even in a bargainbasement licensed brothel nor were its customers mainly manual laborers from the local trust factories ringing the city carefully screened zoe had arrived with her pod of genetically identical sisters francesca and poe and a vita and lin shipped from their birth creche by orbital cargo transport hungry and bewildered at first the farsispeaking nurse had fed them protein soups and dressed them in warm if graceless smocks and patiently endured their demands for home but after a day or two of this they were transferred to the dormitories and the horror began memory swept through zoes dreams like a winter gale everyone was used and everyone died francesca died first of a fever that wracked her body for five long february days until she turned her emaciated body to the cinderblock wall and simply ceased to breathe this is wrong zoe remembered herself thinking we were made to go to the stars this is wrong poe and lin died together when a fierce hemorrhagic contagionthe nurses called it brazzaville which it may have been swept the dormitories zoe in her despair had not felt much grief at the passing of three of her sisters she was selfishly grateful that the brothel trade had diminished out of fear of the plague unfortunately the food supply had diminished too and that wasnt good there had been talk of quarantine the whole west quarter of the city was practically deserted for the next six months but the disease passed in time zoe and avita were among the souls not harvested zoe grew closer to her only remaining pod sister and it affected her more powerfully when avita died almost randomly of some disease born of malnutrition and neglect she is my mirror zoe thought gazing at avitas corpse during the long hours before the hygiene crew came to collect it when i die zoe thoughtand she had supposed it would be a matter of months at mostwhen i die this is how i will look like a soft clay statue pale and shiny and indifferent she missed avita and francesca and lin and poe the other inmates were often cruel to her and her whitemasked minders casually despised her and she thought death might not be so terrible really certainly no worse than living on and on inside these walls then theo came to tehran something had happened something political something in the high families she remembered avrion theophilus from the creche he had stopped by once a month to survey the pods and he had been partial to the five small sisters often stroking zoes hair while the nannies ducked their heads at him and dullwitted tractibles brought him tea and sugar cakes which he shared he had always looked so resplendent in his black uniform and he looked resplendent now in tehran but darker angrier shouting at the orphan keepers who cringed away from him he cursed the obscenties of the dormitory the frigid showers the assignation rooms with their coarse and filthy blankets he swept zoe up into his armscautiously because she had become fragile his uniform pressed against her cheek smelled of fresh laundry of soap and steampressing she thought of him as a kind of king or prince of course he was nothe was only peripherally of the families at all a cousins nephews cousin essentially a high functionary with the devices and personnel branch of the trusts he was a theophilus not a melloch or a quantrill or a mitsubishi but that didnt matter he had come to get her too late for poe or lin or avita or francesca but not too late for zoe one of my girls survived he murmured carrying her out into a human services mobile chnic one of my girls survived when he tried to hand her to the doctors she clung to him so fiercely that she had to be sedated zoe woke abruptly numb with dread there had been a sound but it was only a rattle of thunder bouncing between the peaks of the high coppers locally the rain had slowed to a drizzle dim light came through the polyplex shelter morning she felt shaky and tired she opened the shelter and climbed out into the rain water sheeted off the granite outcrops and drenched the blades of the gorselike plants that grew in the deep glacial scars packmule tractibles lurched comically about the campsite their legs found little purchase in the wet periodically they folded their limbs and sat down like weary dogs clouds tumbled up the coppers in gusting billows the forest steamed she selected a ration dispenser from the store aboard a nearby tractible and carried it back under cover the rain had beaded on her excursion suit she itched the membrane kept her clean even shuttled flakes of dead skin to its surface and shed them as sterile dust nevertheless she itched the itch was intermittent confined to her ribs and thighs and was not a real problemyet but if it got worse well people had been known to claw themselves bloody in order to a cure an itch which under the circumstances wouldnt do it wouldnt do at all eating was a chore the ration tube had to be attached to the excursion suits face mask which opened a sterile passage between mouth and foodagonizingly slowly she compressed the ration tube by hand the nutrient paste that oozed onto her tongue was fundamentally unappetizing and as perfectly textureless as mud and never enough to convince her she had really eaten the rations also tended to pass through her body quickly which presented her with another tedious and unpleasant problem by the time she finished with all this the sky had begun to clear the wind had grown gusty again however it dragged at the polyplex fabric and would no doubt be making life difficult for the robots and remensors she thought about calling yambuku her checkin was due she thought about theo of how he had saved her from the orphan ranch memories that had tumbled through her dreams like broken glass and her inexplicable dread of him she linked to yambuku for her daily update and spoke briefly to cai connor who was manning the excursion desk no news and stay put the winds would diminish overnight and then she could reconnoiter the digger colony before heading back which was fine but it left her with nothing to do except monitor her own telltales watch the cumulus clouds writhe up the distant peaks and functiontest the packmule tractibles she didnt look forward to another night of darkness that afternoon tam hayes contacted her by narrowbeam transmission from yambuku that was odd the tightbeam antenna was a lastditch redundancy limited to line of sight and narrow in bandwidth clunky voiceonly like an antique telephone line this is off the record hayes began nobodys eavesdropping and nothing we say goes into the stations memory zoe are you in a safe place im in the shuttle bay i dont have a remensor view sitting in the shelter waiting for the wind to drop good we have a lot to talk about you start zoe said he began by reading her the contents of elam mathers message zoe had entertained some of these suspicions herself about the thymostat anyway but it must have been functioning when i left phoenix the medical surveillance was extremely tight she thought of anna chopra the terrestrial physician who had presided over her health during the long prelaunch months a tall woman grayhaired a nonfamily functionary from djakarta was it grim and wordless and quite dedicated maybe an act of sabotage hayes suggested some family turf war working itself out maybe but family feuds were seldom so subtle an accident more likely the point is hayes went on you shouldnt be out there by yourself with a dead stat if thats all you wanted to say you could have said it wideband thought you might want to keep this private meaning you think i might want to stay this way unregulated like a kuiper woman he left a silence in the distance between them yes he said at last maybe its your call of course zoe my call she thought my choice but it begged too many questions the thymostat regulated personality am i the same person i was three months ago so hard zoe thought to hold yourself in your hand weigh yourself render a judgment she felt better she felt worse she said to hayes you must have suspected something from time to time but im red thorn we dont wear thymostats and ive never been sure what to expect from people who do elams been to earth she had better instincts there are different kinds of thymostats mainly they regulate mood but mine did more than that tam it suppressed unpleasant memories it also displaced sexual impulses and directed that energy into my work but youre functioning without it she reminded herself that no one could hear her no one but tam i feel like im on the edge all the time sleep is disturbed i have mood swings sometimes this whole excursion seems futile and dangerous sometimes im afraid another long pause wind rattled the shelter zoe we have medical spares we can fix you up no i dont want that youre certain im not certain of anything but i dont want to go back to being what i was what i was for theo what i was for the trusts hayes said ill do everything in my power to keep this quiet the risk is that avrion theophilus will look at your medical telemetry and figure it out for himself better that than facing him zoe thought one look at me and he would know he would see it in my eyes in any case youre in no shape to spend another day in the field i want you back here where i can look after you no zoe said id rather finish this its not just the stat i want you back here in case were forced to evacuate evacuate yambuku tam is it that bad things change quickly he described a series of cascading seal failures and filterstack problems everything crumbling zoe thought everything falling apart give me a day to think about it its another days worth of risk nothing we do here is safe give me a day tam you dont have to prove anything just a day a fresh torrent of rain battered the shelter she imagined the tractibles squatting miserably in the open did tractibles experience misery did their sealed joints ache in the cold zoe i have an alert here well talk again soon she hoped in the absence of his voice she felt doubly alone the squalls abated over the course of the day followed by a cooling breeze from the west zoe had seen all sorts of isian weather from the protected core of yambuku but you had to be outside exposedto appreciate the substance of the weather its moods and subtleties or maybe the failure of her thymostat had made her more sensitive more vulnerable was this how the unregulated masses experienced the world everywhere she looked zoe seemed to find some shadow or echo of herself in the tossing of the trees the cascade of rainwater from leaf to leaf in the cloudy daylight on the gorse the sparkle of mica in ancient rocks mirrors were not born with souls zoe thought they invade us from outside make themselves out of shadow and light noon and midshe wondered whether theo had arrived from orbit yet whether he was already deconning at yambuku did theo have a soul had a soul ever colonized the perfect body of avrion theophilus she scouted her perimeter during the long afternoon ranging within a kilometer of the digger colony though she saw none of the animals she avoided their foraging territory and their funerary grounds she didnt want to alarm them only perhaps leave a trace of her scent a token of her presence she arrived back at camp well before sunset with her escort of spidery tractibles trailing behind her the machines were mudspattered and streaked with yellow pollen one of them lagged badly it had developed a limp settled into her shelter for the night she scrolled her own medical telemetry past her corneal display and requested an analgesic from the medical packmule to treat her various aches and itches high particulate content in the airfrom forest fires in the far westmade the sunset long and gaudy zoe entered a few notes into her excursion log made routine contact with yambuku and tried once more to sleep an alert roused her just past midnight tams voice was in her ear as she sat up into the disorienting darkness zoe yes im here let me find a light she found and activated the tiny photostorage cell next to her bedroll a firefly lamp they called it about as bright hayes went on we have majormalfunction tags on five of your tractiblestwo of the packmules and three of the perimeter surveillors something attacked them apparently just mechanical interrupts but it cant be coincidental im worried about the level of protection youre getting hardware malfs youre sure nutsandbolts failures ill fetch the repair kit and turn on some field lamps where are the tractibles now on your doorstep we brought them in as soon as they began to complain but zoe were getting strange telemetry from the remaining surveillors company hard to say nothing big we have remensors covering for the robots but i want you to be careful the air outside was crisp and moist a few stars adorned the sky that nondescript one high in the northern quarter was sol if zoe remembered her isian constellations correctly cronos rode the hazy horizon camp lights flared on momentarily blinding her she drew a deep breath the filter of her excursion suit sterilized the ambient air but didnt warm it a breath of isis cooled her throat she retrieved a tool kit from one of the damaged packmule tractibles and scrolled the machines telltales her corneal display listed multiple joint dysfunctions a lubricant problem perhaps she disassembled a ballandsocket connector and found it fouled with what looked like mustardyellow slime something got into the joint she told hayes something biological it must be eating the teflons there was no immediate answer she wiped the joint clean with an absorbent cloth and locked it back into place a temporary fix at best but maybe she could patch one or two tractibles well enough to get herself and her essential equipment back to yambuku heads up zoe she looked up sharply the field lamps cast a searing white radiance all around her a glow that faded into the dark of the forest beyond the meadow she shaded her eyes and scanned the perimeter recognizable shapes began to disentangle themselves from the darkness diggers had surrounded the clearing they stood at the perimeter of the meadow spaced maybe five meters aparttwenty or more of them some on four legs some reared back on their hind pair a few were armed with firehardened spears their black eyes glittered in the harsh light her first reaction was fear her pulse ramped up and her palms began to sweat these were animals after all like the hons she had once seen in a trust preserve but larger and vastly more strange cunning unpredictable the hint of intelligence that had made them seem so nearly human was less endearing in this windy darkness there was intelligence here certainly but also a host of instincts purely isian purely unfathomable thank god they werent advancing maybe the camp lights had attracted them though what if those lights failed what if a new set of malfunctions brought the full weight of the dark down on her or maybe these fears were a product of her thymostatic disorder systems failing inside and out zoe thought but i was made for this i was made for this theyre aware of me now as i am aware of them we see each other hayes voice erupted in her ear stay still zoe and well send one of the surviving tractibles into the forest maybe draw their attention away from you we have remensors nearby but the wind is making it hard to keep them airborne no no tam dont excuse me theyre not hostile you cant know that im not under attack something like this had to happen sooner or later but not tonight and youre coming home tomorrow tam i may not get another chance this is their first reallife encounter with a human being most likely theyll look me over for a while and just get bored keep the functioning tractibles ready but dont make enemies im not proposing to slaughter them zoe just wait movement on the perimeter zoe turned her head one of the diggers had stepped out of rank its gait was twolegged forelimbs raised a fightorflight posture it carried a sturdy branch in one hand it stepped closer to the polyplex shelter until zoe recognized the array of white whiskers around the animals muzzle its old man zoe quiet the moment was fragile zoe stood slowly from the place where she had crouched beside the tractible and took an infinitesimal step of her own toward old man what must he think i am an animal an enemy a freakish reflection of himself she held out her armsempty hands weaponless and clawless hayes must have had at least one remensor nearby because he had seen the motion too three meters zoe closer than that i herd him away if any of the rest of them move i want you next to the shelter where we can protect you understand she understood too much she understood that she had reached her destiny point that time and the circumstances of her life had conspired to bring her to this place for one ecstatic moment she was the axis on which the stars revolved she took several bold steps forward the digger reared up like a startled centipede its black eyes rolled in their sockets zoe slowed but didnt stop she kept her hands in front of her still a judicious distance from the animal but close enough to smell it close enough to see the steam rising from its warm underbelly into the night air four billion years of unearthly evolution had shaped this aggregate of cells this beast she looked at it and amazingly it looked at her an impossible distance from the planet of her birth this miracle had happened clay had made life life regarded life first light zoe thought the digger was very quick it drew back the tree branch it was hefting before zoe could begin to flinch no not like this she thought it shouldnt be like this zoe hayes voice was distant and irrelevant no time to step back take shelter behind the tractibles the tractibles had begun to move but slowly more systems failing the digger raised its left upper forearm the club secure in its gripping hand she saw the downward swing of it with frozen clarity the impact blurred everything she fell through the windy night sixteen although he had prayed he would never have to do it containing biological contamination aboard the isis orbital station was the first task for which kenyon degrandpre had been trained the crisis and its thousand details occupied all his attention and that was infinitely better than allowing himself to consider the longterm consequences of the outbreak he summoned all five of the stations senior managers including leander of medical replacing the quarantined corbus nefford and sullivan of foodstuffs and biota they were a motley collation of trust outridersall of them competent managers none of them family except by the most distant and tenuous connection degrandpre himself had such a connection his maternal greatgrandfather had been a corbille but the birth was unregistered and hence irrelevant his first order of business had been to contain the quarantine pod and he had done that before today the ios had been a sterile zone isolated from isis by the hard vacuum beyond its walls now the ios was itself a breached environment an apple into which a dangerous worm had gnawed the isolation ward had become a level five hot zone contained on its perimeter by fiat level four zonesthese were the exterior medical chambers such as the one in which corbus nefford was currently trappedand by level one two and three precautionary zones beyond that ie the engineering pod and a maintenance space where turing assemblers were prepared for launch the problem was there was very little redundancy aboard the ios the size and weight restrictions imposed by the mechanics of the higgs launches narrowed the margin of error to a fine line even at peak efficiency the ios had always been one or two critical failures away from wholesale shutdown without the machine shop and with access restricted to the turing launchers but no that was tomorrows problem solen of engineering said were looking at how to relocate critical functions as far as possible from the hot pod the farms thank god are about as far from quarantine as you can get a hundred eighty degrees of the circle were setting up a temporary clinic for injuries outside the agriculture perimeter disease cases if any go directly to the quarantine perimeter degrandpre pictured the ios in his mind a necklace of ten gray pearls spinning in a void no nine gray pearls and one black infected infectious he would have to move his own quarters closer to the farms certainly the new turing gens would have to wait it meant another delay for the d p interferometer project but that was unavoidable the grand plan to use isis as a staging base for further higgs launches depended on a stable isian outpostto be defended at all costs without the ios degrandpre thought the trusts will lose the stars at least for the foreseeable future his most immediate problem though was not contagion but fear the fact of the outbreak in quarantine could hardly be hidden from the fifteenhundredplus crew of the orbital station each of whom was painfully aware of being locked in a metal canister without plausible hope of escape an emergency higgs launch solen told him blandly would save ten or twelve people depending on their combined mass motivate your workers degrandpre said but dont terrify them emphasize that these are extraordinary precautions were taking that there has been no contamination outside the quarantine chamber leander of medical said they know that manager but they also have the example of the ground stations before them the suspicion is that once contamination occurs theres no certain way to contain it tell them were talking about one organism here not the whole isian biosphere one organism is that true possibly keeping order is more important than telling the truth the meeting moved on briskly working through degrandpres prepared agenda so far so good the contagion had been contained food and water supplies were safe and other essential functions remained in good shape the ios was still a safe environment what had been stolen from them by the event in quarantine was their sense of security we have always been fragile degrandpre thought but never as fragile as now degrandpre ordered his communications manager to stay behind when the others left i want all outbound messages routed through my office for approval including routine housekeeping lets not alarm the trusts prematurely the communications manager a bony terrestrial woman named nakamura shifted her weight uncomfortably thats highly unusual she saidletting him know degrandpre supposed that she wouldnt cover for him if the trusts eventually brought a complaint young woman he thought that is the least of your problems he noted her objection and dismissed her there was nothing here the families needed to know at least not right away above all else the trusts feared the consequences of importing an isian pathogen to earth alarm them and the trusts might well impose an extended quarantine or even refuse to dock a higgs module returned from isis leaving the survivors to drift until they starved degrandpre didnt relish the prospect of becoming one more frozen planetisimal entombed in a sort of artificial kuiper body a cometary mausoleum arcing through endless orbits of the sun h e spoke to corbus nefford through a video link the stations chief physician was clearly frightened his uniform was ringed with perspiration his face was pale and doughy his eyes perpetually too wide degrandpre imagined the mans thymostat pressed to its limits synthesizing regulatory molecules at a feverish pitch its absurd nefford insisted at a time like this that i should be confined here i dont doubt it corbus but thats the way the containment protocols are written written by pedantic theorists who obviously dont understand written by the trusts watch your language doctor neffords narrow eyebrows and small mouth contracted petulantly as if degrandpre thought someone had tightened his stitches the stations former managing physician seemed on the verge of tears not a good omen you dont understand these people died so quickly they died in quarantine yes yes but then you should be safe enough all i want is to put some distance between myself and the contamination is that so unreasonable everyone else is huddling near the gardens i understand why should i be used this way its not your decision doctor ive worked in clean environments all my life im a family physician i maintain health i dont perform autopsies im not accustomed to this degree of of nefford trailed off swiping his forehead on his sleeve the managing physician was sick with fear let it be fear degrandpre thought for once he envied his fathers stubborn faith a prophet to pray to here there was no prophet no mecca no jerusalem no paradise or forgiveness no margin of error only a devil and the devil was fecund the devil was alive seventeen the evacuation of marburg took a day and a half the field station was a twin of yambuku set deep in the lesser boreal continents temperate forest like yambuku it was situated in a cleared perimeter its rigorously sterile core contained inside layers of increasing biohazard its biologically hot outer walls were scrubbed daily by maintenance tractibles or should have beenlately the tractibles had begun to malfunction the bays were full of machinery demanding maintenance and bacterial films had compromised three of the stations exit locks when the shuttle dock seals began to show similar wear the station manshoe clan virologist named weber called for general evac the call was not wellreceived by the ios apparently marburgs shuttle would be routed to a secondary bay that was being set up for prolonged quarantine weber ascribed this to terrestrial paranoia though he feared it might signal something worse but there was no postponing the evac weber loved isis and had worked hard to make marburg a going concern but he was also a realist postpone the evacuation much longer and people would begin to die the oceanic station had already collapsed the isis polar station anchored in the glacial wasteland of the planets northern ice cap reported no significant problems and continued to operate on a daytoday basis yambuku however was on the brink of total breakdown avrion theophilus burst through the shuttlebay doors from decon brushed aside his courtesy detail and marched direcdy to yambukus remoteops room his fulldress devices and personnel uniform drew a few stares from the otherwise distracted downstation crew he was accustomed to that at least from the kuiperborn in civilization it would have been considered ridiculously gauche the peasants impulse to stare but yambuku wasnt civilization he found the station manager tam hayes coming off a long remensor session hayes looked groggy unshaven theophilus took him aside we need a place to talk i gather shes injured theophilus said it looks that way out of contact verbal contact certainly were still getting some telemetry but its intermittent the fault may be with our antenna array remensors are down too and the excursion tractibles are dead all of them but zoe is not no to the best of our knowledge zoe is not we have good telemetry up to the point at which she was attacked yes forwarded to earth forwarded to the ios at least degrandpre bottlenecks traffic to earth i wouldnt worry about that hayes blinked believe me thats not what im worried about have the satellites located her to within a meter of the digger colony but the atmospheres too cloudy for any kind of visual confirmation not good enough theophilus said they had come to the small shuttlecontrol chamber above the core it was occupied only during launchesa good place for a private conversation hayes was in a hurry to get back to the remoteops room zoe was alive and he meant to bring her back to yambuku right now avrion theophilus was only an obstacle and the mans peremptory manner made hayes clench his fists he said are you worried about zoe or about her excursion technology the technology has already proven itself dont you think the fact that she might yet be alive despite a wildanimal attack is evidence of that because if its zoe youre worried about it might be best if you let me get back to the business of bringing her home not all the novel technology is in her excursion suit dr hayes excuse me shes a package it isnt just the interface shes augmented internally do you understand she has an entirely artificial immune system riding on top of her natural immunity microscopic nanofactories stapled to her abdominal aorta if the suit is breached we need to know that theres much more we can learn from her even if she dies in the field youre saying she might survive even if the suit is breached for a time at least it might be difficult to retrieve her body given the situation here but if we can fuck you hayes said he didnt want to retrieve zoes body he had a better plan dieter franklin came into the staging bay as hayes was suiting up hayes standard bioarmor was clumsy and immense compared to the gear zoe had worn a sterile core wrapped in steel and flexiglass and nanofilters hayes had just sealed the massive leggings when the inner door slid open you cant be serious franklin said lee reisman said you were raving about an emergency excursion i told her you were smarter than that tell me i wasnt lying im bringing her back slow down a fucking minute and think about this youre planning to cross the copper river in a suit of armor that can sustain you for what two days maximumwhen its working properly and at a time when every piece of machinery weve sent into the field is either dead or failing and we cant even keep our own seals intact shes alive maybe injured if shes alive she needs a functioning ground station to come home to youre more useful to her here not out in the mud with a hot servomotor or worse dividing everybodys attention and costing us resources we cant afford i owe her nothing you owe her is worth suicide and thats what this is you know it odds are youll end up as a few kilograms of compost inside a broken steel shell and zoe will end up right where she is hayes wound a layer of insulation around his waist forcing himself to slow down do it right she was a fucking test platform dieter dandp doesnt give a shit about the diggers zoe thought she was here to do social studies but she was a test platform dieter franklin nodded slowly for the excursion suit elam suspected as much elam suspected but i knew franklin said nothing hayes tried to focus his attention on his armor working the procedures sealing bands of pneumostatic plastic over his rib cage he wished elam were here to read him his checklist you knew i saw all the dandp memos little communiques to the yambuku manager no details but enough that i should have realized it was her gear that mattered she was a nicking test platform dieter and i let her walk out there in all her glorious ignorance you need to think about this she has good gear but its not breachproof we cant be sure shes still alive next the soft inner helmet she has more than the suit shes been internally modified she has a heavily augmented immune system even if her suits damaged she might survive long enough for us to get her back here maybe long enough to save her life dieter franklin was silent for a time he said at last even so tam its a bad bet i know its a bad bet because yambuku wont be here much longer thats the obvious conclusion no one wants to draw look at the oceanic station look at marburg its the bios tam working out strategies learning how to corrupt our seals and our locks synthesizing solvents and spreading the knowledge sharing it somehow five years ago that biohazard armor was good enough to protect you today its the next best thing to fucking useless hayes toggled the atmosphere lock overhead a series of fans began to create positive pressure an alarm sounded dieter franklin fled the room hayes pulled on his helmet eighteen pain double vision zoe felt herself being dragged the heels of her boots bumping against impediments she was suffering from concussion she thought vaguely or worse from some cranial injury from which she wouldnt recover she smelled impossible things burning rubber ammonia rotting food and when she closed her eyes she saw pinwheels and flares i she was terribly nauseated but dared not vomit the excursion suit would process the mess but probably not before she choked to death she was awake or perhaps not consciousness ebbed time j passed in gusts like the wind she struggledbrieflywhen she realized the diggers were dragging her into one of their mounds away from starlight and firelight and into the rocky claustrophobic dark the mound entrance was narrow the diggers spindled their sickeningly mobile bodies and entered one at a time zoe was dragged by her extended arms helpless over the rocky hp and into a tunnel encrusted with digger excretions the air was thick with an unfamiliar stench spicy and foul at once like cardamom and rotted food she wondered if she would asphyxiate here in the dark and for the first time in her life zoe felt panic she had not panicked even in the cold dormitories of the orphan crib her thymostat had suppressed any violent emotion and left only a hollow pervasive sadness the aching knowledge of her captivity and abandonment what she felt now was worse there was no advantage to struggle but she felt she must struggle the need to fight obliterated thought became a madness rising out of the meat of her she tried to suppress the scream that rose from her chest but the effort was futile the scream erupted and continued without reason or volition she kicked and pulled at the coralsharp claws that held her wrists and ankles but these animals were complacently strong all light vanished there was only darkness now and compulsive motion and the enclosing walls of the tunnel and the sound of her sobbing she woke againalone exhausted beyond fear was she blind no it was only the darkness of the diggers mound above ground it might be noon or midnight here it was always dark but at least she was alone at least for now she moved stretched tentatively found a rocky ceiling just above her head too close to allow her to stand curving to armslength walls and a floor somehow softer but damper than the entrance tunnel had been the silence beat at her ears the only audible sounds were the rattle of her breath inside the suits filter and the rasp of her movements if she had a light but she did she did have a light several in fact the firefly lamps strapped to her tool belt the tool belt she had been using to mend the tractibles stupid stupid languishing in the blackness when she could have been seeing she fumbled at her belt almost fearfully and indeed some of the small lamps had torn away during her struggle but some of them remained as small as bullets and with an activator built into each base she extracted one and thumbed its switch the light it emitted was faint but welcome order was restored she was in a place with contours and dimensionsa rounded pressedearth hollow glistening with damp the floor was carpeted with a pale almost translucent growth through which small mandibled insects crawled and on the wall there was the gauzy nest of some spiderlike creature a mass of cottonfloss thread to which the mummified bodies of insects adhered the firefly lamp was good for an hour or two there were seven more remaining on her belt she counted them with her fingers she would have to be careful but of course she couldnt stay here she couldnt even if she wanted to no food no water she had some water reserves in her suit which would recycle her urine too but that was an open loop and good for maybe a day or two at most without exterior replenishment basically she needed to get to her base camp find food and water and maybe a working tractible then head back to yambuku resources zoe thought she was perhaps not thinking very clearly her head ached horribly where the digger had clubbed her and when she touched her temple she felt a plump bruise under the excursion suits membrane resources what did she have that she could use to her advantage telemetry communication the thought of talking to tam hayes was so enticing she almost wept but when she called up her corns protocol there was no carrier nothing from yambuku wide or narrowband which meant that her gear was damaged or theirs was or perhaps the digger mound was blocking radio transmissions she wondered then how far below the surface she had been carried she didnt knowno one knewhow deep these tunnels ran there had been a few seismicimaging experiments conducted by remotely operated tractibles near the digger mounds enough to suggest that the warrens were extensive and complexly interconnected the digging might have gone on for centuries might have reached down kilometers below the topsoil but no that was a bad thought impermissible she felt panic rising like a lump in her throat daylight might be a kilometer away but it also might be just an inch above this sealed chamber she had no way of knowing and she instructed herself not to think about it she held her breath for a moment and listened carefully was she alone a tunnel roughly as wide as her shoulders was the only entrance to this culdesac the firefly lamp would not illuminate that space beyond a meter or so she saw only that the tunnel was circular and that it rose at a gentle angle perhaps twenty degrees of slope listen she held herself still and tried to calm the pulsing of blood in her ears listen but the silence was absolute surely a digger traversing these tunnels would betray itself by the sound of its passage claws on soil packed as hard as rock there was no such sound good maybe it was daytime zoe thought and the diggers were outside gathering food she tried to scroll a clock but her corneal display seemed to be broken another effect of the blow to her head perhaps she hesitated for what might have been a moment or an hour eyeing the crawl space suspiciously reluctant to exchange this relatively spacious cell for the cramped enclosure of the tunnel but then the firefly lamp began to sputter and dim and anything zoe thought anything would be better than more darkness she plucked another lamp from her belt and struck it but it wouldnt light it was broken her fingers shook as she worked the next lamp free this one when she pressed it sprang brightly to life she sighed her relief but that left only five more lamps and none or all of them might have gone bad now zoe she thought go now she held the firefly lamp in her right hand and lay down on her stomach the albino moss felt cool beneath her suit membrane she would have to advance with her arms in front of her squirming more than crawling using her boots for traction and what if she lost herself in this maze what if all her firefly lamps burned out one by one could she even take another one from her belt in such a narrow space no she realized not without dislocating her shoulder she backed off removed her tool belt and slipped it over one shoulder that way she could reach the remaining lamps if need be five lamps say six or seven hours of light if they all worked and then another bad thought she put it out of her mind and squirmed once more into the tunnel there was just enough space for her to lift herself on her elbows and inch forward scrabbling with boots and knees in a sort of crabcrawl she was grateful for the ubiquitous pale moss beneath her it cushioned her knees and elbows where the vulnerable suit membrane might have torn or eroded the firefly lamp illuminated a narrow circular space perhaps a meter or two ahead of her i need a plan she thought perhaps she said some of this aloud she tried not to but the gap between thought and word had narrowed and she caught the occasional echo of her own hoarse whisper coming back to her out of the distance giving herself away she feared but still the animals hadnt returned a plan she thought again here was a maze and somewhere the minotaur she decided that whenever she came to a fork in the tunnel she would always take the path that led upward or if both paths were equivalent she would take the rightturning branch that way she would eventually reach the surface or at least be able but please dont let it happen to back out of a dead end and retrace her route she could do that she decided even if god forbid she used up all her lamps even in the dark she could do that the dark returned when her current lamp flickered and dimmed too soon surely how far had she come she couldnt guess a long way it seemed but not far enough the tunnel had not branched not even once or perhaps horrible thought the diggers made new tunnels and sealed old ones maybe she would reach a final wall and no bad thought she fumbled another firefly lamp into her hand and pressed the base to her immense relief it flickered to life another hour lost bad thought bad thought she had been imagining vividly what she would do when she got back to yambukupeel off her excursion membrane stand under a hot shower wash her hair eat drink sparkling water from tall crystal tumblerswhen she came to a branching tunnel the first or was it the first here in this small arc of light it was hard to estimate time to distinguish between events imagined and events actual she had planned this but had she already attempted it she didnt know nevertheless zoe thought stick to plan did the left branch show an upward slope or should she keep to the right hard to say she paused hoping to divine some clue was there a breath of wind either way there was not only the same stale stinking air hardly enough to fill her lungs no sound she thought perhaps the righthand tunnel rose ever so slightly and she turned in that direction running into theos arms one of my children survived running into tam hayes arms she woke hurting arms stiff legs stiff her head throbbing pressure all around her and blind no it was the dark the dark she had fallen asleep she cursed her carelessnesstime had been wastedand fumbled for the next firefly lamp she kept her eyes tightly closed as she worked her fingers because she couldnt see anything even if her eyes were open and because with her eyes closed the darkness felt like a choice her own chosen darkness not something imposed by the weight of clay and stone around her the warm darkness perhaps of sleep though she must not sleep again she scratched the lamp alight that was better only this endless tunnel to see but the light was a blessing she crawled ahead a few metersor maybe a lot of meters there were no references here any longer no time and no space she might have traveled a great distance already or she might be a scant few paces from her original culdesac bad thought the tunnel ahead of her began to widen this was change at last and the rush of hope she felt was intoxicating she cautioned herself against it but hope was like panic irrepressible a vast force no longer blocked by her thymostat the thymostat had been a kind of membrane too zoe thoughtlike her excursion suit another barrier between herself and the world shutting out the viruses of panic and hope and love and despair lost now she was naked and infected the tunnel continued to expand became a larger chamber she filled it with the sound of her labored breathing raised her hand and brought the light to bear lifted her eyes and saw a dead end another culdesac she let her tears flow freely for a few precious minutes the excursion suit she thought idiotically would recycle them she crawled back sobbing intermittently to the place where the tunnel branched how many lamps were left her memory was faulty she was compelled to stop and count the remaining lamps with her fingers one two three four which meant that hours had passed since she left the chamber where she had been abandoned she could even calculate the time she supposed if her mind were functioning a little more efficiently if she had not lost an eternity to sleep too much time in any case too much time spent doubling her tracks she thought of open air the memory was so vivid she could taste it and sky zoe thought yes and rain and wind she heard faint sounds at the tunnel intersection an exit missed the sound of outside but she had to be careful she controlled her breathing she put her head into the adjoining tunnel where the black eyes of a digger regarded her coolly she held on to the firefly lamp even as the digger scuttled after her and clutched her ankles she hadnt recognized the digger it wasnt old man absurd as that name was this was simply an animal or something as much insect as animal long and too lithe in the close confinement of the tunnel its thin body flexible huge black eyes queasily mobile in their sockets gripping claws tight as rings of tempered steel she was shocked that she had ever found anything even faintly reminiscent of the human about these creatures they were brutal but not even malevolent their minds worked in strange inhuman loops whatever motivated them she was opaque to it their realm was not her realm it dragged her into another culdesacno oh god the same one the one she had started from she recognized the web on the walland rolled her over on her back still she clutched the lamp a small spark of sanity the digger ignored it she closed her eyes opened them the digger loomed over her she supposed it was looking at her though its eyes were as blank as bubbles of oil she looked back at it beneath her panic was a grim and wholly unexpected calm an emotional deadness that was both relief and threat at once a premature deadness because she was almost certainly about to die the digger put one extended claw on her chest on her sternum above her breasts she felt the pressure of itenough to cause pain perhaps enough to draw blood then the digger began to slice at her excursion membrane peeling away the broken material like pale dead skin nineteen all roads lead to rome kenyon degrandpre thought and out here at the edge of the human diaspora he had become the embodiment of rome and down those roads marched all the bad news in the world rank on serried rank each new crisis demanded a fresh solution the written emergency protocols had proved woefully inadequate the evacuation of marburg for instance clearly the station manager was justified in calling the evac just as clearly degrandpre couldnt sacrifice much more of the limited space aboard the ios for a lengthy quarantine of fifteen individuals any of whom might be vectoring some virulent microorganism he resolved the conflict by housing the marburg evacuees in a vacant engineering bay ordinarily used to launch turing assemblers crude cold and uncomfortable quarters but he ordered the chamber stocked with a weeks worth of food and water and equipped with sleeping mats and considered himself generous for so doing he also ordered the access doors doublesealed and declared the bay a level five hot zone pro tern and in his rare free momentsthe calm he imagined of a falling object a crystal goblet dropped from a tray before it strikes the floorhe was obliged to shuffle through routine earthbound particlepair traffic to ensure that no hint of the ongoing crisis reached the wrong ears this paranoiac rant for instance from yambukus resident planetologist dieter franklin mounting evidence suggests a mechanism of information exchange between physically unconnected living cells such a mechanism would allow a symbiosis that rides above the usual evolutionary process a mechanism perhaps as significant as the ancient terrestrial symbiosis of unicellular life and primitive mitochondria whatever that meant the increasing efficiency of bacteriological attack on downstation seals and the penetration of supposedly inert barriers a phenomenon shared across immense distances by otherwise unrelated organisms led to the investigation of intracellular quantum events such as no strike all that bacterial attack would raise an alarm back home feeling faintly guilty but with the clinical determination of a man who has set about the grim task of ensuring his own survival degrandpre deleted the offending paragraph the proliferation of structurally unnecessary microtubules in a great variety of isian unicells may ultimately explain this apparent actionatadistance in the human brain such structures mediate consciousness by operating as quantum devices a single electrons indeterminacy amplified in effect to become the central mechanism of vertebrate consciousness preliminary laboratory work see appendix suggests that isian unicells not only sustain a similar quantum effect but can in fact create and preserve twinstate particlepair coherency during the process of mitosis all this seemed wrongheaded and subtly threatening to degrandpre though he was hardly equipped to evaluate the scientific content he skipped to the summary at the end of the document one may speculate perhaps not prematurely about the possibilities inherent in a pseudoneural network connecting all isian unicells a biomass that if one includes oceanic matter and the mineralfixing bacteria distributed through the crust of the planet is of truly staggering proportions the increasingly successful biological attacks on the downstations might be seen by analogy as an autonomic reaction to the presence of a foreign body in which breach strategies developed in the saline environment of the ocean and first used against the oceanic research station were slowly but effectively adapted for use against landbased outposts no none of this would do an incoming message chimed his scrolltagged highest priority of course what else degrandpre ordered a quick global delete of the floating document dieter franklins musings were promptly excised from the scroll the mail queue and the central memory they would not of course be broadcast to earth the bad news this timeand it was very bad news indeedwas that corbus nefford had developed a fever degrandpre spoke to his medical manager through a twoway screen fullscale image under the circumstances a scroll connection would have been too formal never mind that he spoke from the safety of his temporary command quarters lodged next to the aeroponic gardens never mind that he had already established four new precautionary zones extending from the shuttle dock to include both adjoining pods and of course the turing launch bays he was shocked at the sight of corbus nefford strapped to a gurney with a saline drip tacked to his arm and ken kinsolving at his side remote tractibles bustled around the physicians bedside snuffling at his wrists with biotic and chemical sensors nefford had insisted he had something important to tell kenyon degrandpre and had refused to speak to intermediates at the moment he looked barely capable of speaking at all we are all lost some part of degrandpre whispered he mustered his diplomatic skills he didnt want nefford to see him flinch away from the screen what you have to understand nefford managed to gasp is the slowness of it the etiology of the disease or neffords own death each protracted each agonizing yes go on degrandpre said all of this was being recorded by the ioss central memory for future reference he wondered whether anyone would ever see it this disease isnt like other isian contagions not as virulent it has an incubation period that means its probably a single organism dangerous and subtle but potentially controllable do you understand i understand you neednt continue asking me that corbus dangerous but potentially controllable but quarantine isnt working were dealing with something very small here maybe a prion a bit of dna in a protein jacket maybe small enough to tunnel through the seals well keep all that in mind corbus if any of us survive manager nefford gasped his mouth working between syllables like a siphon with an air bubble trapped inside may i say kenyon were friends arent we in keeping with our respective positions in the trust hardly of course degrandpre said maybe i wont die perhaps not we can control this yes degrandpre said nefford seemed on the verge of saying something more but fresh red blood began to leak from his nose visibly disappointed he closed his eyes and turned his head away kinsolving broke the video connection ghastly degrandpre murmured he couldnt seem to escape the word it was lodged on his tongue ghastly ghastly neffords prophecy was correct engineering tractibles reported microscopic pinhole punctures in the seals separating the original quarantine chamber from the surrounding quarters here was the real horror degrandpre thought this breaking of barriers civilization after all was the making of divisions of walls and fences to parse the chaotic wild into ordered cells of human imagination wilderness invades the garden and reason is overthrown he understood for the first time or imagined he understood his fathers religious impulse the families and their trusts had finely divided and obsessively ordered the political and technological wilderness of earth each person and thing and process in its appropriate orbit in the social orrery but outside the walls of the families the wild still pressed close proles martians kuiper clans disease vectors breeding in the haunts of the underclasses no conqueror but death finally and the cruel immensity of the universe his fathers furtive islam was after all an act of will the ordering of the void into story and hierarchy walled gardens of good and evil the tragedy of isis was the tragedy of walls made vain not only the physical walls he thought of corbus nefford calling him a friend he thought of the hygienic lies he broadcast to earth on a daily basis all vain very little could be salvaged now perhaps only his own life perhaps not even that a summit with the pompous fat chief engineer todd solen as i see it solen announced we have just one recourse if we cant put physical barriers between ourselves and the disease agent whatever it is we have to shut down modules three and six secure the bulkheads and evacuate the atmosphere put a sector of hard vacuum between ourselves and the threat which ought to do the trick unless this socalled virus has spread through the ios already the marburg evacuees are in module six obviously theyll die if we depressurize the module but theyll die just as surely if we dont disease aside without access to our turing bays or main shuttle docks without spares or a comprehensive engineering sector with our water circulation compromised and the food supply depending entirely on what we can grow in the sun gardensall considered the ios is an unsustainable environment we can save as many people as we can fit into a single higgs launcher no more degrandpre felt the paralysis of utter failure he asked has it come to that the engineer was perspiring freely he swabbed his forehead with a sleeve with all due respect manager yes it has come to that i will not render this decision degrandpre thought under intimidation he said its hot in here solen blinked his bulging eyes wellwere recycling water from the cooling fins theres not much left for thermostatic control find a way to make it cooler in here mr solen yes sir solen said faintly too hot too dry the ios itself was running a fever aaron weber the marburg station manager currently isolated in the turing bayalong with all fifteen of his staffalso took note of the heat the air was dry enervating and it made even the large if poorly illuminated steel cavern of the turing bay seem claustrophobic sleep proved difficult in the heat the heat dried throat and nose made clothing a nuisance and blankets intolerable several of the kuiperborn scientists stripped and thought nothing of it but weber was more inhibited he was reminded of his student dormitory in kim ii sung city during the long winters blistering forcedair heat losing its moisture to glass windows crusted with ice nosebleeds at night bloodstains on the pillow the only recourse had been to open a window and risk freezing fully clothed he nevertheless managed to sleep for an hour or so in the long shadow of a cargo manipulator woke to the snoring of his quarantined comrades slept again and woke with a faint cool breeze on his cheek thinking of the dormitory window snow sliding under glass the moving air soothed him but the air here ought not to be moving the breeze became a wind now a brisk little indoor wind sweeping along the floor of the turing bay with surprising vigor picking up loose items rescued from the shuttle here a foam cup there a sheaf of printed paper he sat upright alarmed that sound that muted throbbing he recognized it from the ios launches though it had never been so immediate it was the sound of the machinery that opened the bays huge airlock his ears exploded with pain as the atmospheric pressure abruptly dropped when he opened his mouth the air spilled out of his throat in an involuntary exhalation that seemed never to end he wanted to cry out but his lungs collapsed like broken balloons lights blinked out around him he saw bodies thrashing as they were thrown from the gaping lock no noise now only the stars pure and unmediated the fixed and naked eye first light twenty yesterdays rainwater dripped from the forest canopy and left the trail mulchy and slick tam hayes moved cautiously in his heavy biological armor he had grown accustomed to the liquid sound of his footsteps in the decaying biomass the regular whir of his servomotors the sounds were peaceful in a strange way throughout that long day he did not speak to yambuku although message alerts scrolled periodically through his headsup the silence was oddly soothing instead he performed the slow and steady work of navigating his armor pacing himself monitoring his gear he wanted to reach and preferably cross the copper river by nightfall if necessary he would sleep inside his armor simply freeze the servos and let the gel padding accommodate itself to his weight but it would be better to keep moving dieter had been right of course about the bioarmor he dared not depend on it it would failin some small way or catastrophically sooner or later much as he tried to pace himself however this was hard physical labor the sweat poured out of him some of it absorbed by the armors recyclers but most of it trapped between his body and the cool gel membrane irritating his skin he watched his footing as he walked avoiding places where the mud seemed threateningly deep he saw the sky reflected in leafstrewn puddles sunlight glistening on scummy water and it occurred to him to wonder from time to time what he was doing out here searching for zoe of course because he cared about zoe she was fragile but brutally persistenthe thought for a moment of a fern emerging from a poisonous windfall of volcanic ash she had been subjected to cruelties that had killed four of her clone sisters and she had survivedhad followed isis out of her captivity just as hayes had followed isis away from his family and his clan but we were both seduced hayes thought would zoe have come here so willingly if she had known she was nothing more than a vehicle for the field testing of new trust technologies god help us hayes thought she might have but the trust never offered her the choice lies wrapped in lies everyone a party to some sin or other knowledge hoarded and tightly held because knowledge was power the terrestrial way and i am out here hayes thought out here in this peaceful toxic wilderness to rescue her but admit the truth to rescue himself as well the awful thing about lying was that it became a habit then a reflex as automatic as the blinking of the eyes or the voiding of the bowels lying was the terrestrial disease his mother used to say calm aloof an ice walker his fathers potlatch wife in some other century she might have been a quaker he had wanted the stars but he had caught the terrestrial disease the unknowing of awkward truths he had lied to zoe perhaps not as egregiously as avrion theophilus had lied to herbut he had abetted those lies he was out here saving zoe but he was also out here salvaging the tattered remains of his innocence no points for that he reached the river at sunset the sky was clean deepening toward indigo and the small moon was quartered at zenith he wanted to cross the river before dark the recent rains had swollen the copper water surged over the surface of the crude bridge the tractibles had built hayes stepped onto that fragile scaffolding and felt it sway beneath his weight if the bridge collapsed he would be trapped beneath the running water by the unbuoyant mass of his armor he switched on his helmet lamp and advanced slowly watching the water redtinted with sunset and shimmering with the oily residue of decomposing plant life as it washed over his boots servomotors labored to steady his balance a reflection of the moon quivered in the current to his left like the image of a lidded eye he thought of zoes eyes eyes shocked by the loss of her thymostat newborn wide but wary understanding at last the price she had paid for her sanity he remembered how she had felt beneath him crying out with what might have been god help her her first shared orgasm she had trembled like this bridge afterward he had felt faintly ashamed as if he had taken advantage of her forced the living heart of her out of a complex membrane of defenses he trudged up the far bank of the copper with gluey mud clinging to his boots the sky was darker now the forest a black corridor fallen logs rotted along the riverbank and to his right he saw some small animal hesitate in the beam of his helmet lamp then dash into the undergrowth when he had passed some meters into the woods and was enclosed in the space carved out of the darkness by his helmet light his radio crackled once and fell silent this would not have been unusual except that he had asked his armor to screen all messages unless they arrived on zoes standard or emergency frequencies in his exhaustion it took him a moment to understand that this was what he had been waiting for her signal must be weak obstructed by some obstacle perhaps or they would have heard her back at yambuku he stood still in the midst of the forest his boots sinking a little into the muddy pathhe might lose her if he movedand thumbed his own com controls zoe zoe its tam hayes can you hear me no answer he waited sixty secondsan eternity the catseye moon sliding through the branches of the treesand tried again this time her carrier frequency crackled alive and he heard her voice eerily close but confused as if he had wakened her from a deep sleep theo no zoe its tam im coming for you but i need to know where you are and how youre doing inside she murmured say again im inside a mound underneath under the ground inside which mound zoe i dont know i think theyre all connected its dark here he didnt like the way she soundedweak uncertain almost delirious but it was her voice she was alive zoe how are you are you hurt how am i she was silent for a long moment hot its hot here i cant see have they hurt you the diggers arent here not always i mean zoe hang on im coining to get you keep talking but he lost contact with her as he started toward the next ridge as he walked through the night he caught fragments of zoes carrier frequency never long enough to rouse her attention for all its exquisitely tuned servomotors and ergonomic flourishes the bioarmor had grown terribly heavy around him he was aware of the enormous effort he expended carrying himself upslope as he approached the foothills of the coppers where the soil grew stony and he could turn if he wished and see the western plains unfolding under moonlight toward the distant sea without a defensive perimeter of tractibles and remensors he feared an attack from some large predator but no such animal approached him he was a formidable creature himself he supposed and his armor didnt smell like food he contacted yambuku once to tell them that zoe was alive and he had spoken to her dieter franklin was manning the comm console tam he said thats good news but we have problems hayes debated cutting the connection there was only one problem he could deal with now and that was the problem of zoe but dieter was a friend and hayes let him talk your telemetry for one we have motors running hot in your left leg assembly its not critical yet you can scroll the diagnostics if you havent already but its not a good sign what you need to do tam is to turn around and hope you get close enough to yambuku that we can send one of the reserve tractibles to carry you back if need be we can try to do something about zoe from orbit the ios has a few landable remensors it can launch hayes digested this information slowly an overheating servo in his left leg that would explain the extra weight he seemed to carry when he moved that foot his tendency to list to port when his attention lapsed but that wasnt bad considering dieters first prediction that he would never reach the river as for rescuing zoe he said from orbit because were evacuating yambuku the seals are lapsing faster than we can replace them and our stores are running low on top of that theophilus says the ios is getting cagey with him maybe somethings gone bad up there too were looking at a last shuttle lift in fortyeight hours not enough time thats the point im trying to make your case with theophilus but hes giving the orders and hes just about angry enough to write you off he wants zoe back her corpse at least hayes did not add not as much as he wants to get off isis hes family and hes very much in charge but i think underneath all that hes starting to get seriously frightened thank you for the information dieter keep the core sterile ill be back he cut the connection before dieter could respond fortyeight hours if he started back now he might make it twentyone tam tam the voice had come the voice had gone unless she had imagined it it was easy to imagine things here in the overheated dark the digger coiling its multijointed body in a sinuous circle had also come and gone the digger had broken the membrane of her excursion suit slitting it from sternum to crotch with one razorsharp claw but carefully drawing only a little blood and then it had left her alone to die she had assumed and she burned her firefly lamps recklessly examining her body waiting for the inevitable collapse of heart lungs liver brainbecause she was exposed at last to the isian biosphere microbes implanted beneath her skin by the animals filthy claw but her blood had dried quickly in the hot close air daubs of it congealed on her fingers she did not sicken and she did not die she did however exhaust her supply of firefly lamps simply because she had dreaded dying in the dark as the last lamp burned she had willed herself to die before it blinked out but she did not die only passed out for a time or slept and then was horribly awake again confined in this lightless hole she tore off her air filter because there was no reason now not to breathe the isian air directly at best it might hasten her inevitable death and still still she did not die the impulse to escape a kind of smoldering panic overwhelmed her once more she resigned herself to the darkness it was only a matter of using her other senses zoe told herself of making maps in her head once again she crawled out of her culdesac into a tunnel she felt but could not see the mossy alien growths pressed against her exposed stomach her breasts she crawled for an inestimable time made several turns tried to picture the labyrinth she had navigated as a map on parchment an ancient mariners map but the map dissolved in the heat and confusion she couldnt hold on to it she turned a corner and put her hand forward and touched the body of a digger she froze in place but the animal was evidently sleeping its fat hollow scales so useful for insulation were splayed apart radiating heat rather than conserving it without her air filter the digger smelled pungent and close the smell reminded her of a freshly manured farm field zoe backed away there wasnt room to turn around in the narrow tunnel she dreaded what she might encounter with her feet dreaded discovering that her world had been reduced to a few yards of excavated subsoil while her body stubbornly and stupidly refused to die she had thrown away her filter mask but retained the excursion suits headgear and she was thankful for that when tam hayes spoke to her even if he was a hallucination a fever dream as she suspected he must be it didnt matter she drank the sound of him like cool water for a time she was in tehran carrying laundry under the stars she had been given the job as punishment for some transgression she couldnt remember gathering the fetid toooftenrecycled smocks from the youngest inmates and carrying them in a plastic crate across the empty courtyard to the laundry shedthis in winter and often late at night her secret revenge was that she did not very much dislike the punishment distasteful as it was because the younger children often soiled themselves or were ill she relished the few free minutes under an open sky even in the cold even in the dark perhaps especially then the cold night air seemed somehow cleaner than the days as if it had been carried by benevolent winds from a distant glacier and the coldest nights were often the clearest the stars shone above the pallid lights of the camp with all the purity of their fixed indifferent light light born in fire and older than the seas she was in this place by mistake she had been made for the stars and she yearned to join them in their cycles as aloof as ancient kings some nights she put down her fetid burden and stole a moment all her own shivering and gazing at the sky she was there now in the camp or among the stars one or the other she was hungry and confused but what if zoe thought reluctantly what if she traveled to the stars and found nothing there but more mud and dismal heat and deadly cold and sickness and strangers who didnt care whether she lived or died what if she traveled all the way to the stars only to be buried in a hole in some alien ground what if what if what if some nights she imagined that the stars could talk she imagined that if she listened hard enough she would hear their voices speaking a language as crisp and hard and colorful as gemstones she waited patiently to hear that timeless language and finally to understand it zoe the voice again tam hayes not the voice of the stars but he was from the stars wasnt he or at least from the kuiper belt where people spoke more freely than they did on earth zoe can you hear me the functioning part of her headgear kept the line open waiting for a response she licked her lips her lips were dry she had finished the last of the suits distilled water lately in fact she had taken to licking sour condensation from the damp ceiling of the tunnel tam she croaked zoe im half a kilometer from the digger mounds i want to try to triangulate your position are you currently in a safe place well no she was not in a safe place but she took his intended meaning i dont have to move not right away good im coming for you i dont think you can find me she shook her head its dark here i understand that zoe im coming dark and close the com connection crackled with static hayes asked whats your physical condition that was a difficult question to answer she could not of course see herself she had to rely on sensation on touch but first things first im contaminated the excursion membrane is damaged im breathing unfiltered air there was no immediate answer she imagined the dismay on his face his mouth sagging at the corners would he cry for her she might have cried herself if she hadnt been so dry but im alive she added youre better protected than you think avrion theophilus says you have a heavily augmented immune systemlittle wetpack nano colonies monitoring your blood its an untested system but it seems to be working zoe thought about that a d p immune system that would explain why she hadnt died with her first unfiltered breath of this awful stagnant air but theo would have told her wouldnt he theo wouldnt have kept a secret like that it was theo after all who had rescued her from the orphan crib when all her clonal sisters had slowly sickened and died she must have said at least some of this aloud because hayes responded zoe were you ever sick during that time in tehran she considered the question weak yes malnourished certainly numbed and frightened always but the fevers had left her alone even the brazzaville that had sickened so many inmates that zoe had been drafted into carrying bedpans and eventually bodies theo had saved her theo theo or maybe theo had saved her before she even left the creche maybe theo had given her something to protect her but then why had her sisters died each in her own way they were a clonal pod after all identical at least genetically unless they were different inside different augmentation different immune packages that was how they did it with clonal animals perform various modifications on genetically identical mice then place them in a hostile environment see who survives one of my girls survived bad thought zoe scolded herself bad bad thought she called out for tam but the link was broken again time passed she couldnt guess how much she was increasingly aware of the diggers a great number of them by the sound moving closer to her she disliked the sound and the smell and the implicit threat the noise drove her down the tunnel where she fled by touch and by ear scuttling in the dark until the diggersounds were lost behind her and resting only then only then she knew they could have caught her if they wanted her they were astonishingly fast and flexible in these tunnels of theirs she presumed they did not want her that they were ignoring her that she was fleeing their ordinary and customary congregations but all the tunnels she followed seemed to bend gradually but steadily downward until it came to her a very bad thought indeed that she was being gently herded deeper and deeper still into these vaults farther and farther from the light twentytwo sir amrit seeger the junior communications chief actually trembled in degrandpres presence degrandpre had become so vigilant of infection that he had first mistaken the mans shaking and sweating for fever but it was only his dread of authority of degrandpres magisterial power such as it was sir i cant do that degrandpre had come to the communications chamber personally it was not a place he had often visited something about it appalled him seemed antiquated and too large all these winking glass appurtenances set into the wall like the monitor lamps of a seagoing battleship the equipment in this room was perhaps the greatest technological achievement of the devices and personnel grandees even greater in its way than the higgs launches maintaining a coherent and stable particlepair link across hundreds of light yearsthe grail of simultaneity in a relativistic universe a link to earth the voice of the families themselves emanated from this room but it was a fragile link narrow in bandwidth a bottleneck degrandpre had invoked information triage often enough in the past usually to make his custodial work aboard the ios appear as efficient as possible now he had elected to close down the link entirely this room was too close to the encroaching perimeter of contagion sir the engineer quavered they dont even knowback home i meanthey dont know about the breach of quarantine we cant break the link certainly not before we generate a distress call and if we do that degrandpre said what do you imagine would happen were contaminated with an infectious agent that the trusts would happily kill us all to contain there wont be a rescue mission certainly not if were idiotic enough to broadcast a distress call the engineer blinked at this logic trembling degrandpre imagined under the weight of blasphemy sir the regulations regulations are suspended for the duration of the emergency degrandpre put his hand on the grip of his quirt to make the matter official the engineer swallowed hard and left the communications chamber alone in the room degrandpre located the main power switchesa bank of breakers that queried and recognized his thumbprintsand cut power to the complex of communications machineries embedded in the walls panels of indicator lights winked out but that was not enough not nearly enough he opened a deckplate over the phalanx of batteries a battery of batteries he thought senselessly that provided a constant flow of uninterruptible current to the core of the particlepair reactor maintaining the delicate cohesion that was the beating heart of the link he disconnected the cells manually systematically ignoring the alarm signals until the overhead lights nickered and went dark m a last futile attempt to reroute power and preserve cohesion degrandpre switched on a hand lamp working by lamplight he pulled the three coaxial lines that were the links last source of energy deep in the supercooled com core photons that had resonated with their terrestrial twins for years began to decohere information was scattered in a sudden entropic collapse and the ios was alone the isis orbital station maintained a semblance of life shipments of replacement parts from the lunar turing factories arrived with clockwork regularity docked at the few remaining live bays and transferred their cargo to waiting tractibles the stations holds filled with finished goods and raw materials that would never be put to use of the nearly one thousand crew who had escaped quarantine fifteen at most would find a berth on the sole escape vessel a small higgs sphere embedded by turing tractibles in a cometary body and parked at an isian lagrange point fifteen coincidentally was the number of section managers plus kenyon degrandpre the general manager two of the original section managers including corbus nefford had been lost to disease or general quarantine their replacements were guaranteed a berth degrandpre understood the possibility of insurrection from the excluded crew and indeed he had found his hand straying to the holster of his quirt more often in the last few days but most of the crew were terrestrial and sufficiently disciplined to carry on even in the face of this disaster degrandpre had encouraged them to believe in the possibility of rescue and they seemed grateful for the lie once he had ordered the preparation of the escape launch a sort of numb quiescence overtook the station degrandpre spent the last night in his cabin with a guard detail posted at the door his first uninterrupted sleep in seventytwo hours he dreamed of a steel labyrinth with shrinking corridors and then of his fathers greenhouses dewy and warm in the winter afternoons odd he thought waking to the chime of his scroll how the psyche salvages calm from disaster dreamlike these nautilus chambers of normalcy when the ios was in fact a crippled and doomed environment the crisis was acute but somehow lazy the way a sailing vessel damaged below decks betrays itself first with the gentlest of lists the scroll chimed again an incoming message tagged highpriority he debated ignoring it what could be urgent when the end of everything was already in progress he was facing at best a life in exile among the kuipers he could never return to a vengeful earth nor even to mars with its prisons and its extradition treaties he wasnt a criminalor so he insisted to himselfbut the families would see it differently the families would hang him given a chance he picked up the scroll his fingers suddenly numb with dread sir it was leander of medical we have a stack of calls from yambuku demanding immediate evacuation avrion theophilus wants to speak to you directly and the last thing kenyon degrandpre wanted was some family cousin pulling rank on him god not now tell theophilus i cant take his call but clear them for the evacuation and dock them at the last turing bay and declare quarantine keep them in the shuttle if possible you meanindefinitely yes indefinitely more precisely until the escape module was launcheddid he have to spell this out is there anything else yes leanders voice grew flat reports of sickness in the delta pod a dormitory pod adjoining engineering we sealed the bulkheads at once of course but he shrugged degrandpre understood the rest no guarantees twentythree the outer ring of the ground station was hot according to nanosensors embedded in the walls yambuku had lost its first perimeter of defense wholesale failure dieter franklin insisted could not be far behind avrion theophilus took the planetologist to the small launchcontrol room above the corethe aerie franklin called itto discuss their options dieter franklin had the slightly mad look of a man condemned to death condemned and resigned to it he spoke too freely but theophilus listened there have been sporadic seal failures since the ground stations were first constructed but nothing like this were looking at a massive concentrated attack the planetologist frowned think of isis as a killer she wants in she wants us until now shes been fumbling with a set of keys chemical compounds trying to find one that fits the lock it was a long and frustrating effort and it led us to believe we were relatively safe but now she has the key the killer has the key and all she has to do is use it patiently open the doors one by one because its too late to change the locks he summarized basically were rucked so you agree that we ought to evacuate its the only way we can continue to draw breath he took a drink from a cup of coffeethat bitter substance the station crew was pleased to call coffee however we have two people in the field hayes tam hayes and zoe fisher last i heard she was still alive trapped under the digger mounds admittedly by your own logic we cant do any more for them without putting us all at risk were already just about as at risk as a human being can get thats not the point sir ive already demanded evac and ive already offered to monitor their situation from orbit give me another recommendation were obliged to take as many people out of harms way as we can so we evacuate the station but we leave it up and running nanos and tractibles can monitor the core for at least a few days we can maintain contact with hayes from the ios and if by some miracle he or zoe make it back to yambuku we can send the shuttle for them i wouldnt care to calculate the odds on any of this succeeding but it costs us nothing theophilus cupped his hands you call isis she she wants in you said do you have any idea why she wants in the tall planetologist shrugged maybe shes curious or maybe shes hungry theophiluss scroll chimed he glanced at it a summons from the communications room he headed for the door sir dieter franklin said theophilus looked over his shoulder ill consider your recommendation mr franklin for now the matter is closed twentyfour tam hayes his left foot dragging and his servomotors flashing yellow overheat warnings in his corneal display like slow fireworks arrived at the clearing around the digger mounds sunlight came out of the hazy east with a humid intensity the forest canopy breathed vapor like a sleepy dragon trails of fog wound down from the high copper mountain range in ghostly rivers hayes moved cautiously in his ponderous bioarmor at least five diggers and more perhaps hidden in the tree perimeter or away from the mounds watched him enter the clearing he carried attached to his armor an electric quirt and a pistol loaded with rubberized bullets so far however the diggers had maintained a respectful distance from him they seemed neither alarmed nor hostileonly watchful if that is he was interpreting their poised silences correctly their heads swiveled like radar dishes standing erect they reminded hayes of photographs he had seen prairie dogs taking the sun sunlight glittered on their blank eyes he had kept open his channel to zoe she did not speak often often ignored his calls but he was comforted by the faint sound of her breathing the recent rain had softened the ground here too he saw a great number of digger tracks leading into and out of the low mound openings he examined several of the mounds until he found a distinctive double groove in the drying mud a track that might have been left by the heels of zoes excursion outfit if she had been dragged inside by her wrists somewhere down theredown that slanting ramp into this warren of ancient excavationssomewhere down there was zoe he was equipped with weapons and a powerful helmet lamp he would gladly have followed but there was no way his bulky bioarmor would fit through that narrow hole h e called yambuku and asked for avrion theophilus dieter franklin came on first he briefed hayes on the situation at yambuku loss of shell integrity the sterile core threatened evacuation imminent if those assholes on the ios would pay attention to us for a fucking minute by the time hayes and zoe reached the downstation it would almost certainly be empty but well leave the light on for you as long as the core is still sterile and it ought to last a few days moreyou can radio the ios for a pickup understand tam put a candle in the window for us dieter count on it now hand me to theophilus master avrion theophilus announced his presence online hayes said i have a question for you theo he imagined theophilus wincing at the name zoe called him theo but zoe was privileged his surrogate daughter technically hayes ought to address him as master theophilus theo was a good family man speak theophilus said zoes been talking now and then i dont believe you picked up any of this at yambuku she has a limited radio perimeter correct shes lucky to have those immune enhancements theo theyre the only thing keeping her alive lucky indeed make your point mr hayes shes just curious theo you being sort of a father to her and all when she went into that orphan crib did she already have this blood gear there was a pause the silence hayes supposed of theos conscience yes she did as a matter of fact that may be what helped her survive but not her clone sisters her clonal sisters had been fitted with other forms of augmentation so it was an experiment put five rats in a cage and give them all smallpox that sort of thing considering your situation mr hayes ill forgive the judgmental tone the tehran facility would not have been my first choice for the girls political circumstances forced our hand however yes her confinement there ultimately served a scientific purpose she thinks you rescued her you might as well have raped her yourself what were discussing is a family matter you should have abandoned this kind of moral highhandedness when you left the kuipers family values arent open to question give the microphone back to dieter hayes said theo more of the diggers came out of the shadows now though they continued to give hayes a wide berth he hoped not to anger them they might take their revenge on zoeif they were capable of such thoughts dieter franklin came online again belatedly youre just making trouble for yourself tam i have plenty already theo still listening master theophilus has left the communication room if thats what you mean but this conversation is a matter of record dieter i have a question the bioarmorits sort of a miniature downstation right i mean it has a series of perimeters around a sterile core in a way big shell for the heavy processing and to house the servomotors gel insulation under that at the bottom a layer of primary containment about as thick as your skin so how much of it can i take off say again tam how much of this armor can i strip and still have any kind of protection the silence this time was longer hayes looked again at the mound entrance before him dark as a badger hole narrow as a sewer pipe conservatively dieter said none it doesnt work that way answer the question im not an engineer ill get kwame in here if you like you know this gear as well as kwame does i take no responsibility im not asking you to the responsibility is all mine answer the question well if you strip off the hard shell you probably wont die immediately youd need the helmet though for the air scrubbers and youd be standing there in a plastic wrapper about as strong as aluminum foil best case it might hold off the native microorganisms for a couple of hours before you go hot if you scrape your elbow of course all bets are off tam this is a fundamentally stupid idea i need to go in after her both of you will die as may be hayes said he hands were already on the latches of his boots dieter franklin caught up to avrion theophilus in the hallway outside the comms room master theophilus i want to apologize on behalf of tam hayes its not your apology to make mr franklin sir i trust this wont interfere with our plans that is if he does make it back to yambuku somehow we will send a shuttle for him wont we family business theophilus said briskly you neednt worry about it twentyfive alone in the sooty courtyard of the orphan crib zoe listened to the winter stars she listened with her eyes closed because she couldnt see she listened with her arms at her sides because her arms were too heavy to move she breathed through her mouth because the air was thick and stank of strange animals maybe she wasnt in the courtyard at all but here were the stars voices like a faraway church choir on a cold night voices like a train whistle bent across a prairie voices like snowflakes whispering at a bedroom window voices like the yellow light that shines out of the homes of strangers it was good not to be alone zoe shivered with the fever that had lately overtaken her and tried to focus on the sound of the stars she knew she was eavesdropping on a vast and impossibly ancient conversation none of it quite comprehensible but all of it radiant with significance a foreign language so complex and so lovely that it exuded meaning the way a blossom drips nectar there was a closer voice too but that one was more disturbing because that voice spoke to her directly spoke with the voice of her own memories touched her and marveled at her just as she marveled at the stars tam im coming he said he said it more than once and something else something about her excursion gear her tool kit she found it difficult to pay attention she would rather listen to the stars she said once mistakenly theo because she was back in the orphan creche again a dream no hayes said not theo the nearest voice was warm and enclosing and it came to her disguised as a memory of dieter franklin here was the gangly planetologist right in front of her lit from within his ribs and elbows obvious even under the rough blue yambuku service uniform this is the answer he told zoe eagerly the answer to all those old questions were not alone in the universe zoe but were damned near unique life is almost as old as the universe itself nanocellular life like the ancient martian fossils it spread through the galaxy before earth was born it travels on the dust of exploded stars this was not really dieter talking but some other agent talking to zoe through her memory of dieter she knew that it might have been frightening but she wasnt afraid she listened carefully i would explain this to you more fully little one but you dont have the words look at it this way youre a living conscious entity and so are we all but not in the same way life flourishes everywhere in the galaxy even in the hot and crowded core of it where the ambient radiation would kill an animal like yourself life is supple and adaptable consciousness arises well almost everywhere not your kind of consciousness though not animals born in ignorance and living for a brief time and dying forever thats the peculiarity not the rule i can hear the stars talking zoe said yes we all can all the time theyre mostly planets not stars planets such as isis often very different physically but all of them filled with life all of them talking but not earth zoe divined no not earth we dont know why the grain of life that found your sun must have been damaged in some way you grew wild zoe wild and alone like an orphan dieterthe dieterthingsmiled sadly yes exactly like an orphan but it wasnt really dieter talking it was isis zoe the beacon this was tams voice his radio voice she opened her eyes reflexively but saw nothing sweat ran in itchy courses down her forehead and her cheeks her mouth was ridiculously dry as dry as wood her tongue thick and clumsy zoe can you hear me she croaked an acknowledgment her stomach hurt her feet were numb she was as cold as she had ever been colder than on the coldest winter night in tehran colder than the core of a kuiper body spinning through space her sweat was cold and the salt of it burned her eyes she tasted it on her cracked lips zoe i need you to listen to me listen to me she nodded uselessly imagining for a moment that she was blind and he was here with her but that was only his radio voice zoe you should have an rf beacon on your tool belt the rf beacon zoe remember on your tool belt about the size of a personal scroll can you activate it the radio beacon but why he knew she was here they could even talk i cant find you without a little help activate the beacon and i can follow it her signal bouncing off the positioning satellites talking back to tams helmet yes that would work wincing she reached around her torn excursion suit exploring the tool belt with her fingers her fingers were as awkward as parade balloons and there was moss slime or something all over her torso she expected the beacon to have been lost in all her useless crawling but no here it was a small box slippery when it came out of its holster i have it she managed crude her human voice can you activate it for me she fumbled with the device until she found the indentation on the side she touched it repeatedly until the beacon came to life it chirpedone small sound to let her know it was working and a light came on a tiny red indicator on the face of the unit small as it was it was nevertheless a light zoe held it up to her face basking in the sensation of vision faint precious spark it illuminated if poorly anything within a centimeter or so of the beacon beacon indeed she put her hand next to the light she didnt like what she saw got it tam said loud and clear hang on zoe not long now the starsor at least their planetswere alive and had been talking to themselves singing to themselves zoe understood for billions of years isis disguised as her memory of dieter franklin sang her a soothing song a nursery song something her nannies had once sung to her a silly rhyme about the seashore if you put a shell to your ear you can hear the sea consciousness isis told her is born in the small things of the universe though no small thing is itself conscious the trick life learned isis explained was to sustain a ghostly contact when one cell divided into two a quantum equivalency of electron pairs suspended in microtubules like the particlepair link that connects you to earth life invented it first zoe thought like so many other things like eyes turning photon impacts into neurochemical events with such subtlety that a frog can target a fly and a man can admire a rose we see the stars after all zoe thought we just cant hear them animal consciousness isis said is a rare event in the universe cherished for its rarity the galactic bios welcomed home its orphans isis was sad that so many had died needlesslybrief nickers here of macabie feya elam matherbut that was unpreventable an autonomic reflex of the isian bios an action as involuntary as the beating of zoes heart and just as difficult to moderate but isis was doing her best im not dead zoe noted youre different little one different enough to survive one of my girls survived isis was silent on the subject twentysix too late kenyon degrandpre thought he marched head high down the ring corridor of the crippled ios too late look at me he thought look at me in my uniform crisp and neat the ring corridor was virtually emptylarge numbers of the crew had elected to die discreetly in their cabinsbut the few he passed still regarded him with a frightened deference his hand was on his quirt just in case but the enlightened manager seldom stoops to corporal punishment he walked stiffly formally toward the last of the docking bays where the escape vehicle waited to take him away from the ios to the higgs vessel he was conscious of his footsteps rhythmic and proportioned he did not veer to the left or to the right he walked in the middle of the ring corridor its corrugated walls equidistant from his braced shoulders he slouched only at the low bulkhead doors he passed through a section of crew quarters each crewman had private quarters cloistered steel cubicles hardly larger than university carrels and equipped with folding beds some of these doors were open and in some of the rooms degrandpre passed he saw men and women inert on their cots blood crusting on their noses and lips occasionally he heard a moan a scream most of the doors were closed most of the crew had chosen to perish in privacy slow corbus nefford had called this disease slow in its incubation perhaps by the yardstick of isian microorganisms but not in its final effect from first symptoms to death three or four hours might elapse not more the survivors he passed wore a blank shocked look they had not died but expected to or believed against all reason in some imminent rescue a miraculous reversal of fate but degrandpre believed in that too he found himself finally unable to contemplate the possibility of his own death not when he had gone to such obscene lengths to prevent it the multiple quarantines the killing of the marburg evacuees the breaking of the particlepair link to earth no in the end he must survive else all was meaningless to that end he modulated his steps and crossed the thick steel threshold of the emergency dock with an apparent calm only the sweat rolling down his cheeks betrayed him the sweat bothered him as his physical weakness bothered him if he wasnt ill was he mad was illness madness he arrived shortly after the appointed time and was disappointed to find only three of his senior managers waiting in the prep room a small chamber linked directly to the escape vessel leander solen and nakamura the others leander explained were ill but we have escaped it degrandpre told them the virus hasnt entered our bodies or if it has it has been weakened to such a degree that our bodies can defend themselves after all he thought here i am he used his senior managers key to unlock and activate the escape vehicle the process was not dramatic a heavy door slid open beyond it was the cramped interior of the escape craft acceleration couches arrayed in a circle no flight controls this was a kind of enormous tractible capable of one intelligent act docking with the higgs sphere leander said i feel like a coward theres no cowardice in this theres nothing more for us to do nakamura hesitated at the threshold manager she quavered im not well none of us are well get in or stay out the escape vehicle lurched away from the ios and followed a looping route to the higgs launcher waiting at the l between isis and her small moon the higgs vehicle was embedded in an icy planetisimal deposited here by a tractible tug some seven years ago remains of the tractible thrusters still dotted the object blackened nozzles like rusty sculptures set in a dark stone garden the wholly automated launch complex noted the proximity of the escape vehicle and negotiated docking protocols with it the smaller vessel docked successfully inside the planetisimal lights flickered on in anticipation of human presence temperatures in its narrow corridors bumped up to twentyone degrees centigrade medical tractibles lined up at the docking hatches in case of need the launch complex queried the escape module repeatedly but received no intelligible answer after a time as if disappointed by the nonappearance of an expected guest the launch complex darkened itself once more habitat chambers cooled to ambient liquid water was returned to ice vessels for storage supercooled processors clocked time with infinite patience isis prowled on in the orbit of its sun and no human voices spoke twentyseven tam hayes helmet light was good for at least a day and a half more than likely the lamp would outlast him would continue to burn while his corpse cooledor perhaps heated nursing a furious brood of isian microorganisms so far however he was intact he forced his way through the narrow digger tunnels the sheer fragility of his strippeddown excursion armor and the size of his helmet obliged him to move slowly he had been most afraid of an attack from the diggershe was horribly vulnerablebut the animals had kept their distance outside and were nowhere visible inside the mound complex there was however much evidence of their recent presence he passed loculi and culdesacs filled with food carefully categorizedhere a cache of seeds there a mound of fruit fermenting in the heat down other tributary tunnels he saw motion just beyond the range of his lamp a squirming that might have been sex or birth or childrearing or a barn dance he followed his beacon and kept his com link up listening as zoes occasional monologues veered toward incoherency the yambuku shuttle must have left for the obstinately silent ios by now tam hayes and zoe fisher were the last people on the continent outside the mound tunnels over the long western steppes and the temperate forest and the spires of the copper mountain range night was falling despite her fever despite her frequent lapses into unconsciousness zoe heard the voice of isis more clearly now heard it or at least understood it she knew and she tried to tell hayes in her lucid moments how the consciousness of isis rode on the planets bios how every living cell from the most ancient thermophyllic bacteria to the specialized cells in the black eye of a digger hosted the entity isis cells lived and died evolved formed communities became fish and birds and animals none of these things knew isis or was controlled by isis isis rode on their mechanism the way the contents of a book ride on the inkstained leaves of paper its only she whispered to tam hayesto someone theo perhapsits only when animal consciousness reaches a certain complexity that isis can interact with it the diggers theyre not really very smart theyre ninetypercent animal but they have a little bit of isis in them they can hear her a little and its why none of the seti projects ever found anything the galaxy is full of life and it is talkingoh god tam if you could hear the voices old old voices older than earth but we couldnt listen theres an isis but theres no earth whatever spores of life fertilized earth back when earth was hot and new they were brokenthe link was broken the quantum coherency life learned to carry between the stars was broken lost earth grew wild and alone when primates learned the trick of consciousness of neurons talking to neurons the way planets talk to planets making consciousness out of quantum eventswhen that happened there was nothing to get in the way of our evolution no earth only earthlings and hadnt she felt it hadnt she felt something of the kind when she carried the filthy laundry under the winter stars this was wrong all the torture and silences and hostility and the slaughterhouse of human history this was wrong but what was right what was so dear and so utterly lost that she ached at the absence of it why do people worship gods tam because were descended from them zoe thought were their mute and crippled offspring in all our millions she coughed and felt the wetness of blood on her hand somewhere in these catacombs of mud and dung tam hayes was scrabbling toward her hayes listening to zoes babbling in the earpiece of his helmet wondered how much of this she had picked up from dieter franklin how much was her own delirium how much might even be true but there was too much of zoe in it she needed the idea of isis he thought the idea of a community of worlds because she had never been truly welcome in any world of her own the crippled orphan was zoe not humanity this long tunnel like a central corridor coiled deeper into the earth hayes imagined a spiral carved into the stony darkness by countless generations of diggers veering around obstacles lurching with idiot persistency toward the bedrock waterrich almost transparent plants thrived on the moisture at the tunnels floor hayes wondered at their metabolism lightless mineraldriven the plants gushed sticky fluid under the weight of his gloves zoes delusion the sky talking to her well he understood the feeling he had looked at the stars often enough had climbed up through the red thorn sun gardens to a port observatory and watched the sky wheeling around him the sun no more than an especially bright star among all the carousel stars that had been one of his mothers convictions that the bios linked all things from kangaroos to martian microfossils it was a religious belief part of her ice walker upbringing he had rejected it along with the rest of the kuiper belts patchwork ideologieshalf puritan half libertine but he had believed it when he watched the stars he knew what it was to feel meaning beyond the limit of his comprehension the stars a vast city he could never enter a republic in which he could never claim citizenship he felt a cool wetness under the arch of his left leg and knew abstractly that he must have compromised the delicate core of his protective membrane just like zoe but he didnt have her immune augmentation he would have to hurry no need for caution now maybe she could use his helmet to find her way out she was tempted to give up isis couldnt save hernot her natural body which was dying despite all her augmentation under attack from too many unfamiliar microorganisms she might have withstood a single infection or two or even three but she was besieged now by organisms beyond number weakened by hunger and thirst but isis cherished her and would not let her go zoethe pattern of hercould be sustained indefinitely in the dense matrix of the isian bios that was how isis was talking to her viral entities slipping into her nervous system making fresh isian cells out of terrestrial neurons killing her but remembering her imagining her dreaming her still she waited for tam when he reached her at last he was deeply feverish he had forgotten in all his desperate haste why he was here found himself aware only of the tunnel and its pressure on his knees and neck the weight of soil above his head the strangeness and the terror of it and when that knowledge weighted too heavily he would breathe slowly and fight the panic of confinement the panic that threatened to overwhelm and suffocate him and when his hands ceased trembling and his legs regained the power of motion he pressed on following the beacon leading him to zoe strange how she had come to mean so much to him this terrestrial orphan with a failed thymostat how he had invested in her so many of his hopes and so much of his fear and how she had led him into this labyrinth under isis he imagined he was climbing not crawling that the brightness in the corridor before him was something more than the glare of his helmet lamp zoes vision was failing along with her other functions but she saw at least faintly tams light burning out of the darkness as he approached she blinked her eyes a sticky sensation h e knew when he saw her that what he had suspected was true was beyond rescue the bios had been working hard at her she sat with her spine against the curved wall of the culdesac her excursion membrane as tattered as an old flag there was dried blood on her belly the color of sooty brick fungus had attacked her exposed skin growing in swollen circles of blue or stark white even the albino moss had begun to feed on her rising to the moisture of her in lush trailing fingers her boots were buried in it she watched him unlatch and remove his helmet the beam of the helmets lampso brightflashed wildly about the culdesac it shone on the ceiling of impacted clay and animal matter on the gauzy insect web full of mummified husks on the delicate bulbs of moss he was offering his helmet to her with all its rebreathing apparatus and water reserves and gaudy glorious light the generosity of the act was heartbreaking but she waved away the gift too late too late hayes understood the gesture he was saddened but he set the helmet aside its light aimed steadily now at the ceiling with each breath he drew more isian microorganisms into his lungs not that it mattered he summoned his strength and fit his body next to zoes in the cramped space of the alcove no fear of contact now life touches life as elam used to say heat radiated from zoe the heat of fever and the heat of parasitical infection but her lips when he touched them were cool cool as the rim of a bucket of water drawn from a deep and mossy well he said i do hear them the stars but she was past listening the diggers avoided their store of strangesmelling meat until it had decomposed into a more familiar mass of diffuse enzymatic tissues ripe with life the smell became rich then exotic then irresistible coiling into the meat chamber one by one and one after another they feasted for days twentyeight the isis orbital station wheeled through its circuit of the planet crippled but functional spaceborne tractibles fetched water and oxygen from turing extractors on the moons icy poles replacing the small but inevitable losses of recycling lately many human bodies had been discovered by the housekeeping tractibles and these too had been recycled for their nutrients flush with fresh sources of nitrogen phosphorous potassium and trace elements the gardens thrived sun panels cast their glow on dense hedgerows of kale and lettuce a bounty of tomatoes and cucumbers avrion theophilus had taken refuge in the gardens while the others dieddieter franklin lee reisman kwame sen and everyone who had shuttled up from yambuku victims of the slow virus that had infiltrated the station the virus continued to tunnel through bulkhead seals in search of nourishment but after a time it found none after a time all its spores lay dormant below on the planets surface marburg and yambuku were deserted and theophilus had ignored the increasingly desperate pleas from the arctic outpost as its perimeters too were breached all dead now and to his horror he had found the escape craft missing the particlepair link to earth permanently broken and yet he lived he had insisted on traveling to isis with the same immunesystem modifications his trust had given zoe fisher the wetware protected him quite effectively from at least the single organism that had infiltrated the ios he was alive and likely to continue living but he was alone he moved through the filtered light of the gardens patrolling restlessly among the silent tractibles and succulent green leaves he talked to himself because there was no one else to talk to he wondered aloud and repeatedly whether anyone would come whether he would be rescued or whether he would be left here whether he would go mad after a month or a year of isolation or whether his thymostat would keep him obstinately sane there would be time enough to know all the answers time and more time his shadow followed him through the corridors of the ios like a lost dog he waited but no one came epilogue for one hundred and fifty yearsalmost to the month since its abandonmentthe isis orbital station navigated its rounds solarpowered and still quite active despite the failure of nearly half its photon exchangers selfmonitoring selfcleaning it had waited with apparently infinite patience for its salvagers to arrive from a distance it seemed unchanged up close age and damage had left more obvious marks jasmin chopra was the first of the salvage crew to board the ios terrestrial born she could trace her lineage back through both revolutions one of her ancestors anna chopra had even been tried and executed as a provocateur after a long life of apparently dutiful service to les families anciennes but that wasnt why jasmin was here she was here because she had conducted two salveur crews through the deadly ruins of kb and reclaimed several tonnes of exoticmatter higgslens fragments without a single casualty she was older nowpushing fifty terrestrial yearsbut she had volunteered early for the isis mission and used her status for maximum leverage and here she was farther from home than human beings had been for a chaotic century and a half after the stations docking seals were judged intact and the internal pressure raised a couple of millibars jasmin chopra became the first of the salveurs to cross the threshold she didnt fear contagion she was equipped with a biostat capable of digesting poisoning dissolving cauterizing or otherwise killing any foreign material that chanced to enter her body she shuddered in fact at the thought of the adventurers who had died here or on the planets surface their defenses against the isian bios as frail as kites in a windstorm nor was she afraid of what she might find aboard the station as she expected any extant human remains had been tidied up by housekeeping tractibles and funneled into the nitrogen cycle given its history the ios was almost supernaturally clean clean but eerie everywhere there was evidence of life abandoned almost in midthoughtclothing left where it had dropped oldfashioned scrolls scattered on desktops even loose paper documents fluttering in the ventilation drafts energystarved tractibles mobbed her legs like lonesome puppies her initial survey of the continuously pressurized portion of the ios brought her at last to the tiered sun garden the agro tractibles had been diligent in their long tasks but not much remained the herbandspice aeroponics tanks must have lost power at some critical juncture all they had lately raised was a crop of dust on the larger and more complex vegetable tiers everything had died but the kale and tomato plants these had gone on year after year surviving draught and power failures seeding themselves into the perpetually washed amalgam beds growing yellow and reedy and brittle with the accumulating scarcity of micronutrientsbut growing the persistence of life jasmin thought how it gets into things the true wild lay below on the planets surface jasmin wasnt the first to set foot there however even discounting the original research teams that privilege was reserved for the young and photogenic specifically jak and elu keys twin martian paleontologists who looked like lean angels as they took their first breath of isian air so full of strange new scents the moment was recorded for broadcast back to its intended terrestrial audience jasmin left the shuttle after the others a deferential act but also her preference she was a salveur not a scientist her concern was to see whether a new work station could be constructed from the weathered remains of yambuku or whether it would be best to start from scratch at least we have one advantage she thought we can walk in the open air actually touch the planet were so profoundly augmented that we could even drink the local water given a little judicious filtering of native toxins we can if need be build log cabins and live like pioneers but for now she was content to slip down the shuttle ramp into a meadow of blowsy seed pods under a hot noon sky a gusty wind plucked at her hair for one euphoric moment she was tempted to shed her clothes and run naked into the reef of trees beyond the slope of this ridge she was as impulsive as that poor treasonous ancestor of hers no one had spoken yet the only sound was the wind wind taming the grasses in slow swells wind out of the west and freshening she closed her eyes and it seemed to jasmin chopra that she heard the sound of voices on the winda whisper of speechless conversation we are here she thought and the wind whispered we are here this all seems somehow familiar she thought and the wind said we know you we remember you strange she walked a little way across the meadow until she could see a part of the old trust station yambuku rising past the canopy of trees its shuttlebay dome was cracked and covered with green creepers it had been reclaimed by the wild a brittle echo of the human presence on isis the bios is strong jasmin thought we have a lot to learn
