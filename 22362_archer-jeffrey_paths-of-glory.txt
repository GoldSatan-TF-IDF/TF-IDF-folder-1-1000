written in a country churchyard the boast of heraldry the pomp of powr and all that beauty all that wealth eer gave awaits alike th inevitable hour the paths of glory lead but to the grave thomas gray prologue saturday may st last time i went bouldering in my hobnails i fell off said conrad jochen wanted to cheer but knew that if he responded to the coded message it might alert a rival group tuned in to their frequencyor even worse allow an eavesdropping journalist to realize that theyd discovered a body he left the radio on hoping for a clue that would reveal which of the two victims the search party had come across but not another word was spoken only a crackling sound confirmed that someone was out there but unwilling to speak jochen followed his instructions to the letter and after sixty seconds of silence he switched off the radio he only wished hed been selected as a member of the original climbing party who were out there searching for the two bodies but hed drawn the short straw someone had to remain at base camp and man the radio he stared out of the tent at the falling snow and tried to imagine what was going on higher up the mountain conrad anker stared down at the frozen body the bleached skin as white as marble the clothes or what was left of them looked as if they had once belonged to a tramp not a man who had been educated at either oxford or cambridge a thick hemp rope was tied around the dead mans waist the frayed ends showing where it must have broken during the fall the arms were extended over the head the left leg crossed above the right the tibia and fibula of the right leg were both broken so that the foot looked as if it was detached from the rest of the body none of the team spoke as they struggled to fill their lungs with the thin air words are rationed at feet anker finally fell to his knees in the snow and offered up a prayer to chomolungma goddess mother of the earth he took his time after all historians alpinists journalists and the simply curious had waited over seventyfive years for this moment he removed one of his thick fleecelined gloves and placed it on the snow beside him then leaned forward each movement slow and exaggerated and with the index finger of his right hand gently pushed back the stiff collar of the dead mans jacket anker could hear his heart pounding as he read the neat red letters displayed on a cashs name tape that had been sewn on the inside of the shirt collar oh my god said a voice from behind him its not irvine its mallory anker didnt comment he still needed to confirm the one piece of information they had traveled over five thousand miles to discover he slipped his gloveless hand into the inside pocket of the dead mans jacket and deftly removed the handstitched pouch that mallorys wife had so painstakingly made for him he gently unfolded the cotton fearing that it might fall apart in his hands if he found what he was looking for the mystery would finally be solved a box of matches a pair of nail scissors a blunt pencil a note written on an envelope showing how many oxygen cylinders were still in working order before they attempted the final climb a bill unpaid from gamages for a pair of goggles a rolex wristwatch minus its hands and a letter from mallorys wife dated april th but the one thing anker had expected to find wasnt there he looked up at the rest of the team who were waiting impatiently he drew a deep breath and delivered his words slowly theres no photograph of ruth one of them cheered book one no ordinary child chapter one st bees cumbria tuesday july th if you had asked george why hed begun walking toward the rock he wouldnt have been able to tell you the fact that he had to wade into the sea to reach his goal didnt appear to concern him even though he couldnt swim only one person on the beach that morning showed the slightest interest in the sixyearold boys progress the reverend leigh mallory folded his copy of the times and placed it on the sand at his feet he didnt alert his wife who was lying on the deckchair beside him eyes closed enjoying the occasional rays of sunshine oblivious to any danger their eldest son might be facing he knew that annie would only panic the way she had when the boy had climbed onto the roof of the village hall during a meeting of the mothers union the reverend mallory quickly checked on his other three children who were playing contentedly by the waters edge unconcerned with their brothers fate avie and mary were happily collecting seashells that had been swept in on the morning tide while their younger brother trafford was concentrating on filling a small tin bucket with sand mallorys attention returned to his son and heir who was still heading resolutely toward the rock he was not yet worried surely the boy would eventually realize he had to turn back but he rose from his deckchair once the waves began to cover the boys knee breeches although george was now almost out of his depth the moment he reached the jagged outcrop he deftly pulled himself out of the sea and leaped from rock to rock quickly reaching the top there he settled himself and stared out toward the horizon although his favorite subject at school was history clearly no one had told him about king canute his father was now watching with some trepidation as the waves surged carelessly around the rocks he waited patiently for the boy to become aware of the danger he was in when he would surely turn and ask for help he didnt when the first spray of foam touched the boys toes the reverend mallory walked slowly down to the waters edge very good my boy he murmured as he passed his youngest who was now intently building a sandcastle but his eyes never left his eldest son who still hadnt looked back even though the waves were now lapping around his ankles the reverend mallory plunged into the sea and started to swim toward the rock but with each slow lunge of his military breaststroke he became more aware that it was much further away than he had realized he finally reached his goal and pulled himself onto the rock as he clambered awkwardly to the top he cut his legs in several places showing none of the surefootedness his son had earlier displayed once hed joined the boy he tried not to reveal that he was out of breath and in some considerable discomfort thats when he heard her scream he turned to observe his wife standing at the waters edge shouting desperately george george perhaps we should be making our way back my boy suggested the reverend mallory trying not to sound at all concerned we dont want to worry your mother do we just a few more moments papa begged george who continued to stare resolutely out to sea but his father decided they couldnt wait any longer and pulled his son gently off the rock it took the two of them considerably longer to reach the safety of the beach as the reverend mallory cradling his son in his arms had to swim on his back only able to use his legs to assist him it was the first time george became aware that return journeys can take far longer when georges father finally collapsed on the beach georges mother rushed across to join them she fell on her knees and smothered the child in her bosom crying thank god thank god while showing scant interest in her exhausted husband georges two sisters stood several paces back from the advancing tide quietly sobbing while his younger brother continued to build his fortress far too young for any thoughts of death to have crossed his mind the reverend mallory eventually sat up and stared at his eldest son who was once again looking out to sea although the rock was no longer in sight he accepted for the first time that the boy appeared to have no concept of fear no sense of risk chapter two doctors philosophers and even historians have debated the significance of heredity when trying to understand the success or failure of succeeding generations had a historian studied george mallorys parents he would have been hard pressed to explain their sons rare gift not to mention his natural good looks and presence georges father and mother considered themselves to be upper middle class even if they lacked the resources to maintain such pretensions the reverend mallorys parishioners at mobberley in cheshire considered him to be high church hidebound and narrowminded and were unanimously of the opinion that his wife was a snob george they concluded must have inherited his gifts from some distant relative his father was well aware that his elder son was no ordinary child and was quite willing to make the necessary sacrifices to ensure that george could begin his education at glengorse a fashionable prep school in the south of england george often heard his father say well just have to tighten our belts especially if trafford is to follow in your footsteps after considering these words for some time he inquired of his mother if there were any prep schools in england that his sisters might attend good heavens no she replied disdainfully that would simply be a waste of money in any case what would be the point for a start it would mean avie and mary had the same opportunities as trafford and me suggested george his mother scoffed why put the girls through such an ordeal when it would not advance their chances of securing a suitable husband by one jot isnt it possible suggested george that a husband might benefit from being married to a welleducated woman thats the last thing a man wants his mother responded youll find out soon enough that most husbands simply require their wife to provide them with an heir and a spare and to organize the servants george was unconvinced and decided he would wait for an appropriate opportunity to raise the subject with his father the mallorys summer holiday of was not spent at st bees bathing but in the malvern hills hiking while the rest of the family quickly discovered that none of them could keep up with george his father at least made a valiant attempt to accompany him to the higher slopes while the other mallorys were happy to wander in the valleys below with his father puffing away several yards behind george reopened the vexed question of his sisters education why arent girls given the same opportunities as boys its not the natural order of things my boy panted his father and who decides the natural order of things god responded the reverend mallory feeling he was on safer ground it was he who decreed that man should labor to gain sustenance and shelter for his family while his spouse remained at home and tended to their offspring but he must have noticed that women are often blessed with more common sense than men im sure hes aware that avie is far brighter than either trafford or me the reverend mallory fell back as he required a little time to consider his sons argument and even longer to decide how he should answer it men are naturally superior to women he eventually suggested not sounding altogether convinced before lamely adding and we should not attempt to meddle with nature if that is true papa how has queen victoria managed to reign so successfully for more than sixty years simply because there wasnt a male heir to inherit the throne replied his father feeling he was entering uncharted waters how lucky for england that no man was available when queen elizabeth ascended the throne either suggested george perhaps the time has come to allow girls the same opportunity as boys to make their way in the world that would never do spluttered his father such a course of action would overturn the natural order of society if you had your way george how would your mother ever be able to find a cook or a scullery maid by getting a man to do the job george suggested guilelessly good heavens george i do believe youre turning into a freethinker have you been listening to the rantings of that bernard shaw fellow no papa but i have been reading his pamphlets it is not unusual for parents to suspect that their progeny just might be brighter than they are but the reverend mallory was not willing to admit as much when george had only recently celebrated his tenth birthday george was ready to fire his next question only to find that his father was falling further and further behind but then when it came to climbing even the reverend mallory had long ago accepted that his son was in a different class chapter three george didnt cry when his parents sent him away to prep school not because he didnt want to but because another boy dressed in the same red blazer and short gray trousers was bawling his head off on the other side of the carriage guy bullock came from a different world he wasnt able to tell george exactly what his father did for a living but whatever it was the word industry kept cropping upsomething george felt confident his mother wouldnt approve of another thing also became abundantly clear after guy had told him about his family holiday in the pyrenees this was a child who had never come across the expression well have to tighten our belts still by the time they arrived at eastbourne station later that afternoon they were best friends the two boys slept in adjoining beds while in junior dormitory sat next to each other in the classroom and when they entered their final year at glengorse no one was surprised that they ended up sharing the same study although george was better than him at almost everything they tackled guy never seemed to resent it in fact he appeared to revel in his friends success even when george was appointed captain of football and went on to win a scholarship to winchester guy told his father that he wouldnt have been offered a place at winchester if he hadnt shared a study with george who never stopped pushing him to try harder while guy was checking the results of the entrance exam posted on the school notice board george appeared more interested in an announcement that had been pinned below mr deacon the chemistry beak was inviting leavers to join him on a climbing holiday in scotland guy had little interest in climbing but once george had added his name to the list guy scribbled his below it george had never been one of mr deacons favorite pupils possibly because chemistry was not a subject he excelled in but as his passion for climbing far outweighed his indifference toward the bunsen burner or litmus paper george decided that he would just have to rub along with mr deacon after all george confided to guy if the damn man went to the trouble of organizing an annual climbing holiday he couldnt be all bad from the moment they set foot in the barren highlands of scotland george was transported into a different world by day he would stroll through the bracken and heathercovered hills while at night with the aid of a candle he would sit in his tent reading the strange case of dr jekyll and mr hyde before reluctantly falling asleep whenever mr deacon approached a new hill george would loiter at the back of the group and think about the route he had selected on one or two occasions he went as far as to suggest that they might perhaps consider an alternative route but mr deacon ignored his proposals pointing out that he had been taking climbing parties to scotland for the past eighteen years and perhaps mallory might ponder on the value of experience george fell back in line and continued to follow his master up the welltrodden paths over supper each evening when george sampled ginger beer and salmon for the first time mr deacon would spend some considerable time outlining his plans for the following day tomorrow he declared we face our most demanding test but after ten days of climbing in the highlands im confident that youre more than ready for the challenge a dozen expectant young faces stared up at mr deacon before he continued we will attempt to climb the highest mountain in scotland ben nevis said george four thousand four hundred and nine feet he added although he had never seen the mountain mallory is correct said mr deacon clearly irritated by the interruption once we reach the topwhat we climbers call the summit or peakwe will have lunch while you enjoy one of the finest vistas in the british isles as we have to be back at camp before the sun sets and as the descent is always the most difficult part of any climb everyone will report for breakfast by seven oclock so that we can set out at eight on the dot guy promised to wake george at six the following morning as his friend often overslept and then missed breakfast which didnt deter mr deacon from keeping to a timetable that resembled a military operation however george was so excited by the thought of climbing the highest mountain in scotland that it was he who woke guy the next morning he was among the first to join mr deacon for breakfast and was waiting impatiently outside his tent long before the party was due to set off mr deacon checked his watch at one minute to eight he set off at a brisk pace down the path that would take them to the base of the mountain whistle drill he shouted after they had covered about a mile all the boys except one took out their whistles and heartily blew the signal that would indicate they were in danger and required assistance mr deacon was unable to hide a thinlipped smile when he observed which of his charges had failed to carry out his order am i to presume mallory that you have left your whistle behind yes sir george replied annoyed that mr deacon had got the better of him then you will have to return to camp immediately retrieve it and try to catch us up before we begin the ascent george wasted no time protesting he took off in the opposite direction and once he was back at camp fell on his hands and knees and crawled into his tent where he spotted the whistle on top of his sleeping bag he cursed grabbed it and began running back hoping to catch up with his chums before they started the climb but by the time hed reached the foot of the mountain the little crocodile of climbers had already begun their ascent guy bullock who was acting as tailend charlie continually looked back hoping to see his friend he was relieved when he spotted george running toward them and waved frantically george waved back as the group continued their slow progress up the mountain keep to the path were the last words he heard mr deacon say as they disappeared around the first bend once they were out of sight george came to a halt he stared up at the mountain which was bathed in a warm haze of misty sunshine the brightly lit rocks and shaded gullies suggested a hundred different ways to approach the summit all but one of which were ignored by mr deacon and his faithful troop as they resolutely kept to the guidebooks recommended path georges eyes settled on a thin zigzag stretching up the mountain the driedup bed of a stream that must have flowed lazily down the mountain for nine months of the yearbut not today he stepped off the path ignoring the arrows and signposts and headed toward the base of the mountain without a second thought he leaped up onto the first ridge like a gymnast mounting a high bar and agilely began making his way from foothold to ledge to jutting outcrop never once hesitating never once looking down he only paused for a moment when he came to a large jagged rock feet above the base of the mountain he studied the terrain for a few moments before he identified a fresh route and set off once again his foot sometimes settling in a welltrodden hollow while at other times he pursued a virgin path he didnt stop again until he was almost halfway up the mountain he looked at his watch he wondered which signpost mr deacon and the rest of the group had reached ahead of him george could make out a faint path that looked as if it had only ever been climbed by seasoned mountaineers or animals he followed it until he came to a halt at a large granite slab a closed door that would prevent anyone without a key from reaching the summit he spent a few moments considering his options he could retrace his steps or take the long route around the slab which would no doubt lead him back to the safety of the public footpathboth of which would add a considerable amount of time to the climb but then he smiled when a sheep perched on a ledge above him let out a plaintive bleat clearly not used to being disturbed by humans before bounding away and unwittingly revealing the route the intruder should take george looked for the slightest indentation in which he could place a hand followed by a foot and begin his ascent he didnt look down as he progressed slowly up the vertical rock face searching for a fingerhold or a hint of a ledge to grip on to once hed found one and pushed himself up he would use it as his next foothold although the rock couldnt have been more than fifty feet high it was twenty minutes before george was able to yank himself onto the top and gaze at the peak of ben nevis for the first time his reward for taking the more demanding route was immediate because he now faced only a gentle slope all the way to the summit he began to jog up the rarely trodden path and by the time hed reached the summit it felt as if he was standing on top of the world he wasnt surprised to find that mr deacon and the rest of the party hadnt got to the peak yet he sat alone on top of the mountain surveying the countryside that stretched for miles below him it was another hour before mr deacon appeared leading his trusty band the schoolmaster could not hide his annoyance when the other boys began cheering and clapping the lone figure sitting on the peak mr deacon marched up to him and demanded how did you manage to overtake us mallory i didnt overtake you sir george replied i simply found an alternative route mr deacons expression left the rest of the class in no doubt that he didnt want to believe the boy as ive told you many times mallory the descent is always more difficult than the climb not least because of the amount of energy you will have expended to reach the top that is something novices fail to appreciate said mr deacon after a dramatic pause he added often to their cost george didnt comment so be sure to stay with the group on the way down once the boys had devoured their packed lunches mr deacon lined them up before taking his place at the front however he didnt set off until hed seen george standing among the group chatting to his friend bullock he would have ordered him to join him at the front if hed overheard his words see you back at camp guy on one matter mr deacon proved correct the journey down the mountain was not only more demanding than the ascent but more dangerous and as he had predicted it took far longer dusk was already setting in by the time mr deacon tramped into camp followed by his bedraggled and exhausted troop they couldnt believe what they saw george mallory was seated crosslegged on the ground drinking ginger beer and reading a book guy bullock burst out laughing but mr deacon was not amused he made george stand to attention while he delivered a stern lecture on the importance of mountain safety once he had finished his diatribe he ordered george to pull his trousers down and bend over mr deacon did not have a cane to hand so he pulled off the leather belt that held up his khaki shorts and administered six strokes to the boys bare flesh but unlike the sheep george didnt bleat at first light the following morning mr deacon accompanied george to the nearest railway station he bought him a ticket and handed him a letter which he instructed the boy to hand to his father the moment he arrived at mobberley why are you back so early georges father inquired george handed over the letter and remained silent while the reverend mallory tore open the envelope and read mr deacons words he pursed his lips attempting to hide a smile then looked down at his son and wagged a finger do remember my boy to be more tactful in future and try not to embarrass your elders and betters chapter four monday april rd the family were seated around the breakfast table when the maid entered the room with the morning post she placed the letters in a small pile by the reverend mallorys side along with a silver letter openera ritual she carried out every morning georges father studiously ignored the little ceremony while he buttered himself another piece of toast he was well aware that his son had been waiting for his endofterm report for some days george pretended to be equally nonchalant as he chatted to his brother about the latest exploits of the wright brothers in america if you ask me interjected their mother its not natural god made birds to fly not humans and take your elbows off the table george the girls did not offer an opinion aware that whenever they disagreed with their mother she simply pronounced that children should be seen and not heard this rule didnt seem to apply to the boys georges father did not join in the conversation as he sifted through the envelopes trying to determine which were important and which could be placed to one side only one thing was certain any envelopes that looked as if they contained requests for payment from local tradesmen would remain at the bottom of the pile unopened for several days the reverend mallory concluded that two of the envelopes deserved his immediate attention one postmarked winchester and a second with a coat of arms embossed on the back he sipped his tea and smiled across at his eldest son who was still pretending to take no interest in the charade taking place at the other end of the table eventually he picked up the letter opener and slit open the thinner of the two envelopes before unfolding a letter from the bishop of chester his grace confirmed that he would be delighted to preach at mobberley parish church assuming a suitable date could be arranged georges father passed the letter across to his wife a smile flickered across her lips when she saw the palace crest the reverend mallory took his time opening the other thicker envelope pretending not to notice that all conversation around the table had suddenly ceased once he had extracted a little booklet he slowly began to turn its pages while he considered the contents he gave the occasional smile the odd frown but despite a prolonged silence he still didnt offer any opinion this state of affairs was far too rare for him not to enjoy the experience for a few more moments finally he looked up at george and said proxime accessit in history with percent he glanced down at the booklet has worked well this half good exam results and a commendable essay on gibbon i hope that he will consider reading this subject when he goes up to university his father smiled before turning the next page fifth place in english percent a very promising essay on boswell but he needs to spend a little more time on milton and shakespeare and rather less on r l stevenson this time it was georges turn to smile seventh in latin percent excellent translation of ovid safely above the mark oxford and cambridge demand from all applicants fourteenth in mathematics percent just one percent above the pass mark his father paused frowned and continued reading twentyninth in chemistry the reverend mallory looked up how many pupils are there in the class he inquired thirty george replied well aware that his father already knew the answer your friend guy bullock no doubt kept you off the bottom he returned to the report twentysix percent shows little interest in carrying out any experiments would advise him to drop the subject if he is thinking of going to university george didnt comment as his father unfolded a letter that had been attached to the report this time he did not keep everyone in suspense your housemaster mr irving he announced is of the opinion that you should be offered a place at cambridge this michaelmas he paused cambridge seems to me a surprising choice added his father remembering that its among the flattest pieces of land in the country which is why i was rather hoping papa that youll allow me to visit france this summer so that i might further my education paris said the reverend mallory raising an eyebrow what do you have in mind dear boy the moulin rouge mrs mallory glared at her husband leaving him in no doubt that she disapproved of such a risqué remark in front of the girls no papa not rouge replied george blanc mont blanc to be precise but wouldnt that be extremely dangerous said his mother anxiously not half as dangerous as the moulin rouge suggested his father dont worry yourself mother on either count said george laughing my housemaster mr irving will be accompanying me at all times and not only is he a member of the alpine club but he would also act as a chaperone were i fortunate enough to be introduced to the lady in question georges father remained silent for some time he never discussed the cost of anything in front of the children although hed been relieved when george won a scholarship to winchester saving him of the annual fee money was not a subject to be raised at the breakfast table though in truth it was rarely far from his mind when is your interview for cambridge he eventually asked a week on thursday father then ill let you know my decision a week on friday chapter five thursday april th although guy woke his friend on time george still managed to be late for breakfast he blamed having to shave a skill he hadnt yet mastered arent you meant to be attending an interview at cambridge today inquired his housemaster after george had helped himself to a second portion of porridge yes sir said george and if i recall correctly added mr irving glancing at his watch your train for london is due to leave in less than half an hour i wouldnt be at all surprised if the other candidates were already waiting on the platform undernourished and having missed your words of wisdom said george with a grin i dont think so said mr irving i addressed them during early breakfast as i felt it was essential they werent late for their interviews if you think im a stickler for punctuality mallory just wait until you meet mr benson george pushed his bowl of porridge across to guy stood slowly and ambled out of the dining room as if he didnt have a care in the world then bolted across the quad and into college house as if he were trying to win an olympic dash he took the stairs three at a time to the top floor thats when he remembered he hadnt packed an overnight case but when he burst into his study he was delighted to find his little leather suitcase already strapped up and placed by the door guy must have anticipated that he would once again leave everything to the last minute thank you guy said george out loud hoping that his friend was enjoying a wellearned second bowl of porridge he grabbed the suitcase bounded down the steps two at a time and ran back across the quad only stopping when he reached the porters lodge wheres the college hansom simkins he asked desperately left about fifteen minutes ago sir damn muttered george before dashing out into the street and heading in the direction of the station confident he could still make his train he raced down the street with an uneasy feeling hed left something behind but whatever it was he certainly didnt have time to go back and retrieve it as he rounded the corner onto station hill he saw a thick line of gray smoke belching into the air was the train coming in or pulling out he picked up the pace charging past a startled ticket collector and onto the platform only to see the guard waving his green flag climbing the steps into the rear carriage and slamming the door behind him george sprinted after the train as it began to move off and they both reached the end of the platform at the same time the guard gave him a sympathetic smile as the train gathered speed before disappearing in a cloud of smoke damn george repeated as he turned to find the ticket collector bearing down on him once the man had caught his breath he demanded may i see your ticket sir that was when george remembered what hed forgotten he dumped his suitcase on the platform opened it and made a show of rummaging among his clothes as if he was looking for his ticket which he knew was on the table by the side of his bed what times the next train to london he asked casually on the hour every hour came back the immediate reply but youll still need a ticket damn said george for a third time aware that he couldnt afford to miss the next train i must have left my ticket back at college he added helplessly then youll have to purchase another one said the ticket collector helpfully george felt desperation setting in did he have any money with him he began searching the pockets of his suit and was relieved to find the half crown his mother had given him at christmas hed wondered where it had got to he followed the ticket collector meekly back to the booking office where he purchased a thirdclass return ticket from winchester to cambridge at a cost of one shilling and sixpence he had often wondered why trains didnt have a second class but felt this was not the time to ask once the collector had punched his ticket george returned to the platform and bought a copy of the times from the newspaper seller parting with another penny he settled down on an uncomfortable slatted wooden bench and opened it to find out what was happening in the world the prime minister arthur balfour was hailing the new entente cordiale recently signed by britain and france in the future relations with france could only improve he promised the british people george turned the page and began to read an article about theodore roosevelt recently inaugurated for a second term as president of the united states by the time the nine oclock train for london came steaming in george was studying the classified advertisements on the front page which offered everything from hair lotion to top hats he was relieved the train was on time and even more so when it pulled into waterloo a few minutes early he jumped out of his carriage ran down the platform and onto the road for the first time in his life he hailed a hansom cab rather than wait around for the next tram to kings crossan extravagance his father would have disapproved of but papas anger would have been far more acute had george missed his interview with mr benson and therefore failed to be offered a place at cambridge kings cross said george as he climbed into the hansom the driver flicked his whip and the tired old gray began a slow plod across london george checked his watch every few minutes but still felt confident that he would be on time for his three oclock appointment with the senior tutor of magdalene college after he was dropped off at kings cross george discovered that the next train to cambridge was due to leave in fifteen minutes he relaxed for the first time that day however what he hadnt anticipated was that it would stop at every station from finsbury park to stevenage so by the time the train finally puffed into cambridge the station clock showed pm george was first off the train and once his ticket had been punched he went off in search of another hansom cab but there was none to be found he began to run up the road following the signs to the city center but without the slightest idea in which direction he should be going he stopped to ask several passersby if they could direct him to magdalene college with no success until he came across a young man wearing a short black gown and a mortar board who was able to give him clear directions after thanking him george set off again now searching for a bridge over the river cam he was running flat out across the bridge as a clock in the distance chimed three times he smiled with relief he wasnt going to be more than a couple of minutes late at the far side of the bridge he came to a halt outside a massive black oak double door he turned the handle and pushed but it didnt budge he rapped the knocker twice and waited for some time but no one answered his call he checked his watch pm he banged on the door again but still no one responded surely they would not deny him entry when he was only a couple of minutes late he hammered on the door a third time and didnt stop until he heard a key turning in the lock the door creaked open to reveal a short stooping man in a long black coat wearing a bowler hat the college is closed sir was all he said but i have an interview with mr a c benson at three oclock pleaded george the senior tutor gave me clear instructions that i was to lock the gate at three oclock and that after that no one was to be allowed to enter the college but i began george but his words fell on deaf ears as the door was slammed in his face and once again he heard the key turning in the lock he began thumping on the door with his bare fist although he knew no one would come to his rescue he cursed his stupidity what would he say when people asked him how the interview had gone what would he tell mr irving when he arrived back at college later that night how could he face guy who was certain to be on time for his interview next week he knew what his fathers reaction would be the first mallory for four generations not to be educated at cambridge and as for his mother would he ever be able to go home again he frowned at the heavy oak door that forbade him entry and thought about one last knock but knew it would be pointless he began to wonder if there might be some other way of entering the college but as the cam ran along its north side acting as a moat there was no other entrance to consider unlessgeorge stared up at the high brick wall that surrounded the college and began to walk up and down the pavement as if he was studying a rock face he spotted several nooks and crannies that had been created by years of ice snow wind rain and a thawing sun before he identified a possible route there was a heavy stone archway above the door the rim of which was only an arms length away from a windowsill that would make a perfect foothold above that was another smaller window and another sill from which he would be within touching distance of the sloping tiled roof which he suspected was duplicated on the other side of the building he dumped his case on the pavementnever carry any unnecessary weight when attempting a climbplaced his right foot in a small hole some eight inches above the pavement and propelled himself off the ground with his left foot grabbing at a jutting ledge which allowed him to pull himself further up toward the stone archway several passersby stopped to watch his progress and when he finally pulled himself up onto the roof they rewarded him with a muted round of applause george spent a few moments studying the other side of the wall as always the descent was going to be more difficult than the ascent he swung his left leg over and lowered himself slowly down clinging on to the gutter with both hands while he searched for a foothold once he felt the windowsill with a toe he removed one hand that was when his shoe came off and the grip of the one hand that had been clinging to the guttering slipped hed broken the golden rule of maintaining three points of contact george knew he was going to fall something he regularly practiced when dismounting the high bar in the college gym but the bar had never been this high he let go and had his first piece of luck that day when he landed in a damp flower bed and rolled over he stood up to find an elderly gentleman staring at him did the poor fellow imagine he was confronting a shoeless burglar george wondered can i help you young man he asked thank you sir said george i have an appointment with mr benson you should find mr benson in his study at this time of day im sorry sir but i dont know where that is said george through the fellows archway he said pointing across the lawn second corridor on the left youll see his name printed on the door thank you sir said george bending down to tie up his shoelace not at all said the elderly gentleman as he headed off down the path toward the masters lodgings george ran across the fellows lawn and through the archway into a magnificent elizabethan courtyard when he reached the second corridor he stopped to check the names on the board a c benson senior tutor third floor he bolted up the steps and when he reached the third floor he stopped outside mr bensons room to catch his breath he knocked gently on the door come responded a voice george opened the door and entered the senior tutors domain a rotund ruddyfaced man with a bushy mustache looked up at him he was wearing a light checked suit and a yellowspotted bow tie under his gown and seated behind a large desk covered in leatherbound books and students essays and how may i help you he inquired tugging at the lapels of his gown my name is george mallory sir i have an appointment to see you had an appointment would be more accurate mallory you were expected at three oclock and as i gave express orders that no candidate should be allowed to enter the college after that hour i am bound to inquire how you managed to get in i climbed over the wall sir you did what asked mr benson rising slowly from behind his desk a look of incredulity on his face follow me mallory george didnt speak as mr benson led him back down the steps across the courtyard and into the lodge the porter leaped up the moment he saw the senior tutor harry said mr benson did you allow this candidate to enter the college after three oclock no sir i most certainly did not said the porter staring at george in disbelief mr benson turned to face george show me exactly how you got into the college mallory he demanded george led the two men back to the fellows garden and pointed to his footprints in the flower bed the senior tutor still didnt look convinced the porter offered no opinion if as you claim mallory you climbed in then you can surely climb back out mr benson took a pace back and folded his arms george walked slowly up and down the path studying the wall carefully before he settled on the route he would take the senior tutor and the college porter watched in astonishment as the young man climbed deftly back up the wall not pausing until he had placed one leg over the top of the building and sat astride the roof can i come back down sir george asked plaintively you most certainly can young man said mr benson without hesitation its clear to me that nothing is going to stop you from entering this college chapter six saturday july st when george told his father he had no intention of visiting the moulin rouge it was the truth indeed the reverend mallory had already received a letter from mr irving with a detailed itinerary for their visit to the alps which did not include stopping off in paris but that was before george had saved mr irvings life been arrested for disturbing the peace and spent a night in jail georges mother was never able to hide her anxiety whenever her son went off on one of his climbing trips but she always slipped a fivepound note into his jacket pocket with a whispered plea not to tell his father george joined guy and mr irving at southampton where they boarded the ferry for le havre when they disembarked at the french port four hours later a train was waiting to transport them to martigny during the long journey george spent most of his time staring out of the window he was reminded of mr irvings passion for punctuality when they stepped off the train to find a horsedrawn charabanc awaiting them with a crack of the coachmans whip the little party set off at a brisk pace up into the mountains allowing george to study even more closely some of the great challenges that lay ahead of him it was dark by the time the three of them had booked into the hôtel lion dor in bourg st pierre at the foot of the alps over dinner mr irving spread a map across the table and went over his plans for the next fortnight indicating the mountains they would attempt to climb the great st bernard feet mont vélan feet and the grand combin feet if they succeeded in conquering all three they would move on to monte rosa feet george studied the map intently already impatient for the sun to rise the next morning guy remained silent although it was well known that mr irving selected only the most promising climbers among his pupils to accompany him on his annual visit to the alps guy was already having second thoughts about whether he should have signed up george on the other hand had no such misgivings but even mr irving was taken by surprise the following day when they reached the top of the great st bernard pass in record time over dinner that evening george asked him if he could take over as climbing leader when they tackled mont vélan for some time mr irving had realized that george was the most accomplished schoolboy mountaineer he had ever come across and was more naturally gifted than his seasoned teacher however it was the first time a pupil had asked to lead himand on only the second day of their expedition i will allow you to lead us to the lower slopes of mont vélan conceded mr irving but once weve reached feet ill take over mr irving never took over because the next day george led the little party with all the assurance and skill of a seasoned alpinist even introducing mr irving to new routes hed never considered in the past and when two days later they climbed the grand combin in a shorter time than mr irving had achieved before the master became the pupil all george now seemed to be interested in was when he would be allowed to tackle mont blanc not for some time yet said mr irving even i wouldnt attempt it without a professional guide but when you go up to cambridge in the autumn ill give you a letter of introduction to geoffrey young the most experienced climber in the land and he can decide when youre ready to approach that particular lady mr irving was confident however that they were ready to take on monte rosa and george led them to the summit of the mountain without the slightest mishap even if guy had at times found it difficult to keep up it was on the way down that the accident occurred perhaps mr irving had become a little too complacenta climbers worst enemybelieving that nothing would go wrong after the triumphant ascent george had begun the descent with his usual confidence but when they reached a particularly sheer couloir he decided to slow down remembering that guy had not found that part of the route easy to negotiate during the ascent george had almost traversed the couloir when he heard the scream his immediate reaction undoubtedly saved the lives of all three of them he thrust his axe into the deep snow and quickly looped the rope around the shaft securing it firmly against his boot while holding on to the rope with his other hand he could only watch as guy careered past him he assumed that mr irving would have carried out the same safety procedure as he had and that between them they would halt the momentum of guys fall but his housemaster had failed to react quite as quickly and although he had dug his axe firmly into the snow he hadnt had time to loop the rope around its shaft a moment later he too came flying past george george didnt look down but kept his boot wedged firmly against the axe head and tried desperately to maintain his balance there was nothing between him and the valley some six hundred feet below he held firm as both of them came to a halt and began swinging in midair george wasnt confident that the rope wouldnt snap under the strain leaving his companions to fall to their deaths he didnt have time to pray and as a second later he was still clinging to the rope his question seemed to have been answered if only temporarily the danger hadnt passed because he still had to somehow get both men safely back onto the mountain george looked down to see them clinging on to the rope in desperation their faces as white as the snow using a skill hed developed while endlessly practicing on a rope in the school gymnasium he began to swing his two companions slowly to and fro until mr irving was able to establish a foothold on the side of the mountain then while george held his position irving carried out the same process swinging guy back and forth until he too was finally secure it was some time before any of them felt able to continue the descent and george did not release his axe until he was convinced that mr irving and guy had fully recovered inch by inch foot by foot he led the two badly shaken climbers to the safety of a wide ledge thirty feet below the three of them rested for nearly an hour before mr irving took over and guided them toward safer slopes hardly a word passed between them over dinner that evening but all three of them knew that if they didnt return to the mountain the following morning guy would never climb again the next day mr irving led his two charges back up monte rosa taking a longer and far less demanding route by the time george and guy had returned to the hotel that evening they were no longer children on the previous day it had only taken a few minutes before all three climbers were safe but each of those minutes could have been measured in sixty parts and then not forgotten for a lifetime chapter seven it was clear from the moment they entered paris that mr irving was no stranger to the city and george and guy were only too happy to allow their housemaster to take the lead having already agreed to his suggestion that they should spend the final day of their trip in the french capital celebrating their good fortune mr irving booked them into a small family hotel located in a picturesque courtyard in the th arrondissement after a light lunch he introduced them to the day life of paris the louvre notre dame the arc de triomphe but it was the eiffel tower built for the universal exhibition of in celebration of the centenary of the french revolution that captured georges imagination dont even think about it said mr irving when he caught his charge looking up at the highest point of the steel edifice some feet above them having purchased three tickets for six francs mr irving herded guy and george into an elevator which transported them on a slow journey to the top of the tower we wouldnt even have reached the foothills of mont blanc george commented as he looked out over paris mr irving smiled wondering if even conquering mont blanc would prove enough for george mallory after they had changed for dinner mr irving took the boys to a little restaurant on the left bank where they enjoyed foie gras accompanied by small glasses of chilled sauternes this was followed by boeuf bourguignon better than any beef stew either of them had ever experienced which then gave way to a ripe brie quite a change from school food both courses were washed down with a rather fine burgundy and george felt it had already been one of the most exciting days of his life but it was far from over after introducing his two charges to the joys of cognac mr irving accompanied them back to the hotel just after midnight he bade them goodnight before retiring to his own room guy sat on the end of his bed while george started to undress well just hang around for a few more minutes before we slip back out slip back out mumbled george yes said guy happily taking the lead for a change whats the point of coming to paris if we dont visit the moulin rouge george continued to unbutton his shirt i promised my mother im sure you did mocked guy and youre now asking me to believe that the man who plans to conquer the heights of mont blanc isnt willing to plumb the depths of parisian nightlife george reluctantly rebuttoned his shirt as guy switched off the light opened the bedroom door and peeked out satisfied that mr irving was safely tucked up in bed with his copy of three men in a boat he stepped out into the corridor george reluctantly followed closing the door quietly behind him once they had reached the lobby guy slipped out onto the street hed hailed a hansom cab before george had time for second thoughts the moulin rouge guy said with a confidence he hadnt shown on the slopes of any mountain the driver set off at a brisk pace if only mr irving could see us now said guy as he opened a silver cigarette case george had never seen before their journey took them across the seine to montmartre a mountain that hadnt been part of mr irvings itinerary when they came to a halt outside the moulin rouge george wondered if they would even be allowed into the glamorous nightclub when he saw how smartly dressed most of the revelers weresome even wearing dinner jackets once again guy took the lead after paying the driver he extracted a tenfranc note from his wallet and handed it to the doorman who gave the two young men a doubtful look but still pocketed the money and allowed them to enter once they were inside the maître d treated the two young men with a similar lack of enthusiasm despite guy producing another tenfranc note a young waiter led them to a tiny table at the back of the room before offering them a menu while george couldnt take his eyes off the cigarette girls legs guy aware of his dwindling finances selected the second cheapest bottle on the wine list the waiter returned moments later and poured each of them a glass of sémillon just as the lights went down george sat bolt upright as a dozen girls dressed in flamboyant red costumes revealing layers of white petticoats performed what was described in the program as the cancan whenever they kicked their blackstockinged legs in the air they were greeted by raucous cheers and cries of magnifique from the mainly male audience although george had been brought up with two sisters he had never seen that much bare flesh before even when they were bathing at st bees guy called for a second bottle of wine and george began to suspect that this was not his close friends first experience of a nightclub but then guy had been raised in chelsea not cheshire the moment the curtain fell and the lights came up the waiter reappeared and presented them with a bill that bore no resemblance to the prices on the wine list guy emptied his wallet but it wasnt enough so george ended up parting with his emergency fivepound note the waiter frowned when he saw the alien currency but still pocketed the large white banknote without any suggestion of changeso much for mr balfours entente cordiale oh my god said guy i agree said george i had no idea that a couple of bottles of wine could cost that much no no said guy not looking at his friend i wasnt referring to the bill he pointed to a table by the stage george was just as astonished when he spotted their housemaster sitting next to a scantily dressed woman an arm draped around her shoulder i think the time has come for us to beat a tactical retreat said guy agreed said george they rose from their places and walked toward the door not looking back until they were out in the street as they stepped onto the pavement a woman wearing an even shorter skirt than the waitresses selling cigarettes in the moulin rouge strolled across to join them messieurs she whispered besoin de compagnie non merci madame said george ah anglais she said juste prix pour tous les deux in normal circumstances i would be happy to oblige chipped in guy but unfortunately weve already been fleeced by your countrymen the woman gave him a quizzical look until george translated his friends words she shrugged her shoulders before moving away to offer her wares to other men who were spilling out of the nightclub i hope you know your way back to the hotel said guy appearing a little unsteady on his feet because ive no money left for a hansom havent a clue said george but when in doubt identify a landmark you know and it will act as a pointer to your destination he set off at a brisk pace yes of course it will said guy as he hurried after him george began to sober up as they made their way back across the river his eyes rarely leaving his chosen point of reference guy followed in his wake and didnt speak until forty minutes later when they came to a halt at the base of a monument many parisians claimed to detest and wished to see dismantled bolt by bolt girder by girder as soon as its twentyyear permit had expired i think our hotels somewhere over there said guy pointing toward a narrow side street he turned back to see george staring up at the eiffel tower a look of sheer adoration in his eyes so much more of a challenge by night george said not diverting his gaze you cant be serious said guy as his friend headed off in the direction of one of the four triangular feet at the base of the tower guy ran after him protesting but by the time hed caught up george had already leaped onto the frame and begun climbing although guy continued to shout at the top of his voice he could do no more than stand and watch as his friend moved deftly from girder to girder george never once looked down but had he done so he would have seen that a small group of night owls had gathered below eagerly following his every move george must have been about halfway up when guy heard the whistles he swung around to see a police vehicle drive onto the concourse coming to a halt at the base of the tower half a dozen uniformed officers leaped out and ran toward an official guy hadnt noticed until then but who was clearly waiting for them the official led them quickly to the elevator door and pulled open the iron gates the crowd watched as the elevator made its slow journey upward guy looked up to check on georges progress he was only a couple of hundred feet from the top and seemed entirely unaware of his pursuers moments later the elevator came to a stuttering halt by his side the gates were pulled open and one of the policemen took a tentative step out onto the nearest girder after a second step he thought better of it and quickly leaped back inside the senior officer began pleading with the miscreant who pretended not to understand his words george was still determined to reach the top but after ignoring some reasoned words followed by some harsh expletives that could have been understood in any language he reluctantly joined the officers in the elevator once the police had returned to the ground with their quarry the watching crowd formed a gangway to the waiting vehicle applauding the young man all the way chapeau jeune homme dommage bravo magnifique it was the second time that night that george had heard a crowd crying magnifique he spotted guy just as the police were about to bundle him into the van and drive off to heaven knows where find mr irving he shouted hell know what to do guy ran all the way back to the hotel and took the lift to the third floor but when he banged on mr irvings door there was no response reluctantly he returned to the ground floor and sat on the steps awaiting the arrival of his housemaster he even considered making his way back to the moulin rouge but on balance decided that that might cause even more trouble the hotel clock had struck six before a carriage bearing mr irving pulled up outside the front door there was no sign of the scantily dressed lady he was surprised to find guy sitting on the steps and even more surprised when he discovered why the hotel manager only needed to make a couple of phone calls before he located which police station george had spent the night in it took all of mr irvings diplomatic skills not to mention emptying his wallet before the duty officer agreed to release the irresponsible young man and only then after mr irving had assured the inspector that they would leave the country immédiatement on the ferry back to southampton mr irving told the two young men that he hadnt yet made up his mind whether to report the incident to their parents and i still havent made up my mind responded guy whether to tell my father the name of that club you took us to last night chapter eight monday october th george was relieved to find that the front door of magdalene college was open when he arrived for the first day of term he strolled into the porters lodge placed his suitcase on the floor and said to the familiar figure seated behind the counter my names mr mallory said the porter raising his bowler hat as if im likely to forget he added with a warm smile he looked down at his clipboard youve been allocated a room on staircase seven sir the pepys building i normally escort freshmen on their first day of term but you seem to be a gentleman who can find his own way george laughed across first court and through the archway thank you said george picking up his suitcase and heading toward the door and sir george turned back as the porter rose from his chair i believe this is yours he handed george another leather suitcase with the letters glm printed in black on its side and do try to be on time for your six oclock appointment sir my six oclock appointment yes sir you are bidden to join the master for drinks in the lodgings he likes to acquaint himself with the new undergraduates on the first day of term thank you for reminding me said george by the way has my friend guy bullock turned up he has indeed sir once again the porter looked down at his list mr bullock arrived over two hours ago youll find him on the landing above you that will be a first said george without explanation as george walked toward first court he was careful not to step on the grass which looked as if it had been cut with a pair of scissors he passed several undergraduates some dressed in long gowns to show that they were scholars others in short gowns to indicate that like himself they were exhibitioners while the rest didnt wear gowns just mortar boards which they occasionally raised to each other no one gave george a second look and certainly no one raised their mortar board to him as he walked by which brought back memories of his first day at winchester he couldnt suppress a smile when he passed mr a c bensons staircase the senior tutor had telegrammed the day after their meeting offering george a history exhibition in a later letter he informed him that he would be tutoring him himself george continued on through the archway into second court which housed the pepys building until he came to a narrow corridor marked with a bold he dragged his cases up the wooden steps to the second floor where he saw a door with the name g l mallory painted on it in silver letters how many names had appeared on that door over the past century he wondered he entered a room not much larger than his study at winchester but at least he would not be expected to share the tiny space with guy he was still unpacking when there was a knock on the door and guy strolled in without waiting for an invitation the two young men shook hands as if they had never met before laughed and then threw their arms around each other im on the floor above you said guy ive already made my views clear on that ridiculous notion responded george guy smiled when he saw the familiar chart that george had already pinned to the wall above his desk ben nevis ft great st bernard ft mont vélan ft grand combin ft monte rosa ft mont blanc ft you seem to have forgotten montmartre he said not to mention the eiffel tower the eiffel tower is only feet replied george and you seem to have forgotten that i didnt reach the top guy glanced at his watch wed better get going if were not to be late for the master agreed said george and quickly slipped on his gown as the two young undergraduates strolled across second court toward the masters lodgings george asked guy if he knew anything about their head of house only what mr irving told me apparently he was our man in berlin before he retired from the foreign office he had a reputation for being pretty blunt with the germans according to irving even the kaiser was wary of him george straightened his tie as they joined a stream of young men who were walking through the masters garden in the direction of a victorian gothic house that dominated one side of the courtyard they were greeted at the door by a college servant dressed in a white jacket and black trousers carrying a clipboard im bullock and this is mallory said guy the man ticked off their names but not before hed taken a closer look at george youll find the master in the drawing room on the first floor he told them george ran up the stairshe always ran up stairsand entered a large elegantly furnished room full of undergraduates and dons with oil paintings of more ancient versions of the latter decorating the walls another servant offered them a glass of sherry and george spotted someone he recognized he strolled across to join him good evening sir he said mallory im delighted you were able to make it said the senior tutor without any suggestion of teasing i was just reminding two of your fellow freshmen that my first tutorial will be at nine oclock tomorrow morning as youve now taken up residence in the college you wont have to climb over the wall to be on time will you mallory no sir said george sipping his sherry though i wouldnt count on it said guy this is my friend guy bullock said george you dont have to worry about him hes always on time the only person in the room not wearing a gown apart from the college servants came across to join them ah sir david said the senior tutor i dont think youve met mr bullock but i know that you are well acquainted with mr mallory who dropped into your garden earlier in the year george turned to face the head of college oh lord he said sir david smiled at the new undergraduate no no mr mallory master will suffice guy made sure that george was on time for his first tutorial with mr benson the following morning but even so george still managed to turn up only moments before the appointed hour the senior tutor opened his remarks by making it clear that weekly essays were to be delivered every thursday by five oclock and if anyone was late for a tutorial they should not be surprised to find the door locked george was grateful that his room was a mere hundred yards away from mr bensons and that his mother had supplied him with an alarm clock once the preliminary strictures had been administered the tutorial went far better than george had dared to hope his spirits were raised further when he discovered over a sherry that evening that the senior tutor shared his love of boswell as well as byron and wordsworth and had been a personal friend of browning however mr benson left george in no doubt of what would be expected of an exhibitioner in his first year reminding him that although the university term was only eight weeks in length he would be required to work just as hard during the vacation as he was leaving benson added and do be sure mr mallory to attend the freshers fair on sunday otherwise you will never discover just how many activities this university has to offer for example he said smiling you might consider joining the dramatic society chapter nine guy knocked on georges door but there was no reply he checked his watch george couldnt be in hall having breakfast because they finished serving at nine on a sunday and he surely wouldnt have gone to the freshers fair without him he must be either fast asleep or having a bath guy knocked again but still there was no reply he opened the door and peeked inside the bed was unmadenothing unusual about thatan open book lay on the pillow and some papers were strewn across the desk but there was no sign of george he must be having a bath guy sat down on the end of the bed and waited he had long ago stopped complaining about his friends inability to understand the purpose of a watch however it still annoyed many of georges acquaintances who regularly reminded him of winchesters motto manners maketh man guy was well aware of his friends shortcomings but he also recognized that george had exceptional gifts the accident of fate that had placed them in the same carriage on their way to prep school had changed his whole life while others sometimes found george tactless even arrogant if he allowed them into his confidence they also discovered kindness generosity and humor in equal measure guy picked up the book from georges pillow it was a novel by e m forster a writer hed never come across before he had only managed a few pages of it before george strolled in a towel around his waist his hair dripping is it ten oclock already he asked taking off his towel and using it to rub his hair ten past said guy benson suggested i sign up for the dramatic society it might give us the chance to meet a few girls i dont think its girls that benson is interested in george swung around youre not suggesting just in case you havent noticed said guy to his friend who was standing naked in front of him it isnt only girls who give you a second look and which do you prefer asked george giving him a flick of the towel youre quite safe with me guy assured him now could you get a move on otherwise everyone will have packed up and gone before we even arrive as they crossed the courtyard george set his usual pace which guy always found hard to keep up with what clubs are you going to join guy asked almost running by his side the ones that wont admit you said george with a grin which ought to leave me a wide enough choice their pace slowed as they joined a teeming horde of undergraduates who were also making their way to the freshers fair long before they reached parkers piece they could hear bands playing choirs singing and a thousand exuberant voices all striving to outdo each other a large area of the green was occupied by stalls manned by noisy students all of whom seemed to be hollering like street traders george and guy strolled down the first gangway soaking up the atmosphere guy began to show some interest when a man dressed in cricket whites and carrying a bat and ball which looked somewhat incongruous in autumn demanded do either of you play cricket by any chance i opened the batting for winchester said guy then youve come to the right place said the man with the bat my names dick young guy recognizing the name of a man who had played both cricket and football for england gave a slight bow what about your friend dick asked you neednt waste your time on him said guy he has his sights on higher things although he happens to be looking for a man whos also called young ill catch up with you later george said guy george nodded and strolled off through the crowd ignoring a cry of do you sing were looking for a tenor but a fiver will do quipped another voice do you play chess we must beat oxford this year do you play a musical instrument asked a desperate voice even the cymbals george stopped in his tracks when he saw an awning above a stall at the end of the aisle which announced the fabian society founded he walked quickly toward a man who was waving a pamphlet and shouting equality for all as george came up to him the man inquired would you care to join our little band or are you one of those hidebound tory fellows certainly not said george i have long believed in the doctrines of quintus fabius maximus if you can win a battle without having to fire a shot in anger you are the true victor good fellow said the young man pushing a form across the table sign up here and then you can come to our meeting next week which will be addressed by mr george bernard shaw by the way my names rupert brooke he added thrusting out his hand im the clubs secretary george shook brooke warmly by the hand before filling in the form and handing it back brooke glanced at the signature i say old chap he said are the rumors true what rumors said george that you entered this university by climbing over your colleges wall george was about to reply when a voice behind him said and then he was made to climb back out thats always the most difficult part and why is that inquired brooke innocently simple really said guy before george had a chance to speak when youre climbing up a rock face your hands are not more than a few inches from your eyes but when youre coming down your feet are never less than five feet below you which means that when you look down youve far more chance of losing your balance got the idea george laughed ignore my friend he said and not just because hes a hidebound tory but hes also a lackey of the capitalist system true enough said guy without shame so what clubs have you signed up for asked brooke turning his attention to guy apart from cricket the union the disraeli society and the officers training corps replied guy good heavens said brooke is there no hope for the man none whatsoever admitted guy turning to george he added but at least ive found what youve been looking for so the time has come for you to follow me george raised his mortar board to brooke who returned the compliment guy led the way to the next row of stalls where he pointed triumphantly at a white awning that read cumc founded george slapped his friend on the back he began to study a display of photographs showing past and present undergraduates standing on the great st bernard pass and on the summits of mont vélan and monte rosa another board on the far side of the table displayed a large photograph of mont blanc on which was written the words join us in italy next year if you want to do it the hard way how do i join george asked a short stocky fellow standing next to a taller man who was holding an ice axe you cant join the mountaineering club old chap he replied you have to be elected then how do i get elected its quite simple you sign up for one of our club meets to penypass and then well decide if youre a mountaineer or just a weekend rambler i would have you know interrupted guy that my friend would be happy to sign up said george before guy could complete the sentence both george and guy signed up for a weekend trip to wales and handed back their application forms to the taller of the two men standing behind the table im somervell he said and this is odell hes a geologist so hes more interested in studying rocks than climbing them the chap at the back added somervell pointing to an older man is geoffrey winthrop young of the alpine club hes our honorary chairman the most accomplished climber in the land said george young smiled as he studied georges application form graham irving has a tendency to exaggerate he said however hes already written to tell me about your recent trip to the alps when were at penypass youll be given the chance to show if youre as good as he says you are hes better said guy irving wont have mentioned our visit to paris whenahhh he shouted as georges heel collided with his shin will i be given a chance to join your party for mont blanc next summer george asked that may not be possible said young there are one or two other fellows already hoping to be selected for that jaunt somervell and odell were now taking a far greater interest in the freshman from magdalene the two young men couldnt have been more dissimilar odell was just a shade over five feet five with sandy hair a ruddy complexion and watery blue eyes he looked too young to be an undergraduate but the moment he spoke he sounded older than his years somervell in contrast was over six foot with dark unruly hair that looked as if it had rarely been acquainted with a comb he had the black eyes of a pirate but when asked a question he bowed his head and spoke softly not because he was aloof but simply because he was shy george knew instinctively that these two disparate men were going to be friends for the rest of his life saturday june rd if george had been asked what he had achieved in his first year at cambridgeand his father didhe would have said that it had been far more than the third class hed been awarded following his endofterm exams is it possible that you have become involved in too many outside activities his father remonstrated none of which is likely to assist you when the time comes to consider a profession this was something george hadnt given a great deal of thought to because i dont have to remind you my boy his father addedbut he didthat i do not have sufficient funds to allow you to spend the rest of your life as a gentleman of leisurea sentiment the reverend mallory had made all too clear since georges first day at prep school george felt confident that this was not a conversation guy would be having with his father despite the fact that he had also only managed to scrape a third he concluded that it was not the moment to tell papa that if he was lucky enough to be among those selected to join geoffrey youngs climbing party in the alps he would be making an excursion to italy that summer unlike guy george had been mortified to be awarded a third however mr benson had assured him that he had been a borderline case for a second and added that if he were to work a little harder during the next two years that would be the class he should attain when he sat his finalsand if he was willing to make sacrifices he might even secure a first george began to consider what sacrifices mr benson might have in mind he had after all been elected to the committee of the fabian society where he had dined with george bernard shaw and ramsay macdonald he regularly spent evenings with rupert brooke lytton strachey geoffrey and john maynard keynes and ka cox all of whom mr benson thoroughly approved of hed even played the pope in brookes production of marlowes doctor faustusalthough george would have been the first to admit that the reviews had not been all that flattering he had also begun a thesis on boswell which he hoped might in time be published but all of this had been secondary to his efforts to be elected to the alpine club did mr benson expect him to sacrifice everything in order to gain the coveted first chapter ten george mallory had never climbed with anyone he considered his equal that was until he met george finch during the michaelmas vacation george had traveled to wales to join geoffrey young for one of the cambridge mountaineering club meets at penypass each day young would select the teams for the morning climb and george quickly came to respect odell and somervell who were not only excellent company but were able to keep pace with him when they tackled the more demanding climbs on thursday morning george was paired with finch for the ridge climb over crib goch cribyddysgl snowdon and lliwedd as the two men clambered up and down snowdon often having to scramble on their hands and knees george became painfully aware that the young australian wouldnt rest until everyone else had been left in his wake its not a competition said george once the rest of the climbers had all fallen behind oh yes it is said finch not slackening his pace havent you noticed that young has only invited two people to this meet who arent at oxford or cambridge he paused to draw breath before spitting out and the other one is a woman i hadnt noticed admitted george if im to have any hope of being invited to join young in the alps this summer snapped finch ill have to leave him in no doubt whos the best climber of all the wouldbe applicants is that right said george as he quickened his pace and overtook his first rival by the time they swung around the snowdon horseshoe finch was back by his side both men were breathing heavily as they almost jogged down the hill george slackened his pace allowing finch to overtake him just as the penypass hotel came into sight youre good mallory but are you good enough said finch after george had ordered two pints of bitter they were on their second pint before odell and somervell joined them in cornwall a few months later the two rivals honed their rockclimbing skills and whenever young was asked to choose who he thought was the better climber he was unwilling to respond however george accepted that once they stepped onto the slopes of the italian alps in the summer young would have to decide which of them would accompany him in the courmayeur valley for the challenging assault on mont blanc among the other climbers who regularly attended those trips to wales and cornwall was one george wanted to spend more time with her name was cottie sanders the daughter of a wealthy industrialist she could have undoubtedly taken her place at cambridge had her mother considered it a proper activity for a young lady george guy and cottie regularly made up a three for the morning climb but once theyd had lunch together on the lower slopes young would insist that george leave them and join finch somervell and odell for the more demanding afternoon climbs cottie could not have been described as beautiful in the conventional sense but george had rarely enjoyed a womans company more she was just an inch over five feet and if she possessed a pleasing figure she disguised it determinedly beneath layers of jumpers and jodhpurs her freckled face and curly brown hair gave the impression of a tomboy but that wasnt what had attracted george to her georges father often referred to inner beauty in his morning sermons and george had just as often silently scoffed at the idea from his place in the front pew but that was before he met cottie he failed however to notice that her eyes always lit up when she was with him and when guy asked her if she was in love with george she simply said isnt everybody whenever guy raised the subject with his friend george always replied that he did not think of cottie as anything more than a friend whats your opinion of george finch asked cottie one day when they sat down for lunch on top of a rock why do you ask said george removing a sandwich from its greaseproof paper wrapping my father once told me that only politicians are expected to answer a question with a question george smiled i admit finch is a damned fine climber but he can be a bit much if you have to spend all day with him ten minutes was quite enough for me said cottie what do you mean asked george as he lit his pipe once we were out of sight of everybody he tried to kiss me perhaps hes fallen in love with you said george trying to make light of it i dont think so george she said im not exactly his type but he must find you attractive if he wanted to kiss you only because i was the one girl within fifty miles thirty my dear said george laughing as he tapped his pipe on the rock i see our esteemed leader is on his way he added as he helped cottie back on her feet george was disappointed when young chose not to take the party down a rather interestinglooking descent of lliwedd by way of a sheer rock buttress when they reached the lower slopes he was irritated to discover that he had left his pipe behind and would have to return to the summit to retrieve it cottie agreed to accompany him but when they reached the base of the rock george asked her to wait as he couldnt be bothered to take the long route around the giant obstacle she watched in amazement as he began to climb straight up the sheer rock face showing no sign of fear once he had reached the top he grabbed his pipe put it in his pocket and came straight back down by the same route over dinner that evening cottie told the rest of the party what she had witnessed that afternoon from the looks of incredulity on their faces it was clear that no one believed her george finch even burst out laughing and whispered to geoffrey young she thinks hes sir galahad young didnt laugh he was beginning to wonder if george mallory might be the ideal person to accompany him on a climb even the royal geographical society considered impossible a month later young wrote to seven climbers inviting them to join his party for the italian alps during the summer vacation he made it clear that he wouldnt select the pair who would make the assault on mont blanc from the courmayeur valley until he had seen which of them acclimatized best to the hazardous conditions guy bullock and cottie sanders did not receive invitations as young believed that their presence would be a distraction distractions he pronounced when the team gathered in southampton are all very well when youre spending a weekend in wales but not when youre in courmayeur attempting to climb some of the most treacherous slopes in europe chapter eleven saturday july th like burglars in the night the two of them slipped out of the hotel unnoticed carrying the swag under their arms silently they crossed an unlit road and disappeared into the forest aware that it would be some time before they were missed by their colleagues who were probably dressing for dinner the first few days had gone well they had pitched up at courmayeur on the friday to find that the weather was perfect for climbing a week later with the aiguille du chardonnet the grépon and mont maudit under their belts to use one of geoffrey youngs favorite expressions they were all prepared for the final challengeassuming the weather held when seven oclock struck on the hotels grandfather clock the honorary chairman of the cumc tapped the side of his glass with a spoon the rest of the committee fell silent item number one said geoffrey young glancing down at his agenda the election of a new member mr george leigh mallory has been proposed by mr somervell and seconded by mr odell he looked up those in favor five hands were raised carried unanimously said young and a ripple of applause followedsomething he had never experienced before i therefore declare george leigh mallory elected as a member of the cumc perhaps someone should go and look for him said odell and tell him the good news if youre hoping to find mallory youd better put on your climbing boots said young without explanation i know he isnt a cambridge man said somervell but i propose that we invite george finch to be an honorary member of the club after all hes a fine climber no one seemed willing to second the proposal george struck a match and lit the little primus stove the two men in the tent sat crosslegged facing each other they warmed their hands while they waited for the water to boil a slow process when youre halfway up a mountain george placed two mugs on the ground while finch ripped the wrapping off a bar of kendal mint cake broke it in half and passed a chunk across to his climbing partner the previous day the two of them had stood together on the summit of mont maudit and stared up at mont blanc a mere feet above them wondering if they would be looking down from its peak tomorrow george checked his watch pm by now geoffrey young would be taking the rest of the team through tomorrows program having informed them who would be joining him on the final ascent the water boiled this has been quite a remarkable week for climbing continued young in fact i would go so far as to say that it has been among the most memorable of my career which only makes my selection of who will join me for the attack on the summit tomorrow all the more difficult i am painfully aware that some of you have waited years for this opportunity but more than one of you has to be disappointed as you are all well aware reaching the summit of mont blanc is not technically difficult for an experienced climberunless of course he attempts it from the courmayeur side he paused the climbing party will consist of five men myself somervell odell mallory and finch we will set out at four oclock tomorrow morning and press on to feet where we will rest for two hours if that capricious mistress the weather allows us the final team of three will make an attempt on the summit odell and somervell will descend to the grand mulets hut at feet where somervell will await the return of the final party triumphant return said somervell magnanimously although he and odell could barely conceal their frustration at not having been chosen for the assault on the summit lets hope so said young i know how disappointed some of you must feel not to be selected for the climbing party but never forget that without a backup team it wouldnt be possible to conquer any mountain and every member of the team will have played his part should tomorrows attempt fail for any reason i shall be inviting odell and somervell to join me later in the week when we will make a second attempt on the summit the two men smiled slightly ruefully as if theyd won a silver medal at the olympic games there is nothing more for me to say other than to tell you who i have chosen to join me for the final ascent george removed a glove unscrewed the jar of bovril and dropped a spoonful of the thick brown substance into the mugs finch added the hot water and stirred until he was sure there was nothing left on the bottom before he handed george his drink george broke a second bar of kendal mint cake and passed the larger portion across to finch neither spoke while they savored their gourmet meal it was george who eventually broke the silence i wonder who young will pick youre certain to be selected said finch warming his hands around his mug but i dont know who else hell choose out of odell somervell and me if he picks the best climber then the final place is mine why wouldnt he pick the best climber im not an oxford or cambridge man old boy said finch mimicking his companions accent youngs no snob said george he wont let that influence his decision we could of course preempt that decision suggested finch with a grin george looked puzzled what do you have in mind we could set out for the summit first thing in the morning and then sit around waiting to see which of them joins us it would be a pyrrhic victory george suggested as he drained his drink a victorys a victory said finch ask any epirote how he feels about the word pyrrhic george made no comment as he crawled into his sleeping bag finch undid his fly buttons before slipping out of the tent he looked up at the peak of mont blanc glistening in the moonlight and even wondered if he could manage to climb it alone when he crawled back into the tent george was already fast asleep i cant find either of them said odell as he joined the rest of his colleagues for dinner ive looked everywhere theyve got an important day tomorrow so theyll be trying to rest said young as a bowl of hot consommé was placed in front of him but its never easy to sleep at minus twenty degrees i will have to make a slight adjustment to tomorrows plan everyone around the table stopped eating and turned toward him odell somervell and i will be joined by herford but what about mallory and finch asked odell i have a feeling that the two of them will already be sitting at grand mulets waiting for us to join them chapter twelve mallory and finch had already finished lunch by the time young and his party joined them at the grand mulets refuge neither of them spoke as they waited to see how the expeditions leader would react to their impudence have you already tried for the top asked young i wanted to said finch as he followed young into the hut but mallory advised against it shrewd fellow mallory said young before unfolding an old parchment map and laying it out on the table george and finch listened intently as he took them all through his proposed route for the last feet this will be my seventh attempt from the courmayeur side he said and if we make it it will only be the third time so the odds are worse than fiftyfifty young folded the map up and stowed it in his rucksack he shook hands with somervell herford and odell thank you gentlemen he said well make every effort to be back with you by five half past at the latest see that you have a cup of earl grey on the boil he added with a smile we cant risk being any later he said as he looked up at the forbidding peak before turning to face his chosen companions time to rope up i can assure you gentlemen this is one lady you dont want to be out with after dark for the next hour the three of them worked their way steadily along a narrow ridge that would take them to within a thousand feet of the summit george was beginning to wonder what all the fuss was about but that was before they reached the barn door a vast pinnacle of ice with sheer rock on both sides acting as bookends there was a simpler longer route to the summit but as young told them that was for women and children young sat at the foot of the barn door and checked his map once again now youll begin to understand why we spent all those weekends honing our rockclimbing skills george couldnt take his eyes off the barn door looking for any cracks in the surface or indentations where other climbers had gone before them he placed a foot tentatively in a small fissure no said young firmly as he walked across to take the lead next year possibly young began to slowly traverse the giant overhanging pinnacle often disappearing from view only roped together as if by an umbilical cord to reappear a few moments later each of them realized that if one of them made a single mistake they would all come tumbling down finch looked up young was out of sight and all he could see of george were the heels of two hobnail boots disappearing over a ridge inch by inch foot by foot mallory and finch followed slowly behind young aware that if they made the slightest error of judgment the barn door would be slammed in their faces and seconds later they would be buried in an unmarked grave inch by inch at grand mulets odell stood over a wood fire toasting a piece of bread while herford boiled a pot of water to make tea i wonder how far theyve got said odell trying to find the key to the barn door would be my bet said somervell i ought to be getting back said odell so i can follow their progress through the hotels telescope the moment i see that theyve joined you ill put in our orders for dinner along with a bottle of champagne suggested somervell young heaved himself up onto the ledge above the barn door he didnt have to wait long before the two georges joined him no one spoke for some time and even finch didnt pretend he wasnt exhausted a mere feet above them loomed the summit of mont blanc dont think of it as being feet away young said its more like a couple of miles and every foot you take will be into thinner and thinner air he checked his watch so dont lets keep the lady waiting although the stony terrain appeared less demanding than the barn door the climb was still treacherous crevices icy stones and uneven rocks covered in only a thin film of snow lay in wait for them should they make the slightest mistake the summit looked tantalizingly close but the lady turned out to be a tease it was another two hours before young finally placed a foot on the summit when mallory first saw the view from the highest peak in the alps he was lost for words magnifique he finally managed as he looked down on madame blancs precocious offspring which stretched as far as the eye could see its one of the ironies of mountaineering said young that grown men are happy to spend months preparing for a climb weeks rehearsing and honing their skills and at least a day attempting to reach the summit and then having achieved their goal they spend just a few moments enjoying the experience along with one or two equally certifiable companions who have little in common other than wanting to do it all again but a little higher george nodded while finch said nothing theres one act i have to carry out gentlemen said young before we begin our descent he took a sovereign from his jacket pocket bent down and placed it in the snow at his feet mallory and finch watched the little ritual with fascination but said nothing the king of england sends his compliments maam said young and hopes that you will grant his humble subjects safe passage back to their homeland when odell arrived back at the hotel a few minutes after four the first thing he did was order a large flask of hot fruit punch before walking out onto the veranda to take up his post he peered through the large telescope and once hed focused on a rabbit scurrying into the forest he turned his attention to the mountain he swung the telescope further up the peak but although it was a clear day he knew that the climbing party would be no larger than ants so searching for them would be pointless odell swung the telescope lower down and focused on the wooden hut at the grand mulets refuge he thought he could see two figures standing outside it but he couldnt make out which was somervell and which was herford a waiter in a white jacket appeared by his side and poured him a cup of hot punch odell leaned back and enjoyed the sensation as the warm liquid slipped down his parched throat he allowed himself to imagine for a moment what it must feel like to be standing on the peak of mont blanc having unlocked the barn door he returned to the telescope although he didnt expect to see much activity at the grand mulets before five oclock young was a reliable sort of cove so he expected him to be on time once the climbing team reappeared he would have that bottle of champagne put on ice to share with those who would be returning in triumph the grandfather clock in the hall struck once to indicate that it was pm he focused the telescope on the grand mulets refuge in case the climbing party was ahead of schedule but there was still no sign of any activity he moved the telescope slowly up the mountain hoping to see three specks appear in the lens dear god no he exclaimed as the waiter poured him a second glass of punch una problema signore inquired the waiter an avalanche replied odell chapter thirteen george heard the unmistakable roar behind him but didnt have time to turn around the snow hit him like a giant wave sweeping all before it he tried desperately to remain the right way up making firm breaststrokes with his arms in the hope of keeping a pocket of air in front of his face so that he could buy some time just as the safety manual recommended but when the second wave hit him he knew he was going to die the third and final wave tossed him like a loose pebble down and down and down his last thoughts were of his mother who had always dreaded this moment then of his father who never spoke of it and finally of his brother and sisters who would all outlive him was this hell and then he came to a sudden halt he lay still for a moment trying to convince himself that he was still alive and to take in his immediate surroundings he had landed at the bottom of a crevasse cast into an aladdins cave of ice the beauty of which he might have appreciated in any other circumstances what did the manual recommend quickly work out which way is up and which is down so that you can at least start heading in the right direction he spotted a shaft of murky gray light thirty perhaps forty feet above him he recalled the manuals next instruction find out if anything is broken he wiggled the fingers and thumb of his right hand hed still got five his left hand was very cold but at least there was some movement there too he stretched his right leg and tentatively raised it off the ground he had one leg he raised his left legtwo he placed his hands by his side and pushed himself up slowly very slowly his fingers were beginning to freeze he looked for his gloves they were nowhere to be seen he must have lost them during his fall the cave was lined with ridges of ice protruding from every side making several natural ladders to the roof but were they safe he crawled across the soft snow to the far side of his prison and kicked at the ice with the toe of his hobnailed boot it made no impression the ice had taken a hundred years perhaps even longer to grow to that thickness and wasnt going to be budged easily george became a little more confident but kept reminding himself to abide by the rules not to hurry and not to take any unnecessary risks he spent some time trying to work out which rungs of the ladder he should mount it looked as if the best route was on the far side of the cave so he crawled back on his hands and knees and grabbed at the bottom rung he prayed when youre in danger you need to believe there is a god he placed a foot tentatively on a ridge of ice a few inches above the ground then gripped another above it with his bare fingers now numb with cold and pulled himself slowly up he risked placing his full weight on the lower ridge because if it broke off he would only have a short fall into the soft snow it didnt which gave him the confidence to climb onto the next rung of his jacobs ladder and find out if he was about to join the angels or his fellow humans he was about halfway up feeling more confident with each move when a piece of ice broke off in his hand his feet immediately slithered off the ice below leaving him dangling by one hand some thirty feet above the floor george began to sweat in a crevasse that must have been minus forty degrees he swung slowly backward and forward certain that the gods above him had simply decided to extend his life by a few minutes and at any moment the ice he was clinging to would shear off then one foot found a toehold followed by the other he held his breath the fingers of his right hand almost glued to the ice above him his strength was beginning to ebb away he took some time before selecting the next rung of the ladder just three more and he would be able to push himself through the chink of light he picked the next rung carefully and then the next and at last he was able to punch a fist through the little crack above him he would have cheered but he couldnt waste the time as the last rays of sunlight were fast disappearing behind the highest peak george pushed his head through the hole and looked tentatively to his left and right he didnt need a manual to tell him it made sense to clear the snow around him if he was to have any chance of finding a rock or a hard place he swept away with his bare hands until he uncovered a slab of rock that had recently been covered by the avalanche gathering all the strength he possessed he hauled himself out of the hole and clung on to the edge of the rock he didnt hang around but like a crab scurried across its surface fearful that he might slide back down the icy rock and return to the bottom of the crevasse that was when he heard a voice singing waltzing matilda no prizes for guessing who the soloist was george continued his painful advance across the snow until the source of the voice took shape finch was sitting bolt upright repeating the chorus again and again he clearly didnt know the second verse is that you george finch cried out as he peered through the falling snow it was the first time finch had ever called him by his christian name yes it is george shouted as he crawled up to his side are you all right im just fine said finch apart from a broken leg and the fact that the toes of my left foot are beginning to freeze up i must have lost a boot somewhere along the way what about you never better old chap said george bloody english said finch if were to have any chance of getting out of here youll need to find my torch where do i start looking the last time i saw it it was some way up the mountain george set off like a toddler on his hands and knees he was beginning to despair until he spotted a black object resting in the snow a few yards ahead of him he cheered he cursed it was only finchs missing boot he struggled on until he was able to cheer again when he saw the handle of the torch sticking out of the snow he grabbed at it and prayed once more before flicking the switch a beam of light glowed in the dusk thank god he murmured and returned down the mountain to where finch was lying no sooner had george reached him than they both heard the moan that must be young said finch better go and see if you can help but for gods sake turn off that torch until the suns completely disappeared if odell spotted the avalanche from the hotel a rescue party should be on their way by now but they wont reach us for hours george switched off the torch and began to crawl in the direction of the moan but it was some time before he came across a body lying motionless in the snow the right leg buckled under the left thigh waltzing matilda waltzing matilda wholl come awaltzing matilda george quickly cleared the snow around youngs mouth but made no attempt to move him hold on old friend he whispered in his ear somervell and herford should be on their way by now theyre certain to be with us soon he only wished he believed his own words he took youngs hand and began to rub trying to get some circulation back all the time having to brush away the falling snow waltzing matilda waltzing matilda wholl come awaltzing matilda odell ran out of the front door of the hotel and onto the driveway he immediately began to turn the wheel of the ancient klaxon which produced a deafening screeching sound that would alert somervell and herford to the danger when the sun finally disappeared behind the highest peak george placed the torch firmly in the snow facing down the mountain he switched it on and a beam of light flickered but how long would it last waltzing matilda waltzing matilda wholl come awaltzing matilda with me and he sang as he there was nothing in the safety manual about what to do about an australian singing out of tune thought george as he rested his head in the snow and began to drift off to sleep not a bad way to die youll come awaltzing matilda with me when george woke he couldnt be sure where he was how hed got there or how long hed been there then he saw a nurse he slept when he woke again somervell was standing by the side of his bed he gave george a warm smile welcome back he said how long have i been away two or three days give or take but the doctors are confident theyll have you back on your feet within a week and finch hes got one leg in plaster but hes eating a hearty breakfast and still singing waltzing matilda to any nurse who cares to listen what about young george asked fearing the worst hes still unconscious suffering from hypothermia and a broken arm the medical chaps are doing everything they can to patch him up and if they do manage to save his life hell have you to thank me said george if it hadnt been for your torch we would never have found you it wasnt my torch said george it was finchs george slept chapter fourteen tuesday july th once youve stared death in the face nothing is ever the same again said young it places you apart from other men george poured his guest a cup of tea i wanted to see you mallory to make sure it wasnt that dreadful experience that has caused you to stop climbing of course it wasnt said george theres a far better reason my tutor has warned me that i wont be considered for a doctorate unless i get a first and what are your chances of that old fellow it seems im a borderline case i cant allow myself not to succeed simply because i didnt work hard enough understandable said young but all work and no play id rather be a dull success than a bright failure retorted george but once your exams are over mallory will you consider joining me in the alps next summer i certainly will said george smiling if theres one thing i fear even more than failing to get a first its the thought of finch standing on the peaks of higher and higher mountains singing waltzing matilda hes just had his degree results said young and guy was astonished by the amount of work george put in as his finals approached he didnt take even a day off during the spring vacation to visit penypass or cornwall let alone the alps his only companions were kings dictators and potentates and his only excursions were to battlefields in faroff lands as he studied night and day right up until the morning of the exams after five days of continual writing and eleven different papers george still couldnt be sure how well hed done only the very clever and the very stupid ever are once hed handed in his final paper he emerged from the examination room and stepped out into the sunlight to find guy sitting on the steps of schools waiting to greet him a bottle of champagne in one hand two glasses in the other george sat down beside him and smiled dont ask he said as guy began to remove the wire from around the cork for the next ten days a period of limbo followed as the examinees waited for the examiners to tell them the class of degree they had been awarded and with it what future had been determined for them however much mr benson tried to reassure his pupil that it had been a closerun thing the fact was that george leigh mallory had been awarded a secondclass honors degree and therefore would not be returning to magdalene college in the michaelmas term to work on a doctorate and it didnt help when the senior tutor added when you know youre beaten give in gracefully despite an invitation from geoffrey young to spend a month with him in the alps that summer george packed his bags and took the next train back to birkenhead if you had asked him he would have described the next four weeks as a period of reflection although the word his father continually used was denial while his mother in the privacy of the bedroom described her sons uncharacteristic behavior as sulking hes not a child any more she said he must make up his mind what hes going to do with the rest of his life despite his wifes remonstrations it was another week before the reverend mallory got round to tackling headon the subject of his sons future im weighing up my options george told him though id like to be an author in fact ive already begun work on a book on boswell possibly illuminating but unlikely to be remunerative replied his father i assume you have no desire to live in a garret and survive on bread and water george was unable to disagree have you thought about applying for a commission in the army youd make a damn fine soldier ive never been very good at obeying authority george replied have you considered taking up holy orders no because i fear theres an insurmountable obstacle and what might that be i dont believe in god said george simply that hasnt prevented some of my most distinguished colleagues from taking the cloth said his father george laughed youre such an old cynic papa the reverend mallory ignored his sons comment perhaps you should consider politics my boy im sure you could find a constituency that would be delighted to have you as its mp it might help if i knew which party i supported said george and in any case while mps remain unpaid politics is nothing more than a rich mans hobby not unlike mountaineering suggested his father raising an eyebrow true admitted george so ill have to find a profession which will provide me with sufficient income to allow me to pursue my hobby then its settled said the reverend mallory youll have to be a schoolmaster although george hadnt offered any opinion on his fathers last suggestion the moment he returned to his room he sat down and wrote to his former housemaster inquiring if there were any openings at winchester for a history beak mr irving replied within the week the college he informed george was still considering applications for a classics master but had recently filled the position of junior history tutor george was already regretting his month of reflection however mr irving continued i hear on the grapevine that charterhouse is looking for a history master and should you think of applying for the post i would be only too happy to act as a referee ten days later george traveled down to surrey for an interview with the headmaster of charterhouse the reverend gerald rendall mr irving had warned george that almost anything would seem an anticlimax after winchester and cambridge but george was pleasantly surprised by how much he enjoyed his visit he was both delighted and relieved when the headmaster invited him to join the staff ahead of three other applicants what george could not have foretold when he wrote back to the reverend rendall accepting the appointment was that it would not be the school but one of the governors who would alter the course of his life chapter fifteen i would need two firstclass climbers to join me for the final assault geoffrey young replied do you have anyone in mind asked the secretary of the royal geographical society yes said young firmly not wishing to divulge their names then perhaps youd better have a word with both of them said hinks and in the strictest confidence because unless the dalai lama gives his blessing we wont even be allowed to cross the border into tibet ill write to both of them this evening said young nothing in writing would be my advice said the secretary young nodded and i also need you to do me a small favor when captain scott one of the problems george faced during his first few weeks at charterhouse was that if he wasnt wearing his mortar board and gown he was often mistaken for one of the boys he enjoyed his first year at the school far more than hed expected even if the lower fifth was populated by a group of monsters determined to disrupt his lessons however when those same boys returned for their final year in the sixth form to georges surprise several of them were entirely reformed characters all their energies directed toward securing a place at the university of their choice george was happy to spend countless hours helping them to achieve that objective however when his father inquired during the summer vacation what had given him the most satisfaction he mentioned coaching the colts football eleven in the winter and the underfourteen hockey team during the spring but most of all taking a group of boys hill walking in the summer and just occasionally he said one comes across an exceptional boy who displays real talent and curiosity and is certain to make his name in the world and have you met such a paragon his father inquired yes replied george without further elucidation on a warm summer evening george traveled to london by train and made his way on foot to no savile row in mayfair to join geoffrey young for dinner a porter accompanied him to the members bar where george found his host chatting to a group of elderly climbers who were repeating tall stories about even taller mountains when young spotted his guest entering the room he broke away and guided george toward the dining room with the words i fear a bar stool is the highest thing that lot can climb nowadays while they enjoyed a meal of brown windsor soup and steak and kidney pie followed by vanilla ice cream young took george through the program he had planned for their forthcoming trip to the alps but george had a feeling that his host had something more important on his mind as he had already written to him setting out in great detail which new climbs they would be attempting that summer it wasnt until they retired to the library for coffee and brandy that george discovered the real purpose behind youngs invitation mallory said young once they had settled in the far corner of the room i wondered if youd care to join me as my guest at the rgs next thursday evening when captain scott will be addressing the society on his forthcoming expedition to the south pole george nearly spilled his coffee he was so excited by the prospect of hearing the intrepid explorer talk about his voyage of discovery not least because hed recently read in the times that every ticket had been taken up within hours of the society announcing the speaker for its annual memorial lecture how did you manage to began george as a committee member of the alpine club i was able to wangle a couple of extra tickets out of the secretary of the rgs however he did request a small favor in return george wanted to ask two questions at once but it quickly became clear that young had already anticipated them of course youll be interested to know who my other guest is said young george nodded well it wont come as much of a surprise because ive invited the only other climber in your class young paused but i must confess that the favor the rgs secretary requested did come as a surprise george put down his coffee cup on a side table folded his arms and waited its quite simple really young said once captain scott has finished his lecture and calls for questions the secretary wants you to raise your hand chapter sixteen it was one of those rare occasions when george was on time he had rehearsed his question during the train journey up from godalming and although he felt confident that he knew the answer he was still puzzled why the rgs secretary wanted him to ask it george had been disappointed when hed read in the times earlier that year that it was an american robert peary not an englishman who had been the first to reach the north pole but as the subject of captain scotts lecture was the south pole yet unconquered he assumed that just as geoffrey young had suggested the great explorer was about to make a second attempt to make amends george jumped off the train at waterloo as it came to a halt ran along the platform and handed in his ticket before going off in search of a hansom cab young had warned him that such was scotts popularity most of the seats would be taken at least an hour before the lecture was due to begin there was already a small queue forming at the entrance to the rgs by the time george presented his invitation card he joined the chattering crowd as they made their way to the lecture theater on the ground floor when george entered the recently built theater he was surprised by how grand it was the oakpaneled walls were covered with oil paintings of past presidents of the rgs while the dark parquet floor was covered by what must have been five hundred plush red chairs perhaps even more the raised stage at the front of the hall was dominated by a fulllength portrait of king george v george scanned the rows searching for geoffrey young he finally spotted him on the far side of the room seated next to finch george quickly made his way across the hall and took the seat next to young i couldnt have held on to it for much longer said young with a grin sorry said george as he leaned across to shake hands with finch he looked around the theater to see if he knew anyone somervell herford and odell were seated near the back the thing that struck george most was that there were no women in the body of the hall he knew they could not be elected as fellows of the rgs but why couldnt they attend as guests he could only wonder what would have happened if cottie sanders had been one of geoffrey youngs guests would they have put her in the front row perhaps which remained unoccupied he glanced toward the upper gallery where several smartly dressed ladies in long gowns and shawls were taking their seats he frowned before turning his attention back to the stage where two men were erecting a large silver screen in the central aisle another man was checking slides in a magic lantern flicking the shutter backward and forward the lecture theater was filling up quickly and long before the clock below the gallery chimed eight times a number of members and their guests found themselves having to stand in the aisles and at the back of the room on the eighth chime the committee crocodilelike entered the room and took their places in the front row while a short elegantly dressed gentleman wearing a white tie and tails strode up onto the stage to be greeted with loud applause he raised the palms of his hands as if warming himself by a fire and immediately the applause died down good evening ladies and gentlemen he began my name is sir francis younghusband i have the honor of being your chairman this evening and i believe that tonights lecture promises to be one of the most exciting in the societys long history the rgs prides itself on being a world leader in two different but not unrelated fields first the surveying and drawing up of maps of previously uncharted territories and second exploring those distant and dangerous lands where no white man has ever trodden before one of the societys statutes allows us to support and encourage those singleminded individuals who are willing to travel the length and breadth of the globe risking their lives in the service of the british empire one such man is our lecturer tonight and i have no doubt continued sir francis as he glanced up at the portrait of the king that we are about to learn of his plans to make a second attempt to be the first of his majestys subjects to reach the south pole it is a wellworn phrase to suggest that a speaker needs no introduction but i suspect there isnt a man woman or child in our land who does not know the name captain robert falcon scott rn the audience rose as one as a cleanshaven stockily built man with fierce blue eyes and in a naval uniform marched out from the wings he took his place at the center of the stage his legs thrust apart giving the impression that he did not intend to be moved for some time he smiled down at his audience and unlike sir francis made no attempt to quell their enthusiasm ensuring that it was some time before he was able to speak george was captivated from scotts first sentence he spoke for over an hour never once referring to notes while dozens of slides projected on the screen behind him brought dramatically to life his previous expedition to the antarctic in his ship the discovery his words were regularly interrupted by spontaneous bursts of applause the audience learned how captain scott went about selecting his team and the qualities he demanded loyalty courage and unquestioning discipline were it seemed to him prerequisites he then went on to explain the deprivation and hardship his men would have to take for granted if they hoped to survive for four months in the antarctic trekking four hundred miles across a frozen wasteland on an uncharted journey to the south pole george stared in disbelief at images of men who had been on his previous expedition some of whom had lost not only fingers and toes to severe frostbite but ears and in one case even a nose one of the slides caused a woman in the gallery to faint scott paused for a moment before adding each of the men who accompanies me on this enterprise must be prepared to undergo such suffering if he still hopes to be standing when we eventually reach the south pole and never forget my most important responsibility is to ensure that all my men return home safely george only wished that he could be among those who would be invited to join scott but he knew that an inexperienced schoolmaster whose greatest achievement to date was conquering mont blanc was an unlikely candidate for scotts team scott ended his lecture by thanking the rgs its committee and fellows for their continued support aware that without their backing he couldnt even consider raising anchor at tilbury let alone docking in mcmurdo sound fully equipped and ready to carry out such an ambitious enterprise when the lights came up scott gave a slight bow and the audience rose as one to acknowledge a very british hero george could only wonder what it must feel like to be standing on that stage receiving such plaudits and more important what would be expected of him to prove worthy of such adulation when the applause eventually died down and the audience resumed their places scott thanked them once again before inviting questions from the floor a gentleman rose in the front row thats arthur hinks whispered geoffrey young hes just been appointed secretary of the rgs sir hinks began rumors abound that the norwegians led by amundsen are also planning an assault on the south pole does this concern you no it does not mr hinks replied scott let me assure you and the societys fellows that it will be an englishman not a viking who will be the first to reach the south pole once again these sentiments were greeted with loud applause from the dozen hands that shot up scott next selected a man seated in the third row the left breast of his dinner jacket was adorned with rows of campaign medals i read in the times this morning sir that the norwegians are willing to use motorized sledges as well as dogs to make sure they reach the pole ahead of you several cries of shame emanated from the body of the hall may i ask what your response is to this blatant disregard of the amateur code finch looked at the questioner in disbelief i shall simply ignore them general scott replied my enterprise remains a challenge of mans superiority over the elements and i am in no doubt that i have assembled a group of gentlemen who are more than ready to face this challenge cries of hear hear came from every quarter of the packed hall although finch did not join in and allow me to add continued scott that i intend to be the first human to reach the south pole not the first dog he paused unless of course its a bulldog laughter followed before several more hands shot up georges among them however captain scott answered three more questions before he pointed in georges direction a young gentleman on the end of the fifth row is showing the sort of determination i look for when selecting my team so lets hear what he has to say george rose slowly from his place his legs shaking he felt five hundred pairs of eyes staring at him sir he said his voice quivering once you have reached the south pole what will there be left for an englishman to conquer he collapsed back onto his chair as some of the audience burst out laughing while others applauded a puzzled expression appeared on finchs face why would mallory ask a question he already knew the answer to the next great challenge for any englishman said scott without hesitation will undoubtedly be the scaling of the highest mountain on earth mount everest in the himalaya it stands at over feet above sea levelthats almost five and a half miles high my boyand we have no idea how the human body will react to such altitude as no man has yet been above feet and thats before you consider temperatures that can fall below minus forty degrees fahrenheit and winds that will cut your skin to shreds but of one thing i am certain dogs and motorized sledges will be of little use up there he paused and looking directly at george added but whoever succeeds in that magnificent endeavor will be the first man to stand on the roof of the world i envy him let us hope that he will be an englishman however scott concluded turning his attention to a lady seated in the front row of the gallery i have already promised my wife that i will leave that particular challenge to a younger man scott looked back down at george as the audience burst once again into spontaneous applause finchs hand immediately shot up and scott nodded in response do you consider yourself to be an amateur or a professional sir an audible gasp could be heard around the hall as finch stared defiantly at the speaker scott took his time before replying never once taking his eyes off finch i am an amateur he eventually replied but an amateur who surrounds himself with professionals my doctors engineers drivers and even my cooks are all fully qualified and would be insulted were you to describe them as amateurs but they would be even more insulted if you were to suggest that their presence on this expedition was motivated by a desire for financial gain this reply was greeted by the loudest applause of the evening and prevented anyone other than young and mallory from hearing finch say if he really believes that he has no hope of coming back alive after two or three more questions scott once again thanked the rgs for sponsoring the lecture and for their wholehearted backing of his latest enterprise this was followed by a vote of thanks from mr hinks on behalf of the society after which the audience stood to attention and lustily sang the national anthem while young and finch joined those leaving the theater george remained in his place unable to take his eyes off the stage scott had occupied a stage from which one day he intended to address the rgs finch grinned when he looked back and saw the immovable mallory turning to young he said hell still be sitting there listening just as intently when its my turn to deliver the annual lecture young smiled at the presumptuous pup and what dare i ask will be the subject of your talk everest conquered finch replied because this lotgesturing with a sweeping armwont let me stand on that stage unless im the man who gets there first book two the other woman chapter seventeen monday february th when elizabeth ascended the english throne in neither the court nor the common people welcomed her as their monarch however when she died in fortyfive years later the virgin queen was as popular as her father king henry the eighth had ever been sir sir said a boy in the front row his hand held high yes carter minor said george whats a virgin sir george ignored the sniggers that followed and carried on as if he had been asked a serious question a virgin is a female who is virgo intacta carter minor i hope your latin is up to it should it not be you can always look up luke to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was josephand the virgins name was mary but back to elizabeth this was the golden era of shakespeare and marlowe of drake and raleigh a time when the english not only defeated the spanish armada but also put down a civil insurrection led by the earl of essex who some historians have suggested was the queens lover several inevitable hands shot up wainwright said george wearily only too aware what his question was going to be whats a lover sir george smiled a lover is a man who lives with a woman but not in the state of holy matrimony then theres no chance of a lover being virgo intacta is there sir said wainwright with a smirk you are quite right wainwright although i suspect that elizabeth never took a lover as it would have called her authority as monarch into question another hand shot up but wouldnt the court and the common people have preferred to have a man like the earl of essex on the throne rather than a woman george smiled again graves one of those rare boys who preferred the classroom to the games field was not one to ask frivolous questions by that time graves even elizabeths original detractors would have preferred her to the earl of essex indeed over three hundred years later this woman surely ranks as the equal of any man in the pantheon of english monarchs he concluded as the chapel bell sounded in the distance george looked around to see if there were any more questions there were none he sighed that will be all then he said but gentlemen he added his voice rising please be sure that your essays on the religious and political significance of henry the eighths marriage to anne boleyn are on my desk by midday on thursday an audible groan went up as the lower fifth gathered their text books and made their way out of the classroom george picked up the blackboard duster and began to rub out the names and dates of henrys six queens he turned around to see that graves was still sitting in his place can you name all six of them robert and the years in which they became queen he asked catherine of aragon anne boleyn jane seymour anne of cleves catherine howard and catherine parr and next week ill teach you a simple way of recalling their fates divorced beheaded died divorced beheaded survived you told us last week sir did i indeed said george as he placed the duster back on his desk seemingly unaware of just how much chalk had ended up on his gown george followed graves out of the classroom and made his way across the quad to the masters common room to join his colleagues for the midmorning break although he had proved to be a popular master with the majority of staff as well as the boys he was well aware that not all of his colleagues approved of what they described in hushed tones as his laissezfaire attitude and one or two of them openly voiced the opinion that the lack of discipline in his classes was undermining their own authority especially when they had to teach the lower fifth on the same day when dr rendall decided the time had come to take mallory to one side and have a word with him on the subject george simply informed him that he believed in selfexpression otherwise how could any boy realize his full potential as the headmaster had no idea what selfexpression meant he decided not to press the matter after all he was due to retire at the end of the school year when it would become someone elses responsibility george had made only one real friend among his colleagues andrew osullivan had been a contemporary of his at cambridge although they had never met he had read geography and won a boxing blue while he was at fitzwilliam but despite the fact that he showed no interest in mountaineering and even less in the beliefs of quintus fabius maximus he and george had immediately found that they enjoyed each others company when george entered the common room he spotted andrew slumped in a comfortable leather chair by the window reading a newspaper george poured himself a cup of tea and strolled across to join his friend have you seen the times this morning andrew asked no said george placing his cup and saucer on the table between them i usually catch up with the news after evensong the papers correspondent in delhi said andrew is reporting that lord curzon has brokered a deal with the dalai lama to allow a select group of climbers to enter george leaned forward a little too quickly and knocked over his colleagues tea cup sorry andrew he said as he grabbed the newspaper andrew looked faintly amused by his friends rare lapse of good manners but said nothing until george had handed the paper back the rgs is inviting interested parties to apply continued andrew are you by any chance my dear mallory an interested party george didnt want to answer until hed given the question a little more thought and was relieved when the bell alerting masters that break would end in five minutes came to his rescue well said andrew as he rose from his chair if you feel unable to answer that particular question allow me to put a less demanding one to you are you doing anything other than reading the times on thursday evening marking the lower fifths essays on the armada said george i do believe that lot finds a sadistic pleasure in rewriting history wainwright even appears to think that the spanish won the battle and drake ended up in the tower andrew laughed its just that one of the school governors a mr thackeray turner has invited me to join him for dinner that night and asked if id like to bring a friend its kind of you to think of me andrew george said as they walked out of the common room and into the quad but i expect mr turner meant a lady friend i doubt it said andrew at least not while hes still got three unmarried daughters chapter eighteen thursday february th george chalked his cue he liked thackeray turner the moment he met him blunt open and straightforward if somewhat oldfashioned and forever testing your mettle andrew had told george on the journey to turners home that he was an architect by profession when george was driven through a fine pair of wroughtiron gates and down a long avenue of lime trees to see westbrook for the first time nestling in the surrey hills surrounded by the most magnificent flower beds lawns and a sunken water garden he didnt need to be told why turner had made such a success of his career before they had reached the top step a butler had opened the front door for them he guided them silently down a long corridor where they found turner waiting in the billiard room as his dinner jacket was hanging over the back of a nearby chair george assumed that he was prepared for battle time for a game before the ladies come down for dinner were turners first words to his guests george admired a fulllength portrait of his host by lavery above the fireplace and other nineteenthcentury watercolors that adorned the wallsincluding one by his hosts namesakebefore he removed his jacket and rolled up his sleeves once the three balls had been placed in position on the green baize george was quickly introduced to another side of his hosts character mr turner liked winning and even expected to win what he hadnt anticipated was that george didnt like losing george wasnt sure if andrew was simply happy to humor the old man or just wasnt that good a player either way george wasnt quite so willing to fall in with his hosts expectations your turn old fellow said turner after he had posted a break of eleven george took some time considering his shot and when he handed his cue to andrew hed amassed a break of fourteen it soon became clear that turner had met his match so he decided to try a different tactic osullivan tells me that youre a bit of a radical mallory george smiled he wasnt going to let turner get the better of him on or off the table if you are alluding to my support for universal suffrage you would be correct sir andrew frowned only three points he said before adding that sum to his meager total turner returned to the table and didnt speak again until he had posted another twelve to his name but just as george bent down to line up his next shot turner asked so you would give women the vote george stood back up and chalked his cue i most certainly would sir he replied before lining up the balls once again but they havent been sufficiently educated to take on such a responsibility said turner and in any case how can one ever expect a woman to make a rational judgment george bent over the table again and this time he had scored another twentyone points before he handed over his cue to andrew who failed to score theres a simple way to remedy that said george and what might that be asked turner as he surveyed the table and considered his options allow women to be properly educated in the first place so that they can go to university and study for the same degrees as men presumably this would not apply to oxford and cambridge on the contrary said george oxford and cambridge must lead the way because then the rest will surely follow women with degrees snorted turner its unthinkable he bent down to take his next shot but miscued and the white ball careered into the nearest pocket george had to make a supreme effort not to burst out laughing let me be sure i understand exactly what you are proposing mallory said turner as he handed the cue to his guest you are of the opinion that clever women the ones with degrees from oxford and cambridge should be given the vote no sir that is not what i was proposing said george i believe that the same rule should apply to women as it does to men the stupid ones should get a vote as well a smile appeared on turners lips for the first time since the game had begun i cant see parliament agreeing to that after all turkeys dont usually vote for christmas until one of the turkeys works out that it might just win them the next election george suggested as he successfully executed a cannon and pocketed the red he stood up and smiled my game i believe sir turner nodded reluctantly as he was putting his jacket on there was a gentle tap on the door the butler entered dinner is served sir thank you atkins said their host once hed left the room turner whispered id wager a years income that atkins wouldnt give women the vote and id wager a years income that youve never asked him said george regretting his words the moment he uttered them andrew looked embarrassed but said nothing i do apologize sir said george that remark was unforgivable and not at all dear boy said turner i fear that since my wife died i have become something ofwhats the modern expressionan old fuddyduddy perhaps we should join the ladies for dinner as they crossed the hall he added well played mallory i look forward to a return match when no doubt youll enlighten us with your views on workers rights the butler held open the door to allow turner and his guests to enter the dining room a large oak table that looked more elizabethan than victorian dominated the center of the oakpaneled room six places had been laid with the finest cutlery linen and china as george walked in he caught his breath which he rarely did even when he stood on the top of a mountain although all three of mr turners daughters marjorie ruth and mildred were waiting to be introduced georges gaze remained fixed on ruth causing her to blush and look away dont just stand there mallory said turner noticing that george was still hovering in the doorway they wont bite you in fact youre far more likely to find them in sympathy with your views than mine george stepped forward and shook hands with the three young women and tried not to show his disappointment when his host placed him between marjorie and mildred two maids served the first course a plate of cold salmon and dill while the butler poured half a glass of sancerre for turner to taste george ignored the most appetizing dish hed seen in weeks as he tried to steal the occasional glance at ruth who was seated at the other end of the table she seemed quite unaware of her own beauty botticellian he whispered to himself as he contemplated her fair skin china blue eyes and luxuriant reddish brown hair botticellian he repeated as he picked up his knife and fork is it true mr mallory asked marjorie the eldest of the three sisters interrupting his thoughts that you have met mr george bernard shaw yes miss turner i had the honor of dining with the great man after he addressed the fabian society at cambridge great man be damned said turner hes just another socialist who delights in telling us all how we should conduct our lives the fellow isnt even an englishman marjorie smiled benignly at her father the theater critic of the times she continued still addressing george felt that pygmalion was both witty and thoughtprovoking hes probably a socialist as well said turner between mouthfuls have you seen the play miss turner asked george turning to ruth no mr mallory i havent ruth replied the last theater production we attended was charleys aunt in the village hall and that was only after the vicar had banned a reading of the importance of being earnest written by another irishman said turner whose name should not be mentioned in respectable society dont you agree with me mallory he asked as the first course was removed georges untouched salmon looked as if it was still capable of swimming if respectable society is unable to discuss the two most gifted playwrights of their generation then yes sir i agree with you mildred who had not spoken until that moment leaned across and whispered i do so agree with you mr mallory what about you osullivan asked turner are you of the same opinion as mallory i rarely agree with anything george says replied andrew which is why we remain on such good terms everyone burst out laughing as the butler placed a baron of beef on the sideboard and having presented it to his master for approval began to carve george took advantage of the distraction to glance once again toward the other end of the table only to find that ruth was smiling at andrew i must confess andrew said that i have never attended a play by either gentleman i can assure you osullivan said turner after sampling a glass of red wine that neither of them is a gentleman george was about to respond when mildred jumped in ignore him mr mallory its the one thing our father cant abide george smiled and indulged himself in a more genteel conversation with marjorie about basket weaving until the plates had been cleared away although he did steal a glance toward the other end of the table from time to time ruth didnt appear to notice well gentlemen said mr turner as he folded his napkin let us hope that youve learned one lesson from this evening and what might that be sir asked andrew to make sure that you dont end up with three daughters not least because mallory wont rest until theyve all gone to university and been awarded degrees a capital suggestion mr mallory said mildred had i been given the opportunity to follow my fathers example and become an architect i would have happily done so for the first time that evening mr turner was struck dumb it was some time before he recovered sufficiently to suggest perhaps we should all go through to the drawing room for coffee this time it was the girls who were unable to hide their surprise at papas break with his traditional routine usually he enjoyed a brandy and cigar with his male guests before he even considered joining the ladies a memorable victory mr mallory whispered marjorie as george held back her chair george waited until all three sisters had left the dining room before he made his move he was pleased to see that andrew was deep in conversation with the old man once ruth had taken her place on the sofa in the drawing room george casually strolled across and sat down beside her ruth said nothing and appeared to be looking across at andrew who had joined marjorie on the chaiselongue having achieved his objective george was suddenly lost for words it was some time before ruth came to his rescue did you defeat my father at billiards by any chance mr mallory she eventually offered yes i did miss turner said george as atkins placed a cup of coffee by her side that would explain why he was so argumentative during dinner she took a sip of her coffee before adding should he invite you again mr mallory perhaps it might be more diplomatic to let him win im afraid i could never agree to that miss turner but why not mr mallory because it would reveal a weakness in my character that she might find out about she repeated ruth genuinely puzzled chomolungma goddess mother of the earth but my father told me that it was everest that you were hoping to conquer everest is the name the english have labeled her with but its not the one she answers to your coffee will be getting cold mr mallory said ruth as she glanced across the room thank you miss turner he said taking a sip and are you hoping to become better acquainted with this goddess she inquired in time perhaps miss turner but not before one or two other ladies have fallen under my spell she looked at him more quizzically anyone in particular madame matterhorn he replied its my intention to leave a calling card during the easter vacation he took another sip of his cold coffee before asking and where will you be spending easter miss turner father is taking us to venice in april a city that i suspect would not meet with your approval mr mallory as it languishes only a few feet above sea level its not only elevation that matters miss turner underneath days azure eyes oceans nursling venice lies a peopled labyrinth of walls amphitrites destined halls so you admire shelley said ruth as she placed her empty cup back on a side table george was about to reply when the clock on the mantelpiece struck once to indicate that it was half past the hour andrew rose from his place and turning to his host said its been a delightful evening sir but perhaps the time has come for us to take our leave george glanced at his watch the last thing he wanted to do was take his leave but turner was already on his feet and marjorie was heading toward him she gave him a warm smile i do hope that youll come and see us again soon mr mallory i hope so too said george while still looking in ruths direction mr turner smiled he might not have defeated mallory but one of his daughters certainly had the measure of him chapter nineteen friday february th george didnt want andrew to discover what he was up to he couldnt get ruth out of his mind he had never come across such serene beauty such delightful company and all he had managed to do when left alone with her was stare into those blue eyes and make a complete fool of himself and the more she smiled at andrew the more desperate he had become quite unable to come up with a witty comment or even to manage polite conversation how much he had wanted to hold her hand but mildred had kept distracting him allowing andrew to retain ruths attention did she have any interest in him at all or had andrew already spoken to her father during dinner he had watched the two of them deep in conversation he had to find out what they had talked about he had never felt so pathetic in his life george had observed smitten men in the past and had simply dismissed them as deluded fools but now he had joined their number and even worse his goddess appeared to favor another creature andrew isnt worthy of her george said out loud before he fell asleep but then he realized that neither was he when he woke the following morningif he had ever slepthe tried to dismiss her from his thoughts and prepare for the days lessons he dreaded the thought of forty minutes with the lower fifth having to listen to their opinions of walter raleigh and the significance of his importing tobacco from virginia if only guy wasnt serving as a diplomat on the other side of the world he could ask his advice about what to do next to george the first lesson that morning felt like the longest forty minutes in history wainwright almost made him lose his temper and for the first time carter minor got the better of him but then thankfully the bell tolled but for whom he wondered not that any of them would have heard of donneexcept perhaps robert graves as george made his way slowly across the quad to the common room he rehearsed the lines hed gone over again and again during the night he must stick to the script until every one of his questions had been answered otherwise andrew would work out what he was up to and mock him a hundred years ago george would have challenged him to a duel then he remembered which one of them had a boxing blue george strode into the main block trying to look confident and relaxed as if he didnt have a care in the world as he opened the common room door he could hear his heart thumping but what if andrew wasnt there he didnt think he could go through another lesson with the lower fifth until at least some of his questions had been answered andrew was sitting in his usual place by the window reading the morning paper he smiled when he saw george who poured himself a cup of tea and strolled across to join him he was annoyed to find that a colleague had just taken the chair next to andrew and was busily discussing the iniquities of the school timetable george perched himself on the radiator between them he tried to remember his first question ah yes good show last night said andrew as he folded his newspaper and turned his attention to george yes good show george repeated lamely even though it wasnt in his script you seemed to be enjoying yourself had a splendid time said george turners quite a character he obviously took a shine to you oh do you think so certain of it ive never seen him so animated then youve known him for some time ventured george no ive only been to westbrook a couple of times and he hardly opened his mouth oh really said george his first question answered so what did you think of the girls asked andrew the girls repeated george annoyed that andrew seemed to be asking him all his own questions yes did you take a fancy to any of them marjorie clearly couldnt take her eyes off you i didnt notice said george what about you well it all came as a bit of a surprise to be frank with you old chap admitted andrew a bit of a surprise said george hoping he didnt sound desperate yes you see i didnt think she had the slightest interest in me she ruth ruth yes on my two previous visits she didnt give me a second look but last night she never stopped chatting i think i might be in with a chance in with a chance george bobbed up are you all right mallory of course i am why do you ask well its just that you keep repeating everything i say everything you say do i said george sitting back down on the radiator then youll be hoping to see ruth again will you he ventured at last getting in one of his questions well thats the funny thing said andrew just after dinner the old man took me to one side and invited me to join the family in venice over easter and did you accept asked george horrified by the very idea well id like to but theres a slight complication a slight complication youre at it again said andrew sorry replied george whats the complication ive already committed myself to a hockey tour of the west country at easter and as im the only goalkeeper available i dont feel i can let the team down certainly not said george having to jump up again that would be damn bad form quite said andrew but i think i may have come up with a compromise a compromise yes if i were to miss the last match i could take the boat train from southampton on the friday evening and be in venice by sunday morning which would mean i could still spend a whole week with the turners a whole week said george i put the idea to the old man and he seemed quite agreeable so ill be joining them during the last week of march that was all george needed to know he jumped off the radiator the seat of his trousers scorched are you sure youre all right mallory you seem quite distracted this morning blame it on wainwright said george glad of the chance to change the subject wainwright said andrew i nearly lost my temper with him this morning when he suggested that it was the earl of essex who defeated the spanish armada and drake wasnt even there playing bowls on plymouth hoe no doubt no wainwright has a theory that drake was at hampton court at the time having a protracted affair with elizabeth and that hed sent essex off to devon to keep him out of the way i thought it was meant to be the other way round said andrew lets hope so said george chapter twenty tuesday march th the first couple of days climbing had gone well even if finch seemed a little preoccupied and not his usual forthright self it wasnt until the third day when they were both stuck on a ledge halfway up the zmutt ridge that george found out why do you begin to understand women asked finch as if this was something they discussed every day cant say i have a great deal of experience in that particular field admitted george his thoughts turning to ruth join the club responded finch but i always thought you were considered to be a bit of an authority on the subject women dont allow any man to be an authority on the subject said finch bitterly fallen in love with someone have you asked george wondering if finch was suffering from the same problem as he was out of love said finch which is far more complicated i feel sure it wont be too long before you find a replacement its not a replacement im worried about said finch ive just found out that shes pregnant then youll have to marry her said george matteroffactly thats the problem finch said were already married that was the nearest george had come to falling off a mountain since the avalanche on mont blanc a head appeared over the ledge lets keep moving said young or cant you two see a way out of the problem as neither of them replied young simply said follow me for the next hour all three men struggled gamely up the last thousand feet and it wasnt until george had joined young and finch at the top of the mountain that finch spoke again is there any news about the one mountain we all want to stand on top of he asked young although george didnt approve of finchs blunt approach he hoped that young would answer the question as one thing was certain no one was going to overhear them at feet on the summit of the matterhorn young looked out across the valley wondering how much information he should divulge anything i have to say on this subject must remain between the three of us he said eventually im not expecting an official announcement from the foreign office for at least another couple of months he didnt speak again for a few moments and for once even finch remained silent however i can tell you he continued at last that the alpine club has come to a provisional agreement with the royal geographical society to set up a joint body which will be known as the everest committee and who will be sitting on that committee asked finch once again young took his time before responding sir francis younghusband will be chairman i will be deputy chairman and mr hinks will be secretary no one can object to younghusband as chairman said george choosing his words carefully after all he was instrumental in getting an everest expedition off the ground but that doesnt apply to hinks responded finch not choosing his words carefully theres a man whos managed to turn snobbery into an art form isnt that a little rough old boy suggested george who had thought he could no longer be shocked by anything finch came out with perhaps you failed to notice that at scotts rgs lecture the women including hinkss and scotts wives were relegated to the gallery like cattle on a goods train traditions die hard in such institutions suggested young calmly dont lets excuse snobbery by passing it off as tradition said finch mind you george he added hinks will be delighted if youre chosen as one of the climbing party after all you went to winchester and cambridge that was uncalled for said young sharply well find out if im right soon enough said finch standing his ground you need have no fear on that front said young i can assure you that it will be the alpine club that selects the climbing team not hinks that may be said finch unwilling to let go of his bone but what really matters is who sits on that committee it will have seven members said young three of them will be from the alpine club before you ask i shall be inviting somervell and herford to join me couldnt say fairer than that said george possibly said finch but who are the rgss candidates hinks a fellow called raeburn and a general bruce so our numbers will be equal that leaves younghusband with the casting vote i have no problem with that said young younghusbands been an excellent president of the rgs and his integrity has never been in question how very british of you remarked finch young pursed his lips before adding perhaps i should point out that the rgs will only be selecting those members of the party who will be responsible for drawing up detailed maps of the outlying district and collecting geological specimens as well as flora and fauna that are unique to the himalaya it will be up to the alpine club to choose the climbing party and it will also be our task to identify a route to the summit of everest and whos likely to lead the expedition asked finch still not giving an inch i expect it will be general bruce hes served in india for years and is one of the few englishmen who is familiar with the himalaya as well as being a personal friend of the dalai lamas he would be the ideal choice to take us across the border into tibet once we reach the foothills of everest and have established base camp i will take over as climbing leader with the sole responsibility of ensuring that its an englishman who is the first man to stand on the roof of the world im an australian finch reminded him how appropriate that another member of the commonwealth will be standing by my side said young with a smile before adding perhaps it might be wise for us to begin our descent gentlemen unless you were planning to spend the night on top of this mountain george put his goggles back on excited by youngs news although he suspected that finch had provoked him to reveal far more than he had originally intended young placed a sovereign on the highest point of the matterhorn bowed and said his majesty pays his compliments maam and hopes you will allow his subjects a safe journey home one more question said finch and only one said young do you have any idea when this expedition plans to leave for tibet yes replied young it cant leave any later than february next year well have to establish base camp by may if were to have time to reach the summit before the monsoon season sets in finch seemed satisfied with this reply but george could only wonder how mr fletcher the newly appointed headmaster of charterhouse would react to one of his staff requesting a sixmonth leave of absence young led them slowly back down the mountain not wasting any words on small talk until they were on safer ground when their hotel came into sight he uttered his last words on the subject i would be obliged gentlemen if this matter was not referred to again even between ourselves until the foreign office has made an official announcement both men nodded however young added i hope you dont have anything else planned for finch was on his way down to dinner dressed in an opennecked shirt flannel trousers and a sports jacket when he spotted mallory at the reception desk writing out a check off on another little adventure are we inquired finch looking down at the suitcase by mallorys feet mallory smiled yes i have to admit that youre not the only man im trying to stay a yard ahead of finch glanced at the label attached to the suitcase as there are no mountains that im aware of in venice i can only assume that another woman must be involved george didnt reply as he handed his check to the clerk standing behind the counter just as i thought said finch and as youve already implied that im something of an expert when it comes to the fairer sex allow me to warn you that trying to juggle two women at once even if they do live on different continents is never easy george grinned as he folded his receipt and placed it in an inside pocket my dear finch he said allow me to point out that there has to be a first woman before there can be a second without another word he picked up his suitcase gave finch a thin smile and headed toward the front door i wouldnt repeat that when you come face to face with chomolungma for the first time said finch quietly i have a feeling that particular lady might well turn out to be an unforgiving mistress george didnt look back chapter twentyone thursday march th ever since he had set eyes on her at westbrook george hadnt been able to get ruth out of his mind even when he was climbing was that the reason finch had reached the top of the matterhorn before him and young had chosen somervell and herford to join him on the everest committee was finch right when he had suggested that at some time george would have to decide between them no choice was necessary at the moment thought george as both the ladies in question were studiously ignoring him george had slipped away from zermatt on tuesday night leaving his colleagues to settle their differences with one or two of the lesser peaks he boarded the train for lausanne changing at visp where he spent most of his time planning how they might casually bump into each otherthat was assuming he managed to find her as the train rattled along george couldnt help thinking that although mountains were not to be depended on at least they remained in one place wouldnt it be all too obvious that hed traveled from switzerland to italy specially to see her he knew one person who would work it out immediately when george disembarked at lausanne he purchased a thirdclass ticket on the cisalpino to verona from where he would join the express for venice there was no need to waste money on a more expensive ticket when all he intended to do was sleep and he would have slept if he hadnt been seated next to a frenchman who clearly felt that every dish he ate should be liberally laced with garlic and whose snoring rivaled the engine for noise george was able to grab only a few moments sleep before the train reached its destination he had never visited venice before but baedekers guide had been his constant companion for the past month so by the time he stepped out onto the platform at santa lucia he knew the exact location of every fivestar hotel in the city he even knew that the firenze was the first hotel in europe to offer what they described as an ensuite bathroom once the waterbus had dropped him off at the piazza san marco george went in search of the one hotel he could afford that wasnt miles from the city center he checked into the smallest room on the top floor a proper place for a mountaineer and settled down desperate for a good nights sleep he would like all wellprepared climbers have to rise before the sun if he hoped to carry out his little subterfuge he was confident that the turners wouldnt be setting foot outside whichever hotel they were staying at much before ten oclock george spent another sleepless night and this time he couldnt blame garlic or a rattling train but rather a mattress with no springs and a pillow that had never been introduced to more than a handful of feathers even his young charges at charterhouse would have complained he rose before six and was crossing the rialto bridge half an hour later accompanied by late revelers and a few early morning workers he took a list of hotels from the inside pocket of his jacket and set about his quest methodically the first establishment he entered was the hotel bauer where he asked at the reception desk if the turner familyone elderly gentleman and his three daughterswere guests the night porter ran a finger down a long list before shaking his head at the nearby hotel europa e regina george received the same response the hotel baglione had a thompson and a taylor but no turner while the night manager of the gritti palace waited for a tip before he even considered answering georges question but then gave him the same response the next hotel refused to divulge the names of its guests even after george claimed to be a close friend of the family he was beginning to wonder if the turners had changed their holiday plans until the head porter of the san clemente an englishman gave a smile of recognition when he heard the name although he didnt smile again until george had passed over a largedenomination note the turner party he told him were not staying at the san clemente but they occasionally dined there and he had once been asked to book a vaporetto to take them back tohe didnt finish the sentence until a second note of the same denomination had joined the firstback to their hotel a third note secured the hotels name the cipriani as well as the dock where its private water taxi always dropped off its guests george placed a thinner wallet back in his jacket pocket and made his way quickly to piazza san marco from where he could see the island of giudecca on which the cipriani hotel proudly stood every twenty minutes a water taxi docked with the name cipriani on its bow he stepped into the shadows of a large archway from where he could observe every boat as it disgorged its customers confident that an elderly gentleman accompanied by three young ladies would be easy enough to identify especially when the vision of one of those ladies had rarely left his mind for the past six weeks for the next two hours george checked every customer coming by water taxi from giudecca after another hour he began to wonder if the turners had moved to a different hotel perhaps the one that had refused to divulge its guest list he watched as the cafés all around him began to fill up the pervading aroma of freshly baked panini crostini and piping hot coffee reminded him he hadnt had any breakfast but he dared not desert his post for fear that if he did so that would be the moment the turner family set foot on the shore george decided that if they hadnt appeared by midday he might have to risk taking the taxi across to the island and even entering their hotel but if he were to bump into them how would he explain what he was doing there mr turner would have known that a night at the cipriani would barely have been covered by georges monthly salary however small the room was and then george saw her his first thought was that she was even more beautiful than hed remembered she was wearing a long empireline yellow silk dress with a wide red ribbon tied just below the bust her wavy auburn hair fell to her shoulders and she shaded herself from the morning sun with a white parasol if youd asked him what marjorie and mildred were wearing he wouldnt have been able to tell you mr turner was the first to step onto the quay he was dressed in a smart cream suit white shirt and striped tie he raised an arm to assist his daughters as they stepped off the boat george was relieved to see no sign of andrew who he hoped was defending a goal in taunton the turners strolled off in the direction of piazza san marco with an air of knowing exactly where they were heading as indeed they clearly did because when they walked into a crowded café the head waiter immediately guided them to the only unoccupied table once they had ordered turner settled down to read the previous days times while ruth leafed through a book that must have been a guide to venice because she kept sharing the contents with her sisters while occasionally pointing out landmarks at one point ruth looked in his direction and for a moment george wondered if she had seen him although you rarely notice someone youre not looking for especially if theyre obscured by shadows he waited patiently until mr turner called for the bill realizing that the next part of his plan could not be put off for much longer the moment the turners left the café george stepped out of the shadows and headed toward the center of the square his eyes never left ruth the guidebook still open in her hand she was now reading passages out from it while the rest of the family listened intently george began to wish he was back on top of a mountain even if it had meant that finch was his only companion surely the moment they saw him they would twig there was only one way he was going to find out he emerged from behind a group of ambling tourists and when he was just a few paces away came to a halt in front of mr turner good morning sir said george raising his boater and trying to look astonished what a pleasant surprise well its certainly a surprise for me mr mallory said turner and a most pleasing one said marjorie good morning miss turner said george once again raising his hat although mildred rewarded him with a shy smile ruth continued to read her guidebook as if georges unexpected appearance was nothing more than an irritating distraction before the five arched portals of the basilica she declared her voice rising rests the piazza san marco a vast paved arcaded square once described by napoleon as the drawing room of europe george continued to smile at her feeling like malvolio because like olivia she didnt return the compliment he was beginning to feel that he had embarked on a wasted journey and should never have allowed himself to imagine even for a momenthe would slip away and they would soon forget hed ever been there the bell tower continued ruth looking up rises to a height of feet and visitors can reach the parapet by ascending its four hundred and twentyone steps george raised his hat to mr turner and turned to leave do you think you could manage that mr mallory asked ruth george hesitated possibly he said turning back but the weather conditions would have to be taken into consideration a high wind might make it difficult i cant imagine why a high wind would make it difficult if you were safely inside mr mallory and then one must always remember miss turner continued george that the most important decision when considering any climb is the route you select you rarely end up going in a straight line and if you make the wrong choice you might have to turn back unrewarded how interesting mr mallory said ruth but if a more direct route does present itself you should always be prepared to consider it i can find nothing in baedeker to suggest that there might be a more direct route said ruth that was the moment george decided that if he was going to leave them he might as well do it in style then perhaps the time has come to write a new chapter for your guidebook miss turner without another word george took off his hat and jacket and handed them to ruth he took one more look at the tower then walked toward the public entrance where he joined the line of tourists waiting to go inside when he got to the front of the queue he leaped onto the turnstile and reached up to grasp the archway above the entrance he pulled himself up and stood on the ledge moments later with a line of startled onlookers following his progress he was hanging from the first parapet he paused for a moment to consider his next move it was to place his right foot on the statue of a saintsaint thomas mildred notedwho looked doubtful mr turner turned his attention away from george for a moment as he progressed from ledge to ledge buttress to buttress to observe his daughters mildred appeared fascinated by georges skill while marjorie had a look of awe on her face but it was ruths reaction that took him most by surprise her face had gone deathly pale and her whole body seemed to be trembling when george appeared to lose his footing only a few feet from the top mr turner thought his favorite daughter was going to faint george looked down into the crowded square no longer able to identify ruth among the patchwork quilt of speckled colors below he placed both hands firmly on the wide balustrade pulled himself up onto the top parapet and joined the visitors who had made the ascent by a more orthodox route a small group of mesmerized tourists took a step back hardly able to believe what they were witnessing one or two of them had taken photographs so they could prove to the folks back home that they hadnt made it up george leaned over the balustrade and began to consider his route back downthat was until he spotted two members of the carabinieri running into the square george could not risk returning by the same route if there was a possibility of adding an italian prison to his french experience he bolted toward the main exit at the top of the stairs and joined the sightseers who were beginning to make their slow progress down the winding stone staircase back to the square he brushed past several of them finally slowing his pace to join a party of americans who had clearly not witnessed his efforts their only topic of conversation was where they would be having lunch as they spilled out of the tower and back into the square george linked arms with an elderly american matron from illinois who didnt protest she smiled up at him have i ever told you i had a relative who was on the titanic no said george how fascinating he added as the group passed two carabinieri who were searching for an unaccompanied man yes it was my sisters child roderick you know he wasnt even meant but george had already disappeared once he had escaped from the crowded square he made his way swiftly back to his hotel but never once broke into a run for fear of attracting attention it only took him fifteen minutes to pack settle the billa surcharge was added for checking out after middayand leave he walked briskly in the direction of the rialto bridge where he knew there would be a vaporetto to take him to the railway station as the motor launch glided slowly past piazza san marco he spotted an officer questioning a young man who must have been about his own age when he was dropped off at santa lucia station he headed straight for the booking office and asked the clerk what time was the next train to london victoria three oclock sir he replied but im afraid i have no more firstclass tickets available then ill have to settle for third class said george emptying his wallet george nipped into the shadows whenever he spotted a policeman and it seemed an eternity before the platform bell was rung and a guard at the top of his voice invited all firstclass passengers to board the express george joined the select group as they strolled toward the train suspecting that they were the last people the police would be taking any interest in he even thought about climbing onto the roof of the train but decided that it would leave him even more exposed once george was on board he hung around in a corridor keeping a wary eye out for any ticket collectors he was just wondering whether he should lock himself in a lavatory and wait there until the train had moved off when a voice behind him said il vostro biglietto signore per favore george swung around to see a man dressed in a long blue jacket with thick gold piping on the lapels and holding a leather book he looked out of the window and spotted a policeman walking down the platform and peering in the carriage windows he began to make a pretense of searching for his ticket when the policeman boarded the carriage i must have mislaid it said george ill just go back to the booking office and no need to do that sir said the ticket collector switching languages effortlessly all i require is your name mallory george said with resignation as the policeman headed toward him ah yes said the ticket collector youre in carriage b stateroom eleven your wife has already arrived sir would you care to follow me my wife said george before following the ticket collector through the dining car and into the next carriage trying to think up some plausible excuse before the ticket collector realized his mistake when they reached cabin number the concierge pulled open a door marked riservato george peered inside to see his jacket and boater on the seat opposite her ah there you are darling said ruth i was beginning to wonder if youd make it in time i thought you werent going back to england for another week george spluttered taking the seat by her side so did i replied ruth but someone once told me that if a more direct route presents itself you should be prepared to consider it unless of course theres a high wind george laughed and wanted to leap in the air with joy until he remembered an encumbrance every bit as terrifying as the italian police does your father know youre here i managed to convince him that on balance it wouldnt be a good thing for the schools reputation to have one of its masters languishing in an italian jail just before the new term begins what about andrew werent you meant ruth threw her arms around him george heard the door of the compartment sliding open he didnt dare look around of course the answers yes my darling said ruth before kissing him scusi the policeman saluted before adding mille congratulazioni signore chapter twentytwo friday may st your shot i believe said turner george lined up the tip of his cue on the white he could feel his legs shaking as he made the shot he miscued and the ball careered wildly up and down the table bouncing off a side cushion before coming to rest several inches from the red foul said turner and four more points for me agreed sighed george as his host returned to the table turner didnt speak again until he had amassed another sixteen points the past month had been the happiest of georges life in fact he had had no idea that such happiness could exist as each day went by he fell more and more in love with ruth she was so bright so gay such fun to be with the journey back to england had been idyllic they had spent every minute getting to know each other although george did have a flash of anxiety when the train stopped at the italian border and a customs official took a close look at his passport when they finally crossed the border into france george relaxed for the first time and even spent a moment thinking about young and finch climbing in zermatt but only a moment he told ruth over dinner why hed ordered all five courses on the menu explaining that he hadnt eaten for three days she laughed when he described the last person hed spent a night with on a train a man who belched garlic when he was awake and snored fumes while he was asleep so you havent slept for the past three nights she said and it doesnt look as if i will tonight either my darling said george i cant pretend that this was how i expected to spend my first night with the man i love said ruth but why dont we she leaned across the table and whispered in georges ear he thought about her proposal for a moment and then happily agreed a few minutes later ruth left the table in their compartment she found that the seats had been converted into single beds she undressed hung up her clothes washed her face in the little hand basin climbed into bed and switched off the light george remained in the dining car drinking black coffee only after the last remaining customer had departed did he return to the compartment he slid the door open quietly and slipped inside then stood still for a moment waiting for his eyes to become accustomed to the dark he could see the outline of ruths slim body under the sheet and wanted to touch her he took off his jacket tie trousers shirt and socks and left them on the floor before climbing into bed he wondered if ruth was still awake good night mr mallory she said good night mrs mallory he replied george slept soundly for the first time in three nights as george bent down to take his next shot turner said you wrote earlier in the week mallory to say there was something of importance you wished to discuss with me yes indeed said george as his cue ball disappeared into the nearest pocket another foul said turner he returned to the table and took his time piling up even more points which only made george feel more and more inadequate yes sir he finally managed and then paused before adding im sure you must have noticed that ive been spending a lot of time with your daughter which one asked turner as george missed another shot another foul are you hoping to score anything this evening young man it was just sir just that you would like my blessing before you ask ruth for her hand in marriage ive already asked her admitted george i would hope so mallory after all you have already spent a night with her when george had woken after that night it was pitch dark he leaned forward and pushed the blind to one side to observe the first rays of sunlight creeping over the horizon a joyful sight for any mountaineer he slipped quietly out of bed felt around on the floor for his pants and slipped them on next he located the rest of his clothes not too difficult an exercise when youre used to sleeping in a small tent with only a candle to see by george quietly slid open the compartment door and stepped outside he looked up and down the corridor thankful that no one was in sight he quickly did up his shirt pulled on his trousers and socks tied his tie and slipped on his jacket when he strolled into the dining car the attendants laying the tables for breakfast were surprised to see a firstclass passenger so early in the morning good morning sir said a waiter who was staring at mallorys trousers looking slightly embarrassed good morning said george and two paces later realized his fly buttons were undone he laughed did them up and hurried through the dining car in search of a morning paper it wasnt until he reached carriage k that he came across the newspaper kiosk the sign in the window read chiuso but george could see a young man standing behind the counter undoing the thick string from around a pile of newspapers he stared at the front page in disbelief he could only just recognize himself in the blurred photograph but even with his limited command of italian he could translate the headline police seek mystery climber of st marks basilica he pointed to the pile of newspapers and the assistant reluctantly unlocked the door how many copies of that paper do you have twenty sir he replied ill take all of them said george the assistant looked uncertain but when george handed over the cash he shrugged his shoulders and deposited the money in the till george was admiring a piece of jewelry in the display cabinet when the assistant handed back his change how much is that he asked pointing to one of the velvet stands which currency sir pounds replied george taking out his checkbook the young man ran his finger down a line of figures on a card attached to the back wall thirtytwo pounds sir george wrote out a check for next months salary while the assistant wrapped the tiny gift george made his way back to the dining car with the papers under one arm having put the gift in his jacket pocket as he entered the next carriage he glanced up and down the corridor again still no one around he slipped into the nearest lavatory and spent the next few minutes tearing off the front page of every paper except one and considerably longer flushing them down the lavatory the moment hed seen the last headline disappear he unlocked the door and stepped back into the corridor as george continued on toward the dining car he dropped a copy of the morning paper on the floor outside each stateroom but sir i can explain how that happened protested george as the object ball bounced off the table and ran along the floor another foul said turner picking up the ball and placing it back on the baize i dont require an explanation mallory but what are your prospects as you know sir im on the teaching staff at charterhouse where my current salary is three hundred and seventyfive pounds a year thats certainly not enough to keep one of my daughters in the style theyve grown accustomed to said turner do you by any chance have a private income no sir i do not my father is a parish priest who had four children to bring up then i shall settle seven hundred and fifty pounds a year on ruth and give her a house as a wedding present should there be any offspring i shall pay for their education i could never marry a girl who had a private income said george haughtily you couldnt marry ruth if she didnt have one said turner as he cannoned successfully off the red george sat alone and sipped his coffee while he waited for ruth to join him was there really a beautiful woman asleep in compartment b or was he about to wake from his dream and find himself locked up in an italian jail with no mr irving to rescue him several other passengers had appeared and were enjoying their breakfast although the waiters were unable to explain why their morning papers didnt have a front page when ruth walked into the dining car george had only one thought im going to have breakfast with this woman every morning for the rest of my life good morning mrs mallory he said as he rose from his side of the table and took her in his arms do you begin to know how much i love you he added before kissing her ruth blushed at the disapproving stares from a few of the older passengers perhaps we shouldnt kiss in public george you were happy enough to kiss me yesterday in front of a policeman george reminded her as he sat back down but only because i was trying to stop you being arrested the waiter joined them and smiled ingratiatingly after all they were used to honeymoon couples on the orient express after the two of them had given their breakfast orders george slid the front page of the morning paper across the table nice photograph mr mallory ruth whispered once shed read the headline and if it isnt bad enough for a girl to be compromised on her first date i now seem to be harboring a fugitive so the first thing my father will want to know is whether your intentions are honorable or can i only hope to be a criminals moll im surprised you need to ask mrs mallory its just that my father told me that you already have a mistress who resides in very high places your father is correct and i explained to him that i have been promised to the lady in question since my coming of age and several people have already borne witness to the engagement its what they call in tibet an arranged marriagewhere neither party sees the other before the wedding day then you must visit this little hussy as soon as possible said ruth and tell her in no uncertain terms that you are spoken for i fear shes not that little said george with a grin but once the diplomatic niceties have been sorted out i hope to pay her a visit early in the new year when i will explain why its no longer possible for us to go on seeing each other no woman ever wants to be told that said ruth sounding serious for the first time you can tell her that ill agree to a compromise george smiled a compromise its possible said ruth that this goddess may not agree to see you when you make your first approach because like any woman she will want to confirm that you are constant and will return to woo her again all i ask george is that once you have seduced your goddess you will return to me and never court her again why so serious my darling asked george taking her hand because when i saw you climb st marks you convinced me of your love but i also saw the risks youre willing to take if you believe in something passionately enoughwhatever dangers are placed in your path i want you to promise me that once youve stood on the summit of that infernal mountain it will be for the first and last time i agree and shall now prove it said george letting go of her hand he took the little package out of his pocket removed the wrapping and placed the small leather box in front of her ruth opened the lid to reveal a slim gold ring set with a single diamond will you marry me my darling ruth smiled i thought wed agreed on that yesterday she said as she slipped on the ring leaned across the table and gave her fiancé a kiss but i thought we also agreed that george considered mr turners offer for a moment before he said thank you sir after managing to score three points his first of the evening he added thats most generous of you its no more and certainly no less than i decided when you came to see ruth in venice george laughed for the first time that evening despite the fact added turner that you only escaped being thrown in jail by a matter of minutes by a matter of minutes yes turner replied after hed potted another red i had a visit from the italian police later that afternoon they wanted to know if id come across an englishman called mallory who had at some time in the past been arrested in paris for climbing the eiffel tower that wasnt me sir said george the description of this vagabond bore a striking resemblance to you mallory its still not true sir i had at least a hundred feet to go when they arrested me turner burst out laughing all i can say mallory is that youd better not plan to spend your honeymoon in france or italy unless you wish to spend your first night of married life in a prison cell mind you when i looked into your criminal activities in venice it seems that you only broke a bylaw a bylaw failure to pay an entrance fee when entering a public monument turner paused maximum fine one thousand lire he smiled at his future soninlaw on a more serious matter dear boymy game i think chapter twentythree tuesday june nd do you think well have to go to war sir asked wainwright on the first day of term lets hope not wainwright george replied why not sir if its a just cause after all we should stand up for what we believe in the english always have in the past but if it were possible to negotiate an honorable agreement with the germans said george wouldnt that be a better solution you cant negotiate an honorable agreement with the hun sir they never keep to their side of the bargain perhaps history will prove you wrong on this occasion said george youve always taught us sir to study the past carefully if you want to predict the most likely outcome in the future and the hun the germans wainwright the germans sir have throughout history proved to be a warlike nation some might say the same of the english whenever its been in our interests not true sir said wainwright england only goes to war when theres a just cause as seen by the english suggested george which silenced wainwright for a moment but if we did have to go to war jumped in carter minor would you enlist before george could reply wainwright interjected mr asquith has said that should we go to war schoolmasters would be exempt from serving in the armed forces you seem unusually well informed on this subject wainwright said george my fathers a general sir views overheard in the nursery are always harder to dislodge than those taught in the classroom replied george who said that asked graves bertrand russell george replied and everyone knows hes a conchie chipped in wainwright whats a conchie asked carter minor a conscientious objector someone who will use any excuse not to fight for his country said wainwright everyone should be allowed to follow their own conscience wainwright when it comes to facing a moral dilemma bertrand russell no doubt said wainwright jesus christ actually said george wainwright fell silent but carter minor came back if we were to go to war sir wouldnt that rather scupper your chances of climbing everest out of the mouths of babesruth had put the same question to him over a breakfast as well as the more important one of whether he would feel it was his duty to enlist or as her father had crudely put it would hide behind the shield of a schoolmasters gown my personal belief began george just as the bell sounded the class in their eagerness not to miss morning break didnt seem all that interested in his personal beliefs as george walked across to the common room he dismissed any thoughts of war in the hope of coming to a peaceful settlement with andrew whom he hadnt seen since hed returned from venice when he opened the common room door he spotted his chum sitting in his usual seat reading the times he didnt look up george poured himself a cup of tea and walked slowly across to join him quite ready for a bout of mental fisticuffs good morning george andrew said still not looking up good morning andrew george replied slipping into the seat beside him i hope you had decent hols andrew added as he abandoned his newspaper pleasant enough replied george cautiously cant say i did old boy george sat back and waited for the onslaught i suppose youve heard about ruth and me said andrew of course i have said george so what would you advise me to do about it old boy be magnanimous suggested george hopefully easy enough for you to say old boy but what about ruth i cant see her being magnanimous why not asked george would you be if i let you down at the last moment george couldnt think of a suitable reply i really did mean to go to venice dont you know continued andrew but that was before we reached the semifinal of the taunton cup congratulations said george beginning to understand and the lads prevailed on me said i couldnt let the side down especially as they didnt have another goalkeeper so you never went to venice thats what ive been trying to tell you old boy and worse we didnt even win the cup so i lost out both ways bad luck old chap said george trying to hide a smirk do you think shell ever speak to me again asked andrew well youll be able to find out soon enough said george andrew raised an eyebrow how come old chap weve just sent you an invitation to our wedding chapter twentyfour wednesday july th have you met this paragon of virtue asked odell as he folded his copy of the manchester guardian and placed it on the seat beside him no said finch but i should have guessed something was up when mallory left us early and disappeared off to venice i think its what female novelists describe as a whirlwind romance said young theyve only known each other a few months that would have been quite long enough for me chipped in guy bullock who had returned to england i can tell you chaps shes ravishing and anyone who might have been envious of george in the past will turn into a greeneyed monster the moment they set eyes on her i cant wait to meet the girl george fell for said somervell with a grin its time to call this meeting to order said young when the guard shouted next stop godalming to start with continued young i hope you all remembered to bring your ice axes wilt thou have this woman to thy wedded wife to live together after gods ordinance in the holy estate of matrimony wilt thou love her comfort her honor and keep her in sickness and in health and forsaking all other keep thee only unto her so long as ye both shall live george never took his eyes off ruth while his father was addressing him i will he responded firmly the reverend mallory turned his attention to the bride and smiled wilt thou have this man to thy wedded husband to live together after gods ordinance in the holy estate of matrimony wilt thou obey him and serve him love honor and keep him in sickness and in health and forsaking all other keep thee only unto him so long as ye both shall live i will said ruth although few beyond the front pew would have heard her response who giveth this woman to be married to this man asked the reverend mallory mr thackeray turner stepped forward and said i do geoffrey young who was georges best man handed the reverend mallory a simple gold ring george slipped it onto the fourth finger of ruths left hand and said with this ring i thee wed with my body i thee worship and with all my worldly goods i thee endow mr turner smiled to himself the reverend mallory once more joined the couples right hands and addressed the congregation joyfully i pronounce that they be man and wife together in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost amen as the first strains of mendelssohns wedding march sounded george kissed his wife for the first time mr and mrs mallory walked slowly down the aisle together and george was delighted to see how many of his friends had taken the trouble to make the journey to godalming he spotted rupert brooke and lytton strachey both maynard and geoffrey keynes as well as ka cox who was sitting next to cottie sanders who gave him a sad smile but the real surprise came when they walked out of the church and into the warm sunshine because waiting to greet them was a guard of honor made up of young bullock herford somervell odell and of course george finch their shining ice axes held aloft to form an archway under which the bride and groom walked confetti appearing like falling snow after a reception at which george and ruth managed to speak to every one of their guests the newlyweds left in mr turners brandnew bullnose morris for a tenday walking holiday in the quantocks so what did you make of the chaperones who will accompany me when i leave you to pay homage to the other woman in my life george asked as he drove down an empty winding road i can see why youre so willing to follow geoffrey young ruth replied studying the map resting in her lap especially after his thoughtful speech on behalf of the bridesmaids odell and somervell looked as if like horatius theyd stand by your side on the bridge while i suspect herford will match you step for step if hes chosen for the final climb and finch said george glancing at his bride ruth hesitated the tone of her voice changed hell do anything george and i mean anything to reach the top of that mountain ahead of you what makes you feel so sure of that my darling asked george sounding surprised when i came out of the church on your arm he looked at me as if i was still a single woman as many of the bachelors in the congregation might have done suggested george including andrew osullivan no andrew looked at me as if he wished i was still a single woman theres a world of difference you may be right about finch admitted george but theres no climber id rather have by my side when it comes to tackling the last thousand feet of any mountain including everest especially chomolungma the mallorys pulled up outside their small hotel in crewkerne just after seven oclock that evening the manager was standing at the entrance waiting to greet them and once they had completed the guest registersigning as mr and mrs mallory for only the second timehe accompanied them to the bridal suite they unpacked their suitcases thinking about but not mentioning the one subject that was on their minds when they had completed this simple task george took his wife by the hand and accompanied her down to the dining room a waiter handed them a large menu which they studied in silence before ordering george i was wondering began ruth if you had yes my darling ruth would have completed the sentence if the waiter hadnt returned carrying two bowls of piping hot tomato soup which he placed in front of them she waited until he was out of earshot before she tried again do you have any idea just how nervous i am my darling not half as nervous as me admitted george not lifting his spoon ruth bowed her head george i think you ought to know yes my darling said george taking her hand ive never seen a naked man let alone have i ever told you about my visit to the moulin rouge asked george trying to ease the tension many times said ruth with a smile and the only woman you showed any interest in on that occasion was madame eiffel and even she spurned you george laughed and without another word rose from his place and took his wife by the hand ruth smiled as they left the dining room just hoping that no one would ask why they hadnt even tasted their soup they walked quickly up the three flights of stairs without another word when they arrived outside their bedroom george fumbled with the key and finally managed to open the door as soon as they were inside he took his wife in his arms eventually he released her took a step back and smiled he slowly took off his jacket and tie his eyes never leaving her ruth returned his smile and unbuttoned her dress allowing it to fall to the floor revealing a long silk petticoat that fell just below the knees she pulled it slowly over her head and once it had joined the dress on the floor george took her in his arms and kissed her while she tried to pull off his trousers he fumbled with the strap of her bra once they were both naked they just stood and stared at each other for a moment before they fell onto the bed george stroked her long auburn hair while ruth kissed him gently as they began to explore each others bodies they quickly became aware that there wasnt anything to be nervous about after they had made love ruth fell back on the pillow and said now tell me mr mallory who youd rather spend the night with chomolungma or me george laughed so loudly that ruth had to place a hand over his mouth for fear they might be heard in the next room he held her in his arms until she finally fell into a deep sleep george was the first to wake the next morning and began to kiss ruths breasts until her eyes blinked open she smiled up at him as he took her in his arms his hands moving freely over her body george could only wonder what had happened to the shy girl who couldnt take a single spoonful of soup the previous evening after they had made love a second time they padded furtively down the corridor to the bathroom where ruth joined george in the largest bath theyd ever seen afterward he sat on the end of the bed a towel wrapped around his waist and watched his beautiful wife as she dressed ruth blushed youd better hurry up george or well miss breakfast as well suits me said george ruth smiled and slowly unbuttoned her dress for the next ten days george and ruth roamed around the quantocks often returning to their hotel long after the sun had set each day ruth continued to quiz george about her rival trying to understand why chomolungma had such a hold over him he was still planning to leave for tibet early in the new year which would mean theyd be apart for at least six months how many days and nights do you think it will take you to reach the summit she asked as they stood on the top of lydeard hill we have no way of knowing george admitted but finch is convinced that well have to sleep in smaller and smaller tents as our altitude increases we might even have to spend the last night at feet before we attempt the final assault but how can you begin to prepare for such an ordeal asked ruth as she looked down from feet i have no idea said george as they began to stroll back down the hill hand in hand no one knows how the human body will react to altitudes above feet let alone where the temperature can be minus forty and if the winds in your face you have to take ten steps just to advance a few feet finch and i once spent three days in a small tent at feet and at one point it became so cold that we ended up in the same sleeping bag having to cling to each other all night id like to cling to you all night ruth said with a grin so that when you leave me ill have a better understanding of what youre going through i dont think youre quite ready for feet my darling even a couple of nights in a small tent on a beach could prove quite a baptism are you sure youre up to it mr mallory the last time you asked me that mrs mallory i nearly ended up in jail in the nearest town they found a shop that sold camping supplies and george bought a small canvas tent and a single sleeping bag after a hearty dinner back at their hotel they slipped out into the night and drove to the nearest beach george selected an isolated spot facing the ocean which offered them little protection from the fierce wind they began to hammer enough pegs into the sand to be sure that their first home wouldnt be blown away once theyd secured the tent anchoring the pegs with stones ruth crawled inside while george remained on the beach once hed taken his clothes off he joined ruth in the tent and climbed into the sleeping bag wrapping his arms around his shivering wife after theyd made love ruth didnt let go of her husband youd leave home to sleep like this night after night she asked in disbelief at minus forty degrees with air so thin that you may hardly be able to breathe while hugging another man mr mallory youve still got a few months to change your mind she added wistfully neither of them could remember when they fell asleep but they would never forget when they woke george blinked as a flashlight beamed in his eyes he sat up to find ruth her skin now covered in midge bites still clinging to him if youd be kind enough to step outside sir said an authoritative voice george had to decide whether to be gallant or leave his wife freezing in the nude he decided on sir galahad and slowly so as not to wake ruth crawled out of the tent to find two officers from the local constabulary shining their torches directly at his naked body may i ask exactly what youre up to sir asked the first officer george thought about telling them that his wife wanted to know what it would be like to spend a night on mount everest but he settled for were on our honeymoon sergeant and just wanted to spend a night on the beach i think youd better both come down to the station sir said a voice from behind the other torch but perhaps you and your wife ought to get dressed first george crawled back into the tent to find ruth laughing whats so funny he demanded as he slipped his trousers on i did warn you that youd get arrested a chief inspector who had been woken in the middle of the night and asked to come down to the station to interview the two suspects soon found himself apologizing what made you think we were spies george asked him you pitched your tent less than a hundred yards from a topsecret naval depot said the chief inspector im sure i dont have to remind you sir that the prime minister has asked everyone to be vigilant while we prepare for war chapter twentyfive october the received wisdom had been that the war would all be over by christmas george and ruth had returned to godalming after their honeymoon to settle in the house mr turner had given his daughter as a wedding present the holt was more than either of them could have asked for and certainly more than george had expected set in ten acres of land it was a magnificent house with a garden in which ruth knew she would be spending many happy hours pottering about no one could have been in any doubt how much george loved his wife and ruth had the glow of a woman who knows shes cherished they wanted for nothing and anyone who saw them together must have considered them a charmed couple living an idyllic existence but it was a façade because george had a conscience during the next few months george could only stand by as many of his friends and contemporaries from cambridge and even some of the young men hed taught at charterhouse left for the western front never to return while the only sacrifice hed made was to put off his proposed trip to tibet until after the hostilities had ceased it didnt help that the friends who visited him at the holt always seemed to be in uniform brooke young somervell odell herford and even finch dropped in to spend the night before traveling on to france george often wondered if any of them thought hed found an easy way out but even though they never once raised the subject indeed went out of their way to stress the importance of the work he was doing he could never be sure and whenever the headmaster mr fletcher read out the names of those old carthusians who had sacrificed their lives in the service of their country it only made him feel more guilty george decided to discuss his misgivings with his oldest friend guy bullock who had returned to london to take up a post at the war office guy tried to reassure him that there could be no greater calling than to teach the next generation of children who would have to take the place of those who had fallen george next sought the counsel of geoffrey young who reminded him that if he did decide to join up someone else would have to take his place he also mulled over the neverending debate with andrew osullivan who wasnt in any doubt that they were doing the right thing by remaining at their posts mr fletcher was even more adamant saying that he couldnt afford to lose someone with georges experience whenever he raised the subject with ruth she left him in no doubt about how she felt it finally caused their first argument since theyd been married george was finding it more and more difficult to sleep at night as he wrestled with his conscience and ruth often lay awake too aware of the dilemma he was going through are you still awake my darling she whispered one night he leaned over and kissed her gently on the lips before placing an arm around her as she rested her head on his shoulder ive been thinking about our future george said bored with me already are you mr mallory she teased and to think weve only been married for a few months terrified of losing you would be nearer the truth george said quietly he felt her body stiffen no one knows better than you my darling just how guilty i feel about not joining my friends in france have any of those friends said anything to make you feel guilty she asked no not one of them admitted george which only makes it more telling but they know youre serving your country in a different way no one my darling can exempt themselves from their conscience if you were killed what would that achieve nothing other than that youd know id done the honorable thing and id be a widow along with so many other women married to honorable men have any of the staff at charterhouse joined up i cant speak for my colleagues replied george but i can speak for brooke young bullock herford somervell and finch who are among the finest men of my generation and who havent hesitated to serve their country theyve also made it clear that they understand your position perhaps but they havent taken the easy way out the man who climbed st marks basilica could never be accused of taking the easy way out protested ruth but what if that same man failed to join his comrades at the front when his country was at war george took his wife in his arms i understand how you feel my darling but perhaps perhaps it would make a difference george she interrupted if i told you i was pregnant this joyful piece of news did delay george from making a decision but soon after the birth of his daughter clare the feelings of guilt resurfaced having a child of his own made him feel an even greater responsibility to the next generation george continued to teach as the war dragged on but if didnt help that every day he had to pass a recruitment poster on his walk to school showing a young girl seated on her fathers lap asking daddy what did you do in the great war what would he tell clare with each friend george lost the nightmare revisited him he had read that even the bravest of men could snap when going over the top and facing gunfire for the first time george was sitting peacefully in his usual pew in the school chapel when he snapped the headmaster rose from his place to lead the morning service let us pray he began for those old carthusians who have made the ultimate sacrifice by laying down their lives for the greater cause sadly he continued i must add two new names to that growing list lieutenant peter wainwright of the royal fusiliers who died at loos while leading an attack on an enemy post let us remember him let us remember him repeated the congregation george buried his head in his hands and wept silently before the headmaster added the second name second lieutenant simon carter who many of us will fondly remember as carter minor was killed while serving his country in mesopotamia let us remember him while the rest of the congregation lowered their heads and repeated let us remember him george rose from his place bowed before the altar and marched out of the chapel he didnt stop walking until hed reached godalming high street where he joined a queue of young men standing in line outside the local recruitment office name said the recruiting sergeant when george reached the front of the queue mallory the sergeant looked him up and down you do realize sir that under the terms of the new conscription act schoolmasters are exempt from military service george took off his long black gown and mortar board and threw them in the nearest wastepaper basket book three no mans land chapter twentysix july th my darling ruth it was one of the unhappiest days of my life when we parted on that cold desolate railway station in godalming only being allowed a weekend together after id completed my basic training was cruel indeed but i promise i will write to you every day it was kind of you to leave me with the assurance that you believe im doing the right thing even though your eyes revealed your true feelings i joined my regiment at dover and bumped into a few old friends do you remember siegfried herford what a difficult decision he had to make having a german father and an english mother the following day we set off for in a boat that leaked like a colander and bobbed up and down like a rubber duck one of the lads suggested it must have been a personal gift from the kaiser we spent most of the crossing using our billycans to return gallons of water to the ocean you will recall from our last trip across the channel that ive never been much of a sailor but i somehow managed not to be sick in front of the men we docked at at first light without much sign of the french taking any part in this war i joined a couple of brother officers in a café for a hot croissant and some coffee we met up with some other officers returning from the front who advised us to enjoy our last meal on a tablecloth let alone the luxury of a china plate for several months and reminded us that we would be sitting in a different sort of dining room in hours time as usual i can be relied on to forget something and this time it was your photograph im desperate to see your face again even if its only in black and white so please send me the snap i took of you on derden heights the day before we were arrested i want to carry it with me all the time god knows i miss you and i dont begin to understand how one can be surrounded by so many people so much furious activity and so much deafening noise and still feel so very lonely im just trying to find another way of saying that i love you although i know youd tease me if i were to suggest that you are the only woman in my life but i already look upon chomolungma as just an old flame your loving husband george once george had handed the letter to his regiments postal clerk he hung around waiting for the convoy of trucks to begin its oneway journey to the front line in the space of a few miles the beautiful french countryside of millet and monet with its dappled greens and bright yellows and sheep and cows grazing in the fields had been replaced by a far uglier canvas of burned and withered trees slaughtered horses roofless houses and desolate civilians who had become pawns on the chessboard of war the convoy rolled relentlessly on but before george was given the chance to be deafened by the noise he watched as angry gray and black clouds of sulfurous fumes gathered until they completely masked the sun they finally came to a halt at a camp three miles behind the front line which didnt have a signpost and where the days had been turned into perpetual night here george met a group of men in uniform who wondered if they would be alive in twentyfour hours after a billycan of bully beef with a plate of stucktogether beans and maggotriddled potatoes george was billeted in a tent with three fellow officers all younger than himself they had experienced varying lengths of serviceone month nine weeks and seven months the last a lieutenant evans considered himself something of a veteran the following morning after george had devoured breakfast served on a tin plate he was driven forward to an artillery post some four hundred yards behind the front line where he was to relieve evans who was long overdue a fortnights furlough its not all bad old fellow evans assured him its a damn sight less dangerous than the front line think of those poor bastards just a quarter of a mile in front of you waiting for the sound of the lone bugle that will send them over the top having spent months being stalked by death our jobs simple in comparison you have a detail of thirtyseven soldiers under your command and twelve howitzers which are hardly ever out of action unless they break down the senior nco is sergeant davies hes been out here for over a year and before that he served fifteen years with the colors he began army life as a private in the boer war so dont even think about making any sort of move until youve consulted him then theres corporal perkins the damn man never stops complaining but at least his sick sense of humor keeps the lads minds off the hun youll get to know the rest of the squad soon enough theyre a good bunch of fellows and wont let you down when it comes to the crunch george nodded but didnt interrupt the hardest decision youll have to make evans continued comes every sunday afternoon when you have to send three lads to our forward lookout post for the next seven days ive never known all three of them to return alive its their job to keep us informed of what the enemys up to so we can range our guns on them rather than our own troops good luck mallory the young lieutenant had said as he shook hands with george later that morning ill say goodbye in case we never meet again september th my dearest ruth i am stationed a long way behind the front line so theres no need to feel at all anxious about me ive inherited men who seem to be good chaps in fact one of them you may even rememberprivate rodgers he used to be our postman before he joined up perhaps you could let his family know that hes alive and well and actually doing rather well out here he says hell stay on in the army once this war is over the rest of the lads have made me feel very welcome which is good of them as theyre only too aware i joined up so recently i understood for the first time this morning what my training officer back at meant when he said a week in the field will serve you better than a threemonth training course i never stop thinking about you and clare my darling and the world we are bringing our children into lets hope the politicians are right when they call this the war to end all wars because i wouldnt want my children ever to experience this madness no man is expected to serve at the front for more than three months at a time so its possible ill be home in time for the birth of clares little brother or sister george stopped writing and thought about his words he knew all too well that the kings regulations were regularly ignored when it came to granting leave but he needed ruth to stay optimistic as for the reality of life on the somme hed rather she didnt discover the truth about that until he was able to tell her face to face he knew the anxiety she must have been suffering when every day could bring the telegram that began it is with deep regret that the secretary for war has to inform you my darling our two years together have been the happiest time of my life and i know that i always close my letters by telling you just how much i miss you perhaps because never a minute goes by when you are not in my thoughts ive received several letters from you in the past month and thank you for all the news about clare and whats happening at the holtbut theres still no photograph perhaps it will turn up in the next post even more than your image i look forward to the day when i will see you in person and hold you in my arms because then youll truly realize just how much ive missed you your loving husband george ave you got some sort of problem perkins dont think so sarge then why is your unit taking ninety seconds to reload when the rest of the batterys taking less than a minute were doing our best sarge your best isnt good enough perkins do i make myself clear yes sarge dont yes sarge me perkins just do something about it yes sarge and matthews yes sarge ill be inspecting your gun at twelve hundred hours and if it doesnt shine like the sun coming out of my arse ill personally ram you down the barrel and fire you at the hun do i make myself abundantly clear lad abundantly clear sarge the buzzer sounded on the field telephone george grabbed the receiver theres a heavy barrage coming from about a mile away sir eleven oclock said one of the men manning the forward lookout post could mean the germans are planning an attack the line went dead sergeant davies hollered george struggling to make himself heard above the sound of gunfire sir one mile eleven oclock germans advancing sir look lively lads we want to be sure to give the hun a warm welcome lets see who can be the first to land one right on top of jerrys tin helmet george smiled as he walked up and down the line checking on each gun grateful that sergeant davies had been born in swansea and not on the other side of the siegfried line well done rodgers said davies first into action again keep this up and youll be a lance corporal in no time even george couldnt miss the less than subtle hint as to who he should be considering for the next promotion well done perkins thats more like it said davies a few moments later neednt start unpicking your stripes just yet thanks sarge and dont ever thank me corporal wouldnt want you to think im going soft no sarge matthews dont tell me youre going to be last again my loading springs busted sarge oh i am so sorry to hear that matthews well then why dont you run along to the ammunition store and see if you can get yourself a nice shiny new onesharpish you bleedin halfwit but the depots three miles behind the line sarge cant i wait for the supply truck in the morning no you cant matthews because if you dont get moving by the time you get back the fuckin germansexcuse my frenchwill have joined us for breakfast do i make myself clear yes sarge on the double then yes sarge october th my darling ruth its been another one of those endless days with both sides pounding away at each other while we have no way of knowing whos getting the better of this war a field officer occasionally turns up to assure us that were doing a firstclass job and the germans are on the retreatwhich raises the question then why arent we advancing no doubt some german field officer is telling his men exactly the same thing only one thing is certain they cant both be right by the way tell your father that if he wants to make a second fortune he should open a factory that makes ear trumpets because once this war is over theyre certain to be in great demand im sorry my darling if these letters are becoming a little repetitive but only two things remain constant my love for you and my desire to hold you in my arms your loving husband george george looked up to see that one of his corporals was also scribbling away a letter to your wife perkins no sir its my will isnt that a little pessimistic i dont think so sir perkins replied back on civvy street im a bookie so im used to havin to weigh up the odds men on the front line survive an average of sixteen days and ive already been out here for over three months so i cant expect to buck the odds for much longer but youre in far less danger back here than those poor devils on the front line perkins george tried to reassure him youre the third officer to tell me that sir and the other two went home in wooden boxes george was still horrified by such casual references to death and wondered how long it would be before he became just as hardened the way i see it sir continued perkins is wars like the grand national theres lots of runners and riders at the start but theres no way of knowing which of them will finish the course and in the end theres only one winner to be honest sir its not a racing certainty that the winners going to be an english nag george noticed that private matthews was nodding his agreement while private rodgers kept his head down as he cleaned the barrel of his rifle with an oily rag well at least youll be getting some leave soon matthews said george trying to steer the conversation away from a subject that was never far from their minds cant wait for the day sir matthews said as he began to roll a cigarette whats the first thing youll do when you get home asked george bang the missus said matthews perkins and rodgers burst out laughing all right matthews said george and the second thing take my boots off sir december th my dearest ruth your photograph has just arrived in this mornings post and as i write this letter from a trench just outside its balanced on my knee quite a looker i heard one of the lads say and i agree with him it wont be long before our second child is born and ive been promised compassionate leave some time in the next three months if i cant make it home for the birth dont imagine even for a moment that you are ever out of my thoughts ive been at the front now for four months and the new second lieutenants arriving from blighty look younger by the day some of them treat me as if im an old soldier once this war is over ill spend the rest of my days with you at the holt by the way if its a boy lets call him john sorry to disturb you sir said sergeant davies but weve got a bit of a problem george immediately leaped to his feet because hed never heard davies utter that particular word what kind of problem weve lost communication with the lads at the forward lookout post george knew that lost communication was daviess way of saying that all three of the men had been killed what do you recommend sergeant he asked recalling evanss advice someones got to get up there sir and sharpish so we can restore contact before the bloody hun trample all over us if i may suggest sir please do sergeant i could take matthews and perkins and see what can be done then well report back to you no sergeant said george not matthews hes due to go on leave tomorrow he looked across at perkins who had turned ice white and was trembling george had no need to consult him about the odds of any of them reporting back i think ill join you for this one sergeant when george had been at winchester on sports day hed covered a quarter of a mile in under a minute and at the end of the race he wasnt even out of breath he never knew how long it took him davies and perkins to reach the front line but when he threw himself into the trench he was exhausted and terrified and all too aware what the men at the front were being asked to endure every minute of the day and night keep your head down sir said davies as he studied the battlefield through a pair of field binoculars the lookout post is about a hundred yards away sir one oclock he passed the binoculars across to george george refocused the lenses and once hed located the post he could see exactly why communications had broken down right lets get on with it he said before he had time to think what it was that he was meant to be getting on with he leaped out of the trench and ran as he had never run before zigzagging through waterlogged potholes and treacle black mud as he charged toward the forward lookout post he never looked back because he was sure that davies and perkins would only be a stride behind he was wrong perkins had been brought down by a bullet after only a dozen paces and lay dying in the mud while davies had managed almost sixty yards before he was killed the lookout post was only twenty yards ahead of george he had covered fifteen of those yards when the mortar shell exploded at his feet it was the first and last time in his life that he said fuck he fell on his knees thought of ruth and then collapsed facedown in the mud just another statistic chapter twentyseven the regular flow of letters suddenly dried up always the first sign all too often followed by an unwelcome telegram ruth had taken to sitting in the alcove by the drawing room window every morning hands clasped over her evergrowing belly thirty minutes before old mr rodgers cycled up the drive when he came into view she would try to fathom the expression on his face was it a letter face or a telegram face she reckoned she would know the truth long before he reached the door just as she spotted mr rodgers coming through the gates clare began to cry did she still have a father or had george died before his second child was born ruth was standing by the door when mr rodgers stopped pedaling put on his brakes and came to a halt by the bottom step always the same routine dismount rummage around in his post bag extract the relevant letters and finally walk up the steps and hand them to mrs mallory it was no different today or was it as mr rodgers mounted the steps he looked up at her and smiled this wasnt a telegram day two letters today mrs mallory and if im not mistaken one of thems from your husband he added passing over an envelope that bore georges familiar handwriting thank you said ruth almost unable to hide her relief then she remembered that she wasnt the only person having to suffer like this every day any news of your son mr rodgers she asked fraid not replied the postman mind you our donald never was much of a letter writer so we live in hope he climbed back on his bicycle and pedaled away ruth had opened georges letter long before shed reached the drawing room she returned to her seat by the window sank back and began to read first quickly and then very slowly january th my dearest one im alive even if im not kicking dont fret all ive ended up with is a broken ankle it could have been much worse the doc tells me that in time ill be right as rain and even able to climb again but in the meantime theyre sending me home to recuperate ruth stared out of the window at the surrey hills in the distance not sure whether to laugh or cry it was some time before she returned to georges letter sadly sergeant davies and corporal perkins were struck down in the same action two fine men like so many of their comrades i hope youll forgive me my darling but i felt i had to drop a line to their wives before i got down to writing to you it all began when sgt davies told me that we had a problem im going to recommend that you are discharged in the next few days mallory and sent back to blighty until youre fully recovered thanks doc said george cheerfully dont thank me old fellow frankly i need the bed by the time youre ready to come back with a bit of luck this damn war will be over lets hope so said george looking around the field tent full of brave men whose lives would never be the same again by the way the doctor added a private rodgers dropped by this morning thought this might be yours it certainly is said george taking the photograph of ruth hed thought hed never see again shes quite a looker mused the doctor not you as well said george with a grin oh and youve got a visitor do you feel up to it yes id be delighted to see rodgers said george no its not rodgers its a captain geoffrey young oh im not sure im up to that said george a huge smile appearing on his face a nurse plumped up georges pillow and placed it behind his back as he waited for his climbing leader he could never think of geoffrey young as anything else but the welcoming smile on his lips turned to a frown as young limped into the tent my dear george young said i came the moment i heard one of the advantages of being in the ambulance auxiliary service is that you get to know where everyone is and what theyre up to young pulled up a small wooden chair that must have previously been used in a french classroom and sat down beside georges bed so much news i dont know where to begin why not start with ruth did you get the chance to visit her when you were last on leave yes i dropped in to the holt on my way back to dover and how is she asked george trying not to sound impatient as beautiful as ever and seems to have fully recovered fully recovered said george anxiously following the birth of your second child said young my second child said george you mean to say that nobodys told you that youre the proud father of he paused i think it was a girl george offered up a silent prayer to a god he didnt believe in and how is she he demanded seemed fine to me said young but then to be honest i can never tell one baby from another what color are her eyes ive no idea old chap and is her hair fair or dark sort of in between i think although i could be wrong youre hopeless has ruth decided on a name i had a ghastly feeling you might ask me that could it be elizabeth i dont think so more unusual than that it will come to me in a moment george burst out laughing spoken like a true bachelor well youll find out for yourself soon enough said young because the doc tells me hes sending you home just make sure you dont come back youve done more than enough to salve your conscience and theres certainly no need to shorten the odds against you george thought about a dead corporal who would have agreed with young what other news asked george some good some badmostly bad im afraid george remained silent while young tried to compose himself rupert brooke died at lemnos while on his way to gallipolieven before he reached some foreign field george pursed his lips hed kept a book of brookes poetry in his knapsack and had assumed that once the war was over he must surely produce some memorable verse george didnt interrupt as he waited for other names to be added to the inevitable list of dead one he dreaded most siegfried herford bought it at ypres poor devil it took him three days to die young sighed if a man like that has to die before his time it shouldnt be on some muddy field in no mans land but on the summit of a great mountain hes just conquered and somervell george dared to ask hes had to witness some of the worst atrocities this war could throw at a man poor fellow being a frontline surgeon cant be much fun but he never complains odell wounded three times the war office finally got the message and sent him back to cambridge but only after his old college had offered him a fellowship someone up there has at last worked out that were going to need our finest minds once this mess has been sorted out and finch ill bet he found himself some cushy number taking care of nurses far from it said young he volunteered to head up a bomb disposal unit so his chances of survival are even less than the boys at the front hes had several offers of a safe job in whitehall but he always turns them downits almost as if he wants to die no said george he doesnt want to die finch is one of those rare individuals who doesnt believe anyone or anything can kill him remember him singing waltzing matilda on mont blanc young chuckled and to cap it all theyre going to give him an mbe good heavens laughed george nothing will stop him now unless you do said young quietly once that ankle of yours is healed my bet is that you two will still be the first to stand on the top of the world with you as usual a pace ahead of us im afraid that will no longer be possible old boy why not youre still a young man true said young but it might not prove quite that easy with one of these he pulled up his left trouser leg to reveal an artificial limb im so sorry said george shocked i had no idea dont worry about it old fellow said young im just thankful to be alive however once this war is over there are no prizes for guessing who ill be recommending to the everest committee as climbing leader ruth was sitting by the window in the drawing room when a khakicolored car drove through the front gates she couldnt make out who was behind the wheel apart from the fact that he or she was in uniform ruth was already outside by the time the young woman driver stepped out of the car and opened the back door the first thing to emerge was a pair of crutches followed by a pair of legs followed by her husband ruth dashed down the steps and threw her arms around him she kissed him as if it were the first time which brought back memories of a sleeping compartment in the train home from venice the driver stood to attention looking slightly embarrassed thank you corporal said george with a grin she saluted climbed back into the car and drove off ruth eventually let go of george but only because he refused to allow her to help him up the steps and into the house as she walked beside him into the drawing room george demanded wheres my little girl shes in the nursery with clare and nanny ill go and fetch them whats her name george called after her but ruth was already halfway up the stairs george propelled himself into the drawing room and fell into a chair by the window he didnt remember a chair being there before and wondered why it was facing outward he looked at the english countryside that he loved so much reminded once again of just how lucky he was to be alive brooke herford wainwright carter minor davies perkins his thoughts were interrupted by cries that he heard long before he set eyes on his second daughter george heaved himself up as ruth and nanny mallory entered the room with his two daughters he hugged clare for some time before taking the little bundle in his arms fair hair and blue eyes he said i thought you already knew that said ruth didnt you get my letters sadly not only your messenger geoffrey young who just about remembered that it was a girl and certainly couldnt recall her name thats funny said ruth because i asked him if hed be godfather and he agreed so you dont know her name daddy said clare jumping up and down no i dont said george is it elizabeth no daddy dont be silly its beridge said clare laughing more unusual than that said george to himself recalling geoffrey youngs words after only a few moments in georges arms beridge began howling and nanny quickly took charge of her the child obviously didnt appreciate being held by a strange man lets have half a dozen more said george taking ruth in his arms once nanny had taken clare and beridge back to the nursery behave yourself george teased ruth try to remember that youre no longer on the front line with your troops some of the finest men ive ever known said george sadly ruth smiled will you miss them not half as much as ive missed you so now youre back my darling whats the first thing youd like to do george thought about private matthewss response when hed been asked the same question he smiled to himself realizing that there wasnt a great deal of difference between an officer and a private soldier he bent down and began to untie his shoelace book four selecting the team chapter twentyeight wednesday june nd when george came down to breakfast that morning nobody spoke whats going on he asked as he took his place at the head of the table between his two daughters i know said clare but mummy told me not to tell you what about beridge said george dont be silly daddy you know beridge cant read read said george looking at clare more closely sherlock holmes would have told us that read was the first clue whos sherlock holmes demanded clare a great detective said george he would have looked around the room to see what there was to read now could this secret possibly be in the newspaper yes said clare clapping her hands and mummy says its something youve wanted all your life another clue said george picking up that mornings times which was open at page eleven he smiled the moment he saw the headline your mother is quite right read the story daddy read the story mp nancy astor has made a speech in the house of commons on womens rights george looked up at ruth and said i only wish i was having breakfast with your father this morning perhaps said ruth but sherlock holmes would tell you that youre wasting your time mrs astors speech is nothing more than a red herring george began to turn the page ruth smiled when she saw his hand begin to tremble she hadnt seen that look on his face since read the story daddy george dutifully obeyed sir francis younghusband he began announced last night that the royal geographical society will be joining forces with the alpine club to form an everest committee of which he will be the chairman with mr geoffrey young as his deputy he looked up to see ruth smiling at him keep on reading daddy keep on reading the committees first task will be to select a party of climbers who will make the first assault on mount everest george looked up again ruth was still smiling he quickly returned to the article before clare could admonish him again our correspondent understands that among the names being canvassed for climbing leader are mr george mallory a schoolmaster at charterhouse and mr george finch an australian scientist currently lecturing at imperial college london but no ones been in touch with me said george ruth was still smiling as she handed him an envelope that had arrived in the morning post bearing the royal geographical societys crest on the back elementary my dear watson she said whos watson demanded clare chapter twentynine none of the five men seated around the table particularly liked each other but that was not their purpose they had all been chosen as members of the everest committee for different reasons the chairman sir francis younghusband had been closer to everest than any of them forty miles when he had been entrusted to negotiate terms with the dalai lama for the expeditions safe crossing of the border into tibet the exact words had been spelled out in a treaty signed earlier that year by lord curzon the foreign secretary sir francis sat bolt upright at the head of the table his feet not quite touching the floor as he stood barely five foot one his thick wavy gray hair and lined forehead give him an air of authority that was rarely questioned on his left sat arthur hinks the secretary of the committee whose primary purpose was to protect the reputation of the rgs which he represented and which paid his annual stipend his forehead was not yet lined and the few tufts of hair left on his otherwise bald head were not yet gray on the table in front of him were several files and a newly acquired minute book some wags claimed that he wrote up the minutes of a meeting the day before it took place so he could be certain that everything went as planned no one would have suggested as much to his face on hinkss left sat mr raeburn who had once been considered a fine alpinist but the cigar he held permanently in one hand and the paunch pressed against the edge of the table meant that only those with good memories could recall his climbing days opposite him sat commander ashcroft a retired naval officer who always had a snifter with hinks just before a meeting opened so that he could be instructed how to cast his vote hed reached the rank of commander by never disobeying orders his weatherbeaten face and white beard would have left even a casual observer in no doubt where hed spent the majority of his days on his left and the chairmans right sat a man who had hoped to be the first person to stand on top of the world until the germans had put a stop to that the grandfather clock at one end of the room chimed six and it pleased sir francis that he didnt have to call for order after all the men seated around the table were used to giving and taking orders gentlemen he said it is an honor for me to open this inaugural meeting of the everest committee following the success of the expedition that surveyed the outlying regions of the himalaya last year our purpose is now to identify a group of climbers who are capable of planting the union jack at the summit of the highest mountain on earth i was recently granted an audience with his majesty sir francis glanced up at the portrait of their patron hanging on the walland i assured him that one of his subjects would be the first man to stand on the summit of everest hear hear mumbled raeburn and ashcroft in unison sir francis paused and looked down at the notes prepared for him by hinks our first task this evening will be to appoint a leader to take the team we select as far as the foothills of the himalaya where he will set up a base camp probably at around feet our second duty will be to choose a climbing leader for some years gentlemen i had anticipated that that man would be mr geoffrey winthrop young but due to an injury he sustained in the war that will sadly not be possible however we are still able to call upon his vast experience of and expertise in climbing matters and warmly welcome him to this committee as deputy chairman young gave a slight bow i will now call upon mr hinks to guide us through the agenda for this meeting thank you mr chairman said hinks touching his mustache as you have reminded us our first duty is to select a leader for the expedition this must be a man of resolute character and proven leadership ability preferably with some experience of the himalaya he must also be skilled in diplomacy in case there should be any trouble with the natives hear hear said a member of the committee sounding to young as if he was coming in on cue gentlemen continued hinks i am in no doubt that we have identified the one man who embodies all these characteristics namely general charles granville bruce late of the fifth royal gurkha rifles the committee may be interested to know that the general is the youngest son of lord aberdare and was educated at harrow and sandhurst raeburn and ashcroft immediately responded again with hear hear i have no hesitation therefore in recommending to the committee that we appoint general bruce as campaign leader and invite him to join us as a member that all sounds very satisfactory said younghusband can i assume that the committee is in agreement and that bruce is the obvious man for the job he glanced around the table to find that all but one of the committee members were nodding mr chairman said young this decision as to who should lead the expedition has been taken by the rgs and rightly so however as i was not privy to the selection process i am curious to know if any other candidate was considered for the post perhaps you would care to answer that query mr hinks said younghusband of course mr chairman responded hinks placing a pair of halfmoon spectacles on the end of his nose several names were put forward for our consideration but frankly young it quickly became clear that general bruce was head and shoulders above the rest i hope that answers your question young said sir francis i hope so too mr chairman said young then perhaps the time has come to invite the general to join us said sir francis hinks coughed yes mr hinks said sir francis have i forgotten something no mr chairman said hinks peering over the top of his spectacles but perhaps we should put the matter to a vote before general bruce is elected as a member of the committee yes of course said sir francis i propose that general bruce be appointed as leader of the expedition and be coopted onto this committee will someone please second that motion hinks immediately raised his hand those in favor said sir francis four hands shot up those against no hands were raised are there any abstentions young raised his hand before you make a note in the minutes mr hinks said younghusband dont you think young that it would be helpful if we were to give general bruce our unanimous support in normal circumstances i would agree with you mr chairman said young sir francis smiled however i feel it would be irresponsible of me to vote for a man ive never met however well qualified he appears to be so be it said sir francis i declare the motion carried by four votes to none with one abstention shall i ask general bruce to join us said hinks yes please do replied sir francis hinks rose from his place and a porter immediately jumped up opened the door at the far end of the room and stood aside to allow him to enter an anteroom where three men were seated waiting to be called before the committee general bruce if you would be kind enough to join us said hinks without giving the other two men so much as a glance thank you hinks said the general heaving himself up from his chair and following the secretary slowly back into the committee room welcome general bruce said sir francis do come and join us he added ushering bruce toward an empty chair i am delighted to tell you said sir francis after bruce had taken his seat that the committee has voted to invite you to oversee this great adventure and also to join us as a member of the executive board my thanks mr chairman to you and the committee for its confidence said the general toying with his monocle before pouring himself a large whiskey be assured i will do my damnedest to prove worthy of it i believe youre acquainted with everyone on the committee general except our deputy chairman mr young young took a closer look at the general and doubted if he was a day under sixty if he was to make the arduous journey to the foothills of the himalaya a very sturdy beast would be needed to transport him our next duty gentlemen said sir francis is to select a climbing leader who will take over from general bruce once he has led the expedition across the border into tibet where he will set up base camp the person we choose will have the responsibility of identifying the route by which the final party possibly including himself will make the first assault on the summit of everest sir francis paused let us pray that whomever we select will succeed in this noble enterprise young bowed his head and wondered if any of the men seated around the table had the slightest idea what they were asking these brave young men to do in gods name sir francis paused again before adding the alpine club has put forward two names for our consideration perhaps this would be the appropriate moment to ask our deputy chairman if he would like to say a few words by way of introduction thank you mr chairman said young i can tell the committee that in the opinion of the alpine club these two candidates are unquestionably the finest climbers in the british isles the only other man in their class was siegfried herford who was sadly cut down at ypres thank you said the chairman i should point out once again that had captain young not been wounded on the western front there would be no need for this interview to take place its kind of you to say so mr chairman but i can assure the committee that both of these young men are capable of carrying out the task and which of the two gentlemen should we see first asked sir francis mr leigh mallory said hinks before anyone else could offer an opinion its george mallory actually said young very well perhaps we should invite mr mallory to join us suggested the chairman once again hinks rose from his place and the porter opened the door that led into the anteroom hinks peered at the two men who were seated below a portrait of queen mary and without having the slightest idea which was which said mr mallory please follow me george stood up good luck mallory said finch dont forget that youve only got one friend in there hinks stopped in his tracks and for a moment looked as if he was going to respond but evidently thought better of it and walked back into the committee room without another word mr mallory said sir francis as george entered the room its good of you to spare us your time he rose from his chair and shook hands with the candidate i do apologize for keeping you waiting george smiled i know that mr young has informed you why youre here this evening so perhaps youd be kind enough to take a seat at the top of the table the committee have one or two questions for you of course sir francis said george a little nervously may i begin said sir francis once george was seated by asking if you are in any doubt that we can succeed in this massive endeavor and by that i mean conquering everest no one can possibly answer that question with any authority sir francis said george as only a handful of mountaineers have ever climbed higher than feet my brother trafford a pilot with the raf tells me that even an airplane hasnt yet reached feet which is the height of everest but youd still be willing to give it a go wouldnt you asked raeburn who was puffing away on a cigar and looked as if his idea of a challenging climb would be the steps to his club of course i would said george enthusiastically but as no one has ever attempted to scale everest we have no way of knowing what difficulties it might present for example are you a married man mr mallory asked commander ashcroft reading from the piece of paper in front of him yes i am sir any family two daughters george replied slightly puzzled by the question he couldnt see how clare and beridge could possibly help him to climb a foot mountain are there any more questions for mr mallory asked sir francis as he checked his halfhunter pocket watch was that it thought george in disbelief was this bunch of old buffers going to decide between finch and himself on the basis of such irrelevant questions it looked as if finch had been right about hinks and his cronies i have a question for mr mallory said hinks george smiled perhaps hed misjudged the man can i confirm said hinks that you were educated at winchester yes i was said george wondering once again what possible relevance the question might have and from there you went up to magdalene college cambridge to read history yes repeated george he was tempted to add but i had to climb the college wall to make sure they offered me a place but somehow he managed to hold his tongue and you graduated with an honors degree before taking up a teaching post at charterhouse that is correct said george still unsure where this could possibly be leading and although as a schoolmaster you were exempt from serving in the armed forces you nevertheless volunteered and were commissioned as an officer in the royal artillery seeing action on the western front yes said george he glanced at young in the hope of guidance only to find that he looked equally bemused and after the war you returned to charterhouse to become the senior history master george nodded but said nothing thats all i needed to know thank you mr chairman george once again glanced at young but he just shrugged his shoulders are there any more questions for mr mallory asked sir francis or can we let him go the man with the cigar raised his hand yes mr raeburn said younghusband if you were selected as climbing leader for this expedition mallory would you be willing to purchase your own equipment im sure i could manage that said george after a moments hesitation and would you also be able to pay for your passage to india inquired ashcroft george hesitated because he couldnt be sure to what extent his fatherinlaw would be willing to assist him he eventually said i would hope so good show mallory said sir francis now all thats left for me to do is thank you on behalf of the hinks furiously scribbled a note which he thrust under younghusbands nose ah yes sir francis said if you were to be selected would you be prepared to undergo a medical examination of course sir francis said george capital said the chairman the committee will be in touch with you in the near future to let you know our decision george rose from his place still slightly bemused and left the room without another word when the porter had closed the door behind him george said it was even worse than you predicted i did warn you said finch just be sure you dont say anything youll regret george finch always knew mallory was serious when he addressed him by his christian name what can you possibly mean old chap he asked humor them dont lose your temper try to remember that its going to be you and me standing at feet preparing for the final climb while that lot will be back in their clubs sitting in front of a log fire and enjoying a glass of brandy what a splendid fellow hinks said i agree said raeburn exactly the sort of chap were looking for wouldnt you agree general i certainly liked the cut of his jib said bruce but i think we need to see the other chap before we come to a decision geoffrey young smiled for the first time the other fellow doesnt look in the same class on paper said ashcroft you wont find many mountains on paper commander said young trying not to sound exasperated that may well be the case said hinks but i feel i should point out to the committee that mr finch is an australian i was given to understand said raeburn that we were only considering chaps from the british isles i think youll find mr chairman said young that australia is still part of his majestys farflung empire quite so said sir francis perhaps we should see the fellow before we jump to conclusions hinks made no effort to rise from his seat he simply folded his arms and nodded at the porter who bowed deferentially opened the door and announced mr finch chapter thirty mr finch the porter repeated a little more firmly got to leave you old chap said finch and added with a grin which is exactly what ill be saying when were a couple of hundred feet from the summit finch strolled into the committee room and sat down in the chair at the end of the table before sir francis had an opportunity to welcome him young could only smile when he saw how finch had dressed for the interview it was almost as if hed set out to provoke the committee a casual corduroy jacket a pair of baggy cream flannels an opennecked shirt and no tie when young had briefed mallory and finch it hadnt crossed his mind to mention a dress code but to this committee the candidates appearance would be every bit as important as their climbing record they were now all staring at finch in disbelief ashcroft even had his mouth open young leaned back and waited for the fireworks to be ignited well mr finch said sir francis once hed recovered let me welcome you on behalf of the committee and ask if you are prepared to answer a few questions of course i am said finch thats why im here capital said sir francis then ill get the ball rolling by asking if youre in any doubt that this great enterprise can be achieved by that i mean do you believe you are capable of leading a team to the summit of everest yes i can do that said finch but nobody has any idea how the human body will react to such altitude one scientist has even suggested we might explode and although i think thats a fatuous notion it does indicate that we havent a clue what well be up against im not sure i follow you old chap said raeburn then allow me to elucidate mr raeburn the elderly gentleman looked surprised that finch knew his name what we do know is that the higher you climb the thinner the air becomes meaning that every movement a mountaineer makes at altitude will be more difficult than the last that may result in some falling by the wayside yourself included perhaps said hinks not looking directly at him yes indeed mr hinks finch said looking back at the secretary but despite all that said raeburn you would still be willing to give it a go yes i would finch replied firmly but i should warn the committee that the success or failure of this project may depend on the use of oxygen during the last feet im not altogether sure i follow your drift said sir francis i reckon that above feet replied finch we will find it almost impossible to breathe ive carried out some experiments at feet which showed that with the assistance of bottled oxygen its possible to continue climbing at almost the same rate as at a much lower altitude but wouldnt that be cheating old chap asked ashcroft its always been our aim to test mans ability against the elements without resorting to mechanical aids the last time i heard a similar opinion expressed publicly was at a lecture given by the late captain scott in this very building im sure gentlemen that you dont need reminding how that sad adventure ended everyone on the committee was now staring at finch as if he was the subject of a bateman cartoon but he continued unabashed scott not only failed to be first to reach the south pole finch reminded them but as you all know only too well he and the rest of his party perished amundsen not only reached the pole ahead of scott but is continuing to lead expeditions to the uncharted places around the globe yes i would like to be the first person to stand on the top of the world but i would also like to return to london to deliver a lecture on the subject to the royal geographical society it was some time before the next question was asked allow me to ask you mr finch said hinks choosing his words carefully does mr mallory agree with you on the use of oxygen no he doesnt admitted finch he thinks he can climb everest without it but then hes a historian mr hinks not a scientist are there any more questions for this candidate asked sir francis looking as if he had already made up his mind on who the committee should select as climbing leader for the expedition yes mr chairman said hinks there are just one or two matters id like to clear up simply for the record you understand sir francis nodded mr finch could you tell the committee where you were born and where you were educated i dont see how thats relevant replied finch i have no idea where mr alcock or mr brown was educated but i do know that they were the first men to fly across the atlantic and that they were only able to achieve that mr hinks with the help of a mechanical aid known as an airplane young tried not to smile although he was no longer in any doubt who the committee would select as climbing leader be that as it may said hinks we at the rgs forgive me for interrupting you mr hinks but i was under the impression that i was being interviewed by the everest committee said finch as the societys secretary you signed a minute to that effect be that as it may repeated hinks trying to compose himself perhaps you would be kind enough to answer my question young considered intervening but remained silent confident that finch could handle himself just as well in a committee room as he did on a mountain i was born in australia but i was educated in zurich said finch and attended the university of geneva ashcroft leaned across the table and whispered to raeburn i had no idea that geneva had a university i thought it was just full of banks and cuckoo clocks said raeburn and what is your profession asked hinks im a chemist replied finch which is how i know about the significance of oxygen at high altitude i always thought chemistry was a hobby said ashcroft this time loud enough to be heard not a profession only for children commander ashcroft said finch looking him straight in the eye and are you a married man finch asked raeburn flicking some ash off the end of his cigar i am a widower said finch a reply which took young by surprise hinks scribbled a question mark against marital status and do you have any children asked ashcroft yes one son peter tell me finch said raeburn clipping the end off another cigar if you were selected for this important role would you be willing to pay for your own equipment only if i had to said finch i am aware that the committee has launched an appeal to raise funds for this expedition and i assumed that some of that money would be used to equip the climbers and what about your travel expenses pressed ashcroft out of the question replied finch if i were to take part in the expedition i would be out of work for at least six months and although i dont expect any financial recompense for loss of earnings i see no reason why i should also have to cover my own expenses so you wouldnt describe yourself as an amateur old chap said ashcroft no sir i would not im a professional in everything i do are you indeed said ashcroft i dont think we need detain mr finch any longer gentlemen suggested sir francis looking around the table i have some further questions for mr finch said young unable to maintain his silence any longer but surely you know everything you need to know about mr finch said hinks youve known this candidate for years i have indeed but the rest of the committee has not and i suspect they might find mr finchs answers to my questions illuminating mr finch said young turning to face the candidate have you ever climbed mont blanc the highest mountain in europe on seven occasions replied finch and the matterhorn three times and any of the other major peaks in the alps all of them i climb in the alps every year and what about the highest mountains in the british isles i gave them up before i was out of short trousers this is all on the record mr chairman said hinks for those whove taken the trouble to read it retorted young unperturbed can i confirm mr finch that after completing your education in geneva you took up a place as an undergraduate at imperial college london that is correct confirmed finch and what subject did you read chemistry replied finch having decided to play along with youngs little ruse what class of degree did that august establishment award you a firstclass honors degree said finch smiling for the first time and did you remain at london university after you had graduated asked young yes i did said finch i joined the staff as a lecturer in chemistry and did you remain in that position after the war broke out mr finch or did you like mr mallory enlist in the armed forces i enlisted in the army in august a few days after war was declared and in which branch of the army did you serve asked young as a chemist replied finch looking directly at ashcroft i felt my expertise could be put to good use by volunteering for the bomb disposal squad bomb disposal squad said young emphasizing all three words can you elaborate certainly mr young the war office was looking for men to defuse unexploded bombs quite fun really so you never saw action on the front line said hinks no mr hinks i did not i found that german bombs had a tendency to fall on our side of the line not theirs and were you ever decorated asked hinks leafing through his notes young smiled the first mistake hinks had made i was awarded the mbe said finch matteroffactly good show said bruce thats not something they give out with the rations i see no mention of this decoration in your records blustered hinks trying to recover perhaps thats because i didnt feel ones place of birth educational qualifications and marital status had much to do with attempting to climb the highest mountain on earth hinks was silenced for the first time well if there are no more questions said sir francis allow me to thank mr finch for attending this meeting he hesitated before adding someone will be in touch with you in the near future finch rose from his place nodded to young and was just about to leave when hinks said just one more question can i confirm that like mr mallory you would be willing to undergo a medical examination of course i would said finch and left the room without another word rum sort of fellow dont you think said raeburn once the porter had closed the door but surely there can be no doubting his ability as an alpine climber said young hinks smiled no doubt youre right young but we at the rgs have always been wary of social climbers dont you think thats a little rough hinks said sir francis considering the chaps war record turning to bruce he asked youve led men into battle general what did you make of the fellow id prefer to have him on my side rather than the enemys thats for sure said bruce given a fair wind i think i could knock him into shape what do we do next asked sir francis turning back to hinks for guidance the members should now proceed to vote on their choice for climbing leader mr chairman for the convenience of the committee ive had ballot papers prepared on which members may place a cross beside the name of their preferred candidate hinks handed a slip of paper to each member of the committee once youve made your choice please return your ballot papers to me the process took only a few moments and as hinks counted the votes a thin smile appeared on his face that grew wider every time he opened another ballot paper he finally passed the result across to the chairman so that he could officially announce the outcome five votes for mallory and theres one abstention said younghusband unable to hide his surprise it was me again announced young but you know both the candidates well said sir francis after all it was you who placed their names in front of the committee perhaps i know them too well replied young they are both fine young men in their different ways but after all these years i still cant make up my mind which one of them is more likely to accomplish the feat of being the first man to stand on top of the world i am in no doubt which man id prefer to see representing this country said hinks there were mutterings of hear hear but not from all quarters any other business asked younghusband we should simply confirm for the official record said hinks that now that we have appointed a climbing leader we willingly accept nem con mr youngs recommendations for the remaining eight places in the climbing team yes of course said sir francis after all that is no more than i agreed with the alpine club prior to this committee being set up i hope remarked ashcroft that not too many of them are cut from the same cloth as that fellow finch no fear of that said hinks looking down at the list apart from finch theyre all oxford or cambridge men well that must just about wrap it up said sir francis a smile returned to hinkss lips mr chairman theres still the small matter of the medical examinations that all the prospective members of the climbing team have agreed to undergo presumably youd like that to be out of the way before the committee reconvenes next month that makes sense to me said sir francis no doubt you will handle all the details mr hinks of course mr chairman chapter thirtyone hinks sat alone in his club nursing a glass of brandy while he waited for his guest he knew that lampton wouldnt be late but he needed a little time to compose his thoughts before the good doctor arrived lampton had carried out several delicate commissions for the rgs in the past but his next undertaking would have to be handled most carefully if no one was to suspect hinks of being personally involved hinks smiled as he recalled machiavellis words once you know a mans ambition if you can assist it he becomes beholden to you he was well aware of one of lamptons ambitions hinks rose from his seat as a porter led dr lampton into the library once theyd settled in a secluded corner of the room and dispensed with the usual small talk hinks made his wellprepared opening i see your name is up for membership of the club lampton he said as a waiter placed two glasses of brandy on the table between them it is indeed mr hinks lampton replied nervously picking up and toying with his glass but then who wouldnt want to be a member of boodles and you shall be a member dear boy said hinks in fact i can tell you that ive added my name to your list of supporters thank you mr hinks i think we can dispense with the mr after all youll soon be a member of this club do call me hinks thank you hinks hinks glanced around the room to check that he could not be overheard as you know old boy one of the club rules is that you cant discuss business matters over dinner damned fine rule said lampton i only wish it applied at st thomass i often feel like telling my colleagues that the last thing i want to talk about over lunch is whats going on in the hospital quite so said hinks mind you the rule doesnt apply here in the library so let me tell you in the strictest confidence that the society wishes to instruct you to carry out a most important piece of scientific research on its behalf i must emphasize this is in the strictest confidence you can rely on me hinks excellent but first a little background you may have read in the times that the society is planning to send a select team of climbers to tibet for the purpose of making an attempt on the summit of mount everest good heavens rather appropriate said hinks and both men laughed with that in mind we would like to appoint you to conduct a series of tests on the twelve men who are under consideration for the nine places in that team clearly the most important matter will be your professional opinion as to how well equipped they are to survive at an altitude of feet is that the height of everest twentynine thousand and two feet to be exact said hinks now of course it goes without saying that the rgs cannot risk sending a chap all that way if hes going to break down the moment he reaches a certain altitude that would be a waste of the societys time and money quite so agreed lampton how much time do i have to conduct these tests i have to report back to the committee in three weeks time said hinks removing a piece of paper from an inside pocket here are the twelve names that have been put forward by the alpine club only nine of them will travel as part of the climbing team so feel free to eliminate any three who fall short of the mark he passed the slip of paper to his guest so that he could study the names more carefully lampton glanced at the list i see no reason why my report shouldnt be on your desk within a fortnight thats assuming all the climbers will be available theyll be available said hinks he paused and once again looked around the room i wonder lampton if i may speak to you on a confidential matter feel free to do so old fellow you should know that the committee would not be displeased if you were to find that one particular applicant did not possess the physical attributes necessary for such a demanding expedition i fully understand said lampton hinks leaned across and placed a finger next to the second name on the list chapter thirtytwo one hundred and twelveone hundred and thirteenone hundred and fourteen finch finally collapsed on the ground george kept going but he only managed another seven pressups before he also gave up a personal record he lay flat on the floor raised his head and grinned at finch who always managed to bring out the best in him or was it the worst dr lampton made an entry on his clipboard of the totals achieved by each of the twelve men and noted that mallory and finch had been in the top five for every test with very little to choose between them he was already beginning to wonder what possible reason he could come up with to disqualify finch who clearly only had one rival as the fittest member of the group lampton stood in the center of the gymnasium and asked the twelve men to gather around him i congratulate all of you he said on having come through the first part of the test unscathed which means that youre qualified to enter my torture chamber they all laughed lampton wondered how many of them would be laughing in an hours time please follow me gentlemen he said and led them down a long brick corridor until he came to an unmarked door he unlocked it and stepped into a large square room the like of which george had never seen gentlemen said lampton you are now standing in a decompression chamber that was commissioned by the admiralty during the war to test submariners ability to endure long periods of time below the surface of the ocean the chamber has been modified to reproduce the conditions we believe you are likely to encounter when climbing everest let me tell you about some of the equipment you see before you the moving staircase in the center of the room is not unlike those you will be familiar with from traveling on the london underground one or two of those present were loath to admit they had never traveled on the underground and remained silent there is however one significant difference continued lampton our moving staircase is not intended to assist you on the contrary it is there to resist you while it is moving downward you will be climbing upward a motion that will take you a few moments to become accustomed to it is important to remember that this is not a race but an endurance test the staircase will move at approximately five miles an hour and you will attempt to remain on it for sixty minutes i can see from the expressions on one or two of your faces that you are beginning to wonder what all the fuss is about continued lampton after all it would not be uncommon for men of your experience and ability to climb for many hours without a break however there are one or two other things you will have to contend with during the next sixty minutes the chamber is currently at room temperature and its atmosphere is set to closely approximate that found at sea level by the end of the hour any of you who are still able to move at that pace will be experiencing the conditions they might expect to encounter at feet as the temperature in the room will have fallen to minus forty degrees that is the reason i asked you to dress exactly as you would for a climb i shall also be introducing another little challenge if you look at the far wall you will see two large industrial fans my wind machines and let me assure you gentlemen it will not be a following wind one or two of the twelve laughed nervously once i set them in motion they will do everything in their power to blow you off the escalator finally you will notice several rubber mats blankets and buckets placed around the room once you have been forced off the moving staircase you will be able to rest and warm yourself im sure i dont have to explain why the buckets are placed by the bottom of the escalator this time no one laughed on the wall to your left are a clock a gauge showing the temperature in the chamber and an altimeter to indicate the atmospheric pressure i will now give you a few moments to familiarize yourself with how the moving staircase works i suggest that you position yourselves two steps apart should you find yourself having difficulty in maintaining your pace move to the right and allow the man behind to overtake you are there any questions whats on the other side of that window asked norton the only candidate george hadnt come across before a soldier who had been recommended by general bruce thats where the control room is located its from there that my staff will observe your progress we can see you but you cant see us when the hour is up the escalator will come to a halt the wind machines will be turned off and the temperature will return to normal at that point you will be joined by several doctors and nurses who will carry out tests to assess your rate of recovery now gentlemen would you be so kind as to take your places on the escalator finch immediately ran up to the top step while george took his place two steps below him with somervell a further two steps behind the staircase will start to move the moment the buzzer sounds said lampton it will sound again ten minutes later by which time the atmosphere in the chamber will be equivalent to that found at an altitude of feet and the temperature will have fallen to zero the buzzer will continue to sound at tenminute intervals throughout the test the wind machines will be turned on after forty minutes if anyone is still on their feet at the end of one hour they will i repeat be experiencing a temperature of minus forty degrees and the atmosphere found at feet good luck gentlemen lampton left the room and closed the door behind him they all heard a key turning in the lock the twelve men stood nervously on the staircase waiting for the buzzer to sound george took a deep breath through his nose filling his lungs with air he avoided looking at finch two steps above him or at somervell two steps below are you ready gentlemen said the voice of dr lampton over a loudspeaker the buzzer sounded and the staircase began to move at what seemed to george a fairly gentle pace for ten minutes the twelve climbers all maintained their positions and george didnt sense much of a change when the buzzer sounded a second time the staircase continued to move at the same speed although the indicators on the wall showed that the temperature had fallen to zero and the atmospheric conditions were those of feet everyone was still in place after twenty minutes when the buzzer sounded a third time by thirty minutes they had reached feet and the temperature was ten degrees below zero still no one had fallen by the wayside kenwright was the first to take a step to the right and slowly drift down past his colleagues before finally ending up at the foot of the staircase he struggled gamely to reach the nearest mat where he collapsed in a heap it was some minutes before he had the strength even to pull a blanket over his body lampton drew a line through his name he would not be part of the team traveling to tibet finch and mallory were maintaining the pace at the top of the escalator with somervell bullock and odell on their heels george had almost forgotten about the wind machines until the buzzer sounded for the fifth time and a blast of cold air hit him in the face he wanted to rub his eyes but knew that if he removed his goggles on a real mountain at feet he risked snow blindness he thought he saw finch stumble in front of him but he quickly recovered george didnt see the poor fellow a few steps below him who had removed his goggles and reeled backward as he took the full blast of cold wind in his face moments later he was on his hands and knees on the floor at the base of the staircase covering his eyes and vomiting lampton drew a line through the name of another man who wouldnt be making the passage to india when the buzzer sounded at fifty minutes they had reached feet with temperatures of minus twentyfive degrees only mallory finch odell somervell bullock and norton were still on their feet by the time they had reached feet bullock and odell had joined the others on the mats so exhausted they didnt have the strength to follow the progress of the four survivors dr lampton checked the clock and put a tick beside odells and bullocks names somervell managed just over fiftythree minutes before he fell off the staircase and collapsed to his hands and knees he tried valiantly to step back on but was immediately thrown off again norton was kneeling by his side a moment later lampton wrote minutes and minutes next to their names he then turned his attention to the two men who appeared to be immovable lampton lowered the temperature to minus forty degrees and raised the atmospheric pressure to that at feet but the two survivors still refused to be budged he turned the wind machine up to forty miles an hour finch stumbled regretting that he had bagged the top step as he was now shielding george from the full force of the wind but just as it looked as if he was beaten he somehow managed to recover and find enough strength to keep pace with the relentlessly moving escalator the clock showed both climbers that they only had three more minutes to go that was when george decided he would have to give up his legs felt like lumps of jelly he was frozen and gasping for breath and he was beginning to fall back he accepted that the victory would be finchs then without warning finch fell back a step and then another followed by a third which only made george more determined to hold on for the last ninety seconds until the final buzzer sounded when the staircase at last came to a halt he and finch fell into each others arms like a pair of legless drunks odell hauled himself up from his mat and staggered across to congratulate them somervell and norton joined them a moment later if bullock could have crawled across he would have done so but he remained spreadeagled on the mat still gasping for breath once the wind machine had been turned off the altitude returned to sea level and the temperature raised to normal the door of the chamber was unlocked and a dozen doctors and nurses rushed into the room and began to carry out tests on the participants to gauge their rates of recovery in less than five minutes georges heartbeat was back down to fortyeight by which time finch was strolling around the room chatting to those colleagues who were still standing dr lampton remained in the control room he knew he was going to have to tell hinks that mallory and finch were by far the most impressive candidates and frankly there was nothing to choose between them he was convinced that if anyone was likely to reach feet and stand on top of the world it was going to be one of those two chapter thirtythree when ruth picked up the phone she immediately recognized the voice on the other end of the line good morning headmaster she said yes he left a few moments agono he never drives to school headmaster he always walksits just under five miles and it usually takes him around fifty minutes goodbye headmaster george raised his ancient umbrella when he felt a few drops of rain land on his forehead he tried to think about his morning lesson with the lower fifthnot that he had anything new to tell them about the elizabethans he wondered how francis drake would have handled the problem that had been nagging away at him for the past decade he had not yet heard from the everest committee following last weeks medical tests still there could be a letter waiting for him when he returned home that evening there might even be a mention of the team selection in the timesif so andrew osullivan would be certain to bring it to his attention during the midmorning break however after finchs stalwart effort at the medical george would have no complaint if he turned out to be the committees choice as climbing leader hed laughed out loud when young had reported verbatim the exchange between finch and hinks that had taken place at the committee meeting he only wished he had been able to witness the encounter himself although he didnt agree with finch about the use of oxygen at high altitude he did accept that if they were to have any chance of making a good fist of it they would have to approach the whole exercise in a more professional manner than in the past and to learn from the mistakes made during the south pole debacle his thoughts turned to ruth and how supportive she had been the past year had been idyllic they were blessed with two lovely daughters and a lifestyle that would have been the envy of most men did he really want to travel to the other side of the earth and have to watch his children growing up by letter and photograph but it was ruth who had cruelly summed up his innermost dilemma when she had casually asked him how he would feel if andrew pointed out a photograph in the times of george finch standing on top of the world while he had just come from teaching the lower fifth george checked his watch as he passed a signpost that told him he still had three miles to walk and smiled he was a couple of minutes ahead of schedule for a change he disliked being late for morning assembly and ruth always did everything in her power to make sure he left home each morning well in time the headmaster always entered great hall as the clock chimed nine and if george was so much as thirty seconds late he had to slip in at the back during prayers while heads were bowed the problem was that the headmasters head was never bowednor were the lower fifths for that matter as he walked into school lane george was surprised to notice how few boys and masters were about even more puzzling when he reached the school gates there was nobody in sight was it half term a sunday perhaps no ruth would have remembered and reminded him to put on his best suit he walked across the empty quad toward the main hall but not a sound was coming from inside no headmaster no music not even a cough perhaps their heads were bowed in prayer he turned the large wroughtiron handle slowly and not wishing to make a sound pushed open the door and peered inside the hall was packed with every pupil in his place on the stage stood the headmaster with the rest of the staff seated behind him george was more mystified than everafter all nine oclock hadnt yet chimed and then one of the boys shouted there he is and everyone in the hall rose as one and began clapping and cheering well done sir what a triumph youll be first to reach the top someone shouted at him as he made his way down the center aisle toward the stage the headmaster shook george warmly by the hand and said we are all so very proud of you mallory then waited for the boys to resume their seats before announcing i will now call upon david elkington to address assembly the head boy rose from his place in the front row and walked up onto the stage he unrolled a scroll and began to read nos scholae carthusianae et pueri et magistri te georgium leigh mallory salutamus dilectus ad ducendum agmen britannicum super everest tantos honores ad omnes carthusianos iam tribuisti sine dubio o virum optime et maiorem gloriam et honorem in scholam tuam in universitatem tuam et ad patriam we the boys and masters of charterhouse salute george leigh mallory you have honored all carthusians by being chosen to lead the british assault on everest we are in no doubt sir that you will bring further glory and honor to your school your university and your country the head boy bowed before presenting the scroll to george once again the whole school rose to their feet and let the senior history master know exactly how they felt george bowed his head he preferred the lower fifth not to see him in tears chapter thirtyfour allow me to welcome you as a member of the committee mallory said sir francis warmly and may i add that we are delighted you felt able to accept the role of climbing leader hear hear hear hear thank you sir francis said george its a great honor to be invited to lead such a fine bunch of chaps he added as he took his place between geoffrey young and general bruce you will have read general bruces report said younghusband describing how the party will travel from liverpool to the foothills of everest perhaps you could advise the committee how you see matters proceeding once youve set up a base camp ive read general bruces report with great interest mr chairman said george and i agree with his assessment that it will be thorough and detailed preparation that will determine the success or failure of this whole expedition we must not forget that no englishman has ever been within forty miles of everest let alone set up a base camp on its lower slopes fair point admitted bruce his monocle falling from his eye but i am able to inform the committee that since writing my report i have had a meeting with lord curzon at the foreign office and he has assured me that he will do everything in his power to ensure a safe and swift passage across the border and into tibet jolly good show said raeburn flicking some ash off the end of his cigar but even if we are able to cross the border without incident said george the committee must understand that no human being has ever climbed above feet we dont even know if its possible to survive at such heights im bound to say mr chairman said ashcroft that i cant see a great deal of difference between and feet dont you know speaking for myself i dont know said george because ive never stood at feet let alone but if i ever do commander ill let you know now mallory said sir francis as no one knows the climbing team better than you wed be interested to hear who you think will accompany you on the final assault i wont be able to answer that question mr chairman until i know who has acclimatized best to the conditions but if i were to make a calculated guess ive pencilled in odell and somervellhinks allowed a smile to cross his faceas the backup team however i have only ever considered one man to be the obvious choice for the final climb and thats finch no one around the table spoke raeburn lit another cigar and ashcroft stared at his agenda it was left to sir francis to break the embarrassing silence he turned to hinks and said but i thought yes mr chairman said hinks looking across the table at george the secretary said im afraid thats not going to be possible mallory and why not asked george because finch will not be a member of the climbing party two of the alpine clubs recommendations failed the medical one of them was kenwright the other was finch but there must be some mistake said george ive rarely come across a fitter man in all my years of climbing i can assure you mallory there is no mistake said hinks extracting a sheet of paper from his file i have dr lamptons report to hand and it would appear that finch has a perforated eardrum which lampton believes could cause dizziness and vomiting and would prevent him from climbing for sustained periods at very high altitude its a pity that dr lampton hasnt stood by finchs side on the top of mont blanc or the matterhorn said young if he had he would have been able to record that he didnt have as much as a nosebleed that may well be said hinks however dont forget mr hinks said george that finch is the only member of the team who has extensive knowledge of the use of oxygen butcorrect me if i am wrong mallorywhen we last met you were opposed to the very idea of using oxygen said hinks youre right and i still am said george but if i were to discover having reached feet that not one member of my team was able to place one foot in front of the other i might be willing to reconsider my position norton and odell have also stated that they do not believe oxygen will prove necessary for the final climb norton and odell have never been higher than feet said young they might also be forced to change their minds perhaps i should point out to you mallory said hinks that finchs medical condition was not the only factor that influenced the societys decision it wasnt the societys decision to make said young angrily sir francis and i agreed that the alpine club would submit the names of the climbing party and the committee would not question its recommendations that may well have been the case said hinks however we have since discovered that when we interviewed finch for the position of climbing leader he lied to this committee both mallory and young were momentarily silenced which allowed hinks to continue uninterrupted when mr raeburn asked finch if he was a married man he informed this committee that he was a widower young bowed his head that turns out not to be the case as i found to my dismay when mrs finch wrote to assure me that she is alive and well hinks extracted a letter from his file the committee may wish to place on record the final paragraph of her letter he added solemnly mallory pursed his lips young however did not appear to be surprised george and i were divorced some two years ago read hinks and im sorry to have to inform your committee that a third party was involved the rotter said ashcroft not a man to be trusted said raeburn frankly said george ignoring both of them if we do manage to reach feet it isnt going to matter much if my climbing partner is a divorcee a widower or even a bigamist because i can assure you mr hinks no one will notice whether he is wearing a wedding ring let me try to understand what youre saying mallory said hinks going red in the face are you telling this committee that you would climb the last feet of mount everest with anyone provided that you were able to reach the summit anyone said george without hesitation even a german said hinks quietly even the devil replied george i say old chap said ashcroft dont you think that was uncalled for not as uncalled for as dying an unnecessary death five thousand miles from home because i didnt have the right climbing partner said george i am quite happy to record your strongly held feelings in the minutes mallory said hinks but our decision on finch is final george was silent for a moment then you can also record in the minutes mr hinks my resignation as climbing leader and as a member of this committee several of those around the table began to speak at once but george ignored them and added i am not willing to leave my wife and children for at least six months to take part in a mission that failed simply because it left its finest climber behind sir francis had to raise his voice to make himself heard above the tumult that followed gentlemen gentlemen he said tapping the side of his brandy glass with a pencil it is clear that we have reached an impasse that can be resolved only in one way what do you have in mind mr chairman asked hinks suspiciously we shall have to take a vote but i havent had time to prepare the necessary ballot papers blustered hinks ballot papers wont be necessary said sir francis after all its a simple enough decision is finch to be included in the climbing party or not hinks sank back in his chair struggling to conceal a smile very well said sir francis will those members in favor of finch being included in the climbing party please raise their hands mallory and young immediately put up their hands and to everyones surprise general bruce joined them those against said the chairman hinks raeburn and ashcroft raised their hands without hesitation thats three votes each said hinks recording the decision in his minute book which leaves you mr chairman with the casting vote everyone around the table turned toward sir francis he considered his position for a few moments before saying i cast my vote in favor of finch hinks held his pen poised above the minute book seemingly unable to record the chairmans vote mr chairman he said for the record may we know what caused you to reach this decision most certainly said sir francis it wont be me being asked to risk my life when mallory reaches feet chapter thirtyfive the little brass bell above the door rang good morning mr pink said george as he entered ede ravenscroft good morning mr mallory how may i assist you on this occasion sir george leaned across the counter ive just been selected as a member of the climbing party for the expedition to everest he whispered how very interesting mr mallory said the manager we havent had any other customers planning a holiday in that part of the world so may i be so bold as to ask what sort of weather conditions you might be expecting well im not altogether certain admitted george but as far as i can make out once weve reached feet we can expect galeforce winds a temperature of forty degrees below zero and so little oxygen that it may be almost impossible to breathe then youll certainly be needing a woolen scarf and some warm gloves not to mention the appropriate headgear said mr pink coming out from behind the counter the managers first suggestion was a cashmere burberry scarf followed by a pair of fleecelined black leather gloves george followed mr pink around the shop as he selected three pairs of thick gray woolen socks two navy blue jumpers a shackleton windcheater several silk shirts and the latest pair of furlined camping boots and may i inquire sir do you anticipate any snow during this trip most of the time i suspect said george then youll be needing an umbrella suggested mr pink and what about headgear sir i thought id take my brothers leather flying helmet and goggles said george i dont think youll find thats what fashionable gentlemen will be wearing climbing this year said mr pink handing him the latest deerstalker which is why it wont be a fashionable gentleman wholl be the first to set foot on the summit of everest george smiled when he saw finch approaching the counter his arms laden with goods we at ede and ravenscroft ventured mr pink believe that it matters how a gentleman looks when he attains the summit of any mountain i cant imagine why said finch as he placed his purchases on the counter there wont be any girls up there waiting for us will there be anything else mr finch asked the manager trying not to show his disapproval not at these prices there wont george said after checking his bill mr pink bowed politely and began to wrap up his customers purchases im glad we bumped into each other finch said george theres something i need to discuss with you dont tell me youve seen the light said finch and are at last considering the use of oxygen perhaps said george but i still need to be convinced then i need at least a couple of hours of your time as well as the proper equipment to hand so i can demonstrate why oxygen will make all the difference lets discuss it while were on the boat to bombay when youll have more than enough time to convince me thats assuming ill be on the boat but youve already been selected for the team only thanks to your intervention said finch scowling and im grateful because i suspect the nearest that hinks has been to a mountain is a christmas card that will be thirtythree pounds and eleven shillings mr finch said mr pink may i inquire how you intend to settle your bill on this occasion just put it on my account said finch trying to imitate mr pinks for customers accent the manager hesitated for a moment before giving finch a slight bow see you on board then said finch before picking up his brown paper bag and leaving the shop your bill comes to fortyone pounds four shillings and six pence mr mallory said mr pink george wrote out a check for the full amount thank you sir and may i say on behalf of all of us here at ede and ravenscroft that we hope you will be the first man to reach the summit of everest and not mr pink did not finish the sentence both men looked out of the window and watched finch as he strode off down the road book five walking off the map chapter thirtysix thursday march nd george knew the moment he stepped on board the ss caledonia at tilbury that he was embarking on a journey for which he had been preparing all his life the climbing team spent the fiveweek sea voyage to bombay getting better acquainted improving their fitness and learning how to work together as a unit every morning for an hour before breakfast they would run circuits around the deck with finch always setting the pace occasionally georges ankle would play up a little but he didnt admit it even to himself after breakfast he would lie out on the deck reading john maynard keyness the economic consequences of the peace but not until hed written his daily letter to ruth finch gave a couple of lectures on the use of oxygen at high altitudes the team dutifully disassembled and reassembled the thirtytwopound oxygen sets strapped them on each others backs and adjusted the valves that regulated the amount of gas released few of them seemed enthusiastic george watched intently there wasnt any doubt that finch knew what he was talking about although most of the team disapproved of the idea of using oxygen on principle norton said that the sheer weight of the cylinders would surely nullify any advantage their contents might have to offer what proof do you have finch that well need these infernal contraptions to get to the summit he demanded none admitted finch but should you find yourself at feet and unable to progress any further perhaps youll end up being grateful for one of these infernal contraptions id rather turn back said somervell and fail to reach the summit queried finch if thats the price so be it said odell adamantly although george was also against the idea of using oxygen he didnt offer an opinion after all he wouldnt be expected to make a decision if finch was proved wrong his thoughts were interrupted by an unmistakable bark of time for pt chaps the team clambered to their feet and formed three orderly lines in front of general bruce who stood with his hands on his hips and his feet firmly on the ground evidently having no intention of leading by example after an hour of furious exercise the general disappeared below deck for his morning snifter leaving the rest of the team to their own devices norton and somervell began a game of deck tennis while odell settled down to read e f bensons latest novel george and guy sat crosslegged on the deck chatting about the possibility of a cambridge man winning the hundred meters dash at the paris olympics ive seen abrahams run at fenners said george hes good damned good but somervell tells me theres a scot called liddell whos never lost a race in his life so it will be interesting to see what happens when they come up against each other well be back well in time to find out which of them wins gold in fact added guy with a grin it will be a good excuse to return tooh my god guy was looking over georges shoulder whats he up to now george swung around to see finch standing with his arms folded feet apart staring up at the ships funnels which were belching out clouds of black smoke surely he cant be considering i wouldnt put it past him said george hed do anything to be one up on the rest of the team i dont think he gives a damn about the rest of the team said guy its only you he wants to beat in which case replied george id better have a word with the captain george told ruth in one of his daily letters that he and finch were like two children always striving to outdo each other to gain teachers attention in this case teacher was general bruce who george confided may well be an old buffer but hes no fool and weve all happily accepted him as the expeditions leader he paused to look at ruths photograph which he had remembered to bring with him this time even though hed forgotten his razor and left home with only one pair of socks he continued to write i still spend so much of my time wondering if i made the right decision to come on this trip when youve found guinevere why go in search of the holy grail ive begun to realize that every day without you is a wasted day god knows i hope i will exorcise this demon once and for all so i can return to the holt and spend the rest of my life with you and the children i know how difficult you find it to put your true feelings into words but please let me know how you really feel your loving husband george ruth read georges letter a second time she still wondered if she had done the right thing in not letting him know before he left that she was pregnant again she rose from her chair by the window walked across to her little bureau and began to write with every intention of answering his last question truthfully my darling ive never been able to properly express how i feel every time you leave home this time its no different from your trips to the western front or the alps when i spent every hour of the day wondering if you were safe and if i would ever see you again its no different now i sometimes envy other wives who were fortunate enough to see their husbands return in one piece from that misnamed great war and assumed that they would never have to face the same dread again in their lifetime like you i yearn for a successful outcome of this expedition but only for the selfish reason that i have no desire to be put through such an ordeal again you dont begin to understand how much i miss you your company your gentle humor your kindness your guidance in all things but most of all your love and affection especially when we are alone i spend every waking hour wondering if you will return if our children will have to grow up without a father from whom they would have learned tolerance compassion and wisdom and if i will grow old having lost the only man i could ever love your devoted wife ruth ruth returned to her chair and read through the letter before placing it in an envelope she looked out of the window at the open gates at the end of the drive wondering just as she had during the war if she would ever see her husband come striding down that path again once the general had blown his whistle for the last time most of the team remained flat on their backs as they tried to recover from the morning pt session george sat up and glanced around the deck to be sure that none of his colleagues were showing any particular interest in him then stood and sauntered off in the direction of his cabin he took the stairs down to the passenger deck crossed the gangway and looked back for a moment before opening a door marked crew only and going down the crews steps for another three levels until he came to the engine room he banged his fist on the heavy door and a moment later the chief engineer stepped out to join him the man nodded but made no attempt to talk above the noise of the engines he led george along a narrow corridor stopping only when they came to a heavy steel door marked danger no entry he removed a large key from a pocket in his boiler suit unlocked the door and held it open the captain gave me clear orders mr mallory he shouted youve got five minutes and no longer george nodded and disappeared inside guy bullock started clapping the moment he saw george standing on top of the center funnel norton and somervell stopped playing deck tennis to see what the fuss was about odell looked up closed his book and joined in the applause only finch hands in pockets feet apart didnt respond how did he manage that said norton you only have to brush up against one of those funnels and youll get a blister the size of an apple and even if it werent for the heat added somervell equally bemused youd need the suction of a limpet to climb that surface finch continued to stare up at mallory he noticed that for once there was no black smoke belching from the center funnel and glanced across at bullock who couldnt stop laughing when finch looked back up mallory had disappeared as george climbed back down the ladder on the inside of the funnel he couldnt decide if he should tell finch that every thursday morning one of the funnels was taken briefly out of commission so that the ships engineers could carry out a full inspection a few moments later a plume of black smoke erupted from the center funnel and once again the rest of the team burst into spontaneous applause i still cant work it out said norton the only explanation i can come up with said odell is that mallory must have smuggled mr houdini on board the rest of the team laughed while finch remained silent whats more he seems to have reached the top without the aid of oxygen somervell added i wonder how he managed that said guy a grin still fixed firmly on his face no doubt our resident scientist will have a theory no i dont have a theory said finch but i can tell you one thing mallory wont be able to climb up the inside of everest ruth sat by the window holding her letter beginning to wonder if her forthright honesty might prove to be a distraction for george after a few minutes of contemplation she tore the letter into small pieces and dropped them into the crackling flames she returned to her desk and began to write a second letter my darling george spring is upon us at the holt and the daffodils are in full bloom in fact the garden has never looked more beautiful everything is just as you would wish it to be the children are doing well and clare has written a poem for you which i enclose chapter thirtyseven when the ss caledonia docked in bombay the first person to disembark was general bruce he was dressed in the freshly ironed shortsleeve khaki shirt and neatly pressed khaki shorts that had become regulation kit for the british army serving in hot climates he regularly reminded the team that it was lord badenpowell who had followed his example when choosing the uniform of the boy scout movement and not the other way around george followed closely in the generals wake the first thing that struck him as he made his way down the wobbly gangplank was the smellwhat kipling had described as spicy pungent oriental and like no other smell on earth the second thing that hit him almost literally was the intense heat and humidity to a palefaced loon from cheshire it felt like dantes fiery furnace the third thing was the realization that the general had considerable clout in this faroff land two groups of men were waiting at the foot of the gangplank to greet the expeditions leader and not only did they stand far apart from each other but they could not have been in greater contrast the first group of three embodied the british abroad they made no attempt to blend in with the indigenous population dressed as if they were attending a garden party in tunbridge wells and making no allowances for the inhospitable climate for fear it might suggest in some way that they and the natives were equals as the general stepped onto the dockside he was greeted by one of them a tall young man wearing a dark blue suit and a white shirt with a stiff collar and sporting an old harrovian tie my name is russell he announced as he took a step forward good morning russell said the general and they shook hands as if they had known each other for years whereas in reality their only bond was the old school tie welcome back to india general bruce said russell im the governorgenerals private secretary this is captain berkeley the governorgenerals adc an even younger man in full dress uniform who had been standing rigidly to attention since the general had stepped ashore saluted the general returned his salute the third man dressed in a chauffeurs uniform stood by the side of a gleaming rollsroyce and was not introduced the governorgeneral hopes continued russell that you and your party will join him for dinner this evening we shall be delighted to do so said bruce at what time would sir peter like us on parade he will be hosting a reception in the residence at seven oclock said russell followed by dinner at eight and the dress code inquired the general formal with medals sir bruce nodded his approval we have as you requested continued russell secured fourteen rooms at the palace hotel and ive also put a number of vehicles at your disposal while you and your men are in bombay most hospitable said the general for the time being perhaps you could arrange for my men to be transported to the hotel billeted and fed of course general said russell and the governorgeneral asked me to give you this he handed over a bulky brown envelope which the general passed on to george as if he was his private secretary george smiled and tucked the envelope under his arm he couldnt help noticing that the rest of the team including finch were observing the exchange in awed silence mallory said the general i want you to join me while the rest of the men are escorted to the hotel thank you russell he said to the governorgenerals private secretary i look forward to seeing you at the reception this evening russell bowed and took a pace backward as if the general were minor royalty the general then turned his attention to the second group also three in number which was about the only thing they had in common the three locals dressed in long cool white gowns and white slippers had waited patiently while mr russell carried out the formal welcome on behalf of the governorgeneral now their leader stepped forward namaste general sahib he said bowing low the general neither shook hands with the sirdar nor saluted without preliminaries he asked did you get my cable kumar yes general sahib and all your instructions have been carried out to the letter i think i can say with some confidence that you will be well satisfied ill be the judge of that kumar and only after ive inspected the merchandise of course general said the indian once again bowing low perhaps youd be kind enough to follow me kumar and his two compatriots led the general across a road teeming with people rickshaws and hundreds of old raleigh and hercules bicycles as well as the occasional contentedlooking cow chewing its cud in the middle of the highway the general marched through the bustling noisy crowd which parted as if he were moses crossing the red sea george pursued his leader curious to discover what was next while at the same time trying to take in the unfamiliar sounds of the street traders plying their exotic wares heinz baked beans players cigarettes swan vesta matches bottles of tizer and eveready batteries were continually thrust in front of his nose he politely declined each new offer while feeling overwhelmed by the energy and exuberance of the local people but horrified by the poverty he saw all around himthe beggars far outnumbered the traders he now understood why these people considered gandhi to be a prophet while the british continued to treat the mahatma as if he were a criminal he would have so much to tell the lower fifth when he returned the general strode on ignoring the dusty outstretched hands and the repeated cries of pie pie pie the sirdar led him into a square that was so packed it might have been a mass rally at speakers corner with the difference that everyone was talking and no one was listening the square was surrounded by unfinished concrete buildings the curious and those with nothing better to do hung out of upper windows hoping to gain a birdseye view of what was taking place below then george set eyes for the first time on what the general had described as the merchandise on a dusty sunburned patch of earth one hundred mules awaited inspection behind them stood a large group of porters george stood to one side and watched as the general carried out his inspection the crowd following his every move he began by checking the mules legs and teeth and even sat astride several of the beasts to assess their strength two of them collapsed under his weight it took him over an hour to select seventy of the animals that in his opinion passed muster next the general carried out exactly the same exercise with row upon row of the silent porters first he inspected their legs then their teeth and in some cases to georges astonishment he even jumped on their backs once again one or two of them collapsed under his weight despite this before the second hour was up he had added sixtytwo porters to the seventy mules he had already selected although george had done little more than act as an observer he was already sweating from head to toe while the general seemed to take everything including the heat in his stride when the inspection had been completed kumar stepped forward and presented his demanding customer with two cooks and four dhobis to georges relief the general did not jump onto their backs he did however check their teeth and legs having completed his inspection the general turned to kumar and said be sure that every one of the coolies and mules are standing on the dockside at six oclock tomorrow morning if they are all on parade by that time you will be paid fifty rupees kumar bowed and smiled the general turned to george and put a hand out george assumed he required the envelope the general opened it extracted a fiftyrupee note and handed it to the sirdar to confirm that the deal had been struck and instruct them kumar he added pointing at the porters that they will be paid ten rupees a week any of them who are still with us when we reboard the ship in three months time will be given a bonus of twenty rupees most generous general sahib most generous kumar replied bowing even lower were you also able to comply with my other request demanded the general as he passed the envelope back to george yes general sahib said the sirdar with an even broader grin on his face one of the two men standing behind kumar stepped forward stood to attention in front of the general and then removed his slippers george had given up trying to guess what would happen next the general took a tape from a pocket in his shorts and proceeded to measure the young man from the top of his head to the soles of his bare feet i think you will find said kumar with satisfaction that the boy is exactly six feet yes but does he understand what is expected of him he does indeed general sahib in fact he has been preparing for the past month im delighted to hear it said bruce if he turns out to be satisfactory he will be paid twenty rupees a week and on arrival at base camp will be given a bonus of fifty rupees once again the sirdar bowed george was about to ask why the expedition required a youth who was exactly six feet tall when the general pointed to the short stocky man with asiatic features who was standing at the back of the trio and had not uttered a word and who is that the young man stepped forward before kumar had a chance to introduce him and said i am sherpa nyima general i am your personal translator and will be the sherpa leader when you reach the himalaya twenty rupees a week said the general and marched out of the square without another word his business completed it had always amused george that whenever generals marched off they assumed that everyone else would follow it was one of the reasons he concluded that the british had won more battles than they had lost it took george several minutes to catch up with bruce because most of the crowd were still running after him hoping to benefit from his largesse when he finally managed to do so bruce simply said never become friendly with the natives youll regret it in the long run he didnt utter another word until they entered the driveway of the palace hotel twenty minutes later leaving the pursuing horde behind them as the general marched up the path through the manicured gardens george spotted a third welcoming party standing on the top step of the hotel he wondered how long they had been waiting the general came to a sudden halt in front of a beautiful young woman wearing a deep purple and gold sari she was carrying a small bowl of sweetsmelling powdered herbs in her left hand and after dipping the forefinger of her right hand into the powder she gently pressed the tip of her finger to the generals forehead leaving a distinctive red mark of respect she took a pace back and a second young woman also in traditional dress placed a garland of flowers over the generals head he bowed and thanked them the ceremony over a smartly dressed man wearing a black frock coat and pinstripe trousers stepped forward welcome back to the palace hotel general bruce he said i have put your party in the south wing overlooking the ocean and your usual suite has been prepared he stood aside to allow his guest to enter the hotel thank you mr khan said the general walking straight past the checkin desk toward a lift that he assumed was being held open for him george followed him and when they reached the top floor the first thing he saw was norton and somervell standing at the far end of the corridor wearing their dressing gowns he smiled and waved to let them know he would be joining them in a few minutes i suppose general said george that this could be our last chance to have a bath for three months speak for yourself mallory said bruce as mr khan held open the door of the queen victoria suite for him george was already discovering why the rgs had considered this short plump retired soldier to be head and shoulders above the rest chapter thirtyeight id like to post some letters please said george of course sir said the concierge how many seventeen said george he had already posted eighteen letters when the ship had docked for a few hours at durban to take on fuel and fresh food all to the same country the concierge asked casually as if this was an everyday occurrence yes in fact all to the same address this time the concierge did raise an eyebrow my wife explained george i write to her every day and ive only just disembarked so leave it to me said the concierge thank you said george are you coming to the governorgenerals shindig george asked a voice behind him george turned to see guy approaching yes he replied then lets share a taxi said guy as he headed toward the door i intend to eat like a pig tonight said guy as the rickshaw dodged obstacles in the crowded streets i have a feeling this is likely to be the best spread well get before we return to england unless of course the governorgeneral decides to invite us again on our way back that may depend on whether we return as conquering heroes or frostbitten failures said george im not going to risk it anyway said guy especially as bruce tells me that sir peter has the finest cellar in india two soldiers in full dress uniform snapped to attention and saluted as the rickshaw drove through the gates of the governorgenerals residence mallory and bullock jumped out and walked beneath a high wooden arch into a long ornate marble hall where they took their place in the reception line the general was standing by the governorgenerals side introducing him to each member of the team as you seem to be so well informed guy whispered george whos the young lady standing by the governorgenerals side his second wife said bullock his first died a couple of years ago and this one this is guy bullock sir peter said the general hes taken a sabbatical from the foreign office to join us good evening mr bullock and this is george mallory our climbing leader so this is the man whos going to be the first to stand on the summit of everest said the governorgeneral shaking george warmly by the hand he has a rival said guy with a grin ah yes said the governorgeneral mr finch if i remember correctly cant wait to meet the fellow and may i introduce my wife after bowing to the young lady george and guy drifted into a packed room where the only indians in sight were servants offering drinks george selected a sherry wine and then headed for the one person he recognized good evening mr mallory said russell good evening mr russell said george are you enjoying being posted out here he was never at ease when having to make small talk capital enjoying every moment russell replied its just a pity about the natives the natives repeated george hoping russell was joking they dont like us whispered russell in fact they loathe us theres trouble brewing trouble prompted bullock who had walked across to join them yes ever since we put that fellow gandhi in jail for creating unrest suddenly without warning russell stopped in midsentence and stared his mouth hanging open mallory and bullock turned to see what had caused him to be struck dumb is he one of yours asked russell barely able to hide his discomfort im afraid so said george stifling a grin as he turned to see finch chatting to the governorgenerals wife finch was dressed in an opennecked khaki shirt green corduroy trousers and brown suede shoes with no socks you should feel flattered chipped in guy he doesnt usually take that much trouble the private secretary was clearly not amused the mans a bounder he said as they watched finch slip an arm around lady davidsons waist george didnt move as he spotted the general heading toward him almost at a gallop mallory he said his cheeks flushed get that man out of here and be quick about it ill do my best said george but i cant guarantee if you dont get him out and now said the general i will and let me assure you it wont be a pretty sight george handed his empty glass to a passing waiter before crossing the room to join finch and the governorgenerals wife have you met mallory sonia finch asked hes my only real rival yes weve been introduced replied the governorgenerals wife pretending to be unaware of finchs arm draped around her waist im sorry to interrupt you lady davidson said george but i need to have a private word with mr finch as a small problem has arisen without another word he grabbed finch firmly by the elbow and led him quickly out of the room guy slipped in next to lady davidson and started chatting to her about whether she intended to return to london for the season so whats this small problem asked finch once they were out in the hallway you are replied george at this moment i think youll find the general is rounding up volunteers for a firing squad he guided finch out of the door and onto the driveway where are we going asked finch back to the hotel but i havent had dinner yet i think thats the least of your problems you were ordered to get me out of there werent you said finch as george shoved him into a rickshaw something like that admitted george i have a feeling that will be the last time were invited to one of the governorgenerals little soirées speak for yourself mallory if you and i get to stand on top of that mountain youll definitely be dining with the governorgeneral again that doesnt mean you will be said george no i wont ill be upstairs in his ladys chamber george thought he heard a knock on the door but then he could have been dreaming it sounded a little louder the second time come in he said still half asleep george opened one eye to see the general staring down at him still dressed in his uniform do you always sleep on the floor with the windows wide open mallory he asked george opened his other eye it was either this or the veranda he said and i can assure you general he added pushing himself up this is luxury compared to what its going to be like at feet stuck in a tiny tent with only finch for company thats precisely what i wanted to speak to you about said the general i felt you ought to be the first to know that ive decided to put finch on the next boat back home george put on his silk dressing gown and sat down on the only comfortable chair in the room he slowly filled his pipe with tobacco and took his time lighting up finchs behavior this evening was quite inexcusable the general continued i now realize i should never have agreed to him being included in the team george puffed away on his pipe for a few moments before he responded general he said quietly you dont have the authority to send any member of my team back to england without consulting me i am consulting you now mallory said the general his voice rising with every word no you are not youve barged into my room in the middle of the night to inform me that youve decided to send finch back to england on the first available boat thats not my idea of consultation mallory interrupted the general i dont have to remind you that i am in overall charge of this expedition i will be the one who makes the final decision as to what happens to any member of my team then youll be making this one all on your own general because if you put finch on that boat then i and the rest of my team will be joining him im sure the rgs will be fascinated to know why unlike the duke of york you didnt even manage to take us to the top of the hill let alone bring us down again but but spluttered the general surely you agree thats not the way to treat a lady mallory especially the governorgenerals wife no one knows better than i do said george that finch can be tiresome and im sure he wont be teaching etiquette to any debs next season but unless youre willing to take his place general i suggest you go to bed now and just be grateful that finch wont be attending any more cocktail parties for at least another three months hes also unlikely to bump into any more ladies on his way to the himalaya ill have to think about it mallory said the general turning to leave ill let you know my decision in the morning general im not one of your coolies whos desperate for the kings shilling so please let me know now if i am to wake up my men and tell them theyll be returning to england on the first boat or if i can allow them to rest before they set out on the most arduous journey of their lives the generals face became redder on your head be it mallory he said before storming out of the room dear lord said george as he took off his dressing gown and lay back down on the floor please tell me what did i do to deserve finch chapter thirtynine april th my dearest ruth we have begun the mile trek to the tibetan border we boarded the train to siliguri at the base of the himalaya which the timetable promised would be a hour journey but it took almost ive often wondered what happens to old trains when theyre pensioned offwell now i know theyre sent to india where theyre reincarnated so we all piled aboard an old great northern locomotive castle class the warwick castle to be precise the seats in first class are now somewhat shoddy and worn while third class still has wooden slats to sit on and no loo which meant we had to jump off when we stopped at a station and head for the bushes the train also had cattle class where bruce put the mules and the porters both complained there is one big difference between traveling down from birkenhead to london in comfort and going from bombay to siliguri we used to keep the windows closed and turn the heating up on our way down from the north of england but here despite the fact that the rail company has dispensed with the glass windows it feels as if youre traveling in an oven on wheels wheres daddy demanded clare where is he now ruth put down the letter and joined her daughters on the floor so they could study the map her father had drawn for them and follow his progress she ran a finger across the ocean from tilbury to bombay and then along a railway line that finally came to a halt at siliguri she picked up the letter and continued to read it aloud to the children imagine our surprise when we disembarked in siliguri to be greeted by the sight of the darjeeling himalayan railway companys own miniature wonder of the world here the meter gauge ends to be replaced by a unique twofoot gauge which is why it is known affectionately by the locals as the toy train you step into a delightful little carriage which would be ideal for beridge and clare but made me feel like gulliver when he woke in the land of the lilliputians with a noise that is out of all proportion to its size the little steam engine begins its upward journey from the foothills of siliguri at a mere feet above sea level to darjeeling miles away climbing to a height of feet the children will be fascinated to learn that the gradient is so steep that a native has to sit on the front buffer of the engine so he can sprinkle sand on the tracks to make sure the wheels can grip as we climb higher and higher into the mountains i cant tell you how long the journey took because every minute was such sheer delight that i didnt stop admiring the view even for a moment for fear of missing some new wonder in fact our intrepid cameraman captain noel became so infatuated by the whole experience that when we came to a halt at tung to fill up with waterboth the little engine and its passengershe climbed up onto the roof of the carriage from where he filmed the rest of the journey while we mere mortals had to satisfy ourselves with looking out of the windows when we finally pulled into darjeeling station after a hour journey i had only one thought if only this little gem could transport us all the way to base camp how much easier our lives would be but no such luck and within moments of our leaving the train the familiar voice of general bruce could be heard barking out orders as he lined up the mules and porters so we could begin the long journey into the jungle and on to the plains of tibet we have each been allocated our own pony to carry our personal possessions and equipment and with the exception of the general we have to walk at least miles a day in the evening we try to set up camp near a river or lake if its at all possible which gives us the chance to swim and for a few glorious moments rid ourselves of the flies mosquitoes and leeches which seem to prefer a diet of white men to natives the general has brought along his own bath which is strapped to two mules and every evening at around seven half a dozen porters fill it with water thats been heated over a wood fire i have a photograph of our leader sitting in his bath a cigar in one hand and a glass of brandy in the other he clearly sees no reason to change the habits of a lifetime simply because hes spending a few weeks in the indian jungle we all dine together in the evening at a trestle tablethe general sits at the top perched on his shooting stick our menu rarely varies from stew and dumplings but by the time we set up camp at the end of the day were far too hungry to inquire which animal has been added to the pot the general has brought along a dozen cases of the finest châteauneufdupape as well as half a dozen cases of pol roger which are carried by two of the sturdiest mules in the pack the only complaint the general voices is that he cant keep the wine at room temperature however as the weather is becoming a little colder each day it wont be too long before hell be able to chill the champagne in a bath full of ice everyone appears to be holding up wella little fever and sickness are to be expected although i seem to have escapedso farwith just a few mosquito bites and a rather bad rash three of the porters have already run away and two of the mules have died of exhaustiondont tell clare otherwise they all seem to be in pretty good shape weve already signed up our chief sherpa hes called nyima and not only does he speak the kings english but he is clearly a serious climberbarefooted somervell has been a real brick as always not only is he enduring the same hardships we all have to go through but he carries out his duties as our reserve quack without ever grumbling about the extra workload odell is in his element discovering new types of rock by the day no doubt once he returns to cambridge several volumes will be appearing on the bookshelves not to mention the dozens of wellattended lectures hell be delivering norton poor man is six foot four inches tall so he has to have the largest mule and still his feet touch the ground finch always brings up the rear of the convoyhis choice as well as ourswhere he keeps a careful eye on his precious oxygen cylinders which he is still convinced will decide the outcome of the expedition i remain skeptical as we climb higher and higher im monitoring how the chaps handle the conditions and im already beginning to consider the composition of the individual climbing parties finch assumes that hell be the one whos selected for the final assault on everest and frankly no one will be surprised if he is hardly a civil word has passed between him and the general since we left bombay however as each day passes the sonia affair as its referred to by the lads fades into blessed memory one of our party has turned out to be an unexpected revelation ive always known that noel was a firstclass alpinist but i had no idea what an outstanding photographer and filmmaker he is there can never have been an expedition thats been better recorded and as an added bonus noel is one of the few members of the team who speaks the local language one of the daily routines that noel has been filming wouldnt be believed unless hed made a record of it morshead who i dont believe youve met is a cartographer who as a member of the rgs team is responsible for producing detailed maps of the area and one of the things hes most assiduous about is recording distances accurately to assist morshead the general has employed at a cost of twenty rupees a day a young indian who is exactly six feet in height let me try to describe his responsibility although youll be able to see it on film for yourself once we return he lies flat on the ground while another sherpa makes a mark in the earth at the top of his head to record the distance the sixfoot man then stands up placing his toes behind the mark hes barefooted while he repeats the entire exercise again and again hour upon hour that way morshead can measure the exact distance we cover each dayaround mileswhich ive calculated means that the young man is standing up and lying down nearly times a day god knows he earns his twenty rupees my darling its time to stop writing and blow out my candle i share my little tent with guy its wonderful having an old friend on this trip but its not the same as being with you wheres he reached demanded clare looking down at the map ruth folded up the letter before joining clare and beridge on the floor again she studied the map for a moment before pointing to a village called chumbi as georges letters took six or seven weeks to reach the holt she could never be quite sure where he actually was she opened his latest letter today we covered our usual miles and lost another mule so were now down to i wonder what strategic decision the general would make if we were faced with a shortage of mules and he had to choose between ditching his wine or his bath he has the porters on parade standing to attention for roll call at six every morning this morning we were down to so another one has run away the general describes them as deserters while we were on our march yesterday we came across a buddhist monastery high in the hills we stopped so that noel could film it but the general advised us against disturbing the monks at their worship hes a strange combination of wisdom and bombast nyima tells me that once weve trudged up the jelep la we should be setting up camp this evening at around feet under the peak of a mountain from which if i were to climb it i would have a clear view of everest tomorrow is sunday which the general has designated as a day of rest to allow the porters and the mules a chance to recover their strength while some of us catch up with our reading or write home to our loved ones im currently enjoying t s eliots the waste land though i confess i intend to climb that mountain tomorrow if theres the slightest chance of seeing everest for the first time i shall have to rise early as nyima estimates that the summit could be as high as feet i didnt point out to the sherpa leader that ive never climbed to that height before what happens if daddy isnt allowed to cross the border asked clare plonking a thumb on the thin red line that divided india from tibet hell just have to turn round and come back home said her mother good said clare chapter forty george slipped out of camp just before sunrise a knapsack on his back a compass in one hand and an ice axe in the other he felt like a schoolboy off to have a smoke behind the bicycle shed through the early morning mist he could just about make out the unnamed mountain rising high above him he was estimating that it would take at least two hours before he could hope to reach its base when he heard an unfamiliar sound he stopped and looked around but couldnt see anything unusual by the time he reached the lower slopes of the mountain hed been able to consider several different routes to the summit the first thrill for any mountaineer contemplating a climb is deciding which route to take the wrong choice can result in disasteror at the least in having to return another day george didnt have another day he had just decided on what looked like the best route when he thought he heard the unfamiliar sound again he looked back down the valley along which he had approached the mountain half of it was bathed in morning sunlight while the shadow of the mountain made the rest of it appear as if it had not yet woken up but he still didnt spot anything strange george doublechecked his chosen route then began to attack the stony rough terrain at the foot of the mountain for the next hour he made good progress despite having to change direction several times whenever an obstacle blocked his way he could now see the peak ahead of him and estimated that he would reach the top within the hour thats when he made his first mistake he had come up against a rock that not only blocked his path but appeared to be insurmountable without a partner to assist him george knew from bitter experience that much of mountaineering ends in frustration and that he had no choice but to turn back and search for another route he also knew that if he was to get back to camp before sunset there would come a moment when he could no longer risk chasing the sun as it sank beneath the unfamiliar horizon and then he heard the sound again closer this time he swung around and saw nyima approaching george smiled flattered that the sherpa leader had followed him well have to turn back george said and try to find another route that wont be necessary said nyima who simply jumped up onto the rock and began to scale it effortlessly his arms and legs working as one unit as he moved across the uneven surface george watched as the sherpa followed a route hed so clearly taken before and george wondered if hed seen everest before moments later nyima had reached the top of the obstacle and all george could see was a hand beckoning him to follow george tracked the route the sherpa had taken and grabbed a ledge he had not noticed before but that opened up a direct path all the way to the summit this simple maneuver had saved him an hour perhaps two while at the same time nyima had become georges climbing leader it was not long before he had joined the sherpa and as they made their way up the mountain it was clear to george that nyima was familiar with the terrain as he set a pace george could only just keep up with when they reached the summit they sat down and looked toward the north but everything was enveloped in a bank of thick cloud george reluctantly accepted that he would not be introduced to chomolungma today he opened his knapsack took out a bar of kendal mint cake broke it in half and handed a piece to nyima the head sherpa did not take a bite until he had seen george chewing away for some time as they sat staring at the unmoving clouds george concluded that sherpa nyima was the ideal climbing partnerexperienced resourceful brave and silent he checked his watch and realized they would have to leave soon if they were to be back in camp before sunset he rose tapped his watch and pointed down the mountain nyima shook his head just a few more minutes mr mallory as the sherpa had proved right about which route they should take george decided to sit back down and wait for a few more minutes however there comes a moment when every climber has to decide if the reward is worth the risk in georges opinion that moment had passed george rose and without waiting for nyima to join him began to descend the mountain he must have covered about feet when he felt the breeze picking up he turned around to see the clouds drifting slowly away he quickly retraced his steps and rejoined the silent sherpa at the summit when he found that like salome chomolungma had already stripped away four of her seven veils as the breeze grew stronger chomolungma removed yet another veil revealing a small range of mountains in the foreground that reminded george of the french alps and then another he didnt believe that such beauty could possibly be surpassed but then a gust of wind removed the final veil proving him wrong george was lost for words he stared up at the highest mountain in the world everests radiant summit dominated the skyline making the other peaks of the mighty himalaya look like a kindergarten playground for the first time george was able to study his nemesis more closely below her furrowed brow projected a sharp tibetan nose made up of uneven ridges and unapproachable precipices beneath which wide nostrils belched out a wind so fierce that even on level ground you would have been prevented from advancing a single stride but worse far worse this goddess was twofaced on her west face the cheekbone was made up of a pinnacle of rock that stretched high into the heavens far higher than georges imagination had ever dared to soar while the east face displayed a milelong sheet of ice that never thawed even on the longest day of the year her noble head rested on a slim neck nestling in shoulders of granite from her massive torso hung two long supple arms attached to large flat hands that offered a slight hope until you saw her ten thin icy fingers one of the nails of which was where they hoped to set up base camp george turned to see nyima gazing at chomolungma with the same fear respect and admiration that he himself felt george doubted if alone either of them would be capable of climbing onto even the shoulders of this giant let alone scaling her granite ice facebut perhaps together chapter fortyone after their midnight dispute in bombay george was relieved that the general invited him to be a member of the diplomatic mission that would present their credentials at the border post thirteen members of the expedition team thirtyfive porters and fortyeight mules had bedded down for the night on a flat piece of land by a fastflowing river on the indiatibet border george and the rest of the party spent a convivial evening enjoying the generals excellent wine and cigars over dinner at the following morning the general was standing outside georges tent in full dress uniform carrying a black leather attaché case sherpa nyima stood a pace behind him wearing his traditional woolen bakhu and carrying a large black box with the words locks of london printed on the lid george crawled out of his tent a few moments later dressed in the suit hed worn for the governorgenerals reception and his old school tie he accompanied bruce out of the camp toward the border post now i am not expecting any problems mallory said the general but should any misunderstanding arise leave everything to me ive dealt with these natives in the past and have the measure of them george accepted that the general had many great strengths but feared he was about to witness one of his weaknesses when they reached the border post george was taken by surprise the little bamboo hut was well camouflaged by the dense undergrowth and certainly didnt look as if it welcomed strangers a few paces later george spotted a soldier and then another holding ancient rifles pointing in their direction this show of hostility didnt cause the general to slacken his paceif anything he speeded up on balance george felt he would have preferred to die on the top of a mountain rather than at the bottom a few paces further on george could see exactly where the tibetan border lay at the only break in the bamboo barrier that stretched across the narrow path two more soldiers sat in a dugout fortified by sandbags their rifles also aimed directly at the advancing british army still undaunted the general marched straight up the wooden steps of the hut and through the open door as if the border post was under his command george followed cautiously in his wake nyima a pace behind inside the hut the general came to a halt in front of a wooden counter a young corporal seated behind the desk stared at the three strangers in disbelief and although he opened his mouth he didnt speak i wish to speak to your commanding officer barked the general sherpa nyima translated in a soft voice the corporal quickly disappeared into a little room behind him and closed the door it was some time before the door opened again and a short thin man with sunken cheeks and a battlehardened face stepped out and glared at the general as if his private territory had been invaded the general smiled when he noticed that the post commander only held the rank of captain he saluted but the tibetan did not return the compliment instead he looked directly at sherpa nyima and pointing at the general said in his native tongue i am the dzongpen of the district of phari who is this once sherpa nyima had translated his words only adding the final word gentleman the general replied i am general bruce then opened his attaché case and removed some papers which he placed firmly on the desk these are the official permits that authorize my party to enter the district of phari dzong after nyima had translated the generals words the dzongpen gave the documents a cursory glance then shrugged his shoulders as you can see said the general they have been signed by lord curzon the british foreign secretary the general waited for sherpa nyima to complete his translation before the dzongpen came back with a question the dzongpen wishes to know if you are lord curzon of course im not said the general tell this fool that if he doesnt allow us to cross the border immediately i will have no choice but to it was clear that the tibetan commander didnt need the generals words translated as his hand moved swiftly to the gun in his holster the dzongpen says that he will allow lord curzon to cross the border but no one else translated nyima bruce banged a fist on the desk and shouted doesnt the stupid man realize who i am george bowed his head and began to think about the long journey home as he waited for the dzongpens response he could only hope that the generals words would be lost in translation but the dzongpen had removed his pistol from its holster and was pointing the barrel at the generals forehead before sherpa nyima had completed his translation tell the general he can go home said the commander quietly i will give my men orders to shoot on sight if he comes anywhere near this border post again do i make myself clear the general didnt flinch even after nyima had translated the border commanders words although george had given up any chance of being allowed to cross the border he still rather hoped they might get out alive may i speak general he whispered yes of course mallory replied the general george wondered if he should have held his tongue because the commanders gun was now pointing at his forehead he looked the dzongpen straight in the eye i bring gifts of friendship from my country to yours sherpa nyima translated and the dzongpen slowly lowered his gun and put it back in its holster before placing his hands on his hips i will see these gifts george removed the lid of the locks box and took out a black homburg hat which he handed across to the dzongpen the commander placed it on his head looked at himself in a mirror on the wall and smiled for the first time please tell the dzongpen that lord curzon wears a homburg to work every morning said george as do all gentlemen in england when the commander heard these words he leaned over the desk and peered into the box general bruce bent down took out another homburg and passed it to the commander who in turn placed it on the head of the young corporal standing by his side this time the dzongpen burst out laughing then grabbed the box left the hut and began to distribute the remaining ten homburgs among his guards when the commander returned to the hut he began to study the generals documents more carefully he was about to rubber stamp the last page when he looked up smiled at the general and pointed to his halfhunter gold watch the general wanted to explain that he had inherited the watch from his father lord aberdare but he thought better of it and without a word handed it over george was relieved that in his haste that morning he had forgotten to put on the watch ruth had given him for his birthday the dzongpen was now eyeing general bruces thick leather beltthen his brown leather shoesand finally his kneelength woolen socks having stripped the general he turned his attention to george and appropriated his shoes socks and tie george could only wonder when and where the dzongpen would wear an old wykehamist tie at last the dzongpen smiled stamped the last page of the entry permits and handed them back to the general bruce was just about to place the documents in his attaché case when the dzongpen shook his head the general left the case on the desk and stuffed the documents into the pockets of his trousers the barefooted bruce held up his trousers with one hand and saluted with the other this time the dzongpen returned the compliment sherpa nyima was the only person who left the hut fully dressed an hour later the expedition party led by general bruce advanced toward the border and the barrier was raised to allow them to enter the district of phari dzong after checking the time on his halfhunter gold watch the dzongpen smiled at the general raised his homburg and said welcome to tibet lord curzon nyima didnt translate his words chapter fortytwo may th my dearest ruth having crossed the border into tibet we are now approaching the himalayaa range of a thousand mountains that surround and protect their mistress like armed guards do not accept the authority of the local dzongpen and have never heard of lord curzon despite their frosty welcome and cold demeanor we battle on when we arrived and set up base camp some feet above sea level we saw the general at his best within hours the portersdown to had erected the team tent about the size of our drawing room which made it possible for us to sit down for dinner by the time coffee and brandy had been served other tents were in place which meant we could all bed down for the night when i say all i should point out that the porters including nyima are still sleeping outside in the open air they curl up on the rough ground with only stones for their pillows i sometimes wonder whether if im to have any chance of conquering this infernal mountain i ought to join them sherpa nyima is proving invaluable when it comes to organizing the natives and the general has agreed to raise his pay to thirty rupees a week about sixpence once we reach the slopes of everest its going to be fascinating to find out just how good a climber he really is finch is convinced that hell be the equal of any one of us ill let you know this evening the general will officially hand over command to me until the moment we begin to retrace our steps back to england his majesty the king said the general raising his glass the king responded the rest of the team gentlemen you may smoke said the general sitting back down and clipping off the end of his cigar george remained standing as did the rest of the team he raised his glass a second time gentlemen he said chomolungma goddess mother of the earth the general was quickly back on his feet and joined his colleagues as they raised their glasses while the sherpas fell flat on the ground and lay facing the mountain a moment later george tapped his glass and called for order command had changed hands i should like to begin gentlemen he said by thanking general bruce for ensuring that we all arrived in one piece and to quote you sir he added turning to the general burly and fit hear hear chorused the rest of the team a sentiment with which even finch felt able to join in george unfurled a parchment map cleared a space in front of him and placed it on the table gentlemen he began we are currently here he pointed the handle of his coffee spoon at feet our immediate aim is to progress to here he added moving the spoon up the mountain and coming to a halt at feet where i hope to set up camp iii if we are to succeed in conquering chomolungma we must establish three more camps at altitude camp iv should be on the north col around feet while camp v will be at feet and camp vi at feet just feet from the summit it is imperative to discover a route along the crest or skirting the northeast ridge that could lead us to the summit but for now he continued we must remember that we have no idea what lies ahead of us there are no reference books to consult no maps to pore over no old fogies sitting at the bar of the alpine club who can regale us with anecdotes of their past triumphs real or imagined several members of the team smiled and nodded we must therefore chart a course that will allow us to one day be the old fogies who pass on our knowledge to the next generation of climbers he looked up at his team any questions yes said somervell how long do you think it will take to establish camp iii and by that i mean fully stocked and occupied ever the practical one said george with a smile in truth i cant be sure id like to cover feet a day so by tomorrow evening i hope to have set up camp ii at feet and be back here at base camp before sunset the following day we push for feet where we set up camp iii before returning to camp ii for the night it will take at least a couple of weeks to become acclimatized to altitudes none of us has ever experienced before never forget climb high sleep low will you be dividing us up into teams before we set out asked odell no not yet said george well remain as one unit until i know which of you acclimatize best to the conditions however i suspect that in the end it wont be me who decides on the final composition of the teams but the mountain itself couldnt agree more said finch but have you given any further thought to the use of oxygen above feet again i expect the mountain will dictate that decision and not me george waited for a moment before he asked any more questions yes skipper said norton what time do you want us on parade tomorrow morning six oclock replied george and that means all kitted up and ready to move remember tomorrow we must have the courage to think like columbus and be prepared to walk off the map george couldnt make up his mind if it was the responsibility of leadership or the sheer thrill of knowing that from this moment on every pace he took would be the highest hed ever climbed that meant he emerged from his tent the next morning some time before the rest of the team a few minutes before six oclock on a clear morning with little wind and the sun inching its own path above the highest peak george was delighted to find that all eight of his climbers were waiting patiently outside their tents they were dressed in a variety of garments woolen waistcoatsprobably knitted by their wives or girlfriendsjaeger trousers windproofs silk shirts cotton smocks climbing boots burberry scarves and canadian moccasins making one or two of them look as if they were about to embark on a skiing holiday in davos standing behind the climbers were the local sherpas nyima had recruited they each carried as much as eighty pounds of equipment strapped to their backs tents blankets spades pots and pans primus stoves and food as well as a dozen oxygen cylinders at six oclock precisely george pointed upward and his men set off on the first stage of a journey of which none of them could predict the outcome he looked back at his team and smiled at the thought of the general sitting in his warm bath at base camp having to read through endless telegrams from hinks demanding to know how much progress had been made and whether finch was behaving himself george set a steady pace for the first hour tramping over the barren stony ground that stretched along the side of the valley above base camp regularly passing the sacred blue sheep of the rongbuk valley which however hungry the local tribesmen became could not be slaughtered he was well aware that the real challenges wouldnt arise until theyd skirted the north ridge at around feet where not only would the air be thinner and the temperature fall to levels few of them had ever experienced but far worse they would have no way of knowing which route they should take if they hoped to progress as they tramped on george became awestruck by colors he had never seen beforea faint blue light that changed to a rich yellow and seemed bent on parching their pale english skins in the distance he could see the kangshung face its vast icy fangs pitted with crevasses and dark unfathomable ridges perpetually threatening them with an unwelcome avalanche once theyd established camps ii and iii george could only wonder just how many days they would have to spend searching for a safe route on the north col only to find that at the end of every illusory path there would be signposts announcing no entry dead end george was beginning to wonder if it would even prove possible for a human to reach the summit those members of the rgs who had predicted that chomolungma would be just like mont blanc but a little higher were already looking foolish at the end of the second hour george called the caravan to a halt so that everyone could enjoy a wellearned rest as he walked among the team he noticed that morshead and hingston were breathing heavily nyima had to report that three of the sherpas had dumped their loads in the snow and headed back down the mountain to return to their villages george wondered how many sherpas would be standing on the dockside in bombay waiting to claim their twentyrupee bonus from general bruce youll be able to count them on one hand bruce had warned him though even the general couldnt have predicted that one of his colleagues wouldnt even be able to do that thirty minutes later the group continued on their way and didnt stop to rest again until the sun had reached its zenith during the lunch break they chewed on mint cake ginger biscuits and dried apricots and drank reconstituted powdered milk before setting off once again after another hours climbing they had to cross a stream surrounded by tufts of green grass on its bank stood a willow tree teeming with giant butterflies that rose into the air as they approached an oasis the memory of which soon became a mirage as they climbed higher and higher the time had come to look for a suitable place to pitch camp ii he finally chose a piece of flat stony ground in the middle of the east rongbuk glacier among the giant pinnacles of ice that had the advantage of being sheltered from the wind he checked his altimeterjust above feet under nyimas watchful eye the sherpas deposited their loads in the snow and leveled off the rocky debris before they could set about erecting the first tent after unloading equipment and boxes of provisions destined for camp iii and meant to last them at least a month they finally raised the team tent george told his men over dinner back at base campgoat stew and dumplings once again no need for a menu because water biscuits and cheese were certain to followthat he thought the first day could not have gone much better however he still had no idea how long it would take to identify a route beyond the rongbuk glacier and they must be prepared to expect a number of false dawns before george blew out his candle that night he read a few pages of the iliad having just finished another long letter to ruth she would read it two months later some time after the tragedy had taken place georges letters often turned up at the holt several weeks after the news they carried had been reported in the times ruth knew she would eventually receive a letter that would give georges side of the story of what had taken place on that fateful june morning but until then she could only follow the drama in installments like reading a dickens novel may th my dearest ruth im sitting in my little tent writing to you by candlelight the first days climb went well and we found an ideal site on which to set up a temporary home however its so cold that when i go to bed i have to wear those mittens you knitted for me last christmas as well as a pair of your fathers woolen long johns the mountain has already left me in no doubt that we were not properly prepared for such a demanding venture frankly many of the team are too old and only a few are fit enough to continue like me they must wish theyd been given the chance to attempt this in when we were all so much younger damn the germans my darling i miss you so much that ruth stopped reading and knelt down beside clare and beridge to study the map that had taken up permanent residence on the drawingroom floor when she drew the figure of a man in goggles leaning on an ice axe at feet clare started clapping chapter fortythree june th my dearest ruth we have now spent just over a month searching for a route which will take us beyond the east rongbuk glacier and i was beginning to become downcast after sherpa nyima reminded me that the monsoon season will soon be upon us and well then have no choice but to return to base camp and begin the long journey back to england however the breakthrough came today when morshead located a route beyond the rongbuk glacier that curves around changtse and onto the other side of the north col so tomorrow norton somervell and morshead will return and if they can find a large enough platform and assuming the windgale force up there morshead warns meallows them theyll try to pitch a tent and discover if its possible to spend a night under canvas on top of the north col some feet below the summit if it is norton and somervell will make the first attempt on the summit the following day i know feet doesnt sound muchindeed i can hear hinks telling the committee that its not much higher than ben nevis but ben nevis doesnt consist of pinnacles of insurmountable black ice or temperatures that fall to minus forty degrees and a wind that insists that for every four strides you take you will only advance a single step on top of that we are only breathing onethird of the oxygen you are enjoying in surrey and as coming back down will undoubtedly be even more hazardous we cant take unnecessary risks just so hinks can inform his committee that one of us has climbed heights no man has ever reached before several of the team are suffering from altitude sickness snow blindness and worst of all frostbite morshead has lost two fingers and a toe it would be worth two fingers and a toe if hed reached the summit but for the north col if norton and somervell fail to reach the summit the day after tomorrow finch odell and i will try the following day if they do succeed then well be on our way home long before you open this letter in fact i might even arrive ahead of itlets hope so i have a feeling that it may be finch and i who end up sleeping in that tiny tent some feet above sea level although theres one other member of the team who has matched us stride for stride my darling i write this letter with your photograph by my side and once again ruth joined her daughters on the drawingroom carpet only to find that clare already had her thumb firmly planted on the north col they should have been back over an hour ago odell didnt comment although he knew george was right they stood outside the team tent and stared up at the mountain willing norton somervell and morshead to appear if norton and somervell had reached the summit georges only regretalthough he would never have admitted it to anyone other than ruthwould be not putting himself in the first team george checked his watch again and calculated that they could wait no longer he turned to the rest of his team all of whom were peering anxiously up the mountain right its time to put together a search party who wants to join me several hands shot up a few minutes later george finch odell and sherpa nyima were fully kitted out and ready to go george set off up the mountain without another word a biting cold wind was whistling down the pass and tore into their skin covering them in a thin wafer of snow that immediately froze onto their parched cheeks george had never faced a more determined or bitter enemy and he knew that no one could hope to survive a night in these conditions they must find them madness this is nothing but madness he shouted into the howling gale but boreas didnt heed him and kept on blowing after more than two hours of the worst conditions george had ever experienced he could hardly place one foot in front of the other he was about to give the order to return to the camp when he heard finch cry out i can see three little lambs whove lost their way baa baa baa ahead of them almost invisible against the rocky background george could just make out three lost climbers shuffling slowly down the mountain the rescue party moved as quickly as they could toward them desperate as they all were to find out if norton and somervell had reached the summit they looked so exhausted that no one attempted to ask them norton was holding a hand over his right ear and george took the poor fellow by the elbow and guided him slowly back down the mountain he glanced over his shoulder to see somervell a few feet behind his face gave no clue as to the success or failure of their mission he finally looked at morshead whose face remained expressionless as he staggered on it was another hour before the camp came into sight in the murky twilight george guided the three climbers into the team tent where mugs of lukewarm tea awaited them the moment norton stepped into the tent he collapsed on his knees guy bullock rushed to his side and began to examine his frostbitten ear which was black and blistered while morshead and somervell knelt over the flame of the primus stove trying to thaw out the rest of the team stood around in silence waiting for one of them to break the news it was somervell who spoke first but not until hed drunk several gulps of tea laced with brandy we couldnt have made a better start this morning having put up the tent at camp v he began but after about a thousand feet we walked straight into a snowstorm he added between breaths my throat became so bunged up i could hardly breathe he paused again norton thumped me on the back until i was violently sick which temporarily solved the problem but by then i didnt have the strength to take another step norton waited for me to recover before we struck out across the north face norton picked up the story while somervell took another gulp of tea it was hopeless we made a little more progress but the snowstorm didnt ease up so we had no choice but to turn back what height did you reach asked george norton passed the altimeter to his climbing leader twentysix thousand eight hundred and fifty feet gasped george thats the highest any man has ever climbed the rest of the team burst into spontaneous applause if only youd taken oxygen said finch you might have reached the summit no one else offered an opinion this is going to hurt im afraid old fellow said bullock picking up a pair of scissors and warming them over the primus he bent down and carefully began trimming off parts of nortons right ear the following morning george rose at am he stuck his head out of his tent to see a clear sky without the slightest suggestion of wind finch and odell were sitting crosslegged on the ground devouring a hearty breakfast good morning gentlemen said george he was so keen to be on the move that he ate breakfast standing up and was ready to set off ten minutes later bullock morshead and somervell crawled out of their tents to wish them godspeed norton remained flat on his back george took nortons advice on which route they should take and led finch and odell slowly toward the north ridge despite the clear windless conditions every pace seemed more demanding than the last because they had to take three breaths for each stride they advanced finch had insisted on strapping two cylinders of oxygen to his back would he prove to be right and end up the only one who could keep going hour after hour they trudged on up the mountain in silence it was not until the late afternoon that they felt the first breath of icy wind that met them like an unwelcome guest within minutes the gentle breeze had turned into a gale if georges altimeter hadnt confirmed that they were only a hundred yards from camp v at feet he would have turned back one hundred yards became an hour as the wind and snow lashed relentlessly at their bodies tearing into their garments as if searching mercilessly for any exposed skin while trying to blow them back down the mountain whence theyd come when they finally reached the tent george could only pray that the bad weather would have cleared by the morning otherwise they would have to return as they couldnt hope to survive such conditions for two nights in a row in fact george feared that if they fell asleep all three of them might freeze to death the three men attempted to settle down for the night george noticed that their condensed breath froze and turned into icicles that hung from the roof of the tent like chandeliers in a ballroom finch spent every moment checking and rechecking the dials on his precious oxygen cylinders while george attempted to write to ruth june th my dearest ruth yesterday three brave men set out to try to reach the summit of everest and one of them norton climbed to a height of ft before sheer exhaustion got the better of them they finally had to turn back and norton lost parts of his right ear to frostbite he sleeps tonight in the knowledge that he has climbed higher than any man on earth tomorrow three more of us will attempt to follow in their footsteps and perhaps one of us might even after what weve been through today mallory surely youll reconsider using oxygen tomorrow no i wont replied george putting his pen down im determined to give it a go without any artificial aids but your handmade boots are an artificial aid said finch the mittens your wife knitted for you are an aid even the sugar in your tea is an aid in fact the only thing that isnt an aid is our partner said finch glaring at the sleeping odell and who would you have chosen in his place norton or somervell neither replied finch although theyre both damned good climbers but you made it clear right from the start that the final push should only be attempted by someone best acclimatized to the conditions and we both know who that is nyima said george quietly theres another reason why you should have invited nyima to join us and i would certainly have done so if id been climbing leader and what might that be the pleasure of seeing hinkss face when he had to report to the everest committee that the first two men to place a foot on the summit of everest were an australian and a sherpa that was never going to happen said george why not demanded finch because hinks will be reporting to the committee that an englishman was the first to reach the summit george gave finch a brief smile but i cant see any reason why an australian and a sherpa shouldnt manage it at some time in the future he picked up his pen now go back to sleep finch ive got a letter to finish once again george began to move the nib across the paper but no words appeared the ink had frozen at five oclock the following morning the three men clambered out of their sleeping bags george was the first to emerge from the tent to be greeted by a cloudless blue sky the color of which j m w turner would have marveled at although the great artist would have had to climb to feet before he could hope to paint the scene there was only the slightest suggestion of a breeze and george filled his lungs with the cold morning air as he looked up at the peak a mere feet above him so near he said as finch crawled out of the tent with thirtytwo pounds of oxygen cylinders strapped to his back he also looked up at the summit and then beat his chest shh said george we dont want to wake her let her slumber and then we can take her by surprise thats hardly the way to treat a lady replied finch with a grin george began pacing up and down on the spot unable to hide his frustration at having to wait for odell to appear sorry to keep you waiting chaps odell said sheepishly when he eventually crawled out of the tent i couldnt find my other glove neither of his companions showed any sympathy they roped up george taking the lead with finch behind him and odell bringing up the rear good luck gentlemen said george the time has come for us to court a lady lets hope she doesnt drop her handkerchief right on top of us said finch turning the valve of one of his oxygen cylinders and adjusting his mouthpiece george had taken only a few steps before he knew that this was going to be like no other climb hed ever experienced whenever hed approached the summit of a mountain in the past there were always places where it was possible to stop and rest but here there was no chance of respite the slightest movement was as exhausting as if he was trying to run a hundredyard dash although he progressed at a tortoises pace he tried not to think about finch only a few strides behind contentedly taking in his oxygen would he prove them all wrong george battled on but with each step his breathing became more and more labored he had practiced a special deepbreathing technique every day for the past seven monthsfour seconds in through the nose fill up your chest followed by four seconds out through the mouth but this was the first opportunity hed had to try the technique out above feet he glanced back to see that finch despite carrying an extra thirtytwo pounds on his back still appeared relaxed but if they both reached the top there would be no doubt which one of them would be considered the victor george struggled on inch by inch foot by foot and didnt stop until he came across nortons burberry scarf which had been left as a marker to proclaim the newnow oldworldrecord altitude for any climber he looked back to see finch still climbing strongly but odell was clearly struggling and had already fallen several yards behind would finch prove to be right should george have chosen the best climber available to accompany them george checked his watch although their progress had been slower than he had anticipated he still believed that if they could reach the summit by midday they would have enough time to return to the north col before sunset he counted slowly to sixtysomething hed done on every climb since he was a schoolboybefore checking the altimeter to see how far theyd progressed he didnt need an altimeter to know the distance was becoming less and less by the minute but he still remained confident that they could make it to the top when they reached feet at that was when he heard a cry that sounded like a wounded animal he knew it wasnt finch george looked back to see odell was on his knees his body racked with coughs his ice axe buried beside him in the snow he clearly wasnt going to advance another inch reluctantly george slithered back down to join him losing twenty hardearned feet in the process im so sorry mallory gasped odell i cant go any further i should have let you and finch set off without me dont give it a second thought old chum george said between breaths he placed an arm around odells shoulders i can always have another crack at it tomorrow you couldnt have done more finch didnt waste any time with words of sympathy he removed his mouthpiece and said if youre going to stick around looking after odell can i at least carry on george wanted to say no but knew he couldnt he checked his watchand nodded good luck he said but you must turn back by midday at the latest that should be quite long enough said finch before replacing his mouthpiece and releasing himself from the teams rope as he eased his way past mallory and odell neither could see the grin on his face george could only watch as his rival progressed slowly on up the mountain inching his way toward the summit however long before the hour was up finch could no longer place one foot in front of the other he stopped to release the valve on the second gas cylinder but he could still only manage a few more feet he cursed as he thought how close he was to immortality he checked his altimeter feet a mere feet from shaking hands with god finch stared up at the glistening peak took out his mouthpiece and shouted it was mallory you were expecting wasnt it but it will be me who comes back tomorrow chapter fortyfour june th my dearest ruth we so nearly reached the summit but within hours of returning to the north col the foul weather set in again with a vengeance i cant make up my mind if the gods are angry because we failed to reach the top or that we came too close so they decided to slam the door in our face the following day the conditions were so dreadful that we only just got back to camp ii and weve had to sit around for the past week waiting for a break in the weather im still determined to have one final crack at the summit norton has had to return to base camp and i suspect the general may decide to send him back to england god knows hes played his part finch has been struck down with dysentery and also returned to base camp but is still well enough to remind anyone who cares to listen that he is the man who climbed higher than anyone else on earth feetmyself included morshead has had to join him as his frostbite has become unbearable odell has fully recovered from our first attempt on the summit when he suffered badly and tells me that he wants to be given another chance but if we do make another attempt im not going to risk climbing with him again so with finch norton and morshead no longer available to join me for the final climb only somervell among the recognized climbers is still on his feet and he has every right to be given a second chance if the weather breaks even for a couple of days im determined to give it one more go before the monsoon season is upon us i dont care for the idea of returning to britain in second place not while im convinced that if odell hadnt held me up i could have gone far higher than especially with finch snapping at my heelspossibly even to the top now that hes laid low i may even experiment with his foul oxygen cylinders but i wont tell him until ive returned triumphant however the real reason im so determined to put an end to this lifelong obsession is that i have no interest in coming back to this desolate place and every interest in spending the rest of my life with you and the girlsi even miss the lower fifth i hope that long before you open this letter you will have read in the times that your husband has stood on top of the earth and is on his way back home i cant wait to hold you in my arms your loving husband george george was sealing the envelope when nyima appeared by his side with two mugs of bovril you will be pleased to learn mr mallory he said that we are about to have three clear days in a row but no more so this will be your last chance because the monsoon season will follow close behind how can you be so sure asked george warming his fingers on the mug before taking a sip im like a cow in your country nyima replied that knows when to shelter under a tree because its about to rain george laughed you have a considerable knowledge of my country more books have been written about england than any country on earth nyima hesitated for a moment before saying perhaps if i had been born an englishman mr mallory you might have considered including me in your climbing party please wake me at six said george folding his letter if youre right about tomorrows weather id like to try to reach the north col camp by sunset so we can have one final crack at the summit the following day would you like me to take your letter down to base camp so it can be posted immediately no thank you said george someone else can do that i have a more important role than postman in mind for you when nyima woke him the following morning georges spirits were high ascension day a day for making history he ate a hearty breakfast aware that he would only be able to nibble kendal mint cake for the next couple of days when he stepped out of his tent he was delighted to see somervell and odell already waiting for him along with nine sherpas including nyima who all looked equally determined to be on their way good morning gentlemen said george i think the time has come to leave our calling card on top of the earth without another word he set off up the mountain the weather was perfect for climbing a bright clear day not a breath of wind just a carpet of overnight snow that reminded him of the swiss alps if nyimas prediction turned out to be correct georges only problem would be selecting who to team up with for the final assault but hed already made up his mind to follow finchs advice and invite the most competent climber to join him tomorrow george made better progress in the first hour than he had thought possible and when he turned to see how his team was faring he was delighted to find that no one was lagging behind he decided not to stop while they were progressing so well a decision that was to save his life no one flagged during the second hour at the end of which george called for a break he was pleased to see that even the sherpas despite each having eighty pounds of supplies on their backs were still smiling when they set off again their pace dropped a little as the slope steepened the snow was deep often above his knees but georges spirits remained high he was pleased that somervell and odell were keeping up with the pace no doubt both assuming that they would be joining him tomorrow for the final climb hed already decided that this time only one of them would a little further down the mountain the sherpas were managing a slow shuffle up the slope with nyima bringing up the rear a contented smile remained on georges face as he now believed he could defeat both finch and hinks they were within feet of the north col when george heard what sounded like a car backfiring somewhere above him he instantly recalled when hed last heard that unmistakable unforgiving sound please god not again he shouted as a wave of rocks snow and rubble came crashing down from a cliffface some feet above him within seconds he somervell and odell were completely buried george frantically fought his way to the surface in time to see the avalanche continuing its ruthless course down the mountain gathering momentum as it engulfed everything its path he could only watch helplessly still buried up to his shoulders in snow as first his colleagues and then the sherpas disappeared below the surface one by one the last to be buried was nyima an image that would remain with george for the rest of his life an cerie silence fell before george cried out he prayed that he wasnt the only member of the party still alive odell answered his call and moments later somervell surfaced the three of them dug themselves out of the snow and hurried down the mountain hoping against hope that they could save the sherpas who had served them so faithfully george spotted a glove on the surface and tried to run toward it but with each step he sank deeper into the thick snow when he finally reached the glove he began frantically shoveling at the snow around it with his bare hands he was beginning to despair when a blue gloveless hand appeared followed by an arm a neck and finally a head gasping for breath behind him he heard a cry of relief as odell rescued another sherpa who had not expected to see the light of day again george waded on down the mountain through the thick powdery snow searching for a rucksack a boot an ice axe anything that might lead him to nyima for what seemed like hours he dug desperately at even the slightest hint of life he found nothing at last he collapsed exhausted forced to accept that he could do no more when the sun set an hour later only two of the nine sherpas had been rescued the other seven including nyima remained buried in undug graves george knelt in the snow and wept chomolungma had laughed at the impertinence of these mortals it would be days before the loss of those seven sherpas was not constantly on georges mind even when he slept no matter how hard his colleagues tried to console him they were unable to convince george that his ambition had not been the cause of the sherpas deaths general bruce had ordered that a memorial cairn be erected on a moraine close to a tibetan monastery as the team stood around it heads bowed somervell said quietly it would have been better if one of us were buried alongside them bruce led a broken band of men back to bombay they had been on board the ship sailing for england for several days before anyone smiled and weeks passed before anyone laughed george could only wonder what lay ahead of them when they docked at liverpool every member of the team had vowed that he would not return to everest for to quote their climbing leader all the gold in arabia book six back to earth chapter fortyfive monday september th george leaned over the railing of the ss caledonia and along with the rest of the team stared down at the dockside in disbelief none of them could believe what they were witnessing as far as the eye could see the dockside was crowded with people clapping cheering and waving union jacks who are they cheering for asked george wondering if perhaps some american film star was on board i think youll find george that theyre welcoming you home said somervell they must be suffering from the delusion that you reached the summit george continued to stare down at the clamoring crowd but there was only one person he was looking for it wasnt until they had tied up to the dock that he finally caught a fleeting glimpse of her a lone figure who kept appearing and disappearing among the vast mêlée of raised hats waving hands and union jacks george would have been the first down the gangplank if finch hadnt beaten him to it the moment he placed a foot on the dockside he was engulfed by a mass of outthrust arms which brought back vivid memories of bombayexcept that this time they were trying to slap him on the back rather than begging or proffering secondhand goods do you still hope to be the first man to conquer everest mr mallory shouted a journalist with his notepad open his pencil poised george made no attempt to reply but fought his way through the crowd toward the spot where hed last seen her ill certainly be going back shouted finch as the press surrounded him after all i only have just over feet left to climb the man with the poised pencil wrote down his every word do you think youll make it to the top next time mr mallory a pursuing journalist persisted there isnt going to be a next time mumbled george under his breath and then he saw her just a few yards in front of him ruth ruth he called but she clearly couldnt hear him above the clamor of the crowd at last their eyes met and he saw that smile she reserved only for those she truly cared for he stretched out a hand and several strangers tried to shake it he finally lunged forward and took her in his arms how are we ever going to escape from this lot he shouted in her ear the cars just over there she said clinging to his hand and pulling him away from the crowd but his newfound friends were unwilling to let him escape quite that easily have you accepted the position as climbing leader for next years trip shouted another journalist next years trip asked george taken by surprise but by then ruth had reached the car opened the door and pushed him into the passenger seat george couldnt hide his astonishment when she climbed behind the wheel when he asked a girl has to find something to occupy her time when her husband is off visiting another woman ruth said with a smile he took her in his arms again and kissed her gently on the lips ive spoken to you before about kissing strange women in public george she said not letting go of him i remember george replied kissing her again lets get moving said ruth reluctantly before this becomes the closing scene of a lillian gish picture she switched on the ignition and cranked the gear lever into first then tried to inch her way through the crowd but it was another twenty minutes before she was able to change into second gear and leave the baying pack behind her and even then one last admirer banged the bonnet with his hand and shouted well done sir what was all that about asked george looking out of the rear window as some of the mob continued to pursue them you had no way of knowing but the press has been covering your progress since the day you left and over the past six months theyve turned you into something of a national figure but i failed said george didnt anyone take that into account they dont seem to care the fact that you remained behind with odell after hed collapsed and let finch go on is what caught the publics imagination but its finch whose names in the record bookshe climbed at least three hundred feet higher than i managed but only with the aid of oxygen said ruth in any case the press thinks you would have climbed far higher than finch if youd had the opportunitypossibly even made it to the top no i wouldnt have been able to climb much further than finch that day said george shaking his head and it was because i wanted to prove that i was better than him that seven good men lost their lives one of them just might have stood by my side on the summit but surely all the climbing team survived said ruth he wasnt part of the official party said george but id already decided that he and somervell would accompany me on the final assault a sherpa said ruth unable to mask her surprise yes sherpa nyima i never did find out his family name george remained silent for some time before he added but i know that i was responsible for his death no one blames you for what happened said ruth taking his hand you obviously wouldnt have set out that morning if you had thought even for a moment there was the slightest chance of an avalanche but thats the point said george i didnt think i allowed my personal ambition to cloud my judgment your latest letter only turned up this morning said ruth wanting to change the subject and where was i george asked in a small tent feet above sea level explaining to finch why you wouldnt consider using oxygen if id taken his advice said george i might have reached the top theres nothing to stop you trying again said ruth never well i know someone wholl be delighted to hear that she said trying not to reveal her own feelings you my darling no mr fletcher he called this morning and asked if you could drop in and have a word with him at ten oclock tomorrow yes of course i will said george i cant wait to get back to work i know you wont believe it but i even missed the lower fifth and more important i need to start earning a salary again heaven knows we cant go on living off your fathers largesse forever ive never heard him complain said ruth in fact hes very proud of what youve achieved he never stops telling all his friends at the golf club that youre his soninlaw thats not the point my darling i must get back behind my desk in time for the first day of term no chance of that said ruth but why not because the first day of term was last monday replied ruth smiling which is no doubt why the headmasters so keen to see you now tell me about our son said george when they finally drove through the gates of the holt some six hours later george said slow down my darling ive been thinking about this moment for the past two months they were halfway down the drive when george saw his daughters waving from the steps he couldnt believe how much theyd grown clare was cradling a small bundle in her arms is that who i think it is said george turning to smile at ruth yes at last youre going to meet your son and heir master john mallory only a complete fool would ever leave you for a day let alone six months said george as the car came to a halt in front of the house which reminds me said ruth someone else phoned and asked you to call him urgently who asked george mr hinks chapter fortysix ruth helped george on with his gown before handing him his mortar board and umbrella it was as if hed never been away after hed kissed her and said goodbye to the children he marched out of the front door and began to stride down the path toward the main road beridge asked is daddy going away again george checked his watch interested to see how long it would now take him to reach the school gates ruth had made certain that he left well in time for his appointment with the headmaster the times had been particularly generous that morning giving extensive coverage to the triumphant homecoming of the everest team it didnt seem to concern their correspondent that no one had reached the summit although he reported finch as saying that he had every intention of going back next year to do just that toward the end of the article there was a guarded quote from mr hinks hinting that george would be the everest committees first choice as climbing leader for the second expedition which was no doubt what hinks wanted to speak to him about so urgently but george intended to tell hinks exactly what he would be telling the headmaster in a few minutes time his climbing days were over he was looking forward to a life of domesticity while at the same time continuing to teach the lower fifth about the exploits of elizabeth raleigh essex and a smile crossed georges face when he thought about the dilemma hinks would face when it came to selecting who would take his place as climbing leader the obvious choice was finchhe was unquestionably the most skilled and experienced climber and was the man who had reached the highest point on the last expedition but george was in no doubt that hinks would come up with some utterly compelling reason to resist any such suggestion and that the committee would end up by appointing either norton or somervell as climbing leader even hinks however wouldnt be able to stop finch reaching the summit well ahead of both of them particularly if he was assisted by his faithful oxygen cylinders when the school chapel came into view george checked his watch again he might be thirtysix years old but hed lost none of his speed as he marched through the school gates he might not have set a new record but he was damned close george strolled across the main quad in the direction of the headmasters study smiling at a couple of boys he didnt recognize it was clear from their response that they had no idea who he was which brought back memories of his first days at charterhouse and of how nervous he had felt whenever he came face to face with a pupil let alone the headmaster mr fletcher was a stickler for punctuality and would no doubt be pleased and possibly even surprised that george was five minutes early george straightened his gown and took off his mortar board before knocking on the door of the outer office come in said a voice george entered the room to find fletchers secretary miss sharpe seated at her desk nothing changes he thought welcome back mr mallory she said may i say she added how much weve all been looking forward to seeing you again following your triumph on everest on everest thought george but not on top of it ill let the headmaster know youre here thank you miss sharpe said george as she went into the adjoining room a moment later the door opened the headmaster will see you now she said thank you george repeated and marched into mr fletchers study miss sharpe closed the door behind him good morning mallory said the headmaster as he rose from behind his desk good of you to be so punctual not at all headmaster said george can i say how nice it is to be back he added as he sat down allow me to begin said the headmaster by congratulating you on your achievements during the past six months even allowing for the presss tendency to exaggerate we all feel that given a little more luck you would undoubtedly have made it to the top thank you headmaster and im sure i speak for everyone at the school when i say that im in no doubt that youll fulfill your ambition next time there wont be a next time george replied i can assure you that my climbing days are over however as im sure youll appreciate mallory continued the headmaster as if he hadnt heard him running a school like charterhouse necessitates being able to rely on all members of staff at all times yes of course headmaster but your decision to join the armed forces despite the fact that you were exempt although commendable in itself severely disrupted the school timetable as i made clear at the time you did indeed headmaster but and then your decision rightly taken in my view to accept the invitation from the everest committee caused even more disruption to the running of the school especially as you had recently been appointed senior history master i do apologize headmaster but as you know i had to appoint mr atkins to take over from you in your absence and im bound to say that he has carried out his duties with commendable diligence and authority and has shown unswerving commitment to the school im glad to hear that headmaster however im also bound to say mallory that when you failed to report for the first day of term no doubt through no fault of your own i was left with little choice but to offer atkins a permanent appointment as a full member of staff which ipso facto means regrettably that there is no position for you at charterhouse at the present time but spluttered george trying not to sound desperate i have no doubt that many of our leading schools will jump at the opportunity of adding mallory of everest to their numbers indeed were i to lose a member of the history staff you would be among the first candidates i would consider interviewing george no longer bothered to interrupt he felt as if everests relentless east wind was hitting him in the face again do let me assure you mallory that you leave charterhouse with the respect and affection of both the staff and the pupils it goes without saying that i will be delighted to supply you with a reference confirming that you were a valued member of staff george remained silent im sorry it had to end this way mallory but allow me to add on behalf of myself the governing body and all of us at charterhouse that we wish you good fortune in whatever it is you decide to do in the future should that turn out to be one more stab at everest our thoughts and prayers will be with you mr fletcher rose from behind his desk george stood up dutifully shook hands doffed his mortar board and left the study without another word ruth was reading about her husband in the times when the phone rang only her father ever called at that time of the day hello she said cheerfully as she picked up the phone is that you daddy no it isnt mrs mallory its hinks of the rgs good morning mr hinks she said her tone of voice immediately changing im afraid my husband isnt here at the moment and im not expecting him back until this evening im pleased to hear that mrs mallory because i was hoping to have a private word with you ruth listened carefully to what mr hinks had to say and assured him that she would think it over and let him know her decision she had just returned to reading the paper when she heard the front door open she feigned surprise when george marched into the drawing room and slumped down on the sofa opposite her that bad she ventured it couldnt have been much worse he said the damned man sacked me it seems im so unreliable that hes offered my job to atkins who he assured me is diligent conscientious and more important reliable can you believe it yes i can said ruth in fact i cant pretend that it comes as a great surprise she added folding the paper and placing it on a side table what makes you say that my darling asked george looking at her more closely it worried me that the headmaster asked to see you at ten oclock why was that important because that mans whole life is dominated by a timetable if all had been well my darling he would have invited both of us for a drink at six in the evening or he would have arranged your morning meeting for eight oclock so that you could accompany him in triumph when he presided over assembly so why did he ask to see me at ten because at that time all the boys and staff would be safely in their classrooms and hed be able to get you on and off the premises without anyone having the chance to speak to you he must have planned the whole exercise down to the minute brilliant said george youd have made a firstclass detective do you have any clues about whats going to happen to me next no admitted ruth but while you were out i had a call from mr hinks i hope you made it clear to him that im not available to play any part in next years expedition that wasnt why he called said ruth it seems that the american geographical society wants you to do a lecture tour of the east coastwashington new york boston not a hope said george ive only just got home why would i want to troop off again possibly because theyre willing to pay you a thousand pounds for half a dozen lectures on your experiences of climbing everest a thousand pounds said george but thats more than id earn at charterhouse in three years well to be accurate said ruth the ags think the lectures could bring in as much as two thousand pounds and the rgs is willing to split the profits with you fiftyfifty thats unusually generous of hinks said george i think i can also explain that said ruth it seems that if you turn down the offer theres only one other person the americans would consider inviting in your place and hinks would never agree to that said george so what did you tell him i said id discuss the idea with you and then let him know your decision but why did he call you in the first place why didnt he want to speak to me he wondered if i might like to join you on the trip the cunning old devil said george he knows thats the one thing that might clinch the deal for me but not for me said ruth but why not my darling youve always wanted to visit the states and we could turn this into a second honeymoon i knew youd come up with some reason why i should agree to the idea and so obviously did mr hinks but you seem to forget that we have three children cant nanny take care of them while were away george the girls havent seen you for six months and john didnt even know who you were now no sooner has his father returned than he disappears off to america with their mother for another six weeks no george thats no way to bring up children then you can tell hinks that im not interested good said ruth because heaven knows i dont want you to leave again when youve only just come home she hesitated before saying in any case we can always go to america another time george looked directly at her theres something you havent told me ruth hesitated its just that hinks did say that before you turn down such a lucrative offer you mustnt forget that to quote the americans youre hot property at the moment and theyre evidently a nation whose enthusiasms cool fairly quickly and frankly i doubt if youll find an easier way to earn a thousand pounds and if i dont go said george quietly i may well have to make another appointment to see your father and end up being even more indebted to him ruth said nothing ill agree to do it on one condition said george and what might that be asked ruth suspiciously that youll let me take you to venice for a few days and this time he added just the two of us chapter fortyseven thursday march st george had been on deck for over an hour by the time the ss olympic steamed into new york harbor during the five days of the atlantic crossing ruth had been constantly in his thoughts she had driven him down to southampton and once he had reluctantly left her to board the ship shed remained on the dockside until it had sailed out of the harbor and become a small speck on the horizon mr and mrs mallory had spent their promised break in venice which turned out to be something of a contrast from the last visit george had made to that city because on this occasion he booked a suite at the cipriani hotel can we afford it ruth had asked as she looked out of the window of the lagoonside suite her father usually occupied probably not george replied but ive decided to spend a hundred of the thousand pounds im going to earn in america on what i intend to be an unforgettable holiday the last time you went to venice george it was unforgettable ruth reminded him the newlyweds as most of the other guests assumed they were because they came down so late for breakfast were always holding hands and never stopped looking in each others eyes did everything except climb st marks towerinside or out after such a long time apart the few days really did feel like a honeymoon as they got to know each other again by the time the orient express pulled into victoria station a week later the last thing george wanted to do was leave ruth again and sail away to the states if his bank statement hadnt been among the unopened post on their arrival back at the holt he might even have considered canceling the lecture tour and staying at home there was one other letter george hadnt anticipated and he wondered if he ought to accept the flattering invitation given the circumstances hed see how the tour went before he made that decision georges overwhelming first impression of new york as the ship came into harbor was the sheer size of its buildings hed read about skyscrapers even seen photographs of them in the new glossy magazines but to see them standing cheek by jowl was beyond his imagination the tallest building in london would have appeared as a pygmy among this tribe of giants george leaned over the ships railing and looked down at the dock where a boisterous crowd were smiling and waving as they waited for their loved ones and friends to disembark he would have searched among the throng for a new friend had he had the slightest idea what lee keedick looked like then he spotted a tall elegant man in a long black coat holding up a placard that read mallory once george had stepped off the ship a suitcase in each hand he made his way toward the impressive figure when he was a stride away he pointed to the board and said thats me thats when george saw him for the first time a short plump man who would never have made it to base camp stepped forward to greet him mr keedick was wearing a beige suit and an opennecked yellow shirt with a silver cross dangling from a chain around his neck it was the first time george had ever seen a man wearing jewelry keedick must have stood a shade over five feet but only because his crocodileskin shoes had higher heels than those ruth usually wore im lee keedick he announced after removing the stub of an unlit cigar from his mouth you must be george is it ok to call you george i think you just did said george giving him a warm smile this is harry said keedick pointing to the tall man hell be your chauffeur while youre in the states harry touched the rim of his hat with the forefinger of his right hand then opened the back door of what george had thought was a small omnibus somethin wrong asked keedick as george remained on the sidewalk no said george as he stepped inside its just that this is the biggest car ive ever seen its the latest caddie lee told him george thought a caddie was someone who carried a golfers clubs but then recalled george bernard shaw once telling him england and america are two nations divided by a common language its the finest darn car in america added keedick as harry pulled away from the curb to join the morning traffic are we picking up anyone else on the way asked george i just love your english sense of humor said keedick nope this is all yours you gotta understand george its important for people to think youre a big shot you gotta keep up appearances or youll never get anywhere in this town does that mean the bookings for my lectures are going well asked george nervously theyre just swell for the opening at the broadhurst theater tomorrow night keedick paused to light his cigar and if you get a good writeup in the new york times well do just fine for the rest of the tour if its a rave well sell out every night george wanted to ask him what rave meant but satisfied himself with looking up at the skyscrapers as the car inched its way through the traffic thats the woolworth building said keedick winding down the window its seven hundred and ninetytwo feet tall the tallest building in the world but theyre planning one that will be over a thousand feet thats just about how much i missed it by said george as the limousine came to a halt outside the waldorf hotel a bellboy rushed forward to open the car door with the manager following close behind he smiled the moment he saw keedick step out onto the sidewalk hi bill said keedick this is george mallory the guy who conquered everest well not quite said george in fact dont bother with the facts george said keedick no one else in new york does congratulations sir said the manager thrusting out his hand george had never shaken hands with a hotel manager before in your honor he continued weve put you in the presidential suite on the seventeenth floor please follow me he added as they walked across the foyer may i ask where the fire escape is asked george before theyd reached the elevator over there sir said the manager pointing to the other side of the lobby a puzzled look appearing on his face the seventeenth floor you say yes confirmed the manager looking even more puzzled ill see you up there said george dont they have elevators in english hotels the manager asked keedick as george strode across the lobby and through a door marked fire escape or is he mad no replied keedick hes english the elevator whisked both men up to the seventeenth floor the manager was even more surprised when george appeared in the corridor only a few minutes later and didnt seem to be out of breath the manager unlocked the door to the presidential suite and stood aside to allow his guest to enter the room georges immediate reaction was that there must have been some mistake the suite was larger than the tennis court at the holt did you think i was bringing my wife and children with me he asked no said keedick laughing its all yours dont forget the press may want to interview you and its important that they think this is how they treat you back in england but can we afford it dont even think about it said keedick it all comes out of expenses how nice to hear from you geoffrey said ruth when she recognized the familiar voice on the other end of the line its been far too long and im the one to blame said geoffrey young its just that since i took up my new post at imperial college i dont get out of town much during termtime well im afraid george isnt at home at the moment hes in america on a lecture tour yes i know said young he dropped me a line last week to say he was looking for a job and that if anything came up i should let him know well a position has arisen in cambridge that just might be ideal for him but i thought id run it past you first thats very thoughtful of you geoffrey shall we try and meet up when im next in london no no said young i can always pop down to godalming when did you have in mind would next thursday suit you of course will you be able to stay for the night thank you id like that if its not inconvenient if you were able to stay for a month geoffrey it wouldnt be inconvenient george couldnt sleep on his first night in new york and the time difference wasnt to blame because the fiveday atlantic crossing had taken care of that it was just that hed never spent a night in a city before where the traffic never came to a halt and police and ambulance sirens screamed incessantly it reminded him of being back on the western front he finally gave up climbed out of bed and sat at a large desk by the window overlooking central park he went over his lecture once again then checked all the large glass slides he was delighted to find that none of them had been broken during the voyage from england george was becoming more and more apprehensive about what keedick kept referring to as opening night he tried not to think of the consequences of it being a flop another of keedicks words even though the agent kept assuring him that there were only a few seats left unsold and all that mattered now was what the new york times thought of the lecture on balance george decided he preferred mountains they didnt give a damn what the new york times thought of them he crept back into bed a couple of hours later and eventually fell asleep at around four oclock ruth sat in her chair by the window enjoying georges first letter from america she laughed when she read about the caddie and the presidential suite with its central heating aware that george would have been quite content to pitch a tent on the roof but she doubted if that was an option at the waldorf when she turned the page she frowned for the first time it worried her that george felt that so much rested on the opening night he ended his letter by promising to write and let her know how the lecture had been received just as soon as he returned to the hotel later that evening how ruth wished she could have read the review in the new york times before george saw it there was a knock on the door and george answered it to find a smiling lee keedick standing in the corridor he was dressed in his usual opennecked shirt but this time it was green while his suit was a shade of light blue that would have been more appropriate if worn by a blade in cambridge the chain around his neck had turned from silver to gold and the shoes from crocodile to white patent leather george smiled lee keedick would have made george finch look elegant how are you feelin old buddy asked keedick as he stepped into the room apprehensive admitted george no need to said lee theyre gonna love you an interesting observation george thought considering keedick had only known him for a few hours and had never heard him speak in public but then he was beginning to realize that lee keedick had a set of stock phrases whoever his client was outside the hotel harry was standing by the car he opened the back door and george jumped in feeling far more nervous than he ever did before a demanding climb he didnt speak on the journey to the theater and was grateful that keedick remained silent even if he did fill the car with cigar smoke as they drew up outside the broadhurst theater george saw the poster advertising his lecture he burst out laughing book now george mallory the man who conquered everest singlehanded next week jack benny he smiled at the photograph of a young man playing a violin pleased that he would be followed by a musician george stepped out onto the sidewalk his legs trembling and his heart beating as if he was a few feet from the summit keedick led his client down a side alley to the stage door where a waiting assistant accompanied them up a stone staircase to a door with a silver star on it keedick told george before he left that hed see him before he went on stage george sat alone in the cold slightly musty dressing room lit by several naked light bulbs surrounding a large mirror he went over his speech one last time for the first time in his life he wanted to turn back before hed reached the top there was a tap on the door fifteen minutes mr mallory said a voice george took a deep breath and a few moments later keedick walked in lets get this show on the road pal he said he led george back down the stone steps along a brick corridor and into the wings at the side of the stage leaving him with the words good luck buddy ill be in the front row cheering you on george paced up and down becoming more nervous by the minute although he could hear loud chattering coming from the other side of the curtain he had no idea how many people were in the audience had keedick exaggerated when he said there were only a few unsold tickets at five minutes to eight a man dressed in a white tuxedo appeared at georges side and said hi im vince the compère ill be introducing you is there some special way of pronouncing mallory this was a question george had never been asked before no he replied george looked around for someone anyone to talk to while he waited nervously for the curtain to rise he would even have been happy to see keedick he realized for the first time how raleigh must have felt just before he had his head chopped off and then suddenly without any warning the curtain rose and the compère marched out onto the stage tapped the microphone and announced ladies and gentlemen its my pleasure to present to you for your entertainment this evening george mallory the man who conquered everest at least he didnt add singlehanded thought george as he walked onto the stage feeling desperately in need of oxygen but he quickly recovered when he was greeted by warm applause george began his lecture hesitantly partly because he couldnt see the audience who must have been out there somewhere but while several spotlights were trained on him it was impossible to see beyond the front row however it took only a few minutes for him to become accustomed to the strange experience of being treated like an actor rather than a lecturer he was encouraged by intermittent bursts of applause and even the occasional roar of laughter after a bumpy start he battled on for nearly an hour it wasnt until he called for questions and the lights went up that he saw just how many people he had been addressing the stalls were almost full even if the dress circle remained in darkness george was relieved by how many people seemed keen to ask questions and it quickly became clear that there were some seasoned alpinists and genuine enthusiasts among the audience who offered observations that were both thoughtful and relevant however george was nearly stumpednot that the questioner would have known the derivation of the wordwhen a slim blonde seated in the third row asked mr mallory could you tell us how much it costs to mount such an expedition it was some time before george replied and not just because he didnt know the answer ive no idea madam he finally managed the financial details are always handled by the rgs however i do know that the society will be launching an appeal in the near future to raise funds for a second expedition that will set out for the himalaya early next year with the sole purpose of putting anhe stopped himself just in time from saying an englishmana member of that team on the summit can those of us who might consider donating to that fund the young lady inquired assume that you will be a member of the team in fact its climbing leader george didnt hesitate no madam i have already assured my wife that the society will have to look for someone else to lead the team next time he was surprised when several groans of disappointment emanated from the audience even one or two muffled cries of shame after a couple more questions george recovered and was even a little disappointed when lee stagewhispered from the wings time to wrap it up george george immediately bowed and quickly left the stage the audience began to applaud not so fast said keedick pushing him back onto the stage to laughter and even louder applause in fact he had to send him back three times before the curtain finally came down that was great said lee as they climbed into the back of the limousine you were fantastic did you really think so asked george couldnt have gone better said lee now all we have to pray for is that the critics love you as much as the public does by the way have you ever come across estelle harrington before estelle harrington repeated george the dame who asked if you were going to lead the next expedition no ive never seen her before in my life said george why do you ask shes known as the cardboardbox widow said lee her late husband jake harrington the inventor of the cardboard box left her so much money she cant even count it lee inhaled deeply and puffed out a plume of smoke ive read a ton of stuff about her in the gossip columns over the years but i never knew she took any interest in climbing if she was willing to sponsor the tour we wouldnt have to worry about the new york times is it that important asked george more important than all the other papers put together so when will it deliver its verdict in a few hours time replied lee blowing out another cloud of smoke chapter fortyeight the workers educational association said geoffrey young as they strolled around the garden ive never heard of them said ruth it was founded in the early days of the labor movement and its aim is to assist people who werent given the chance of a decent education in their youth but would benefit from it in later life that sounds very much in line with georges fabian principles in my opinion said geoffrey the job was made for him it would allow george to combine his teaching experience with his views on politics and education but would it also mean us having to move to cambridge yes im afraid so but i can think of worse places to live responded geoffrey and dont forget that george still has a lot of old friends there i think i should warn you geoffrey that george is becoming quite anxious about what he describes as his financial predicament in his latest letter he hinted that the tour wasnt going quite as well as hed hoped im sorry to hear that said young however i do know that the basic salary for the job is three hundred and fifty pounds a year with the opportunity to earn a further hundred and fifty through extra tuition fees which would make it up to around five hundred pounds in that case said ruth i think george will jump at the opportunity when would they want him to start she asked not until next september said young which would mean dare i mention it that george could even reconsider not now geoffrey ruth said as they walked back toward the house lets discuss that particular matter over dinner for now why dont you go and unpack and then join me in the drawing room around seven we dont have to talk about it ruth oh yes we do she replied as they strolled back into the house taxi shouted keedick and when it screeched to a halt he opened the back door to allow his client to climb in harry and his caddie were nowhere to be seen so how bad is it asked george as he slumped down in the back seat not good admitted lee even though the new york times gave you a favorable review the outoftown bookings have still beenhe looked out of the windowlets say disappointing although you seem to have attracted at least one huge fan what are you talking about come on george you must have noticed that estelle harringtons turned up to every one of your lectures id be willing to bet good money shell be there again tonight well at least tonights lecture is sold out said george not wanting to dwell on the everpresent mrs harrington sold would be the wrong word said lee they refused to sign the contract unless we agreed to let students in gratisnot a word im comfortable with what about baltimore and philadelphia asked george as the taxi swung off the main road and drove onto a campus george had always wanted to visit but had never imagined he would be invited to lecture at sorry old buddy said lee between puffs but i had to cancel both otherwise we might have lost what little dough weve made so far that bad said george worse im afraid were gonna have to cut the tour short in fact ive booked you onto the saxonia which sails outta new york on monday but that means thisll be your last lecture george so be sure to make it a good one so how much profit have we made asked george quietly i cant give you an exact figure at the moment said lee as the taxi drew up outside the private residence of the president of harvard there are one or two outofpocket expenses i still have to calculate george thought about the letter that had arrived at the holt the day before he sailed once hinks learned that the tour had failed to make the anticipated profit would georges invitation to deliver the societys annual memorial lecture be withdrawn perhaps the best solution would be for george to decline the invitation and save the society unnecessary embarrassment youve been avoiding the subject all evening said ruth as she led young through to the drawing room but it was such a magnificent meal said geoffrey sitting down on the sofa and youre such a wonderful hostess and youre such an old flatterer geoffrey said ruth as she passed him a cup of coffee she sat down in the chair opposite him so were you hoping to try to persuade me that george should reconsider leading the next expedition to the himalaya because im not altogether convinced thats what he really wants are we telling each other the truth asked geoffrey yes of course said ruth looking a little surprised when george wrote to me just before he sailed he made it clear that to quote him he still wanted one more crack at his wildest dream but began ruth he also said that he wouldnt consider leaving you again unless he had your complete support but hes already told me that he wouldnt go back again under any circumstances he also begged me not to let you know how he really felt by telling you ive betrayed his confidence did he give you one good reason why he would want to put himself through all that again asked ruth apart from the obvious one if he were to succeed just think about the extra income that would generate you know as well as i do geoffrey that he didnt do it for money it was you who reminded me that hes anxious about his current financial predicament ruth didnt speak for some time if i were to agree to lie to george about how i really feel she eventually said and it would be a lie geoffreyyou must promise me that this will be the last time it would have to be said geoffrey if george were to take the job as director of the wea the board wont want him to be disappearing for six months at a time and frankly my dear hell be too old by the time the rgs considers mounting another expedition i just wish there was someone i could turn to for advice why dont you seek a second opinion from the one person who will understand exactly what youre going through who do you have in mind asked ruth when young told her ruth simply said do you think shed agree to see me oh yes shell see the wife of mallory of everest george immediately recognized the attractive woman who was chatting to keedick on the far side of the room she was not someone he was likely to forget congratulations mr mallory most stimulating said the president of harvard most stimulating may i also say that i hope you pull it off next time thats kind of you mr lowell said george not bothering to repeat once again that he wouldnt be going on the next expedition and allow me to thank you for organizing this reception my pleasure said the president im only sorry that prohibition prevents me from offering you anything other than orange juice or a cocacola an orange juice will be just fine thank you i know that many of the students are keen to ask you questions mr mallory said the president so i wont monopolize you he walked off to join the woman speaking to keedick within moments george was surrounded by eager young faces that brought back memories of his days at cambridge have you still got all your toes sir asked a young man who was peering down at georges feet they were all there when i checked in the bath this morning said george laughing but my friend morshead lost two fingers and a toe and poor captain norton had half his right ear trimmed off after hed set a new altitude record a voice from behind him asked are there any mountains in america sir that you might consider a worthy challenge most certainly said george i can assure you that mount mckinley presents as great a challenge as any to be found in the himalaya and there are several peaks in the yosemite valley that would test the skills of the most experienced climber if its rock climbing that interests you you need look no further than utah or colorado if you hope to prove your worth something has always puzzled me mr mallory said an intenselooking young man why do you bother the president who had just returned to georges side coughed and tried to hide his embarrassment theres a simple answer to that said george because its there but i apologize for interrupting you mallory said mr lowell but i know that mrs harrington is keen to meet you her late husband was an alumnus of this university and indeed a generous benefactor george smiled as he shook hands with the young woman who had asked him about the expeditions finances in new york and had since attended every one of his lectures she didnt look much older than some of the undergraduates and george assumed that she must have been at least the third mrs harrington unless the cardboard king as keedick kept describing him married very late in life i confess estelle said the president i had no idea you were interested in mountaineering who could fail to be entranced by mr mallorys charismaa word george had never heard used in that way before and would have to look up in his dictionary to find out if in fact it had a second meaning and of course we all hope she gushed that he will be the first person to stand on top of his mountain and then he can come back and tell us all about it george smiled and gave her a slight bow as i explained in new york mrs harrington i shall not is it true continued mrs harrington who clearly wasnt in the habit of being interrupted that this evenings lecture was your last before your return to england im afraid so replied george i take the train back to new york tomorrow afternoon and then sail for southampton the following morning well if youre going to be in new york mr mallory perhaps you might care to join me for a drink tomorrow evening thats extremely kind of you mrs harrington but sadly you see my late husband was a very generous benefactor and i feel sure he would have wanted me to make a substantial donation to your cause substantial repeated george i was thinking aboutshe pausedten thousand dollars it was sometime before george said but i wont get back to new york until around seven tomorrow evening mrs harrington then ill send a car to pick you up from your hotel at eight and george do call me estelle after breakfast had been cleared and nanny had taken the children off for their morning walk ruth went through to the drawing room she sat down in her favorite chair by the window and opened georges latest letter march nd my dearest ruth im sitting on a train traveling between boston and new york some good news for a change harvard was everything i could have hoped for not only was the taft hall packedhanging from the rafters is how keedick described the audiencebut the undergraduates and the dons couldnt have made me feel more welcome i came away from the presidents reception in high spirits despite not being allowed to drink more than an orange juice because of prohibition but when i woke this morning reality set in once again my tour has been cut short and ill be returning to england far earlier than expected its a pity i didnt talk you into coming with me since the whole trip has turned out to be less than a month mind you our short holiday in venice was unforgettable despite not climbing st marks this is to warn you that ill be back some time next week ill cable you from the ship with details of when we dock at southampton the second piece of good news is that im to be given one last chance to top up the societys funds in new york this evening the only good thing about the trip being cut short is that ill be able to see you and the children earlier than expected but back to reality the first thing ill have to do when i return is to start looking for a job see you soon my darling your loving husband george ruth smiled as she put the letter back in the envelope and placed it in the top drawer of her desk along with all the letters george had written to her over the years she glanced at the clock on the mantelpiece her train to london wasnt due to leave godalming for another hour but ruth felt she ought to set out for the station fairly soon as this was an appointment for which she mustnt be late chapter fortynine george knocked on the front door of a brownstone on west th street a few minutes before nine oclock a butler dressed in a long black tailcoat and white tie answered the door good evening sir mrs harrington is expecting you george was shown into the drawing room where he found mrs harrington standing by the mantelpiece below a bonnard oil of a nude woman stepping out of a bath his hostess was wearing a bright red silk dress that didnt quite cover her knees there was no sign of an engagement or wedding ring although she was wearing a necklace of diamonds with a matching bracelet thank you dawkins said mrs harrington that will be all before the butler had reached the door she added and i wont be requiring you again this evening as you wish madam said the butler bowing before closing the door behind him george could have sworn he heard a key turning in the lock do have a seat george said mrs harrington gesturing him toward the sofa and let me fix you a drink what would you like i suppose ill have to settle for orange juice said george certainly not said mrs harrington she walked across to the other side of the room touched a leatherbound volume of hard times and the bookcase immediately swiveled around to become a drinks cabinet scotch and soda she suggested is there anything you dont know about me asked george with a smile one or two things said mrs harrington as she took a seat next to him on the sofa her dress rising several inches above the knee but given a little time i should be able to remedy that george nervously touched his tie now do tell me george how my little donation might help your next expedition the truth is mrs harrington said george taking a sip of his scotchit was even his favorite blendwe need every penny we can lay our hands on one of the things we learned from the last trip was that we just werent well enough prepared it was the same problem captain scott faced on his journey to the south pole and it resulted in him losing his life along with the rest of his polar party im not willing to take that risk with my men youre so very serious george said mrs harrington leaning over and patting him on the thigh its a serious business mrs harrington do call me estelle she said as she crossed her legs to reveal the top of her black stockings do you think youll reach the top this time possibly but you always need a bit of luck said george not least with the weather if you can get three or perhaps even two clear days in a row with no wind youre in with a chance just when i thought i had my chance sadly a disaster befell me i do hope that if i get my chance said mrs harrington a disaster wont befall me her hand was now resting on georges thigh george turned the color of mrs harringtons dress and decided the time had come to look for an escape route theres no reason to be nervous george this is one little adventure that no one need find out about and it certainly doesnt have to end in disaster george was just about to get up and leave when she added and when you do stand on top of your mountain georgeand im sure you willdo spare a thought for me she reached into her sleeve and drew out a slip of paper which she unfolded and placed on the table in front of her george looked down at a check which read pay the royal geographical society he thought about mr hinks and remained seated now you just think about that for a moment george while i slip into something a little less formal do help yourself to another drink while im away mines a gin and tonic she added before leaving the room george picked up the check and was about to place it in his wallet when he saw the edge of a small photograph sticking out between two dollar bills he pulled out the picture of ruth he had taken during their honeymoon and which he always carried with him on his travels he smiled put the photograph back in his wallet and tore the check in half he walked across to the door and slowly turned the handle only to discover that it was locked what a pity the rgs hadnt selected finch for the american tour he thought because then the societys coffers would undoubtedly have been swelled by and he felt confident mrs harrington would have considered it a good investment george walked across to the other side of the room slipped the latch on the sill and quietly slid open the window he stuck his head out and considered the best possible route he was pleased to see that the façade of the building was made up of large rough stone slabs evenly placed he stepped out onto the ledge and began to make his way slowly down the building and when he was five feet from the ground he jumped down onto the sidewalk george walked quickly across the street he knew that a climber should never look back but he couldnt resist it and was suitably rewarded there standing by an open upperstory window was a beautiful woman wearing only a sheer negligee that left little to the imagination damn said george when he remembered he hadnt bought a present for ruth ruth knocked gently on the front door of no tite street a moment later it was opened by a maid who curtsied and said good morning mrs mallory would you be kind enough to follow me when ruth entered the drawing room she found her hostess standing by the fireplace beneath an oil painting of her late husband approaching the south pole she was wearing a simple long black dress no makeup and no jewelry other than an engagement and wedding ring what a pleasure to meet you mrs mallory said kathleen scott as they shook hands please come and join me by the fire she added ushering her to a comfortable chair opposite her its extremely kind of you to agree to see me said ruth as she sat down the maid reappeared carrying a silver tray laden with tea and biscuits which she placed on a table by her mistresss side you can leave us millie said captain scotts widow and i dont wish to be disturbed yes of course my lady said the maid leaving the room and closing the door quietly behind her indian or china mrs mallory indian please milk and sugar just milk thank you said ruth mrs scott completed the little ceremony and passed ruth a cup of tea i was intrigued by your letter she said you indicated there was a personal matter that you wished to discuss with me yes replied ruth tentatively i need your advice ruths hostess nodded before giving her a warm smile my husband began ruth is currently on a lecture tour in the united states and im expecting him back any day now although hes told me several times that he doesnt wish to lead the next rgs expedition to everest i have no doubt that that is exactly what he does want and how do you feel about him returning to the himalaya after his long absence during the war followed by the expedition to everest and now his trip to america i really dont want him to be away for another six months i can appreciate that my dear con was exactly the samejust like a child never able to settle in the same place for more than a few months at a time did he ever ask how you felt about that constantly but i knew he only wanted reassurance so i told him what he wished to hear that i believed he was doing the right thing and did you not always the older woman admitted with a sigh but however much i yearned for him to stay at home and lead a normal life that was never going to be a possibility because just like your husband mrs mallory con wasnt a normal man surely you must now regret not telling him how you really felt no mrs mallory i do not i would rather have spent two years with one of the most exciting men on earth than forty with someone who thought i had prevented him from fulfilling his dream ruth tried to compose herself i can bear the thought of being apart from george for another six months she paused but not for the rest of my life no one understands that better than i do but your husband is no ordinary man and im sure you knew about his overriding ambition long before you agreed to be his wife yes i did but then you cannot indeed must not stand in the way of his destiny if he were to see some lesser mortal achieve his dream it could be you who spends the rest of your life regretting it but does it have to be my destiny to spend the rest of my life without him asked ruth if he only knew how much i adore him i can assure you he does know mrs mallory otherwise you would not have asked to see me and because he knows you will have to convince him that you believe it is nothing less than his duty to lead the next expedition and then my dear all you can do is pray for his safe return ruth raised her head tears streaming down her face but your husband didnt return if i could turn the clock back came the quiet reply and con were to ask me do you mind me going off again old gal i would still reply as i did thirteen years one month and six days ago no my darling of course i dont mind but do remember to take your thick woolen socks with you this time george was up packed and ready to leave by six the following morning when he checked out of the hotel he wasnt altogether surprised to find that keedick hadnt settled the bill he was only relieved that his final night was spent in a single room in a guest house on the lower east side and not the presidential suite at the waldorf when george stepped out onto the sidewalk he didnt hail a cab for more than one reason he strode off on the fortythreeblock route march a suitcase in each hand dodging the natives as he crossed the sweating teeming jungle of manhattan when he reached the dockside just over an hour later he saw keedick standing by the ships gangway cigar in mouth smile etched on his face and the appropriate line ready when you make it to the top of your mountain george gimme a call cause that could be the clincher thank you lee said george and after hesitating for a moment he added for an unforgettable experience my pleasure said keedick thrusting out his hand delighted to have been of assistance george shook hands and was stepping onto the gangway when keedick called out after him hey dont go without this he was holding out an envelope george turned and walked back down not something he enjoyed doing its your share of the profits old boy he said trying to imitate georges english accent fifty percent as agreed thank you said george placing the envelope in an inside pocket he had no intention of opening it in front of keedick when george went in search of his cabin he wasnt surprised to discover that hed been downgraded to steerage four levels below the main deck and that he and three other men were sharing a cabin which wasnt much larger than his tent on the north col he stopped unpacking when he heard the first blast of the foghorn announcing their departure and made his way quickly up on deck so he could follow the ships slow progress out of the harbor once again he leaned over the railing and looked down on the dockside friends and families were now waving goodbye he didnt bother to look for lee keedick whom he knew would have long gone george watched as the giant skyscrapers became smaller and smaller and when the statue of liberty was finally out of sight he decided the time had come to face reality he took the envelope out of his pocket tore it open and extracted a check pay the royal geographical society he smiled and thought about estelle for a moment but only for a moment book seven a womans privilege chapter fifty they strolled down kings parade together hand in hand looking like a couple of undergraduates dont keep me in suspense any longer said ruth how did the interview go i dont think it could have gone much better said george they seemed to agree with all my views on higher education and didnt balk when i suggested the time has come to award degrees to women who are taking the same courses as men about time too said ruth even oxford has managed to come to terms with that it may take another world war before cambridge budges said george as a couple of crusty old dons strolled past so do you think theres a chance theyll offer you the job or are there still other candidates to interview i dont think so said george in fact young led me to believe that i was on a shortlist of one and the chairman of the interviewing board rather gave the game away when he asked if id be able to start work next september thats wonderful said ruth congratulations my darling but wont you find it a terrible bore having to pull up roots and move to cambridge good heavens no said ruth i cant think of a better place to bring up the children and you still have so many friends here lets be grateful they dont need you until next september which will give me more than enough time to look for a new house and plan the move while youre away while im away said george looking puzzled yes because if the job doesnt start until next year i cant see any reason why you shouldnt go off and climb your mountain george stared at her as if he couldnt believe what he was hearing are you telling me my darling he eventually managed that you wouldnt object if i were to sign up for the return expedition on the contrary id welcome it said ruth the idea of you hanging around the house for months like a bear with a sore head isnt worth thinking about and i certainly wouldnt want to be around if finch ends up standing on top of your mountain and all you can do about it is send him a telegram of congratulations of course she continued its possible that they may not be willing to offer you a place on the climbing team and why not demanded george well you may still look like an undergraduate my darling and at times even behave like one but if they were to check your curriculum vitae more carefully theyd soon see that youre no spring chicken so youd better let them know youre available pretty quickly because this will undoubtedly be your last chance you cheeky little minx said george i dont know whether to kiss you or spank you i think ill settle for a kiss when he finally released her all ruth had to say was ive had to speak to you before mr mallory about kissing me in public she couldnt remember when shed last seen him looking so exhilarated thank you my darling he said its such a relief to know how you really feel about me having one last crack at everest ruth was glad that george took her back in his arms for fear he would look into her eyes and discover what she really felt no one was surprised that george was late for his brothers birthday party but his sister mary did tick him off when she discovered that hed left traffords present back at the holt what did you get him asked mary or cant you remember that either a watch said george i picked it up when i was last in switzerland thats a surprising choice considering its an instrument youve shown scant interest in for the past thirtyseven years she said as trafford came across to join them i can always pick it up at christmas said trafford just as i did last year he added with a smile but more important i need to settle an argument between cottie and mother about the highest point george reached on everest george looked across the room to see cottie chatting to a man he didnt recognize he hadnt seen her since they had visited the monet exhibition at the royal academy a year or two ago she gave him that familiar smile he remembered from their climbing days and he felt even more guilty that he hadnt been in touch since her father had gone bankrupt not that he could have offered any financial help but twentyseven thousand five hundred and fifty feet said mary as every schoolboy knows then its higher than any pilot has ever managed said trafford otherwise id try and land on top of the damn mountain that would save us all a lot of trouble said george turning back until then someone will still have to go up the hard way trafford laughed hows cottie george asked is she still having to work for a living yes replied mary but thankfully shes no longer serving behind the counter at woolworths why asked trafford have they made her the manager no said mary laughing shes just had her first book published and the reviews have been most favorable george felt even more guilty ill have to take a copy with me on my next trip he said without thinking your next trip said trafford i thought youd decided not to be part of the next everest expedition can cottie make a living from writing asked george not wanting to respond to his brothers question i only earned a miserable thirtytwo pounds in royalties from my book on boswell cotties written a romantic novel not a stuffy biography said mary whats more the publishers have offered her a threebook contract so someone must believe in her more than one person it would seem said trafford looking more closely at the man cottie was talking to what do you mean asked george cotties just got married said mary a diplomat from the foreign office didnt you know no i didnt admitted george i wasnt invited to the wedding hardly surprising said mary if you read peking picnic you might understand why what are you getting at the hero of the novel is a young schoolmaster who was educated at cambridge and climbs mountains in his spare time trafford laughed what no mention of his dashing younger brother the fearless flying ace who after beating off the germans returns to his homeland to become the youngest flight commander in the raf only one paragraph said mary but she does suggest that like his more handsome older brother hes destined for higher things that might depend on which one of us is the first to reach feet suggested trafford twentynine thousand and two feet said george chapter fiftyone the rest of the committee were studying the rgss latest map of the himalaya when general bruce began his report most of the backup party should have reached feet by now said the general tapping the map with his monocle to indicate the position their job will be to make sure that everything is ready for mallory and his team of climbers by the time they turn up at base camp in twelve weeks time good said george and as ive already identified the route i intend to take that will give us more than a month to get bedded in and have a crack at the summit before the monsoon season sets in can we assume mallory said sir francis that weve dealt with most of the anxieties you raised following the previous expedition you certainly can mr chairman george replied but after my desultory efforts in the united states im bound to ask where the money has come from to make all this possible we had an unexpected windfall explained hinks although all may not have gone to plan for you in america mallory noels film the epic of everest was a huge success here so much so that hes offered the society eight thousand pounds for the exclusive i think the expression is cinematography rights for the next expedition with only one proviso and what might that be asked raeburn that mallory be appointed as climbing leader said hinks and as ive already agreed to that said mallory all thats left for me to do is settle the composition of the rest of my climbing party which quite frankly mr chairman interjected geoffrey young selects itself george nodded and took a piece of paper from his jacket pocket may i present the list of names for the committees approval mr chairman yes of course old boy said sir francis damn it all its your team george read out the names that he and young had agreed on at the previous meeting of the alpine club norton somervell morshead odell finch bullock hingston noel and myself he looked up expecting to receive the committees unanimous approval there was a long silence before the chairman responded im sorry to have to tell you mallory that i received a letter only this morning from mr finch saying that he felt that given the circumstances he would have to withdraw his name for consideration as a member of the expedition given the circumstances repeated george what circumstances sir francis nodded in hinkss direction hinks opened one of the files in front of him extracted a letter and passed it to george george read it twice before he said but he gives no specific reason for having to withdraw he passed the letter to geoffrey young then asked is he ill by any chance not that we are aware of said sir francis guardedly and it cant be a financial problem said young passing the letter back to hinks because thanks to noel we have more than enough money to cover any expenses finch might require for his passage and equipment im afraid mallory the truth is that the situation is a little more delicate than that said hinks as he closed the minute book and screwed the top back onto his fountain pen surely it cant be anything to do with that business with the governorgenerals wife said george no i fear its far worse than that unsavory incident said hinks taking off his halfmoon spectacles and placing them on the table george waited impatiently for hinks to continue without informing the rgs hinks eventually said finch accepted several speaking engagements up and down the country these resulted in him making a considerable sum of money of which the society has not received one penny was the society entitled to one penny asked young it most certainly was said hinks as finch had signed a contract just as you did mallory to pass over fifty percent of any earnings he received as a consequence of the everest expedition how much money is involved asked young we have no idea admitted hinks as finch refuses to submit any accounts despite several requests for him to do so in the end the society had no choice but to issue a writ demanding what is rightfully ours i always said he was a cad from the start interjected ashcroft this latest incident only proves that i was right do you think the matter will come to court asked young i would hope not said hinks but were it to do so the case would probably be heard when the expedition is already in tibet im sure the sherpas will get very worked up about that said george this is no laughing matter said sir francis gravely is there anyone around this table who believes this latest misdemeanor will in any way affect finchs climbing ability asked young thats not the point young said hinks and you know it it will be the point said george when im standing at feet and have to decide who to select to partner me for the final climb youll still have norton and somervell to choose between hinks reminded him and they would be the first to admit they arent in finchs class surely mallory you must accept that the rgs has been left with little or no choice following this latest incident it is not the rgss godgiven right to make the decision as to who should and should not be in the climbing party said mallory just in case youve forgotten mr hinks this is the everest committee i say mallory interjected ashcroft i think that was a bit ripe then let me ask you commander george spat out with all your vast experience of being above sealevel who do you consider would be the obvious choice to take finchs place im glad you raised that question mallory interjected hinks because i believe we have come up with a suitable replacement and who might that be asked mallory a young man called sandy irvine hes an oxford rowing blue and has agreed to stand in despite the short notice as its not my intention to row up everest mr hinks perhaps you could let us know what climbing experience mr irvine has because ive never heard of him hinks smiled for the first time it seems that your friend odell was very impressed with the lad when they climbed together inside the arctic circle last year and irvine was the first to reach the summit of the highest peak on spitsbergen hinks looked rather pleased with himself spitsbergen interjected young is for promising novices and in case you didnt know mr hinks its highest peak is about feet so when im next looking for someone to keep me company for the first feet said george let me assure you mr hinks that irvines will be the first name that springs to mind i should also point out mallory said hinks that irvine is reading chemistry at oxford and is wellacquainted with the oxygen apparatus finch experimented with on the last trip in fact im reliably informed that hes in regular touch with the manufacturers about possible improvements to the system finch is also a dab hand when it comes to the use of oxygen and hes got a firstclass honors degree to prove it george reminded him and just in case the committee has forgotten hes already experimented with oxygen above feet which you were extremely critical of at the time mr hinks perhaps even more relevant is that finch is the current holder of the world altitude record at feet as i know to my cost gentlemen gentlemen said sir francis we must try to resolve our differences with some degree of decorum what do you have in mind mr chairman asked george as clearly mr hinks and i are never going to agree on this particular subject that we should allow the majority to prevail as has always been our custom at the rgs before george could interrupt sir francis added as im sure is also the case at the alpine club young kept his counsel and as no one else ventured an opinion sir francis continued may i therefore suggest somewhat reluctantly that the time has come for us to take another vote on this matter he waited for any objections to be voiced but the rest of the committee remained silent will you please officiate mr secretary certainly mr chairman said hinks those in favor of mr finch being reinstated as a member of the climbing party please raise your hand mallory young and to everyones surprise general bruce raised their hands before hinks registered the generals vote in the minute book he stared across at him and said but i thought you detested the man yes i do old boy said bruce but the highest point i managed on the last trip was feet and i can assure you hinks that i have no intention of putting my name forward to join mallory when he reaches feet and has to decide who will join him for the final climb hinks reluctantly registered the generals vote those against raeburn and ashcroft joined the secretary when he raised his hand i fear that its three all mr chairman so once again you have the casting vote on this occasion said sir francis without hesitation i vote against finch being reinstated hinks immediately entered the result in the minute book and before the ink was dry announced the everest committee has decided by four votes to three that george finch should not be reinstated as a member of the climbing party he closed the minute book may i ask what caused you to change your mind on this occasion mr chairman asked george calmly not keeping to his agreement with the rgs was the final straw for me said sir francis glancing at the portrait of the societys president however i also suspect that his majesty would not be pleased to be told that a divorced man was the first person to stand on top of the world what a pity henry the eighth wasnt your president when the first attempt on everest was considered said george quietly he slowly gathered up his papers and rose from his place i must apologize mr chairman but you have left me with no choice but to resign as a member of this committee and to withdraw my name as climbing leader naturally i wish my successor every good fortune good day gentlemen mr mallory said hinks before george had reached the door i hope your decision will not prevent you from delivering the memorial lecture to the rgs this evening the event has been sold out for weeks and indeed the i shall of course honor my agreement said mallory but should anyone ask me why i have resigned from this committee and will not be leading the forthcoming expedition to everest i shall not hesitate to tell them that i was overruled when it came to the selection of the climbing party so be it said hinks mallory left the room and closed the door quietly behind him bang goes noels eight thousand pounds said raeburn as he stubbed out his cigar which leaves us with little choice but to cancel the whole damn shindig not necessarily said hinks quietly you will have noticed gentlemen that i did not record mallorys resignation in the minute book i still have a couple of cards up my sleeve which i intend to play before the evening is out george quickly made his way out of the hall and across the corridor to the speakers room he didnt stop to chat to anyone on the way for fear they might ask him a question that he didnt want to answer until after hed given his lecture he also needed to use the forty minutes to compose his thoughts as he knew he was about to deliver the most important speech of his life when he walked into the speakers room he was surprised to find ruth waiting for him what happened she asked when she saw the expression of anger on his face george paced up and down the room while he gave ruth a blowbyblow account of what had taken place at the committee meeting he finally came to a halt in front of her i did do the right thing didnt i darling ruth had anticipated the question and knew that all she had to say was yes of course you were right to resign my darling hinks behaved disgracefully and unless finch is reinstated youll be taking far too great a risk and dont lets forget its your life not his that will be at risk george stood there waiting for her reply lets hope that you wont live to regret your decision was all she said she jumped up from her chair before george could press her further ill leave you now my darling i only popped by to wish you luck i realize youll need these last few minutes to prepare yourself for such an important occasion she gave him a gentle kiss on the cheek and left without another word george sat at the little desk and tried to go over his notes but his thoughts kept returning to the committee meeting and ruths ambiguous response to his question there was a gentle tap on the door george wondered who it could possibly be it was one of the societys golden rules that a speaker must not be interrupted during his final moments of preparation when he saw hinks come marching through the door he could have happily punched the damn man on the nose until he noticed who was following close behind him george leaped to his feet and bowed your royal highness said hinks may i have the honor of presenting mr george mallory who as you know sir will be delivering tonights lecture yes indeed said the prince of wales i apologize for barging in on you like this mallory but i have a message from his majesty the king that ive been entrusted to deliver to you in person its extremely kind of you to take the trouble sir not at all old fellow his majesty wanted you to know how delighted he is that you have agreed to lead the next expedition to everest and he looks forward to meeting you on your return hinks gave a thin smile and may i say mallory that those are also my sentiments and add how much i am looking forward to your lecture thank you sir said george now id better leave you in peace the prince said otherwise this show may never get off the ground george bowed again as the prince of wales and hinks left the room you bastard hinks he muttered as the door closed behind them but dont imagine even for one moment that your little subterfuge will change my mind chapter fiftytwo your royal highness my lords ladies and gentlemen it is my privilege as chairman of the royal geographical society and the everest committee to introduce tonights guest speaker mr george mallory announced sir francis younghusband mr mallory was the climbing leader on the last expedition when he reached a height of feeta mere feet from the summit tonight mr mallory will be telling us about his experiences on that historic adventure in a lecture entitled walking off the map ladies and gentlemen mr george mallory george was unable to speak for several minutes because the audience rose to their feet as one and applauded until he finally had to wave them down he looked down at the front row and smiled at the man who should have been giving the memorial lecture that evening had it not been for the injury he sustained in the war young returned his smile clearly proud that his pupil was representing him norton somervell and odell sat beside him george waited for the audience to settle before he delivered his first line when i was recently in new york he began i was introduced as the man who had conquered everest singlehanded he waited for the laughter to die down before he went on wrong on both counts although one man may end up standing alone on top of that great mountain he could not hope to achieve such a feat without the backing of a firstclass team and by that i mean youd better have everything from seventy indian mules to a general bruce if you hope even to reach base camp this was the cue for the lights to go down and the first slide to appear on the screen behind him forty minutes later george was back at base camp and once again receiving rapturous applause he felt that the lecture had gone well but he still needed to answer questions and feared that the wrong response could well put him back at base camp when he called for questions he was surprised that hinks didnt rise from his place as tradition allows the secretary of the rgs to ask the first question instead he remained resolutely in his place in the front row arms folded george selected an elderly gentleman in the second row when you were stranded at feet sir and saw finch moving away from you did you not wish at the time that you had taken a couple of oxygen cylinders along with you not when we first set out i didnt replied mallory but later when i couldnt progress more than a few feet without having to stop for a rest i came to the conclusion that it would be nigh on impossible to reach the summit under ones own steam he pointed to another hand but wouldnt you consider the use of oxygen to be cheating sir i used to be of that opinion said george but that was before a colleague who shared a tent with me at feet pointed out that you might argue that it was cheating to wear leather climbing boots or woolen mittens or even to put a lump of sugar in your lukewarm tea all of which undoubtedly give you a better chance of success and lets be honest why travel five thousand miles if you have no hope of covering the last thousand feet he selected another raised hand if you hadnt stopped to assist mr odell do you think you might have reached the top i could certainly see the top george replied because mr finch was feet ahead of me this was greeted with warm laughter i confess that the summit seemed to be tantalizingly close at the time but even that can be deceptive never forget that on a mountain feet is not a couple of hundred yards far from itits more likely to be over a mile however that experience convinced me that given enough time and the right conditions it is possible to reach the summit george answered several more questions during the next twenty minutes without giving any hint that he had just resigned as climbing leader last question he said finally with a relieved smile he pointed to a young man near the middle of the hall who was standing up and waving a hand hoping to be noticed in a voice that had not yet broken the boy asked when you have conquered everest sir what will be left for the likes of me the whole audience burst out laughing and mallory recalled how nervous he had been when he had asked captain scott almost the same question he looked up at the gallery delighted to see scotts widow in her usual place in the front row thank god his decision earlier that evening meant that ruth would no longer have to worry about suffering the same fate mallory looked back down at the young man and smiled you should read h g wells my boy he believes that in time mankind will be able like puck to put a circle round the earth in forty minutes that someone will one day break the sound barrier with consequences we have yet to comprehend and that in your lifetime though perhaps not in mine a man will walk on the moon george smiled at the young man perhaps youll be the first englishman to be launched into space the audience roared with laughter and applauded again as george took his final bow he felt confident that hed escaped without anyone suspecting what had taken place at the committee meeting earlier that evening he smiled down at ruth who was sitting in the front row his sisters avie and mary on either side of her another small triumph when george raised his head he saw his oldest friend standing and applauding wildly within moments the rest of the audience had joined guy bullock and seemed quite unwilling to resume their seats however much he gestured that they should do so he was about to leave the stage but when he turned he saw hinks climbing the steps toward him carrying a file he gave mallory a warm smile as he approached the microphone lowered it by several inches and waited for the applause to die down and for everyone to resume their seats before he spoke your royal highness my lords ladies and gentlemen those of you who are familiar with the traditions of this historic society will be aware that it is the secretarys privilege on these occasions to ask the lecturer the first question i did not do so this evening thus breaking with tradition but only because my chairman sir francis younghusband rewarded me with an even greater prize that of giving the vote of thanks to our guest speaker and my dear friend george mallory george had never heard hinks call him by his christian name before but first allow me to tell you about a resolution that we passed at the everest committee this evening in mr mallorys absence and which we feel is something we should share with every member of this society hinks opened the file extracted a piece of paper adjusted his spectacles and began to read it was unanimously agreed that we should invite mr george leigh mallory to be climbing leader for the expedition of everest the audience burst into loud applause but hinks raised a hand to silence them as he clearly had more to say george stood a pace behind him seething however the committee is only too aware that there might be reasons why mr mallory would feel unable to take on this onerous task a second time cries of no came from the audience causing hinks to raise a hand once again reasons you may not be aware of but when i tell you what they are you will appreciate his dilemma mr mallory has a wife and three young children whom he may not wish to abandon for another six months not only that but i learned today that he is about to be appointed to a most important position at the workers educational association that will allow him to put into practice the beliefs he has held passionately for many years if that were not enough continued hinks there is a third reason i must be very careful how i word this as i am only too aware that several gentlemen of the press are among us tonight your society learned today that mr finch mr mallorys colleague on the last everest expedition has had to withdraw his name from the climbing team for personal reasons which i fear the newspapers will be reporting in greater detail tomorrow the room was now silent with this in mind your committee has decided that if mr mallory felt quite understandably unable to take his place as leader of the expedition we would be left with no choice but to postponenot abandon but postponethat expedition until such time as a suitable replacement as climbing leader could be found george suddenly realized that the king and the prince of wales were only a side show hinks was about to deliver the knockout punch let me end by saying hinks said turning to face george that whatever decision you come to sir this society will be eternally grateful for your unswerving commitment to its cause and more important your service to this country we naturally hope that you will accept our offer of the position of climbing leader and that this time you will lead your team to even greater glory ladies and gentlemen i ask you all to join me in thanking our guest speaker this evening mallory of everest the audience rose as one men who would normally offer courteous and respectful applause to the guest speaker leaped from their seats some cheering some pleading all hoping that mallory would accept the challenge george looked down at ruth who was also on her feet joining in the applause when hinks took a pace back to join him george said for the second time that evening you bastard quite possibly hinks replied however when i bring the minute book uptodate later this evening i presume ill be able to record your acceptance of the position of climbing leader mallory of everest mallory of everest the audience chanted in unison you bastard george repeated chapter fiftythree george leaned over the railing of the ss california searching for his wife he smiled when he spotted her among the cheering crowd the moment she realized he had found her she began to wave she was only glad that he could not see the tears streaming down her face by the time the crew had raised the gangway the ropes had been untied and the ship had begun to ease away from the dockside he was already missing her why did he always have to go away to realize how much he loved her for the next six months all he would have to remind him of her beauty was a frayed sepia photograph taken during the first week of their honeymoon if she had not been adamant that he should go he would have stayed at home content to follow the progress of the expedition in the times he knew that hinks had no intention of postponing the expedition but as every word of his speech had been reported in the thunderer the following morning he also realized that his bluff had been called hinks had proved to be a far better poker player so now he was on his way back to india without finch to challenge his every move and sherpa nyima would not be standing on the dockside waiting to greet him when he stepped off the ship on the far side of the world and then george saw him standing at the back of the crowd slightly to one side as befits a loner he didnt recognize him to begin with until the man raised his hat to reveal that thick wavy fair hair that so many women had swooned over george returned the compliment only surprised that finch hadnt smuggled himself on board but hinks had made certain that he couldnt show his face in public until the scandal had died down let alone make a solo appearance on the highest stage on earth george searched for ruth once again and having found her he never let her out of his sight until she could no longer be seen among the vast crowd of wellwishers waving from the dockside when finally a column of black belching smoke was all that could be seen on the horizon ruth reluctantly walked slowly to her car she drove out of the dock and began the long journey back to the holt this time there were no adoring crowds to prevent her from escaping ruth had never craved adoring crowds she simply wanted her husband to return alive but she had played the game so well that everyone was convinced she wanted george to be given one last chance to fulfill his dream in truth she didnt care if he succeeded or failed as long as they could grow old together and today would become nothing more than a fading memory when george could no longer see his homeland he retired to his little cabin he sat at the desk below the porthole and began to write a letter to the only woman he had ever loved my dearest ruth book eight ascension day chapter fiftyfour march th my dearest ruth the long sea voyage has only served to remind me what a fine bunch of chaps i have the privilege of leading i think too often of the sacrifices i have made and not enough about these fine men who have been willing to join me in this capricious adventure and what tribulations they must also have been through with their families and friends during the past two years despite my initial misgivings sandy irvine turns out to be a very singular fellow although hes only he has a shrewd northern head screwed firmly onto his broad shoulders and the coincidence of us both hailing from birkenhead would not be acceptable on the pages of a novel of course im still anxious about the fact that hes never climbed much above feet but i have to admit that he is far fitter than any of us as passengers have been able to witness at our morning pt sessions conducted by the redoubtable general bruce bruce is happy enough to remain our conductor while still having no desire to be part of the orchestra i must also confess that hinks did not exaggerate irvines chemistry skills hes quite the equal of finch in that department even though norton and odell still refuse to countenance the idea of using oxygen let alone agreeing to strap those bulky cylinders onto their backs will they in the end accept that we cannot hope to reach the summit without the aid of this infernal heresy or will they remain in finchs words blessed amateurs who must therefore fail only time will tell our ship docked at bombay on march th and we immediately boarded the train for darjeeling where we selected our ponies and porters once again general bruce performed miracles and the following morning we set off on the long trek for tibet along with ponies and more than a hundred porters before leaving darjeeling on the toy train we dined with lord lytton the new governorgeneral and his wife but as finch wasnt present there is nothing of interest to report other than the fact that young irvine took more than a passing interest in the governorgenerals daughter lynda lady lytton seemed happy to encourage him there was a letter awaiting me at the embassy from my sister mary bit of luck her husband being posted to ceylon because shell be able to warn us in advance when the monsoon season will be upon us as it travels across that island about ten days before its due to reach us the following morning we set off on the eightymile journey to the border which passed without incident sadly general bruce caught malaria and had to return to darjeeling i fear we wont see him again he took with him his bath a dozen boxes of cigars and half his cases of wine and champagnebut he kindly left us with the other half not to mention all the gifts he had so carefully selected for the dzongpen when we present our credentials at the border the generals deputy lt col norton has taken over his responsibilities you may recall norton as the man who held the world altitude record for twentyfour hours before finch so rudely snatched it away from him although he never mentions the subject i know norton is keen to put the record straight and i must admit that if only he would agree to using oxygen once we have reached feet he would be the obvious choice to accompany me to the summit however somervell is wavering when it comes to oxygen so he may well turn out to be the alternative as i wouldnt consider attempting the last feet with odell again we sailed across the border on this occasion even if we were all wearing our oldest boots and watches picked up cheaply in bombay however we were still able to shower the dzongpen with gifts from harrods fortnums davidoff and locks including a black opera cane mounted with a silver head of the king which i assured him was a personal gift from his majesty we were all taken by surprise when the dzongpen told us how disappointed he was to learn that general bruce had been taken ill as he had been looking forward to seeing his old friend again i couldnt help noticing that he was wearing the generals halfhunter and chain even if there was no sign of my old wykehamist tie this morning as we passed over pang la the clouds suddenly lifted and we saw the commanding heights of chomolungma dominating the skyline ahead of us once again her sheer beauty took my breath away a wise man would surely resist her alluring charms and immediately turn back but like euripides sirens she draws one toward her rocky and treacherous terrain as we climbed higher and higher i kept a watchful eye on irvine who appears to have acclimatized to the conditions as well as any of us but then i sometimes forget that hes sixteen years younger than i am this morning with everest in the background we held a service in memory of nyima and the other six sherpas who lost their lives on the last expedition we must reach the summit this time if for no other reason than to honor their memory i only wish nyima was standing by my side now because i would not hesitate to invite him to join me on the final climb as it must surely be right that a sherpa is the first person to stand on top of his own mountain not to mention that it would be the sweetest revenge on hinks after his machiavellian behavior on the night of the memorial lecture but sadly a sherpa will not reach the top on this occasion as i have searched among his countrymen and have not found nyimas equal we finally arrived at base camp on april th and to be fair to hinkssomething ive never found easyeverything i requested has been put in place this time we will not be wasting precious days erecting and dismantling camps and continually moving equipment up and down the mountain ive been assured by mr hazard an unfortunate name for someone with the responsibility of organizing our daily lives that camp iii has already been established at feet with eleven of the finest sherpas awaiting our arrival under the command of guy bullock one must never forget that its noels that has made all this possible and hes filming anything and everything that moves the final documentary of this expedition will surely rival birth of a nation i am writing this letter in my little tent at base camp in a few minutes time i will be joining my colleagues for dinner and norton will hand over the responsibility of command to me i will then brief the team on my plans for the ascent of everest and so my dearest the great adventure begins once again i am much more confident about our chances this time but as soon as i conquer my magnificent obsession i shall press a button and moments later i will be standing by your side from this you will gather that i am currently rereading h g wellss the time machine even if i cant press his mythical button i will nevertheless return as quickly as humanly possible as i have no desire to be away from you a moment longer than necessary as i promised i still intend to leave your photograph on the summit chapter fiftyfive thursday may st and then there were eight gentlemen his majesty the king said lieutenant colonel norton as he rose from his place at the head of the table and raised his tin mug the rest of the team immediately stood up and as one said the king please remain standing said george gentlemen chomolungma goddess mother of the earth the team raised their mugs a second time outside the tent the sherpas fell flat on the ground facing the mountain gentlemen said george you may smoke the team resumed their places and began to light cigars and pass the port decanter around the table a few minutes later george stood up again tapped his glass with a spoon allow me to begin gentlemen by saying how sorry we all are that general bruce is unable to be with us on this occasion hear hear hear hear and how grateful we are to him for the fine wine he has bequeathed to us which we have enjoyed this evening let us hope that in time god willing we will have good reason to uncork his champagne hear hear hear hear thanks to general bruces foresight and diligence we have been left with only one task that of finally taming this monster so that we can all return home and begin leading normal lives let me make it absolutely clear from the outset that i havent yet decided the composition of the two teams that will join me for the final ascent one aspect that will not differ from the previous expedition is that i will be keeping a close eye on each one of you until i decide who has best acclimatized to the conditions with that in mind i expect all of you to be up and ready to leave by six oclock tomorrow morning in order that we can reach feet by midday and still return to base camp by sunset why come back down asked irvine when were trying to get to the top as quickly as possible not as quickly as possible said george smiling when he realized just how inexperienced young sandy irvine was even you will take a little time to become acclimatized to new heights the golden rule he added is climb high sleep low when weve become fully acclimatized he continued its my intention to move on to feet and set up camp iv on the north col once weve bedded in we will move on and establish camp v at feet and camp vi around feet from where the final assault will be launched george paused for some time before he delivered his next sentence i want all of you to know that whoever i invite to join me will be part of the team making the second attempt on the summit as i intend to allow two of my colleagues the first opportunity to make history should the first team fail my partner and i will make our attempt the following day i feel sure that every one of us has the same desire to be the first to place his foot on the brow of chomolungma however its only fair to let you know gentlemen that its going to be me this was greeted by the whole team with laughter and banging of mugs on the table when the noise had died down george invited questions is it your intention to use oxygen for the second attempt on the summit asked norton yes it is replied george ive reluctantly come to the conclusion that finch was right and that we cannot hope to scale the last feet without the aid of oxygen then ill have to make sure im in the first party said norton and prove you wrong its a shame really mallory because that means ill be the first man to stand on top of everest this was greeted with even louder cheers and more banging of mugs on the table if you manage that norton retorted george ill abandon the use of oxygen the following day and climb to the top in my bare feet that will be of little significance said norton raising his mug to george because no one will remember the name of the second man to climb everest howzat not out mallory wasnt sure if he was dreaming or if he really had just heard the sound of leather on willow he stuck his head out of the tent to see that a square of snow in the himalaya had been transformed into an english village cricket pitch two ice axes had been planted in the snow twentytwo yards apart serving as stumps odell ball in hand was bowling to irvine mallory only needed to watch a few deliveries to realize that bat was on top of ball it amused him to see the sherpas standing around in little huddles chatting among themselves clearly puzzled by the english at play while noel filmed the event as if it were a test match mallory crawled out of his tent and strolled across to join norton behind the stumps taking up his place at first slip irvines not at all bad said norton the lads only a few runs off his half century how long has he been at the crease asked mallory best part of thirty minutes and hes still able to run between the wickets doesnt seem to be a problem he must have lungs like bellows but then you have to remember mallory he does have at least fifteen years on the rest of us wake up skipper shouted odell as the ball shot past mallorys right hand sorry odell my mistake said mallory i wasnt concentrating irvine hit the next ball for four bringing up his fifty which was greeted with warm applause ive seen enough of this bloody oxford man said guy bullock as he took over the bowling from odell guys first effort was a little short and irvine dispatched it to the boundary for another four runs but his second sizzled off an icy patch caught the edge of irvines bat and george falling to his right took the ball onehanded well caught skipper said guy pity you didnt turn up a little earlier all right chaps lets get moving said mallory i want to be out of here in half an hour suddenly the pitch was deserted as the village cricketers reverted to seasoned mountaineers thirty minutes later nine climbers and twentythree sherpas were all ready to move mallory waved his right arm like a traffic policeman and set off at a pace that would soon sort out those who would be unlikely to survive at greater heights one or two sherpas fell by the wayside dropping their loads in the snow and retreating down the mountain however none of the climbing party seemed to be in trouble with irvine continually dogging his leaders footsteps despite having two large oxygen cylinders strapped to his back mallory was puzzled because he didnt seem to have a mouthpiece attached he beckoned the young man to join him you wont be needing oxygen irvine he said until we reach at least feet irvine nodded i was hoping not to use one precious ounce of the stuff until at least feet but if im lucky enough to be selected to join you for the final climb i want to become accustomed to the extra weight you see im planning to be sitting on top he said pointing to the peak waiting for you to join me after all he added its nothing more than the duty of an oxford man to hammer a tab whenever possible george gave a slight bow fix me up with two of your cylinders tomorrow he said its not just getting used to the extra weight thats important but once we have to tackle sheer rock faces and sheets of ice even the slightest shift of balance could prove fatal after a couple of hours george allowed the team a short break to enjoy a digestive biscuit and a mug of tea before setting off again the weather couldnt have been more conducive to climbing apart from a brief shower of snow that wouldnt have distracted a child building a snowman and they maintained a steady pace george wondered just how long the weather would remain so docile he prayed his prayers were not answered chapter fiftysix may th my dearest ruth disaster nothing has gone right for the past two weeks the weather has been so foul that there have been days when the relentless heavy snow has made it impossible to see more than a few feet in front of your nose norton always as brave as a lion somehow managed to reach feet where he and somervell set up camp iv and spent the night however the following day the two of them only just made it back to camp iii before nightfall it took them over eight hours of downhill trekking into the driving snow to cover ft think about itthats an average speed of yards an hour a distance harold abrahams covered in seconds the following day odell bullock and i reached feet and somehow managed to pitch camp v on an icy ledge but after spending the night there the weather gave us no choice but to return to camp iii when we arrived dr hingston greeted me with the news that one of the sherpas had broken his leg while another had suspected pneumonia i didnt bother to tell him that my ankles been playing up again guy and odell kindly volunteered to accompany the walking wounded down to base camp from where they were escorted back to their villages when guy returned the following day he reported that our cobbler had died of frostbite a gurkha nco had developed a blood clot on the brain and twelve more sherpas had run away on the equivalent of less than a shilling a week who could blame them apparently morale at base camp is pretty low what do they imagine its like up here norton and somervell finally reached the north col after three more attempts and even managed to set up camp despite the temperature being minus twentyfour degrees but when they were on their way back down four of the sherpas lost their nerve and fearing an avalanche returned to spend a second night on the north col the following morning norton somervell and i mounted a rescue party and somehow managed to reach the sherpas and bring them back to the relative safety of camp iii my bet is that weve seen the last of them if that wasnt enough our meteorologist informed me over breakfast this morning that in his opinion the monsoon will soon be upon us however he did remind me that last time the monsoon was preceded by three days of clear skies its hardly a pattern one can rely on but it didnt stop me from offering up a prayer to whichever god is in charge of the weather george should have seen it coming but he had been so preoccupied with the desire to be given one more chance that he had failed to notice what was taking place around him that was until norton called a council of war i think it would be wise given the circumstances gentlemen said norton for us to cut our losses and turn back now before we lose anyone else i dont agree said george immediately if we were to do that we would have sacrificed six months of our lives with nothing to show for it at least we would live to fight another day said somervell none of us is going to be given the opportunity to fight another day said george tersely this is our last chance somervell and you know it somervell was momentarily stunned by the vehemence of mallorys words and it was some time before he responded but at least wed be alive he managed thats not my idea of living responded george before anyone had a chance to offer an opinion he turned to his oldest friend and asked how would you feel about turning back guy bullock didnt respond immediately though the rest of the team waited for his reply im still willing to back your judgment george he finally said and to hang about for a few more days to see if the weather breaks me too said irvine but then i have no qualms about turning back either after all im the only one here young enough to fight another day the rest of the team burst out laughing which helped to ease the tension why dont we give it another week before we decide to shut up shop suggested odell if the weather hasnt improved by then perhaps we should admit defeat and return home george looked around the group to find his colleagues nodding he recalled a c bensons sage advice when you know youre beaten give in gracefully so be it said george well stick it out for another seven days and if the weather doesnt improve norton will resume command and well return to england george felt he had won the dayor to be more accurate seven days but would that be enough may th so unless the weather turns on its head in the next few days you can expect me back in england toward the end of august or the beginning of september at the latest please thank clare for her wonderful poemrupert brooke would have been proud of herand beridge for her drawing of a cat or was it a dognot to mention johns good wishes short but appreciated im glad that youve found time to visit cambridge and start looking for a home and thanks for the warning that it gets very cold in the fens at this time of the year my dearest im looking forward to starting the new job and to sleeping in a bed with a woman i want to hold and not a man i have to cling on to just to stay alive when i return home this time there will be no crowds at the dockside to welcome mallory of everest just a young lady waiting for a middleaged man who is looking forward to spending the rest of his life with the woman he loves your loving husband george chapter fiftyseven monday june nd and then there were five george was having breakfast on a clear windless morning when a sherpa arrived from base camp and handed him the cable he tore it open read its contents slowly and smiled as he considered its implications he glanced at norton who was sitting crosslegged on the ground beside him could we have a word old chap yes of course said norton putting aside his sliced ham and tongue im going to ask you one last time said george if i were to offer you the chance to partner me on the final climb would you be willing to consider the use of oxygen no i would not said norton firmly so be it said george quietly accepting that no amount of further discussion on the subject was going to persuade norton to change his mind in that case you will lead the first assault without oxygen if you succeed gentlemen george said after calling the team together im sorry to interrupt your breakfast but ive just received a message from my sister in colombo he looked down at marys cable one week possibly ten days of good weather before monsoon season upon you good luck mallory looked up we dont have a moment to waste ive had a good deal of time to consider my options and i will now share my thoughts with you ive selected two teams for the attempts on the summit the first will be norton and somervell they will set out in an hours time and attempt to reach camp v at feet by nightfall tomorrow they will have to rise early if they hope to skirt the northeast ridge establish camp vi at around feet and be bedded down before the sun sets they will have to grab as many hours of sleep as possible because on the following morning they will have to make the first attempt on the summit any questions gentlemen both norton and somervell shook their heads they had spent the past month endlessly discussing every possible scenario now all they wanted to do was get on with it meanwhile the rest of the team mallory said will just have to sit around twiddling their thumbs while we wait for the return of the conquering heroes and if they fail asked irvine with a grin then you and i sandy will make the second attempt using oxygen and if we succeed asked norton mallory gave the old soldier a wry smile in that case odell and i will make the second ascent without the aid of oxygen in your bare feet remember added somervell while the rest of the team laughed mallory gave his two colleagues a slight bow he waited for a moment before he spoke again gentlemen he said this is not the occasion on which to make a speech about what being the first man to stand on the top of this mountain would mean to our fellow countrymen throughout the empire or to dwell on the possible garlands that would be placed on our heads there will be time enough to sit at the bar of the alpine club and bore young climbers with tales of our past glories but for now if we are to succeed we cannot afford to waste a precious moment so good luck gentlemen and godspeed thirty minutes later norton and somervell were fully equipped and ready mallory odell irvine bullock morshead and hingston were standing in line to see them off while noel went on filming them until they were out of sight he didnt see mallory look up to the heavens and say just give me one more week and ill never ask you for anything else again george matched norton and somervell stride for stride as he sat alone in his tent he regularly checked his watch trying to imagine what height his two colleagues would have reached after a prolonged lunch of macaroni and prunes with the rest of the team george returned to his tent he wrote his daily letter to ruth and another to traffordwing commander mallory another man interested in reaching great heights he then translated a few lines of the iliad and later managed a round of bridge against odell and irvine with guy as his partner after the last rubber was decided odell dug out a tin of bully beef from rations and once it had thawed over a candle divided the contents into four portions later all the remaining members of the climbing party sat and watched the moon replace the sun which had flickered across the snow on what had turned out to be a perfect day for climbing they all had only one thought on their minds but no one spoke of itwhere were they george climbedthe only climbing he managed that dayback into his sleeping bag just before eleven oclock exhausted by hour upon hour of doing nothing he fell into a deep sleep wondering if he would live to regret allowing norton and somervell the first crack at the summit would he be returning to england in a weeks time having captained the winning team only to be forever reminded of nortons words no one will remember the name of the second man to climb everest irvine was the first to rise the following morning and immediately set about preparing breakfast for his colleagues george vowed that when he returned home he would never eat another sardine in his life once breakfast had been cleared away irvine lined up the nine oxygen cylinders and like his leader selected the best pair for the final climb george watched as he went about the slow methodical business of tapping cylinders and adjusting knobs and wondered if they would ever be used or simply discarded here on the north col along with their owner odell went off in search of rare rocks and fossils happy to escape into a world of his own in the afternoon the three of them came together to pore over noels photographs of the upper reaches searching for any new piece of information that might assist their attempt to reach the summit they earnestly discussed whether they should follow the ridgeline and tackle the second step headon or simply strike out onto the north face across the limestone slabs of the yellow band and skirt around the second step in truth all three of them knew that the final decision couldnt be made until somervell and norton had returned and were able to pass on the firsthand knowledge that would allow them to fill in so many empty spaces on the map and so many gaps in their knowledge after supper george returned to his tent a drink made from powdered milk in one hand ulysses in the other he fell asleep at page determined to finish joyces masterpiece on the sea voyage back to england the next morning odell rose early and to his colleagues surprise pulled on his rucksack gloves and goggles just off to camp v to make sure the tents still in place he explained as george crawled out of his sleeping bag and i may as well leave them some provisions as theyre sure to be famished george would have laughed at such a casual remark delivered at feet but it was typical of odell to consider the plight of others and not the dangers he might be facing he watched as odell accompanied by two sherpas headed up the mountain as if he was on an afternoon stroll in the cotswolds george was beginning to wonder if odell wouldnt be the best choice to accompany him on the final climb as he seemed to have acclimatized to the conditions far better than any of them had this time himself included odell was back in time for a lunch of two sardines on a wholemeal biscuitwholemeal meant whole mealand he didnt appear to be even out of breath any sign of them george asked before he had pulled off his rucksack no skipper odell replied but then if they reached the summit by midday and returned to spend the night at camp vi i wouldnt expect them to be back at camp v much before two in which case they should be with us some time around four this afternoon just in time for tea george said after a sixminute lunch george returned to ulysses but spent most of his time staring up the mountain waiting for two specks to appear from the wasteland of the north face rather than turning the pages of the novel he checked his watch just after two if they turned up now they could not have reached the summit if they arrived around four the prize must surely be theirs if they had not returned by sixhe tried not to think about it three oclock passed to become four followed by five by which time small talk had been replaced by more serious discussion no one mentioned supper by six the moon had replaced the sun and they were all becoming apprehensive by eight they were beginning to fear the worst i think ill just head back up the north ridge said odell casually and see if theyve decided to bed down for the night ill join you said george leaping up i could do with the exercise he tried to sound as if there was nothing to be worried about but in truth they all knew he was leading a search party me too said irvine dumping his oxygen cylinders in the snow george was grateful for a full moon and a still night with no wind or snow twenty minutes later odell and irvine were fully equipped and ready to accompany him as he set out in search of their colleagues up up up they went george was becoming more despondent with each step he took but he didnt consider turning back even for a moment because they might just be a few feet away from it was irvine who spotted them first but then he had the youngest eyes there they are he shouted pointing up the mountain georges heart leaped when he saw them even if they did resemble two old soldiers limping off a battlefield norton the taller of the two had one arm draped around somervells shoulder the other covering his eyes george moved as quickly as he could up the slope to join them with irvine only a pace behind they each threw an arm under somervells shoulders and almost carried him back across the finishing line norton transferred an arm to odells shoulder the other still covering his eyes mallory and irvine guided somervell into the team tent before lowering him gently to the ground and covering him with a blanket norton followed a moment later and immediately fell to his knees bullock had already prepared two mugs of lukewarm bovril he passed one to somervell as norton eased himself onto a mattress and lay flat on his back no one spoke as they waited for the two men to recover george undid somervells laces and gently pulled off his boots then began to rub his feet to get some circulation back bullock held one of the mugs of bovril to nortons lips but he was unable to take even a sip although george had never believed patience was a virtue he somehow managed to remain silent despite being desperate to know if either of them had reached the summit to everyones surprise it was somervell who spoke first long before we reached the second step he began we decided not to climb it but to skirt round the yellow band a longer route but safer he added between breaths we traversed across it until we came to a massive couloir i thought that if we were able to cross it we could progress all the way to the final pyramid where the gradient would be less demanding our progress was slow but i still believed we had enough time to make it to the top but did you george wanted to ask as somervell sat up and took another sip of now cold bovril that was until we reached feet when my throat started to play up again i began coughing up phlegm and when norton slapped me on the back with all the force he could muster i brought up nearly half my larynx i tried to struggle on but by the time we reached feet i couldnt put one foot in front of the other i had to stop and rest but i could see the peak ahead of me so i insisted that norton carried on i sat there watching him climb toward the summit until he was out of sight george turned to norton and quietly asked did you make it no i didnt said norton because when i stopped to rest i made the classic mistake dont tell me you took your goggles off said george in disbelief how many times have you warned us never to do that in any circumstances said norton as he removed the arm that was covering his eyes by the time i replaced them my eyelids had almost frozen together and i couldnt see a pace in front of me i called out to alert somervell he yodelled to let me know where he was and i slowly made my way back down to join him some glee club said somervell attempting a smile with the aid of my torch we were able to make our way back down if somewhat slowly thank god for somervell said norton as odell placed a handkerchief that hed soaked in warm water over his eyes it was some time before either man spoke again norton drew a deep breath i dont believe that theres ever been a better example of the blind leading the blind this time george did laugh so what height did you reach ive no idea old man norton said and passed his altimeter to mallory george studied the altimeter for a moment before he announced twentyeight thousand one hundred and twentyfive feet many congratulations old chap for failing to climb the final feet said norton sounding desperately disappointed no for making history said george because youve regained the altitude record i cant wait to see finchs face when i tell him its kind of you to say so said norton but finch would be the first to remind me that i should have listened to him and agreed to use oxygen he paused before adding if this weather holds i expect to be nothing more than a footnote in history because if youll forgive the cliché old fellow you should walk it george smiled but made no comment somervell added i agree with norton frankly the best thing you odell and irvine can do is make sure you get a good nights sleep george nodded and although they had all been together for over three months he shook hands with both his colleagues before returning to his own tent to try to capture that good nights sleep he might even have succeeded if one of nortons remarks hadnt remained constantly on his mind if this weather holds chapter fiftyeight june th and then there were three george rose long before dawn to witness a full moon glistening on the snow making it look like a lawn of finely cut diamonds despite the temperature being minus thirty degrees he felt a warm glow and a confidence that they would succeed even if he hadnt made up his mind who they would be did he really need to bother with oxygen after norton and somervell had come so close and hadnt odell proved to be better acclimatized than either of them or would odell once again fall by the wayside just when the prize was within his grasp would irvines inexperience become a liability when they stepped into uncharted territory or perhaps his enthusiasm supported by those blessed oxygen cylinders would be the only thing that would guarantee success good morning sir said a voice behind him george swung around to be greeted by irvines infectious grin good morning sandy he replied shall we go and have some breakfast but its only five oclock said irvine checking his watch in any case odell is still asleep then wake him up said george we must be on our way by six six said irvine but at your final briefing yesterday evening you told us to be up in time for breakfast at eight ready to move off at nine because you didnt want to spend any longer than necessary perched on a ledge at feet six thirty then conceded george if odell isnt up by then well leave without him and while youre at it young man why dont you do something useful for a change like what sir go and make my breakfast the infectious grin returned i can offer you sardines on biscuit lightly grilled sardines off the bone with raisins or the speciality of our tent sardines just get on with it said george mallory odell and irvine accompanied by five sherpas carrying tents equipment and provisions left the north col just after on the morning of june th odell had missed breakfast but he didnt complain guy bullock was the last to shake hands with george before he left see you in a couple of days old friend he said yes keep the kettle boiling as georges old housemaster mr irvinggeorge wondered if he was still aliveused to say you can never start too early only too late george set off like a man possessed at a pace odell and irvine found difficult to match he kept peering suspiciously up at the clear blue sky trying to detect the slightest suggestion of wind the appearance of a single wisp of cloud or the first flake of snow that might alter all his best laid plans but the sky remained resolutely calm and undisturbed however he knew from bitter experience that this particular lady could change her mind in the blink of an eye he also kept a close watch on his two companions to see if either of them appeared to be in any trouble almost hoping that one of them would fall behind and take the final decision out of his hands but as hour succeeded hour he reluctantly concluded that there was nothing to choose between them the party reached camp v a few minutes after three that afternoon well ahead of schedule george checked his watch and tried to make a calculation when hannibal crossed the alps he had always allowed the sun to make such decisions for him should he press on to camp vi and try to save a day or would that result in them being so exhausted that they wouldnt be able to take on the more important challenge ahead he chose caution and decided on an early night so they could set out for camp vi first thing in the morning but who would he set out with which one of them would accompany him to the summit and which would be accompanying the sherpas back to the north col turning in early didnt guarantee a nights sleep for george every hour or so he would wake poke his head out of the tent and check if he could still see stars few others had witnessed with such clarity he could irvine slept like a child and odell even had the nerve to snore george looked across at them while he continued to wrestle with the problem as to who should join him for the final climb should it be odell who after years of dedication had surely earned his chanceprobably his last chance or should it be irvine after all it would only be human for the young man to be dreaming of his place in the sun but if he were not selected he would still have many years ahead of him in which to try again george was certain of only one thing this was his last chance just after four oclock the following morning with the moon still shining peacefully down on them the three men set off again their pace slowed with each hour that passed until it was no more than a shuffle if either odell or irvine was suffering from the experience neither gave the slightest hint of it as they continued doggedly in their leaders footsteps the sun was beginning to set by the time the northeast shoulder came into sight george checked his altimeter feet half an hour and feet later the three of them collapsed exhausted and mightily relieved to find norton and somervells small tent still in place george could no longer put off making his final decision because three men werent going to be able to sleep in that small space and there certainly wasnt enough room on the ridge to pitch a second tent george sat on the ground and scribbled a note to norton to inform him of their progress and that they would attempt the final ascent in the morning he stood up and looked at both silent men before handing the note to odell would you please take this back down to the north col old fellow and see that norton gets it odell betrayed no sign of emotion he simply bowed im sorry old chap added george he was about to explain his reasons when odell said youve made the right decision skipper he shook hands with george and then with the young man he had recommended to the rgs should replace finch as a member of the climbing team good luck he said before turning his back on them to begin the lonely journey down to camp v to spend the night before returning to the north col the following morning and then there were two chapter fiftynine june th my darling im sitting in a tiny tent some feet above sea level and almost miles from my homeland seeking the paths of glory dont you ever sleep asked irvine as he sat up and rubbed his eyes only on the way down said george so by this time tomorrow ill be sound asleep by this time tomorrow theyll be hailing you as the new st george after youve finally slain your personal dragon said irvine adjusting an indicator on one of the oxygen cylinders i dont recall st george having to rely on oxygen when he slew the dragon if hinks had been in charge at the time said irvine st george wouldnt even have been allowed the use of a sword against the spirit of the amateur code dont you know old chap added irvine as he touched an imaginary mustache you must strangle the wretched beast with your bare hands george laughed at irvines plausible imitation of the rgs secretary well if im going to break with the amateur spirit he said ill need to know if your blessed oxygen cylinders will be up and running by four oclock tomorrow morning otherwise ill be sending you back to the north col to ask odell to take your place not a chance said irvine all four of them are in perfect working order which should give us more than enough oxygen assuming you dont plan to take longer than eight hours to cover a mere feet and back youll find out what a mere feet feels like only too soon young man and id have a darn sight better chance of achieving it if you were to go back to sleep so i can finish this letter to my wife you write to mrs mallory every day dont you yes replied george and if youre lucky enough to find someone half as remarkable youll end up feeling exactly the same way i think i already have said irvine lying back down its just that i forgot to tell her before i left so im not absolutely sure if she knows how i feel shell know said george believe me but if youre in doubt you could always drop her a linethats assuming writing is still a form of communication theyre using at oxford george waited for a barbed riposte but none followed as the lad had already fallen back into a deep slumber he smiled and continued his letter to ruth after hed shakily scribbled your loving husband george and sealed the envelope he read grays elegy written in a country churchyard before finally blowing out the candle and falling asleep sunday june th would you like me to remove the scarf old chum asked odell yes please do said norton odell lifted the silk scarf gently off nortons face oh christ i still cant see a thing said norton dont panic said somervell its not unusual for it to take two or three days for your sight to begin to recover following a bout of snow blindness in any case were not going anywhere until mallory comes back down its not down im worried about snapped norton its up odell i want you to return to camp vi and take a jar of bovril and a supply of kendal mint cake with you because you can be sure that mallorys forgotten to pack something im on my way said odell he peered out of the tent ive never known better conditions for climbing george woke a few minutes after four to find irvine preparing breakfast whats on the menu for ascension day he asked as he poked his head out of the tent to check on the weather despite being hit by a blast of cold air that made his ears tingle what he saw brought a smile to his face macaroni and sardines replied irvine an interesting combination said george but i have a feeling it wont make the next edition of mrs beetons cookbook i might have been able to offer you a little more choice said irvine with a grin if youd remembered to pack your rations i do apologize old chap said george mea culpa no skin off my nose said irvine because frankly im far too nervous to even think about eating he pulled on an old flying jacket not unlike the one georges brother trafford had been wearing when hed last visited the holt on leave george wondered how irvine had acquired it because he was far too young to have served in the war my housemasters explained irvine as he did up the buttons answering georges unasked question stop trying to make me feel so old said george irvine laughed ill fix up your oxygen cylinders while youre having breakfast a couple of sardines and a short note to odell and ill be with you outside the tent the morning sun almost blinded irvine as it shone down from a clear blue sky once george had eaten what was left of the sardines having ignored the macaroni he scribbled a quick note to odell and left it on his sleeping bag hed have put money on odell returning to camp vi that day george had slept in four layers of clothes and he now added a thick woolen vest and a woven silk shirt followed by a flannel shirt and another silk shirt he then put on a cotton burberry jacket known as a shackleton smock before pulling on a pair of baggy gabardine trousers he strapped a pair of cashmere puttees around his ankles pulled on his boots and slipped on a pair of woolen mittens that had been knitted by ruth he finally put on his brothers leather flying cap before grabbing the latest pair of goggles donated by finch he was glad there wasnt a mirror available although chomolungma would have agreed that he was correctly dressed for an audience with her majesty george crawled out of the tent to join irvine who helped him on with a set of oxygen cylinders once they were strapped to his back george wondered if the extra weight would prove more of a disadvantage than not being able to breathe regularly but hed made that decision when he sent odell back the last ritual the two men carried out was to smear zinc oxide all over the exposed parts of each others faces before setting off up the mountain they squinted at the summit which looked so close be warned said george shes a jezebel she grows even more alluring the closer you come to her and this morning shes even tempting us with a spell of perfect weather but like any woman its her privilege to change her mind he checked his watch he would have liked to start a little earlier come on young man he said in the words of my beloved father its time to put our best foot forward he adjusted his mouthpiece and turned on the oxygen supply if only hinks could see me now thought odell as he climbed the last few feet to camp vi when he reached the tent he fell on his knees and pulled back the flap to encounter the sort of mess one might expect after having left two children to spend the night in a treehouse a plate of unfinished macaroni an empty sardine tin and a compass that george must have left behind odell chuckled as he crawled in and set about tidying up it wouldnt have been mallorys tent if he hadnt left something behind odell was placing the bovril and a couple of bars of kendal mint cake on georges sleeping bag when he spotted the two envelopesone addressed to mrs george mallory the holt godalming surrey england which he put in an inside pocket and one with his own name scrawled across it he tore the envelope open dear odell awfully sorry to have left things in such a mess perfect weather for the job start looking for us either crossing the rock band or going up the skyline see you tomorrow yours ever george odell smiled and once hed doublechecked that everything was in place for the returning heroes he crawled out of the tent backward then stood and stretched his arms above his head as he looked up at the highest peak in the world the weather was so perfect that for a moment he was even tempted to follow them as he couldnt help feeling a little envious of his two colleagues who must by now be approaching the summit and then suddenly he spotted two figures silhouetted against the skyline as he watched the taller of the two walked across to join the other he could see that they were standing on the second step about feet from the summit he checked his watch they still had more than enough time to reach the top and be back in their little tent before the last rays of sunlight disappeared he couldnt stop himself from leaping up and down with joy as he watched them stride into a cloud of mist and disappear from sight once irvine had reached the top of the second step he clambered over a jagged piece of rock and joined george weve got about another feet to go said george checking his altimeter but remember thats equivalent to at least a mile and without oxygen norton could only manage about feet an hour so it could take us another three hours he added between breaths which means we cant afford to waste any time because when we start back down that rock face later this afternoon he said pointing upward i want to be sure i can still see several feet in front of me as george replaced his mouthpiece irvine gave him the thumbsup sign then they began the slow trek along a ridgeline no man had ever trodden before chapter sixty pm sunday june th when george looked up again it appeared as if the peak was within touching distance despite the altimeter warning him that they still had over feet to climb so breathtakingly close even if it had taken far longer than he had bargained for once they had conquered the second step the two of them chipped pushed and pulled their way slowly up the narrow northeast ridgeline aware that the snow on either side of them was like the eaves of a roof with nothing below but air they would only have to stray a few feet either way and the invitinglooking fresh untrodden snow had turned out to be two feet deep making it almost impossible to take a step forward and when they did their feet only advanced a few inches before sinking once again into the snow two hundred and eleven steps latergeorge counted every one of themand they were finally released from the snowdrift only to be confronted by a sheer rock face that would have been a challenge for him on a warm summers morning at feet let alone when his body was soaked with sweat his limbs almost frozen and he was so exhausted that all he wanted to do was lie down and sleep even though he knew that at minus forty degrees if he was to stay still for more than a few moments he would freeze to death george even considered turning back while there was still a good chance that they would be safely under canvas before sunset but then he would have had to spend the rest of his life explaining why hed let the prize slip from his grasp at the last moment and worse when he fell asleep each night he would dream of climbing those last feet only to wake from the nightmare in a cold sweat he turned around to see an exhausted irvine pulling his foot out of the snow only to stare in disbelief at the rock face that stood in front of them for a moment george hesitated did he have the right to risk irvines life as well as his own should he even now suggest that the young man turn back while he went on alone or rest and wait for him to return he banished the thought from his mind after all irvine had surely earned the right to share the spoils of triumph with him george removed his mouthpiece and said were nearly there old chap this rock will be the last obstacle before we reach the top irvine gave him a thin smile george turned around to face a vertical rock covered with ice that never melted from one year to the next he searched for somewhere he could gain a toehold normally he would place his first step at about eighteen inches perhaps even two feet but not today when a few inches would prove a mountain in itself with a trembling hand he grasped a ledge inches above his head and pulled himself slowly up he lifted a boot and searched for a foothold so he could raise his other arm and progress a few more inches on the vertical journey to the top of the rock he tried not to think what it was going to be like on the way down his brain screamed turn back but the heart whispered carry on forty minutes later he heaved himself up onto the top of the rock and pulled the rope taut to make his colleagues task a little easier once irvine had clambered up to join him george checked the altimeter feet left to climb he looked up this time to be faced with a sheet of ice that had built up over the years into a cornice overhanging the east face which would have prevented even a fourlegged animal with spiked hooves from progressing any further george was trying to secure a foothold when a flash of lightning struck the mountain below him followed moments later by a clap of thunder he assumed they were about to be engulfed by a storm but as he looked down he realized that they were far above the tempest must have been venting its fury on his colleagues some feet below them it was the first time george had viewed a storm from above and he could only hope that by the time they descended it would have moved on leaving in its wake the still clear air that so often follows such anger once again george lifted his boot and tried to gain some purchase on the ice the surface immediately cracked and his heel skidded back down the slope he almost laughed could things get any worse he thrust his axe into the ice in front of him this time it didnt crack quite so easily but when it did he placed a foot in the hole it still slithered back a few inches he didnt laugh when he recalled the saying two paces forward one pace back he was now having to satisfy himself with one foot forward six inches back after a dozen such steps the narrow ridge became even thinner until he had to fall on all fours and begin crawling he didnt look to his left or right because he knew that on both sides of him was a sheer drop of several hundred feet look up ignore everything around you and battle on another yard forward another half yard back just how much could the body endure then suddenly he felt solid rock below him and was able to climb out of the bed of ice and stand on rough stony ground only perhaps feet from the summit he turned around to see an exhausted irvine still on his hands and knees only feet to go he shouted as he untied the rope so that both men could continue at their own pace it was another twenty minutes before george leigh mallory placed a hand his right hand on the summit of everest he pulled himself slowly up onto the top and lay flat on his stomach hardly a moment of triumph was his first thought he pushed himself up onto his knees and then with a supreme effort he somehow managed to stand up the first man to stand on top of the earth he looked across the himalaya admiring a view no man had ever seen before he wanted to leap up and down with joy and shout triumphantly at the top of his voice but he had neither the energy nor the breath to do so instead he turned a slow circle the biting wind which seemed to come at him from every direction did not allow him to move any faster a myriad of unconquered mountains stood proudly around him heads bowed in the presence of their monarch a strange thought crossed his mind he must remember to tell clare that the top of everest was about the same size as their diningroom table george checked his watch pm he tried to convince himself that they had more than enough time to return to the safety of their little tent at camp vi especially if it turned out to be a clear night with no wind he looked back down to see irvine moving ever closer even if it was at a snails pace would he falter at the last step then like a child who couldnt yet walk irvine crawled up onto the summit once george had helped him to his feet he fumbled around in the pocket of his shackleton smock only hoping that he hadnt forgotten what he was looking for his fingers were so numb with cold that he nearly dropped his vest pocket camera over the side once hed steadied himself he took a photograph of irvine arms held high above his head as if hed just won the boat race he passed the kodak to his companion who took a photo of him trying to look as if hed been for a bracing walk in the welsh hills george checked his watch again and frowned he pointed firmly down the mountain irvine placed the camera in a trouser pocket and buttoned up the proof of what they had achieved george was about to take the first step back down when he recalled his promise to ruth with heavy icecovered fingers he clumsily pulled out his wallet and extracted the sepia photograph that he always took with him on every trip he gave his wife one last look and smiled before placing her image on the highest point on earth he put his hand back in his pocket and began rummaging around the king of england sends his compliments maam he said giving a bow and hopes that you will grant his humble subjects safe passage back to their homeland george smiled george cursed hed forgotten to bring geoffrey youngs sovereign chapter sixtyone pm sunday june th when odell arrived back at camp iv he was unable to conceal his excitement he crawled into nortons tent and told him what hed seen about feet from the summit you say said norton still lying flat on his back yes said odell im certain of it they were standing on the second step when i saw one of them walk toward the other before going strong for the top then nothing should stop them now said bullock as he placed a fresh warm cloth over nortons eyes lets hope youre right said somervell but i still think it would be wise for odell to write down the details of everything he saw while theyre fresh in his mind it might turn out to be significant when the history of the expedition is written odell crawled across to his rucksack and took out his diary he sat in a corner of the tent and for the next twenty minutes wrote down everything he had witnessed that morning exactly where hed seen the two figures the time at which they continued up the mountain and the fact that they appeared to be in no difficulty as they disappeared into the mist when hed finished he checked his watch pm were mallory and irvine safely back in their tent at camp vi having stood on top of the earth once theyd roped up georges first thought as he stepped off the summit of everest was to wonder how long his oxygen would last irvine had joked about them not taking more than eight hours but they must surely be approaching that deadline his second thought was to wonder how many hours were left in the suns rays because that was something you couldnt alter with the twiddling of a valve finally he hoped it would be a clear night which would allow the moon to accompany them on the last steps of their journey home he was surprised to find that once they had attained the prize the rush of adrenaline had deserted him and all he had left was the will to survive after covering a mere feet george wanted to sit down and rest but with his body so fatigued and racked with pain he knew that if he closed his eyes even for a moment he might never open them again he jabbed his ice axe into the cracked surface took a step backward and immediately felt the rope tighten irvine must be finding the journey down even more difficult than he was if that was possible george tentatively placed his left foot back onto the icy slope that was now even more treacherous than before he tried to take advantage of the finger and toeholds hed left behind on the way up but they were already icing over despite losing his balance and falling on his backside several times he managed to keep moving until he had safely reached the patch of stony ground only to find himself once again standing above a sheer icy rock face this time looking down george knew that this would be the most dangerous part of the climb and he had to assume that irvine was in an even worse state than he was if either of them made the slightest error they would both tumble to their deaths he turned to his companion and smiled for the first time irvine did not return his smile george gripped the top of the rock with both hands and slowly lowered himself a few inches searching for the slightest indentation that might secure a toehold once his toe had found a step he lowered his other leg suddenly he felt the rope go slack he looked up to see that irvine had lost his grip on an icy ledge and was falling backward his body passed george a moment later george knew that he couldnt hope to cling on to an icy vertical rock face while the sixfoottwoinch pound man to whom he was roped was falling through the air an instant later he was pulled off the rock he didnt even have a chance to think about death as he followed irvine down down down a second later they both landed in the two feet of thick snow that had so bedeviled them on the way up and which now acted as a cushion to save their lives after a brief stunned silence they both began laughing like two naughty schoolboys whod fallen out of a tree and were buried in christmas snow george rose slowly and checked his limbs he stood unsteadily pleased to see irvine already on his feet the two men collapsed into each others arms and george began slapping his young colleague on the back he finally released him and gave irvine the thumbsup before once again setting off down the mountain george knew nothing was going to stop him now chapter sixtytwo monday june th when odell rose at five the following morning the first thing he saw was noel setting up his tripod on a small flat ridge the massive lens of his camera was pointing in the direction of camp vi ready to roll at the slightest sign of life a moment later norton crawled out to join them good morning odell he said cheerfully i confess that for the moment youre no more than a blur but at least i can tell the difference between you and noeljust thats good news said noel because i hope it wont be too long before we see george and sandy coming over the skyline dont count on it said norton mallorys never been an early riser and i expect young irvine will still be fast asleep i cant hang around waiting for them any longer said odell im going up to cook them some breakfast and then ill escort them back down in triumph before you leave old man said noel once you get up there would you do something for me odell turned to face him could you drag their sleeping bags out of the tent and lay them side by side in the snow and then well know they reached the summit and if they didnt he paused or worse place the bags in the sign of a cross said noel quietly odell nodded pulled on his rucksack and began the climb back to camp vi for the second time in three days but this time the weather was becoming worse by the minute within moments he was battling against a savage wind that was whipping down the valley a clear warning that within hours the monsoon would be upon them he kept looking up anxiously hoping to see his two triumphant colleagues on their way down as he came closer and closer to camp vi he tried to dismiss from his mind the thought that they might have come to any harm but when he finally spotted the small tent it was covered in a layer of fresh snow with no telltale footprints in sight and its green canvas flapping in the wind odell attempted to quicken his pace but it was pointless because his heavy boots just sank deeper and deeper into the fresh snow until it felt as if he was treading water he finally gave up fell on his knees and began to crawl the last few feet toward the tent he poked his head inside and took off his goggles hoping to see an untidy mess left by two exhausted men who were fast asleep but in truth he already knew that was wishful thinking he stared in disbelief odell would tell his friends for many years to come that it was like looking at a stilllife painting the sleeping bags had not been slept in the jar of bovril was unopened and the bars of kendal mint cake had not been unwrapped while beside them stood a candle that had not been relit odell put on his goggles and backed out of the tent he pushed himself up off his knees and looked up toward the mountain peak but could no longer see more than a few feet in front of him he screamed george sandy at the top of his voice but the lashing wind and drifting snow beat his words back he kept on shouting until his voice was just a whimper and he could barely hear himself above the noise of the gale he finally gave up but not until he accepted that his own life was in danger he crawled back toward the tent and reluctantly pulled out one sleeping bag and placed it on the side of the mountain someones dragging out one of the sleeping bags announced noel whats the message cried norton not sure yet ah hes dragging the other one out now noel focused on the moving figure is it george shouted norton looking hopefully up the mountain a hand shielding his eyes from the driving snow noel didnt reply he just bowed his head somervell shuffled across the ridge as quickly as he could and took noels place behind the camera he peered through the viewfinder the whole lens was filled with the sign of a cross epilogue he who would valiant be gainst all disaster if george leigh mallory had been surprised by the reception he received on returning to england following the expedition what would he have made of the memorial service that was held in st pauls cathedral in his honor no body no casket no grave yet thousands of ordinary citizens had traveled the length and breadth of the land to line the streets and pay homage let him in constancy follow the master his majesty the king the prince of wales the duke of connaught and prince arthur were all represented with the prime minister ramsay macdonald the former foreign secretary lord curzon the lord mayor of london and the mayor of birkenhead in attendance theres no discouragement shall make him once relent general bruce stood at the east end of the cathedral and lined up lieutenant colonel norton dr somervell professor odell major bullock major morshead captain noel and geoffrey young to form the guard of honor they carried silver ice axes under their right arms as they followed the dean of st pauls down the nave past the crowded pews and took their places in the front row next to sir francis younghusband mr hinks mr raeburn and commander ashcroft who were there to represent the royal geographical society his first avowed intent to be a pilgrim when the bishop of chester mounted the pulpit steps to address the packed congregation he opened his eulogy by trying to articulate the peoples feelings of affection and admiration for the two lads from birkenhead who on ascension day had captured the imagination of the world we will never know he went on to say if together they reached the summit of that great mountain but who among us can doubt that if the prize was within his grasp george mallory would have battled on whatever the odds and that young sandy irvine would have followed him to the ends of the earth ruth mallory who was seated in the front row on the other side of the aisle was in no doubt that her husband wouldnt have turned back if there was even the slightest possibility of achieving his wildest dream nor did the reverend herbert leigh mallory who sat beside his daughterinlaw hugh thackeray turner seated on the other side of his daughter would go to his grave without offering an opinion who so beset him round with dismal stories after the dean of st pauls had given the blessing and the captains and the kings had departed ruth stood alone by the north door shaking hands with friends and wellwishers many of whom told her how their lives had been enriched by this gallant and courageous gentleman she smiled when she saw george finch waiting in line to speak to her he was dressed in a dark gray suit white shirt and black tie that looked as if they were being worn for the first time he bowed as he shook her hand ruth leaned forward and whispered in his ear if it had been you who was climbing with george he might still be alive today finch didnt voice his longheld opinion that had he been invited to join the expedition he and mallory would surely have reached the summit together and more important returned home safely although finch accepted that if they had been in any trouble mallory might have ignored his advice and carried on leaving him to return alone do but themselves confound his strength the more is at last ruths father felt the time had come to take his daughter home despite the fact that so many mourners still wished to pay their respects on the drive back to godalming hardly a word passed between them but then ruth had lost the only man she had ever loved and old gentlemen do not expect to attend the funerals of their sonsinlaw as they passed through the gates of the holt ruth thanked her father for his kindness and understanding but asked if she could be left alone to grieve he reluctantly departed and returned to westbrook no foes shall stay his might though he with giants fight when ruth opened the front door the first thing she saw lying on the mat was an envelope addressed to her in georges unmistakable hand she picked it up painfully aware that it must be his last letter she walked through to the drawing room and poured herself what george would have called a stiff whiskey before taking her seat in the winged chair by the window she looked up at the driveway somehow still expecting george to come striding through the gates and take her in his arms he will make good his right to be a pilgrim ruth tore open the envelope took out the letter and began to read her husbands last words june th my darling im sitting in a tiny tent some feet above sea level and almost miles from my homeland seeking the paths of glory even if i were to find them it would be as nothing if i am unable to share the moment with you i should not have needed to travel halfway round the world to discover that without you i am nothing as many less fortunate men with envy in their eyes have oft reminded me and they do not know the half ask any one of them what he would sacrifice for that first moment of passion to last a lifetime and he would tell you half his days because no such woman exists they are wrong i have found that woman and nothing will ever take her place certainly not this icecold virgin that slumbers above me some men boast of their conquests the truth is ive had but one as i loved you from the moment i first saw you you are my waking morning you are my setting sun and if that were not enough i still marvel at my good fortune for i have been thrice blessed the first blessing came on the day you became my wife and agreed to share the rest of your life with me that night you became my lover and since have become my closest friend the second blessing came when you unselfishly encouraged me to fulfill my wildest dream always allowing my head to remain in the clouds while you somehow managed with wisdom and common sense to keep your feet firmly on the ground and thrice you have blessed me with a wonderful family who continue to bring unending joy to my life although there are never enough minutes in each day to share their laughter and brush away their tears i often regret depriving myself of so much of their brief years of childhood clare will follow me to cambridge where she will not only outwit untested men but when put to the test herself will surely succeed where i failed beridge has been gifted with your grace and charm growing daily in your image so that when she blossoms into a woman many men will bend low to seek her hand but for me none will be worthy and as for little john i cannot wait to read his first school report watch his first football match and be by his side when he has to face up to what he imagines to be his first disaster my darling there is so much more that i want to say but my hand grows shaky and the flickering candle reminds me that i still have some purpose on the morrow when i intend to place your photograph on the highest point on earth so that i might exorcise this demon forever and finally return to the only woman i have ever loved i can see you at the holt sitting in your winged chair by the window reading this letter and smiling as you turn each page look up my darling for at any moment you will see me march through those gates and come striding down the path toward you will you leap up and rush to greet me so that i can take you in my arms and never leave your side again forgive me for having taken so long to realize that you are more important to me than life itself your loving husband george at the same time every day for the rest of her life ruth mallory would sit in the winged chair by the window and reread her husbands letter on her deathbed she told her children that not a day had passed when she hadnt seen george march through those gates and come striding down the path toward her post george leigh mallory georges body was discovered on may st at feet the photo of his wife ruth was not in his wallet and there was no sign of
