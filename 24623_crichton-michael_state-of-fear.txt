michael crichton state of fear there is something fascinating about science one gets such wholesale returns of conjecture out of such a trifling investment of fact mark twain within any important issue there are always aspects no one wishes to discuss george orwell introduction in late at the sustainable earth summit conference in johannesburg the pacific island nation of vanutu announced that it was preparing a lawsuit against the environmental protection agency of the united states over global warming vanutu stood only a few feet above sea level and the islands eight thousand inhabitants were in danger of having to evacuate their country because of rising sea levels caused by global warming the united states the largest economy in the world was also the largest emitter of carbon dioxide and therefore the largest contributor to global warming the national environmental resource fund an american activist group announced that it would join forces with vanutu in the lawsuit which was expected to be filed in the summer of it was rumored that wealthy philanthropist george morton who frequently backed environmental causes would personally finance the suit expected to cost more than million since the suit would ultimately be heard by the sympathetic ninth circuit in san francisco the litigation was awaited with some anticipation but the lawsuit was never filed no official explanation for the failure to file has ever been given either by vanutu or nerf even after the sudden disappearance of george morton an inexplicable lack of interest by the media has left the circumstances surrounding this lawsuit unexamined not until the end of did several former nerf board members begin to speak publicly about what had happened within that organization further revelations by mortons staff as well as by former members of the los angeles law firm of hassle and black have added further detail to the story thus it is now clear what happened to the progress of the vanutu litigation between may and october of and why so many people died in remote parts of the world as a result mc los angeles from the internal report to the national security council nsc from the aasbc classified redacted portions from aasbc obtained foia in retrospect the conspiracy was extremely wellplanned preparations were under for more than a year before the events themselves took place there were preliminary as early as march and reports to the britishand the german the first incident took place in paris in may of it isthat the authorities but there now can be no doubt that what happened in paris and the serious consequences that followed i akamai paris nord sunday may pm in the darkness he touched her arm and said stay here she did not move just waited the smell of salt water was strong she heard the faint gurgle of water then the lights came on reflecting off the surface of a large open tank perhaps fifty meters long and twenty meters wide it might have been an indoor swimming pool except for all the electronic equipment that surrounded it and the very strange device at the far end of the pool jonathan marshall came back to her grinning like an idiot questce que tu penses he said though he knew his pronunciation was terrible what do you think it is magnificent the girl said when she spoke english her accent sounded exotic in fact everything about her was exotic jonathan thought with her dark skin high cheekbones and black hair she might have been a model and she strutted like a model in her short skirt and spike heels she was half vietnamese and her name was marisa but no one else is here she said looking around no no he said its sunday no one is coming jonathan marshall was twentyfour a graduate student in physics from london working for the summer at the ultramodern laboratoire ondulatoirethe wave mechanics laboratoryof the french marine institute in vissy just north of paris but the suburb was mostly the residence of young families and it had been a lonely summer for marshall which was why he could not believe his good fortune at meeting this girl this extraordinarily beautiful and sexy girl show me what it does this machine marisa said her eyes were shining show me what it is you do my pleasure marshall said he moved to the large control panel and began to switch on the pumps and sensors the thirty panels of the wave machine at the far end of the tank clicked one after another he glanced back at her and she smiled at him it is so complicated she said she came and stood beside him at the control panel your research is recorded on cameras yes we have cameras in the ceiling and on the sides of the tank they make a visual record of the waves that are generated we also have pressure sensors in the tanks that record pressure parameters of the passing wave these cameras are on now no no he said we dont need them were not doing an experiment perhaps we are she said resting her hand on his shoulder her fingers were long and delicate she had beautiful fingers she watched for a minute then said this room everything is so expensive you must have great security no not really he said just cards to get in and only one security camera he gestured over his shoulder that one back in the corner she turned to look and that is turned on she said oh yes he said thats always on she slid her hand to caress his neck lightly so is someone watching us now afraid so then we should behave probably anyway what about your boyfriend him she gave a derisive snort i have had enough of him earlier that day marshall had gone from his small apartment to the cafй on rue montaigne the cafй he went to every morning taking a journal article with him to read as usual then this girl had sat down at the next table with her boyfriend the couple had promptly fallen into an argument in truth marshall felt that marisa and the boyfriend didnt seem to belong together he was american a beefy redfaced fellow built like a footballer with longish hair and wireframe glasses that did not suit his thick features he looked like a pig trying to appear scholarly his name was jim and he was angry with marisa apparently because she had spent the previous night away from him i dont know why you wont tell me where you were he kept repeating it is none of your business thats why but i thought we were going to have dinner together jimmy i told you we were not no you told me you were and i was waiting at the hotel for you all night so no one made you you could go out enjoy yourself but i was waiting for you jimmy you do not own me she was exasperated by him sighing throwing up her hands or slapping her bare knees her legs were crossed and the short skirt rode up high i do as i please thats clear yes she said and at that moment she turned to marshall and said what is that you are reading it looks very complicated at first marshall was alarmed she was clearly talking to him to taunt the boyfriend he did not want to be drawn into the couples dispute its physics he said briefly and turned slightly away he tried to ignore her beauty what kind of physics she persisted wave mechanics ocean waves so you are a student graduate student ah and clearly intelligent you are english why are you in france and before he knew it he was talking to her and she introduced the boyfriend who gave marshall a smirk and a limp handshake it was still very uncomfortable but the girl behaved as if it were not so you work around here what sort of work a tank with a machine really i cant imagine what you say will you show me and now they were here in the wave mechanics laboratory and jimmy the boyfriend was sulking in the parking lot outside smoking a cigarette what shall we do about jimmy she said standing beside marshall while he worked at the control panel he cant smoke in here i will see that he does not but i dont want to make him more angry can i let him in do you think marshall felt disappointment flood through him sure i guess then she squeezed his shoulder dont worry he is busy later with other business of his she went and opened the door at the back of the lab and jimmy came in marshall glanced back and saw him hanging back hands in his pockets marisa came up to stand beside marshall again at the control panel hes all right she said now show me the electric motors at the far end of the tank whirred and the wave paddles generated the first wave it was a small wave and it rippled smoothly down the length of the tank to splash on a slanted panel at the near end so this is a tidal wave she said it is a simulation of a tsunami yes marshall said his fingers tapping the keyboard on the control panel displays showed temperature and pressure generated falsecolor images of the wave a simulation she said meaning what we can make waves up to one meter high in this tank marshall said but the real tsunamis are four eight ten meters high occasionally even more a wave in the ocean that is ten meters her eyes widened really she was looking toward the ceiling trying to imagine it marshall nodded that would be over thirty feet high the height of a threestory building and it would be moving at eight hundred kilometers an hour roaring up to the shore and when it comes to the shore she said is that the slope at this end it looks like a pebble texture on it is that the shore thats right marshall said how high the wave goes up the shore is a function of the angle of the slope we can adjust the slope to any angle the boyfriend came forward moving closer to the tank but still he hung back he never said a word marisa was excited you can adjust it how it is motorized to any angle she giggled show me vingtsept degrees twentyseven coming up marshall typed at the keyboard with a slight grinding sound the slope of the shore angled higher the american boyfriend went closer to the tank to look drawn by the activity it was fascinating marshall thought anybody would be interested but the guy never spoke he just stood and watched the pebbled surface tilt soon it stopped so that is the slope she said yes marshall said although in point of fact twentyseven degrees is fairly steep more than the average shoreline in the real world maybe i should set it to her dark hand closed over his no no she said her skin was soft leave it show me a wave i want to see a wave small waves were being generated every thirty seconds they rippled along the length of the tank with a slight whoosh well i first have to know the shape of the shoreline right now its flat beach but if it was an inlet of some kind amp will it change to make an inlet of course really show me what kind of inlet do you want a harbor a river a bay amp oh she said shrugging make a bay he smiled fine how big with the whir of electric motors the shoreline began to sink into a curve the slope indenting into a bowl fantastic she said come on jonathan show me the wave not yet how big is the bay oh amp she gestured in the air one mile a bay of one mile now will you show me she leaned toward him i do not like to wait you should know this he smelled her perfume he typed quickly here it comes he said a big wave coming into a onemile bay with a twentysevendegree slope there was a much louder whoosh as the next wave was generated at the far end of the tank and then it rippled smoothly toward them a raised line of water about six inches high oh marisa pouted you promised me it would be big just wait he said it will grow she said giggling she put her hand on his shoulder again then the american glanced back and gave her a dirty look she jerked her chin in the air defiant but when he looked back at the tank she took her hand away marshall felt despondent again she was just using him he was a pawn in this game between them you said it will grow she said yes marshall said the wave will grow as it comes to the shore in deep water a tsunami is small but in shallow water it builds and the inlet will concentrate its power so it goes higher the wave rose higher and then smashed against the curved shore at the near end it foamed white and sloshed up the sides of the shore it came up about five feet he guessed so it comes high she said in the real world thats about forty fifty feet he said fifteen meters ooh la la she said pursing her lips so a person cannot run away from this oh no marshall said you cant outrun a tidal wave there was a wave in hilo hawaii in came right down the streets of the town tall as the buildings people ran from it but so thats it the american said thats all it does his voice was growly like he needed to clear his throat dont mind him she said quietly yes thats what we do here marshall said we generate waves jesus fucking a the american said i could do that in my bathtub when i was six months old well marshall said gesturing to the control panel and the monitors displaying data we generate a lot of databases for researchers around the world who are yeah yeah thats enough boring as whale shit im leaving you coming marisa or not he stood and glared at her marshall heard her suck in her breath no she said i am not the american turned and walked off slamming the door loudly as he left her apartment was just across the river from notre dame and from the balcony in the bedroom he had a beautiful view of the cathedral which was lighted at night it was ten oclock but there was still a deep blue in the sky he looked down at the street below the lights of the cafйs the crowds walking on the streets it was a busy and glamorous scene dont worry she said behind him if youre looking for jimmy he wont come here actually the thought hadnt occurred to him until she mentioned it no no she said he will go elsewhere jimmy has many women she took a sip of red wine then set the glass down on the bedside table unceremoniously she pulled her top over her head and dropped her skirt she was wearing nothing beneath still in her high heels she walked toward him he must have seemed surprised because she said i told you i do not like to wait and threw her arms around him and kissed him hard fiercely almost angrily the next moments were awkward trying to kiss while she tore off his clothes she was breathing hard almost panting she never spoke she was so passionate she seemed almost angry and her beauty the physical perfection of her dark body intimidated him but not for long afterward she lay against him her skin soft but her body taut beneath the surface the bedroom ceiling had a soft glow from the church faзade opposite he was relaxed but she seemed if anything to be energized restless after making love he wondered if she had really come despite her moans and her final cries and then abruptly she got up anything wrong she took a sip of wine to the toilet she said and turned away passing through a door she had left her wineglass he sat up and took a sip seeing the delicate pattern of her lipstick on the rim he looked at the bed and saw the dark streaks on the sheets from her heels she had not taken them off until midway through their lovemaking now the heels were tossed away coming to a stop beneath the window signs of their passion he still felt even now as if he were in a dream he had never been with a woman like this beautiful like this living in a place like this he wondered how much this apartment cost the wood paneling the perfect location amp he took another sip of wine he could get used to this he thought he heard water running in the bathroom a humming sound a tuneless song with a bang the front door slammed open and three men burst into the bedroom they were wearing dark raincoats and hats terrified marshall set the wineglass on the tableit felland dived for his clothes beside the bed to cover himself but in an instant the men were on him grabbing him with gloved hands he yelled in alarm and panic as they threw him over shoving him facedown on the bed he was still yelling as they pushed his face into a pillow he thought they were going to suffocate him but they didnt one man hissed be quiet nothing will happen if you are quiet he didnt believe him so he struggled calling out again where was marisa what was she doing it was happening so fast one man was sitting on his back knees digging into his spine his cold shoes on marshalls bare buttocks he felt the mans hand on his neck shoving him into the bed be quiet the man hissed again the other men had each taken one of his wrists and they were pulling his arms wide spreadeagling him on the bed they were getting ready to do something to him he felt terrified and vulnerable he moaned and somebody hit him on the back of the head quiet everything was happening quickly it was all impressionistic where was marisa probably hiding in the bathroom and he couldnt blame her he heard a sloshing sound and saw a plastic baggie and something white in it like a golf ball they were placing the baggie under his armpit on the fleshy part of his arm what the hell were they doing he felt the water cold against his underarm and he struggled but they held him tight and then inside the water something soft pressed against the arm and he had a sticky sensation like sticky chewing gum something sticky and tugging against the flesh of his arm and then he felt a little pinch nothing hardly noticeable a momentary sting the men were moving quickly the baggie was removed and at that moment he heard two surprisingly loud gunshots and marisa was screaming in rapid frenchsalaud salopard bougetoi le culand the third man had tumbled off marshalls back and fallen to the ground then scrambled up and marisa was still screaming there were more shots and he could smell powder in the air and the men fled the door slammed and she came back stark naked babbling in french he could not understand something about vacherie which he thought was a cow but he wasnt thinking straight he was starting to tremble on the bed she came over and threw her arms around him the barrel of the gun was hot and he yelled and she set it aside oh jonathan i am so sorry so sorry she cradled his head against her shoulder please you must forgive me it is all right now i promise you gradually his trembling stopped and she looked at him did they hurt you he shook his head no good i did not think so idiots friends of jimmy they think they make a joke to scare you and me i am sure but you are not hurt he shook his head again he coughed perhaps he said finding his voice at last perhaps i should be going oh no she said no no you cannot do this to me i dont feel absolutely no she said she pushed closer to him so her body was touching his you must stay a while should we call the police mais non the police will do nothing a quarrel of lovers in france we do not do this call the police but they broke in amp they are gone now she said whispering in his ear he felt her breath there is only us now only us jonathan her dark body slid down his chest it was after midnight when he was finally dressed and standing at the window looking out at notre dame the streets were still crowded why will you not stay she said pouting prettily i want you to stay dont you want to please me im sorry he said i have to go i dont feel very well i will make you feel better he shook his head in truth he really did not feel well he was experiencing waves of dizziness and his legs felt oddly weak his hands were trembling as he gripped the balcony im sorry he said again i have to leave all right then i will drive you her car he knew was parked on the other side of the seine it seemed far to walk but he just nodded numbly all right he said she was in no rush they strolled arm in arm like lovers along the embankment they passed the houseboat restaurants tied up to the side brightly lit still busy with guests above them on the other side of the river rose notre dame brilliantly lit for a while this slow walk with her head on his shoulder the soft words she spoke to him made him feel better but soon he stumbled feeling a kind of clumsy weakness coursing through his body his mouth was very dry his jaw felt stiff it was difficult to speak she did not seem to notice they had moved past the bright lights now under one of the bridges and he stumbled again this time he fell on the stone embankment my darling she said worried and solicitous and helped him to his feet he said i think ampi think amp darling are you all right she helped him to a bench away from the river here just sit here for a moment you will feel better in a moment but he did not feel better he tried to protest but he could not speak in horror he realized he could not even shake his head something was very wrong his whole body was growing weak swiftly and astonishingly weak and he tried to push up from the bench but he could not move his limbs he could not move his head he looked at her sitting beside him jonathan what is wrong do you need a doctor yes i need a doctor he thought jonathan this is not right amp his chest was heavy he was having trouble breathing he looked away staring straight ahead he thought in horror i am paralyzed jonathan he tried to look at her but now he could not even move his eyes he could only look straight forward his breathing was shallow jonathan i need a doctor jonathan can you look at me can you no you cannot turn your head somehow her voice did not sound concerned she sounded detached clinical perhaps his hearing was affected there was a rushing sound in his ears it was harder and harder to breathe all right jonathan lets get you away from here she ducked her head under his arm and with surprising strength got him to his feet his body was loose and floppy sagging around her he could not control where he looked he heard the clicking of footsteps approaching and thought thank god he heard a mans voice say in french mademoiselle do you need help thank you but no she said just too much to drink are you sure he does this all the time yes i can manage ah then i wish you bonne nuit bonne nuit she said she continued on her way carrying him the footsteps became fainter then she paused turned to look in all directions and now ampshe was moving him toward the river you are heavier than i thought she said in a conversational tone he felt a deep and profound terror he was completely paralyzed he could do nothing his own feet were scraping over the stone toward the river i am sorry she said and she dropped him into the water it was a short fall and a stunning sense of cold he plunged beneath the surface surrounded by bubbles and green then black he could not move even in the water he could not believe this was happening to him he could not believe that he was dying this way then slowly he felt his body rise green water again and then he broke the surface on his back turning slowly he could see the bridge and the black sky and marisa standing on the embankment she lit a cigarette and stared at him she had one hand on her hip one leg thrust forward a models pose she exhaled smoke rising in the night then he sank beneath the surface again and he felt the cold and the blackness close in around him at three oclock in the morning the lights snapped on in the laboratoire ondulatoire of the french marine institute in vissy the control panel came to life the wave machine began to generate waves that rolled down the tank one after another and crashed against the artificial shore the control screens flashed threedimensional images scrolled columns of data the data was transmitted to an unknown location somewhere in france at four oclock the control panel went dark and the lights went out and the hard drives erased any record of what had been done pahang tuesday may am the twisting jungle road lay in shadow beneath the canopy of the malay rain forest the paved road was very narrow and the land cruiser careened around the corners tires squealing in the passenger seat a bearded man of forty glanced at his watch how much farther just a few minutes the driver said not slowing were almost there the driver was chinese but he spoke with a british accent his name was charles ling and he had flown over from hong kong to kuala lumpur the night before he had met his passenger at the airport that morning and they had been driving at breakneck speed ever since the passenger had given ling a card that read allan peterson seismic services calgary ling didnt believe it he knew perfectly well that there was a company in alberta els engineering that sold this equipment it wasnt necessary to come all the way to malaysia to see it not only that but ling had checked the passenger manifest on the incoming flight and there was no allan peterson listed so this guy had come in on a different name furthermore he told ling he was a field geologist doing independent consulting for energy companies in canada mostly evaluating potential oil sites but ling didnt believe that either you could spot those petroleum engineers a mile off this guy wasnt one so ling didnt know who the guy was it didnt bother him mr petersons credit was good the rest was none of lings business he had only one interest today and that was to sell cavitation machines and this looked like a big sale peterson was talking about three units more than a million dollars in total he turned off the road abruptly onto a muddy rut they bounced through the jungle beneath huge trees and suddenly came out into sunlight and a large opening there was a huge semicircular gash in the ground exposing a cliff of gray earth a green lake lay below whats this peterson said wincing it was openface mine abandoned now kaolin which is amp ling thought this is no geologist he explained that kaolin was a mineral in clay its used in paper and ceramics lot of industrial ceramics now they make ceramic knives incredibly sharp theyll make ceramic auto engines soon but the quality here was too low it was abandoned four years ago peterson nodded and where is the cavitator ling pointed toward a large truck parked at the edge of the cliff there he drove toward it russians make it the vehicle and the carbonmatrix frame are russian made the electronics come from taiwan we assemble ourselves in kuala lumpur and is this your biggest model no this is the intermediate we dont have the largest one to show you they pulled alongside the truck it was the size of a large earthmover the cab of the land cruiser barely reached above the huge tires in the center hanging above the ground was a large rectangular cavitation generator looking like an oversize diesel generator a boxy mass of pipes and wires the curved cavitation plate was slung underneath a few feet above the ground they climbed out of the car into sweltering heat lings eyeglasses clouded over he wiped them on his shirt peterson walked around the truck can i get the unit without the truck yes we make transportable units seagoing containers but usually clients want them mounted on vehicles eventually i just want the units peterson said are you going to demonstrate right away ling said he gestured to the operator high up in the cab perhaps we should step away wait a minute peterson said suddenly alarmed i thought we were going to be alone who is that thats my brother ling said smoothly hes very trustworthy well amp lets step away ling said we can see better from a distance the cavitation generator fired up chugging loudly soon the noise blended with another sound a deep humming that ling always seemed to feel in his chest in his bones peterson must have felt it too because he moved back hastily these cavitation generators are hypersonic ling explained producing a radially symmetric cavitation field that can be adjusted for focal point rather like an optical lens except we are using sound in other words we can focus the sound beam and control how deep the cavitation will occur he waved to the operator who nodded the cavitation plate came down until it was just above the ground the sound changed becoming deeper and much quieter the earth vibrated slightly where they were standing jesus peterson said stepping back not to worry ling said this is just lowgrade reflection the main energy vector is orthogonal directed straight down about forty feet below the truck the walls of the canyon suddenly seemed to blur to become indistinct small clouds of gray smoke obscured the surface for a moment and then a whole section of cliff gave way and rumbled down into the lake below like a gray avalanche the whole area filled with smoke and dust as it began to clear ling said now we will show how the beam is focused the rumbling began again and this time the cliff blurred much farther down two hundred feet or more once again the gray sand gave way this time sliding rather quietly into the lake and it can focus laterally as well peterson said ling said it could a hundred yards north of the truck the cliff was shaken free and again tumbled down we can aim it in any direction and any depth any depth our big unit will focus at a thousand meters although no client has any use for such depths no no peterson said we dont need anything like that but we want beam power he wiped his hands on his trousers ive seen enough really we have quite a few other techniques to demon im ready to go back behind his sunglasses his eyes were unreadable very well ling said if you are sure im sure driving back peterson said you ship from kl or hong kong from kl with what restrictions ling said how do you mean hypersonic cavitation technology in the us is restricted it cant be exported without a license as i said we use taiwanese electronics is it as reliable as the us technology ling said virtually identical if peterson knew his business he would know that the us had long ago lost the capacity to manufacture such advanced chipsets the us cavitation chipsets were manufactured in taiwan why do you ask are you planning to export to the us no then there is no difficulty whats your lead time peterson said we need seven months i was thinking of five it can be done there will be a premium for how many units three peterson said ling wondered why anyone would need three cavitation units no geological survey company in the world owned more than one i can fill that order ling said upon receipt of your deposit you will have it wired to you tomorrow and we are shipping where canada you will receive shipping instructions peterson said in five months directly ahead the curved spans of the ultramodern airport designed by kurokawa rose into the sky peterson had lapsed into silence driving up the ramp ling said i hope we are in time for your flight what oh yes were fine youre heading back to canada yes ling pulled up at the international terminal got out and shook petersons hand peterson shouldered his day bag it was his only luggage well peterson said id better go safe flight thank you you too back to hong kong no ling said i have to go to the factory and get them started its nearby yes in pudu raya just a few kilometers all right then peterson disappeared inside the terminal giving a final wave ling got back in the car and drove away but as he was heading down the ramp he saw that peterson had left behind his cell phone on the car seat he pulled over to the curb glancing back over his shoulder but peterson was gone and the cell phone in his hand was lightweight made of cheap plastic it was one of those prepaidcard phones the disposable ones it couldnt be petersons main phone it occurred to ling that he had a friend who might be able to trace the phone and the card inside it find out more about the purchaser and ling would like to know more so he slipped the phone into his pocket and drove north to the factory shad thames friday may am richard mallory looked up from his desk and said yes the man standing in the doorway was palecomplected slender and americanlooking with a blond crew cut his manner was casual his dress nondescript dirty adidas running shoes and a faded navy tracksuit he looked as if he might be out for a jog and had stopped by the office for a moment and since this was designquest a hot graphics shop located on butlers wharf a refurbished warehouse district below londons tower bridge most of the employees in the office were casually dressed mallory was the exception since he was the boss he wore slacks and a white shirt and wingtip shoes that hurt his feet but they were hip mallory said can i help you ive come for the package the american said im sorry what package mallory said if its a dhl pickup the secretary has it up front the american looked annoyed dont you think youre overdoing it he said just give me the fucking package okay fine mallory said getting up from behind the desk apparently the american felt he had been too harsh because in a quieter tone he said nice posters and pointed to the wall behind mallory you do em we did mallory said our firm there were two posters side by side on the wall both stark black with a hanging globe of the earth in space differing only in the tag line one said save the earth and beneath it its the only home we have the other said save the earth and beneath that theres nowhere else to go then off to one side was a framed photograph of a blond model in a tshirt save the earth and the copy line was and look good doing it that was our save the earth campaign mallory said but they didnt buy it who didnt international conservation fund he went past the american and headed down the back stairs to the garage the american followed why not they didnt like it no they liked it mallory said but they got leo as a spokesman and used him instead campaign went to video spots at the bottom of the stairs he swiped his card and the door unlocked with a click they stepped into the small garage beneath the building it was dark except for the glare of daylight from the ramp leading to the street mallory noticed with annoyance that a van partly blocked the ramp they always had trouble with delivery vans parking there he turned to the american you have a car yes a van he pointed oh good so thats yours and somebody to help you no just me why its bloody heavy mallory said it may just be wire but its half a million feet of it weighs seven hundred pounds mate i can handle it mallory went to his rover and unlocked the boot the american whistled and the van rumbled down the ramp it was driven by a toughlooking woman with spiked hair dark makeup mallory said i thought you were alone she doesnt know anything the american said forget her she brought the van she just drives mallory turned to the open boot there were stacked white boxes marked ethernet cable unshielded and printed specifications lets see one the american said mallory opened a box inside was a jumble of fistsized coils of very thin wire each in shrinkwrap plastic as you see he said its guide wire for antitank missiles is it thats what they told me thats why its wrapped that way one coil of wire for each missile i wouldnt know the american said im just the delivery man he went and opened the back of his van then he began to transfer the boxes one at a time mallory helped the american said this guy tell you anything else actually he did mallory said he said somebody bought five hundred surplus warsaw pact rockets called hotfire or hotwire or something no warheads or anything just the rocket bodies the story is they were sold with defective guide wire i havent heard that thats what he said missiles were bought in sweden gothenburg i think shipped out from there sounds like youre worried im not worried mallory said like youre afraid youre mixed up in something not me sure about that the american said yes of course im sure most of the boxes were transferred to the van mallory started to sweat the american seemed to be glancing at him out of the corner of his eye openly skeptical he said so tell me whatd he look like this guy mallory knew better than to answer that he shrugged just a guy american i dont know you dont know whether he was american or not i couldnt be sure of his accent why is that the american said he might have been canadian alone yeah because i hear talk about some gorgeous woman sexy woman in high heels tight skirt i would have noticed a woman like that mallory said you wouldnt be ampleaving her out another skeptical glance keeping her to yourself mallory noticed a bulge on the americans hip was it a gun it might be no he was alone whoever the guy was yes you ask me the american said id be wondering why anybody needed half a million feet of wire for antitank missiles in the first place i mean for what mallory said he didnt say and you just said right mate half a million feet of wire leave it to me with never a question seems like youre asking all the questions mallory said still sweating and i have a reason the american said his tone turned ominous i got to tell you pal i dont like what i am hearing the last of the boxes were stacked in the van mallory stepped back the american slammed the first door shut then the second as the second door closed mallory saw the driver standing there the woman she had been standing behind the door i dont like it either she said she was wearing fatigues army surplus stuff baggy trousers and highlaced boots a bulky green jacket heavy gloves dark glasses now wait a minute the american said give me your cell phone she said holding out her hand for it her other hand was behind her back as if she had a gun why give it to me why i want to look at it thats why theres nothing unusual give it to me the american pulled the cell phone out of his pocket and handed it to her instead of taking it she grabbed his wrist and pulled him toward her the cell phone clattered to the ground she brought her other hand from around her back and quickly gripped the side of his neck with her gloved hand she held him with both hands around his neck as if she were strangling him for a moment he was stunned then he began to struggle what the fuck are you doing he said what are youhey he knocked her hands away and jumped back as if he had been burned what was that what did you do he touched his neck a tiny trickle of blood ran down just a few drops there was red on his fingertips almost nothing what did you do he said nothing she was stripping off her gloves mallory could see she was doing it carefully as if something were in the glove something she did not want to touch nothing the american said nothing son of a bitch abruptly he turned and began to run up the ramp toward the street outside calmly she watched him go she bent over picked up the cell phone and put it in her pocket then she turned to mallory go back to work he hesitated you did a good job i never saw you you never saw me now go mallory turned and walked to the backstairs door behind him he heard the woman slam the van door and when he glanced back he saw the van racing up the ramp into the glare of the street the van turned right and was gone back in his office his assistant elizabeth came in with a mockup for the new ultralight computer ads for toshiba the shoot was tomorrow these were the finals to go over he shuffled through the boards quickly mallory had trouble concentrating elizabeth said you dont like them no no theyre fine you look a little pale i just um ampmy stomach ginger tea she said thats best shall i make some he nodded to get her out of the office he looked out the window mallorys office had a spectacular view of the thames and the tower bridge off to the left the bridge had been repainted baby blue and white was that traditional or just a bad idea but to see it always made him feel good secure somehow he walked closer to the window and stood looking at the bridge he was thinking that when his best friend had asked if he would lend a hand in a radical environmental cause it had sounded like something fun a bit of secrecy a bit of dash and derringdo he had been promised that it would not involve anything violent mallory had never imagined he would be frightened but he was frightened now his hands were shaking he stuck them in his pockets as he stared out the window five hundred rockets he thought five hundred rockets what had he gotten himself into then slowly he realized that he was hearing sirens and there were red lights flashing on the bridge railings there had been an accident on the bridge and judging from the number of police and rescue vehicles it was a serious accident one in which someone had died he couldnt help himself feeling a sense of panic he left the office went outside to the quay and with his heart in his throat hurried toward the bridge from the upper level of the red doubledecker bus the tourists were staring down covering their mouths in horror mallory pushed through the crowd clustered near the front of the bus he got close enough to see a halfdozen paramedics and police crouched around a body lying in the street above them stood the burly bus driver in tears he was saying that there was nothing he could have done the man had stepped in front of the bus at the last moment he must have been drunk the driver said because he was wobbling it was almost as if he fell off the curb mallory could not see the body the policemen blocked his view the crowd was nearly silent just watching then one of the policemen stood holding a red passport in his handsa german passport thank god mallory thought feeling a flood of relief that lasted until a moment later when one of the paramedics stepped away and mallory saw one leg of the victima faded black tracksuit and a dirty adidas running shoe now soaked with blood he felt a wave of nausea and turned away pushing back through the crowd the faces stared past him impassive or annoyed but nobody even glanced at him they were all looking at the body except for one man dressed like an executive in a dark suit and tie he was looking directly at mallory mallory met his eyes the man nodded slightly mallory made no response he just pushed through the last of the crowd and fled hurrying back down the stairs to his office and realizing that somehow in some way that he did not understand his life had changed forever tokyo tuesday june am idec the international data environmental consortium was located in a small brick building adjacent to the campus of keio mita university to the casual observer idec was part of the university and even showed the coat of arms calamus gladio fortior but in fact it was independent the center of the building consisted of a small conference room with a podium and two rows of five chairs facing a screen at the front at ten in the morning idec director akira hitomi stood at the podium and watched as the american came in and took a seat the american was a large man not so tall but thick in the shoulders and chest like an athlete for such a large man he moved easily quietly the nepali officer entered right behind him darkskinned and watchful he took a seat behind the american and off to one side at the podium hitomi nodded to them and said nothing the woodpaneled room darkened slowly to allow eyes to adjust on all sides the wood panels slid silently away exposing huge flatpanel screens some of the screens moved smoothly out from the walls at last the main door closed and locked with a click only then did hitomi speak good morning kennersan on the main screen it said hitomi akira in english and japanese and good morning thapasan hitomi flipped open a very small very thin silver laptop today i will present data from the last twentyone days correct up to twenty minutes ago these will be findings from our joint project akamai tree the two visitors nodded kenner smiled in anticipation as well he should hitomi thought nowhere else in the world could he see such a presentation for hitomis agency was the world leader in the accumulation and manipulation of electronic data now images on the screens came up glowing one after another they showed what appeared to be a corporate logo a green tree on a white background and the lettering akamai tree digital network solutions this name and image had been chosen for their similarity to actual internet companies and their logos for the last two years akamai trees network of servers actually consisted of carefully designed traps they incorporated multilevel quadcheck honeynets established in both business and academic domains this enabled them to track backward from servers to user with an percent success rate they had baited the net starting last year first with ordinary feed and then with increasingly juicy morsels our sites mirrored established geology applied physics ecology civil engineering and biogeography sites hitomi said to attract deep divers typical data included information on the use of explosives in seismic recordings the tests of the stability of structures to vibration and earthquake damage and in our oceanographic sites data on hurricanes rogue waves tsunamis and so forth all this is familiar to you kenner nodded hitomi continued we knew we had a disseminated enemy and a clever one users often operate behind netnanny firewalls or used aol accounts with teen ratings to imply they are juvenile pranksters or kiddie scripters but they are nothing of the sort they are well organized patient and unrelenting in recent weeks we have begun to understand more the screen changed showing a list out of a mix of sites and discussion groups our sys progs found the deep divers clustered on the following category topics aarhus denmark argonoxygen drives australian military history caisson seawalls cavitation solid cellular encryption controlled demolition flood mitigation highvoltage insulators hilo hawaii midocean relay network morn missionary diaries of the pacific national earthquake information center neic national environmental resource fund nerf network data encryption potassium hydroxide prescott arizona rain forest disease foundation rfdf seismic signatures geological shaped explosives timed shinkai solid rocket propellant mixtures toxins and neurotoxins wireguided projectiles an impressive if mysterious list hitomi said however we have filters to identify smees and highperformance clients these are individuals attacking firewalls setting trojans wild spiders and so forth many of them are looking for credit card lists but not all he tapped his little computer and the images changed we added each of these topics into the honeynet with increasing stickiness finally including hints of forthcoming research data which we exposed as email exchanges among scientists in australia germany canada and russia we drew a crowd and watched the traffic we eventually sorted a complex nodal north americatoronto chicago ann arbor montrealwith spines to both american coasts as well as england france and germany this is a serious alpha extremist group they may already have killed a researcher in paris were awaiting data but the french authorities can be ampslow kenner spoke for the first time and whats the current delta cellular cellular traffic is accelerating email is heavily encrypted stf rate is up it is clear there is a project under wayglobal in scope immensely complicated extremely expensive but we dont know what it is not yet then youd better follow the money we are doing it everywhere hitomi smiled grimly it is only a matter of time before one of these fishes takes the hook vancouver tuesday june pm nat damon signed the paper with a flourish ive never been asked to sign a nondisclosure agreement before im surprised the man in the shiny suit said taking the paper back i would have thought it was standard procedure we dont want our proprietary information to be disclosed he was a lawyer accompanying his client a bearded man with glasses wearing jeans and a work shirt this bearded man said he was a petroleum geologist and damon believed him he certainly looked like the other petroleum geologists he had dealt with damons company was called canada marine rs technologies from a tiny cramped office outside vancouver damon leased research submarines and remote submersibles to clients around the world damon didnt own these subs he just leased them the subs were located all over the worldin yokohama dubai melbourne san diego they ranged from fully operational fiftyfoot submersibles with crews of six capable of traveling around the globe to tiny oneman diving machines and even smaller remote robotic vehicles that operated from a tender ship on the surface damons clients were energy and mining companies who used the subs for undersea prospecting or to check the condition of offshore rigs and platforms his was a specialized business and his little office at the back of a boat repair yard did not receive many visitors yet these two men had come through his door just before closing time the lawyer had done all of the talking the client merely gave damon a business card that said seismic services with a calgary address that made sense calgary was a big city for hydrocarbon companies petrocanada shell and suncor were all there and many more and dozens of small private consulting firms had sprung up there to do prospecting and research damon took a small model down from the shelf behind him it was a tiny white snubnosed submarine with a bubble top he set it on the table in front of the men this is the vehicle i would recommend for your needs he said the rs scorpion built in england just four years ago twoman crew diesel and electric power with closed cycle argon drive submerged it runs on twenty percent oxygen eighty percent argon solid proven technology potassium hydroxide scrubber twohundredvolt electrical operational depth of two thousand feet and hours dive time its the equivalent of the japanese shinkai if you know that one or the downstar of which there are four in the world but theyre all on long leases the scorpion is an excellent submarine the men nodded and looked at each other and what kind of external manipulators are there the bearded man said thats depth dependent damon said at lesser depths lets say at two thousand feet what external manipulators are there you want to collect samples at two thousand feet actually were placing monitoring devices on the bottom i see like radio devices sending data to the surface something like that how large are these devices the bearded man held his hands two feet apart about so big and they weigh what oh i dont know exactly maybe two hundred pounds damon concealed his surprise usually petroleum geologists knew precisely what they were going to place exact dimensions exact weight exact specific gravity all that this guy was vague but perhaps damon was just being paranoid he continued and these sensors are for geological work ultimately first we need information on ocean currents flow rates bottom temperatures that kind of thing damon thought for what why did they need to know about currents of course they might be sinking a tower but nobody would do that in two thousand feet of water what were these guys intending to do well he said if you want to place external devices you have to secure them to the exterior of the hull prior to the dive there are lateral shelves on each side he pointed to the model for that purpose once youre at depth you have a choice of two remote arms to place the devices how many devices are you talking about quite a few more than eight oh yes probably well then youre talking about multiple dives you can only take eight maybe ten external devices on any given dive he talked on for a while scanning their faces trying to understand what lay behind the bland looks they wanted to lease the sub for four months starting in august of that year they wanted the sub and the tender ship transported to port moresby new guinea they would pick it up there depending on where you go there are some required marine licenses well worry about that later the lawyer said now the crew well worry about that later too its part of the contract then just write it in however you do it youll return the tender to moresby at the end of the lease period yes damon sat down in front of the desktop computer and began to fill in the estimate forms there were all in all fortythree categories not including insurance that had to be filled out at last he had the final number five hundred and eighty three thousand dollars he said the men didnt blink they just nodded half in advance they nodded again second half in escrow account prior to your taking delivery in port moresby he never required that with his regular customers but for some reason these two made him uneasy that will be fine the lawyer said plus twenty percent contingency payable in advance that was simply unnecessary but now he was trying to make these guys go away it didnt work that will be fine okay damon said now if you need to talk to your contracting company before you sign no were prepared to proceed now and then one of them pulled out an envelope and handed it to damon tell me if this is satisfactory it was a check for from seismic services payable to canada marine damon nodded and said it was he put the check and the envelope on his desk next to the submarine model then one of the men said do you mind if i make a couple of notes and picked up the envelope and scribbled on it and it was only after they were gone that damon realized they had given him the check and taken back the envelope so there would be no fingerprints or was he just being paranoid the following morning he was inclined to think so when he went to scotiabank to deposit the check he stopped by to see john kim the bank manager and asked him to find out if there were sufficient funds in the seismic services account to cover the check john kim said he would check right away stangfedlis monday august am christ it was cold george morton thought climbing out of the land cruiser the millionaire philanthropist stamped his feet and pulled on gloves trying to warm himself it was three oclock in the morning and the sky glowed red with streaks of yellow from the stillvisible sun a bitter wind blew across the sprengisandur the rugged dark plain in the interior of iceland flat gray clouds hung low over the lava that stretched away for miles the icelanders loved this place morton couldnt see why in any case they had reached their destination directly ahead lay a huge crumpled wall of dirtcovered snow and rock stretching up to the mountains behind this was snorrajцkul one tongue of the huge vatnajцkull glacier the largest ice cap in europe the driver a graduate student climbed out and clapped his hands with delight not bad at all quite warm you are lucky its a pleasant august night he was wearing a tshirt hiking shorts and a light vest morton was wearing a down vest a quilted windbreaker and heavy pants and he was still cold he looked back as the others got out of the backseat nicholas drake thin and frowning wearing a shirt and tie and a tweed sport coat beneath his windbreaker winced as the cold air hit him with his thinning hair wireframe glasses and pinched disapproving manner drake conveyed a scholarly quality that in fact he cultivated he did not want to be taken for what he was a highly successful litigator who had retired to become the director of the national environmental resource fund a major american activist group he had held the job at nerf for the last ten years next young peter evans bounced out of the car evans was the youngest of mortons attorneys and the one he liked best evans was twentyeight and a junior associate of the los angeles firm of hassle and black now even late at night he remained cheerful and enthusiastic he pulled on a patagonia fleece and stuck his hands in his pockets but otherwise gave no sign that the weather bothered him morton had flown all of them in from los angeles on his gulfstream g jet arriving in keflavнk airport at nine yesterday morning none of them had slept but nobody was tired not even morton and he was sixtyfive years old he didnt feel the slightest sense of fatigue just cold morton zipped up his jacket and followed the graduate student down the rocky hill from the car the light at night gives you energy the kid said dr einarsson never sleeps more than four hours a night in the summer none of us does and where is dr einarsson morton asked down there the kid pointed off to the left at first morton could see nothing at all finally he saw a red dot and realized it was a vehicle that was when he grasped the enormous size of the glacier drake fell into step with morton as they went down the hill george he said you and evans should feel free to go on a tour of the site and let me talk to per einarsson alone why i expect einarsson would be more comfortable if there werent a lot of people standing around but isnt the point that im the one who funds his research of course drake said but i dont want to hammer that fact too hard i dont want per to feel compromised i dont see how you can avoid it ill just point out the stakes drake said help him to see the big picture frankly i was looking forward to hearing this discussion morton said i know drake said but its delicate as they came closer to the glacier morton felt a distinct chill in the wind the temperature dropped several degrees they could see now the series of four large tan tents arranged near the red land cruiser from a distance the tents had blended into the plain from one of the tents a very tall blond man appeared per einarsson threw up his hands and shouted nicholas per drake raced forward morton continued down the hill feeling distinctly grouchy about being dismissed by drake evans came up to walk alongside him i dont want to take any damn tour morton said oh i dont know evans said looking ahead it might be more interesting than we think coming out of one of the other tents were three young women in khakis all blond and beautiful they waved to the newcomers maybe youre right morton said peter evans knew that his client george morton despite his intense interest in all things environmental had an even more intense interest in pretty women and indeed after a quick introduction to einarsson morton happily allowed himself to be led away by eva jуnsdуttir who was tall and athletic with shortcropped white blond hair and a radiant smile she was mortons type evans thought she looked rather like mortons beautiful assistant sarah jones he heard morton say i had no idea so many women were interested in geology and morton and eva drifted away heading toward the glacier evans knew he should accompany morton but perhaps morton wanted to take this tour alone and more important evanss firm also represented nicholas drake and evans had a nagging concern about what drake was up to not that it was illegal or unethical exactly but drake could be imperious and what he was going to do might cause embarrassment later on so for a moment evans stood there wondering which way to go which man to follow it was drake who made the decision for him giving evans a slight dismissive wave of his hand as he disappeared into the big tent with einarsson evans took the hint and ambled off toward morton and the girl eva was chattering on about how percent of iceland was covered in glaciers and how some of the glaciers had active volcanoes poking out from the ice this particular glacier she said pointing upward was of the type called a surge glacier because it had a history of rapid advances and retreats at the moment she said the glacier was pushing forward at the rate of one hundred meters a daythe length of a football field every twentyfour hours sometimes when the wind died you could actually hear it grinding forward this glacier had surged more than ten kilometers in the last few years soon they were joined by бsdнs sveinsdуttir who could have been evas younger sister she paid flattering attention to evans asking him how his trip over had been how he liked iceland how long he was staying in the country eventually she mentioned that she usually worked in the office at reykjavнk and had only come out for the day evans realized then that she was here doing her job the sponsors were visiting einarsson and einarsson had arranged for the visit to be memorable eva was explaining that although surgetype glaciers were very commonthere were several hundred of them in alaskathe mechanism of the surges was not known nor was the mechanism behind the periodic advances and retreats which differed for each glacier there is still so much to study to learn she said smiling at morton that was when they heard shouts coming from the big tent and considerable swearing evans excused himself and headed back to the tent somewhat reluctantly morton trailed after him per einarsson was shaking with anger he raised his fists i tell you no he yelled and pounded the table standing opposite him drake was very red in the face clenching his teeth per he said i am asking you to consider the realities you are not einarsson said pounding the table again the reality is what you do not want me to publish now per the reality he said is that in iceland the first half of the twentieth century was warmer than the second half as in greenland the reality is that in iceland most glaciers lost mass after because summers warmed by degrees celsius but since then the climate has become colder the reality is that since these glaciers have been steadily advancing they have regained half the ground that was lost earlier right now eleven are surging that is the reality nicholas and i will not lie about it no one has suggested you do drake said lowering his voice and glancing at his newly arrived audience i am merely discussing how you word your paper per einarsson raised a sheet of paper yes and you have suggested some wording merely a suggestion that twists truth per with due respect i feel you are exaggerating am i einarsson turned to the others and began to read this is what he wants me to say the threat of global warming has melted glaciers throughout the world and in iceland as well many glaciers are shrinking dramatically although paradoxically others are growing however in all cases recent extremes in climate variability seem to be the cause ampblah ampblah ampblah ampog svo framvegis he threw the paper down that is simply not true its just the opening paragraph the rest of your paper will amplify the opening paragraph is not true of course it is it refers to extremes in climate variability no one can object to such vague wording recent extremes but in iceland these effects are not recent then take out recent that is not adequate einarsson said because the implication of this paragraph is that we are observing the effects of global warming from greenhouse gases whereas in fact we are observing local climate patterns that are rather specific to iceland and are unlikely to be related to any global pattern and you can say so in your conclusion but this opening paragraph will be a big joke among arctic researchers you think motoyama or sigurosson will not see through this paragraph or hicks watanabe нsaksson they will laugh and call me compromised they will say i did it for grants but there are other considerations drake said soothingly we must all be aware there are disinformation groups funded by industrypetroleum automotivewho will seize on the report that some glaciers are growing and use it to argue against global warming that is what they always do they snatch at anything to paint a false picture how the information is used is not my concern my concern is to report the truth as best i can very noble drake said perhaps not so practical i see and you have brought the source of funding right here in the form of mr morton so i do not miss the point no no per drake said hastily please dont misunderstand i understand only too well what is he doing here einarsson was furious mr morton do you approve of what i am being asked to do by mr drake it was at that point that mortons cell phone rang and with illconcealed relief he flipped it open morton yes yes john where are you vancouver what time is it there he put his hand over the mouthpiece john kim in vancouver scotiabank evans nodded though he had no idea who that was mortons financial operations were complex he knew bankers all over the world morton turned and walked to the far side of the tent an awkward silence fell over the others as they waited einarsson stared at the floor sucking in his breath still furious the blond women pretended to work giving great attention to the papers they shuffled through drake stuck his hands in his pockets looked at the roof of the tent meanwhile morton was laughing really i hadnt heard that one he said chuckling he glanced back at the others and turned away again drake said look per i feel we have gotten off on the wrong foot not at all einarsson said coldly we understand each other only too well if you withdraw your support you withdraw your support nobody is talking about withdrawing support amp time will tell he said and then morton said what they did what deposited to what how much money are we jesus christ john this is unbelievable and still talking he turned and walked out of the tent evans hurried after him it was brighter the sun now higher in the sky trying to break through low clouds morton was scrambling up the slope still talking on the phone he was shouting but his words were lost in the wind as evans followed him they came to the land cruiser morton ducked down using it as a shield against the wind christ john do i have legal liability there i meanno i didnt know a thing about it what was the organization friends of the planet fund morton looked questioningly at evans evans shook his head hed never heard of friends of the planet and he knew most of the environmental organizations based where morton was saying san jose california oh jesus what the hell is based in costa rica he cupped his hand over the phone friends of the planet fund san josй costa rica evans shook his head i never heard of them morton said and neither has my lawyer and i dont rememberno ed if it was a quarter of a million dollars id remember the check was issued where i see and my name was where i see okay thanks yeah i will bye he flipped the phone shut he turned to evans peter he said get a pad and make notes morton spoke quickly evans scribbled trying to keep up it was a complicated story that he took down as best he could john kim the manager of scotiabank vancouver had been called by a customer named nat damon a local marine operator damon had deposited a check from a company called seismic services in calgary and the check had bounced it was for damon was nervous about whoever had written the check and asked kim to look into it john kim could not legally make inquiries in the us but the issuing bank was in calgary and he had a friend who worked there he learned that seismic services was an account with a postal box for an address the account was modestly active receiving deposits every few weeks from only one source the friends of the planet foundation based in san josй costa rica kim placed a call down there then about that time it came up on his screen that the check had cleared kim called damon and asked him if he wanted to drop the inquiry damon said no check it out kim had a brief conversation with miguel chavez at the banco credito agricola in san josй chavez said he had gotten an electronic deposit from the moriah wind power associates via ansbach cayman ltd a private bank on grand cayman island that was all he knew chavez called kim back ten minutes later to say he had made inquiries at ansbach and had obtained a record of a wire transfer that was paid into the moriah account by the international wilderness preservation society three days before that and the iwps transfer noted in the comment field g morton research fund john kim called his vancouver client nat damon to ask what the check was for damon said it was for the lease of a small twoman research submarine kim thought that was pretty interesting so he telephoned his friend george morton to kid him a bit and ask why he was leasing a submarine and to his surprise morton knew absolutely nothing about it evans finished taking down notes on the pad he said this is what some bank manager in vancouver told you yes a good friend of mine why are you looking at me that way because its a lot of information evans said he didnt know the banking rules in canada to say nothing of costa rica but he knew it was unlikely that any banks would freely exchange information in the way morton had described if the vancouver managers story was true there was more to it that he wasnt telling evans made a note to check into it and do you know the international wilderness preservation society which has your check for a quarter of a million dollars morton shook his head never heard of them so you never gave them two hundred and fifty thousand dollars morton shook his head ill tell you what i did do in the last week he said i gave two hundred and fifty grand to nicholas drake to cover a monthly operating shortfall he told me he had some problem about a big contributor from seattle not coming through for a week drakes asked me to help him out before like that once or twice you think that money ended up in vancouver morton nodded you better ask drake about it evans said i have no idea at all drake said looking mystified costa rica international wilderness preservation my goodness i cant imagine evans said you know the international wilderness preservation society very well drake said theyre excellent weve worked closely with them on any number of projects around the worldthe everglades tiger tops in nepal the lake toba preserve in sumatra the only thing i can think is that somehow georges check was mistakenly deposited in the wrong account or ampi just dont know i have to call the office but its late in california itll have to wait until morning morton was staring at drake not speaking george drake said turning to him im sure this must make you feel very strange even if its an honest mistakeas i am almost certain it isits still a lot of money to be mishandled i feel terrible but mistakes happen especially if you use a lot of unpaid volunteers as we do but you and i have been friends for a long time i want you to know that i will get to the bottom of this and of course i will see that the money is recovered at once you have my word george thank you morton said they all climbed into the land cruiser the vehicle bounced over the barren plain damn those icelanders are stubborn drake said staring out the window they may be the most stubborn researchers in the world he never saw your point evans said no drake said i couldnt make him understand scientists cant adopt that lofty attitude anymore they cant say i do the research and i dont care how it is used thats out of date its irresponsible even in a seemingly obscure field like glacier geology because like it or not were in the middle of a wara global war of information versus disinformation the war is fought on many battlegrounds newspaper opeds television reports scientific journals websites conferences classroomsand courtrooms too if it comes to that drake shook his head we have truth on our side but were outnumbered and outfunded today the environmental movement is david battling goliath and goliath is aventis and alcatel humana and ge bp and bayer shell and glaxowellcomehuge global corporate these people are the implacable enemies of our planet and per einarsson out there on his glacier is irresponsible to pretend it isnt happening sitting beside drake peter evans nodded sympathetically though in fact he took everything drake was saying with a large grain of salt the head of nerf was famously melodramatic and drake was pointedly ignoring the fact that several of the corporations he had named made substantial contributions to nerf every year and three executives from those companies actually sat on drakes board of advisors that was true of many environmental organizations these days although the reasons behind corporate involvement were much debated well morton said maybe per will reconsider later on i doubt it drake said gloomily he was angry weve lost this battle im sorry to say but we do what we always do soldier on fight the good fight it was silent in the car for a while the girls were damn good looking morton said werent they peter yes evans said they were evans knew that morton was trying to lighten the mood in the car but drake would have none of it the head of nerf stared morosely at the barren landscape and shook his head mournfully at the snowcovered mountains in the distance evans had traveled many times with drake and morton in the last couple of years usually morton could cheer everybody around him even drake who was glum and fretful but lately drake had become even more pessimistic than usual evans had first noticed it a few weeks ago and had wondered at the time if there was illness in the family or something else that was bothering him but it seemed there was nothing a miss at least nothing that anyone would talk about nerf was a beehive of activity they had moved into a wonderful new building in beverly hills fundraising was at an alltime high they were planning spectacular new events and conferences including the abrupt climate change conference that would begin in two months yet despite these successesor because of themdrake seemed more miserable than ever morton noticed it too but he shrugged it off hes a lawyer he said what do you expect forget about it by the time they reached reykjavнk the sunny day had turned wet and chilly it was sleeting at keflavнk airport obliging them to wait while the wings of the white gulfstream jet were deiced evans slipped away to a corner of the hangar and since it was still the middle of the night in the us placed a call to a friend in banking in hong kong he asked about the vancouver story absolutely impossible was the immediate answer no bank would divulge such information even to another bank theres an str in the chain somewhere an str suspicious transfer report if it looks like money for drug trafficking or terrorism the account gets tagged and from then on its tracked there are ways to track electronic transfers even with strong encryption but none of that tracking is ever going to wind up on the desk of a bank manager no not a chance youd need international lawenforcement credentials to see that tracking report so this bank manager didnt do all this himself i doubt it there is somebody else involved in this story a policeman of some kind somebody youre not being told about like a customs guy or interpol or something why would my client be contacted at all i dont know but its not an accident does your client have any radical tendencies thinking of morton evans wanted to laugh absolutely not you quite sure peter well yes amp because sometimes these wealthy donors amuse themselves or justify themselves by supporting terrorist groups thats what happened with the ira rich americans in boston supported them for decades but times have changed no one is amused any longer your client should be careful and if youre his attorney you should be careful too hate to visit you in prison peter and he hung up to los angeles monday august pm the flight attendant poured mortons vodka into a cutglass tumbler no more ice sweetie morton said raising his hand they were flying west over greenland a vast expanse of ice and cloud in pale sun beneath them morton sat with drake who talked about how the greenland ice cap was melting and the rate at which the arctic ice was melting and canadian glaciers were receding morton sipped his vodka and nodded so iceland is an anomaly oh yes drake said an anomaly everywhere else glaciers are melting at an unprecedented rate its good we have you nick morton said putting his hand on drakes shoulder drake smiled and its good we have you george he said we wouldnt be able to accomplish anything without your generous support youve made the vanutu lawsuit possibleand thats extremely important for the publicity it will generate and as for your other grants well ampwords fail me words never fail you morton said slapping him on the back sitting across from them evans thought they really were the odd couple morton big and hearty dressed casually in jeans and a workshirt always seeming to burst from his clothes and nicholas drake tall and painfully thin wearing a coat and tie with his scrawny neck rising from the collar of a shirt that never seemed to fit in their manner too they were complete opposites morton loved to be around as many people as possible loved to eat and laugh he had a penchant for pretty girls vintage sports cars asian art and practical jokes his parties drew most of hollywood to his holmby hills mansion his charity functions were always special always written up the next day of course drake attended those functions but invariably left early sometimes before dinner often he pleaded illnesshis own or a friends in fact drake was a solitary ascetic man who detested parties and noise even when he stood at a podium giving a speech he conveyed an air of isolation as if he were alone in the room and being drake he made it work for him he managed to suggest that he was a lone messenger in the wilderness delivering the truth the audience needed to hear despite their differences in temperament the two men had built a durable friendship that had lasted the better part of a decade morton the heir to a forklift fortune had the congenital uneasiness of inherited wealth drake had a good use for that money and in return provided morton with a passion and a cause that informed and guided mortons life mortons name appeared on the board of advisors of the audubon society the wilderness society the world wildlife fund and the sierra club he was a major contributor to greenpeace and the environmental action league all this culminated in two enormous gifts by morton to nerf the first was a grant of million to finance the vanutu lawsuit the second was a grant of million to nerf itself to finance future research and litigation on behalf of the environment not surprisingly the nerf board had voted morton their concerned citizen of the year a banquet in his honor was scheduled for later that fall in san francisco evans sat across from the two men idly thumbing through a magazine but he had been shaken by the hong kong call and found himself observing morton with some care morton still had his hand on drakes shoulder and was telling him a jokeas usual trying to get drake to laughbut it seemed to evans that he detected a certain distance on mortons part morton had withdrawn but didnt want drake to notice this suspicion was confirmed when morton stood up abruptly and headed for the cockpit i want to know about this damn electronic thing he said since takeoff they had been experiencing the effects of a major solar flare that rendered satellite telephones erratic or unusable the pilots said the effect was heightened near the poles and would soon diminish as they headed south and morton seemed eager to make some calls evans wondered to whom it was now four am in new york one am in los angeles who was morton calling but of course it could concern any of his ongoing environmental projectswater purification in cambodia reforestation in guinea habitat preservation in madagascar medicinal plants in peru to say nothing of the german expedition to measure the thickness of the ice in antarctica morton was personally involved in all these projects he knew them in detail knew the scientists involved had visited the locations himself so it could be anything but somehow evans felt it wasnt just anything morton came back pilots say its okay now he sat by himself in the front of the plane reached for his headset and pulled the sliding door shut for privacy evans turned back to his magazine drake said you think hes drinking more than usual not really evans said i worry i wouldnt evans said you realize drake said we are just five weeks from the banquet in his honor in san francisco thats our biggest fundraising event of the year it will generate considerable publicity and itll help us launch the conference on abrupt climate change uhhuh evans said id like to ensure that the publicity focuses on environmental issues and not anything else of a personal nature if you know what i mean evans said isnt this a conversation you should be having with george oh i have i only mention it to you because you spend so much time with him i dont really you know he likes you peter drake said youre the son he never had orhell i dont know but he does like you and im just asking you to help us if you can i dont think hell embarrass you nick just ampkeep an eye on him okay sure at the front of the plane the sliding door opened morton said mr evans if you please peter got up and went forward he slid the door shut behind him i have been on the phone to sarah morton said sarah jones was his assistant in la isnt it late its her job shes well paid sit down evans sat in the chair opposite have you ever heard of the nsia no the national security intelligence agency evans shook his head no but there are twenty security agencies ever heard of john kenner no amp apparently hes a professor at mit no evans said sorry does he have something to do with the environment he may see what you can find out evans turned to the laptop by his seat and flipped open the screen it was connected to the internet by satellite he started to type in a few moments he was looking at a picture of a fitlooking man with prematurely gray hair and heavy hornrim glasses the attached biography was brief evans read it aloud richard john kenner william t harding professor of geoenvironmental engineering whatever that means morton said he is thirtynine doctorate in civil engineering from caltech at age twenty did his thesis on soil erosion in nepal barely missed qualifying for the olympic ski team a jd from harvard law school spent the next four years in government department of the interior office of policy analysis scientific advisor to the intergovernmental negotiating committee hobby is mountain climbing he was reported dead on naya khanga peak in nepal but he wasnt tried to climb k driven back by weather k morton said isnt that the most dangerous peak i think so looks like hes a serious climber anyway he then went to mit where id say his rise has been spectacular associate professor in director of the mit center for risk analysis in william t harding professor in consultant to the epa the department of the interior the department of defense the government of nepal god knows who else looks like a lot of corporations and since on faculty leave meaning what it just says hes on leave for the last two years morton came and looked over evanss shoulder i dont like it the guy burns up the track at mit goes on leave and never comes back you think he got into trouble i dont know but amp evans was calculating the dates professor kenner got a doctorate from caltech at twenty got his law degree from harvard in two years instead of three professor at mit when hes twentyeight amp okay okay so hes smart morton said i still want to know why hes on leave and why hes in vancouver evans said hes in vancouver hes been calling sarah from vancouver why he wants to meet with me well evans said i guess youd better meet with him i will morton said but what do you think he wants i have no idea funding a project sarah says he wants the meeting to be confidential he doesnt want anybody to be told well thats not hard youre on an airplane no morton said jerking his thumb he specifically doesnt want drake to be told maybe id better attend this meeting evans said yes morton said maybe you should los angeles monday august pm the iron gates swung open and the car drove up the shaded driveway to the house that slowly came into view this was holmby hills the wealthiest area of beverly hills the billionaires lived here in residences hidden from the street by high gates and dense foliage in this part of town security cameras were all painted green and tucked back unobtrusively the house came into view it was a mediterraneanstyle villa cream colored and large enough for a family of ten evans who had been speaking to his office flipped his cell phone shut and got out as the car came to a stop birds chirped in the ficus trees the air smelled of the gardenia and jasmine that bordered the driveway a hummingbird hung near the purple bougainvillea at the garage it was evans thought a typical california moment evans had been raised in connecticut and schooled in boston even after five years in california the place still seemed exotic to him he saw that another car was parked in front of the house a dark gray sedan it had government license plates from out of the front door came mortons assistant sarah jones a tall blond woman of thirty as glamorous as any movie star sarah was dressed in a white tennis skirt and pink top her hair pulled back in a pony tail morton kissed her lightly on the cheek you playing today i was my boss came back early she shook evanss hand and turned back to morton good trip fine drake is morose and he wont drink it gets tiresome as morton started toward the door sarah said i think i ought to tell you theyre here right now who is professor kenner and another guy with him foreign guy really but didnt you tell them they had to make an appointment yes i did they seem to think that doesnt apply to them they just sat down and said theyd wait you should have called me they got here five minutes ago huh okay he turned to evans lets go peter they went inside mortons living room looked out on the garden in back of the house the room was decorated with asian antiques including a large stone head from cambodia sitting erectly on the couch were two men one was an american of middle height with short gray hair and glasses the other was very dark compact and very handsome despite the thin scar that ran down the left side of his face in front of his ear they were dressed in cotton slacks and lightweight sport coats both men sat on the edge of the couch very alert as if they might spring up at any moment look military dont they morton muttered as they went into the room the two men stood mr morton im john kenner from mit and this is my colleague sanjong thapa a graduate student from mustang in nepal morton said and this is my colleague peter evans they shook hands all around kenners grip was firm sanjong thapa gave a very slight bow as he shook hands he spoke softly with a british accent how do you do i didnt expect you morton said so soon we work quickly so i see whats this about im afraid we need your help mr morton kenner smiled pleasantly at evans and sarah and unfortunately our discussion is confidential mr evans is my attorney morton said and i have no secrets from my assistant im sure kenner said you may take them into your confidence whenever you choose but we must speak to you alone evans said if you dont mind id like to see some identification of course kenner said both men reached for wallets evans was shown massachusetts drivers licenses mit faculty cards and passports then they handed out business cards john kenner phd center for risk analysis massachusetts institute of technology massachusetts avenue cambridge ma sanjong thapa phd research associate department of geoenvironmental engineering building c massachusetts institute of technology cambridge ma there were telephone numbers fax email evans turned the cards over it all looked straightforward kenner said now if you and miss jones will excuse us amp they were outside in the hallway looking into the living room through the large glass doors morton was sitting on one couch kenner and sanjong were on the other the discussion was quiet in fact it looked to evans just like one more of the endless investment meetings that morton endured evans picked up the hall phone and dialed a number center for risk analysis a woman said professor kenners office please one moment clicking another voice center for risk analysis professor kenners office good afternoon evans said my name is peter evans and im calling for professor kenner im sorry he is not in the office do you know where he is professor kenner is on extended leave it is important that i reach him evans said do you know how i could do that well it shouldnt be hard since you are in los angeles and so is he so she had seen the caller id evans thought he would have imagined morton had a blocked id but evidently not or perhaps the secretary in massachusetts had a way to unblock it well evans said can you tell me im sorry mr evans she said but im not able to help you further click sarah said what was that about before evans could answer a cell phone rang in the living room he saw kenner reach into his pocket and answer briefly then he turned looked at evans and waved sarah said his office called him looks like it so i guess thats professor kenner i guess it is evans said and were dismissed come on sarah said ill give you a ride home they walked past the open garage the row of ferraris glinting in the sun morton owned nine vintage ferraris which he kept in various garages these included a spyder corsa a testa rossa and a california spyder each worth more than a million dollars evans knew this because he reviewed the insurance every time morton bought another one at the far end of the line was sarahs black porsche convertible she backed it out and he climbed in beside her even by los angeles standards sarah jones was an extremely beautiful woman she was tall with a honeycolored tan shoulderlength blond hair blue eyes perfect features very white teeth she was athletic in the casual way that california people were athletic generally showing up for work in a jogging suit or short tennis skirt she played golf and tennis scuba dived mountain biked skied snowboarded and god knew what else evans felt tired whenever he thought about it but he also knew that she had issues to use the california word sarah was the youngest child of a wealthy san francisco family her father was a powerful attorney who had held political office her mother was a former high fashion model sarahs older brothers and sisters were all happily married all successful and all waiting for her to follow in their footsteps she found her familys collective success a burden evans had always wondered why she chose to work for morton another powerful and wealthy man or why she had come to los angeles at all since her family regarded any address south of the bay bridge to be hopelessly tawdry but she was good at her job and devoted to morton and as george often said her presence was aesthetically pleasing and the actors and celebrities who attended mortons parties agreed she had dated several of them which further displeased her family sometimes evans wondered if everything she did was rebellion like her drivingshe drove quickly almost recklessly shooting down benedict canyon heading into beverly hills do you want to go to the office or your apartment my apartment he said i have to pick up my car she nodded swerved around a slowmoving mercedes then cut left down a side street evans took a deep breath listen she said do you know what netwar is what he wasnt sure he had heard her over the sound of the wind netwar no he said why i heard them talking about it before you showed up kenner and that sanjong guy evans shook his head doesnt ring a bell you sure it wasnt netware might have been she sped across sunset running a yellow light and then downshifted as she came to beverly you still on roxbury he said he was he looked at her long legs protruding from the short white skirt who were you going to play tennis with i dont think you know him its not uh amp no thats over i see im serious its over okay sarah i hear you you lawyers are all so suspicious so its a lawyer youre playing with no it is not a lawyer i dont play with lawyers what do you do with them as little as possible like everybody else im sorry to hear that except you of course she said giving him a dazzling smile she accelerated hard making the engine scream peter evans lived in one of the older apartment buildings on roxbury drive in the flats of beverly hills there were four units in his building across the street from roxbury park it was a nice park a big green expanse always busy he saw hispanic nannies chatting in groups while they minded the children of rich people and several oldsters sitting in the sun off in a corner a working mother in a business suit had taken off lunch to be with the kids the car screeched to a stop here you are thanks he said getting out isnt it time to move youve been here five years im too busy to move he said got your keys yeah but theres always one under the doormat he reached in his pocket jingled metal all set see you and she raced off squealed around the corner and was gone evans walked through the little sunlit courtyard and went up to his apartment on the second floor as always he had found sarah slightly distressing she was so beautiful and so flirtatious he always had the feeling that she kept men at a distance by keeping them off balance at least she kept him off balance he could never tell if she wanted him to ask her out or not but considering his relationship with morton it was a bad idea he would never do it as soon as he walked in the door the phone began to ring it was his assistant heather she was going home early because she felt sick heather frequently felt sick toward the afternoon in time to beat rush hour traffic she tended to call in sick on fridays or mondays yet the firm showed a surprising reluctance to fire her she had been there for years some said she had had a relationship with bruce black the founding partner and that ever since bruce lived in constant dread that his wife would find out since she had all the money others claimed heather was seeing another of the firms partners always unspecified a third story was that she had been on the scene when the firm moved offices from one century city skyscraper to another in the course of which she stumbled on some incriminating documents and copied them evans suspected the truth was more mundane that she was a clever woman who had worked in the firm long enough to know everything about wrongful termination suits and now carefully gauged her repeated infractions against the cost and aggravation of their firing her and in this way worked about thirty weeks a year heather was invariably assigned to the best junior associate in the firm on the assumption that a really good attorney wouldnt be hampered by her inconstancy evans had tried for years to get rid of her he was promised a new assistant next year he saw it as a promotion im sorry you dont feel well he told heather dutifully one had to go along with her pretense its just my stomach she said i have to see the doctor are you going today well im trying to get an appointment amp all right then but i wanted to tell you they just set a big meeting for the day after tomorrow nine oclock in the big conference room oh mr morton just called it apparently ten or twelve people are called you know who no they didnt say evans thought useless okay he said and dont forget you have the arraignment for mortons daughter next week this time its pasadena not downtown and margo lanes calling about her mercedes lawsuit and that bmw dealer still wants to go forward he still wants to sue the church he calls every other day okay is that it no theres about ten others ill try to leave the list on your desk if i feel well enough amp that meant she wouldnt okay he said are you coming in no its too late i need to get some sleep then ill see you tomorrow he realized he was very hungry there was nothing to eat in the refrigerator except a container of yogurt of indeterminate age some wilted celery and a halffinished bottle of wine left over from his last date about two weeks earlier he had been seeing a girl named carol who did product liability at another firm theyd picked each other up in the gym and had begun a desultory intermittent affair they were both busy and not especially interested in each other to tell the truth they met once or twice a week had passionate sex and then one of them would plead a breakfast appointment the next day and go home early sometimes they went to dinner as well but not usually neither of them wanted to take the time he went into the living room to check his answering machine there was no message from carol but there was a message from janis another girl he sometimes saw janis was a trainer in the gym the possessor of one of those la bodies perfectly proportioned and rock hard sex for janis was an athletic event involving multiple rooms couches and chairs and it always left evans feeling vaguely inadequate as if his body fat werent low enough for her but he continued to see her feeling vaguely proud that he could have a girl who looked so astonishing even if the sex wasnt that good and she was often available on short notice janis had a boyfriend who was older a producer for a cable news station he was out of town a lot and she was restless janis had left a message the night before evans didnt bother to call her back with janis it was always that night or forget it before janis and carol there had been other women more or less the same evans told himself he should find a more satisfying relationship something more serious more adult more suited to his age and station in life but he was busy and just took things as they came meanwhile he was hungry he went back down to his car and drove to the nearest drivein a hamburger joint on pico they knew him there he had a double cheeseburger and a strawberry shake he went home intending to go to bed then he remembered that he owed morton a call im glad you called morton said ive just been going over some things withgoing over some things where are we now on my donations to nerf the vanutu lawsuit all that i dont know evans said the papers are drawn and signed but i dont think anythings been paid yet good i want you to hold off payments sure no problem just for a while okay theres no need to say anything to nerf no no of course not good evans hung up he went into the bedroom to get undressed the phone rang again it was janis the exercise instructor hey she said i was thinking about you and i wondered what you were doing as a matter of fact i was going to go to bed oh pretty early for that i just got in from iceland so you must be tired well he said not that tired want company sure she giggled and hung up beverly hills tuesday august am evans awoke to the sound of rhythmic gasping he flung his hand across the bed but janis wasnt there her side of the bed was still warm he raised his head slightly yawning in the warm morning light he saw one slender perfectly formed leg rise above the foot of the bed to be joined by the other leg then both legs slowly descended gasping then legs up again janis he said what are you doing i have to warm up she stood smiling naked and at ease confident of her appearance every muscle outlined i have a class at seven what time is it six he groaned and buried his head in the pillow you really should get up now she said it shortens your lifespan to sleep in he groaned again janis was full of health information it was her job how can it possibly shorten my life to sleep they did studies on rats they didnt let them sleep and you know what they lived longer uhhuh would you mind turning on the coffee okay she said but you really should give up coffee amp she drifted out of the room he swung his feet onto the floor and said havent you heard coffee prevents strokes it does not she said from the kitchen coffee has nine hundred twentythree different chemicals in it and it is not good for you new study he said it was true too besides it causes cancer thats never been shown and miscarriages not a concern for me and nervous tension janis please she came back crossing her arms across her perfect breasts as she leaned against the doorjamb he could see the veins in her lower abdomen running down to her groin well you are nervous peter you have to admit it only when i look at your body she pouted you dont take me seriously she turned back into the kitchen showing him her perfect high glutes he heard her open the refrigerator theres no milk black is fine he stood and headed for the shower did you have any damage she said from what from the earthquake we had a little one while you were gone about not that i know well it sure moved your tv he stopped in midstride what it moved your tv look for yourself the morning sunlight that slanted through the window clearly showed the faint outline where the base of the television had compressed the carpet the tv had been moved about three inches from its former position it was an old thirtytwoinch monitor and damned heavy it didnt move easily looking at it now gave evans a chill youre lucky she said you have all those glass things on your mantel they break all the time even in a small quake do you have an insurance policy he didnt answer he was bent over looking behind the television at the connections everything looked normal but he hadnt looked behind his tv for about a year he wouldnt really know by the way she said this is not organic coffee you should at least drink organic are you listening to me just a minute he had crouched down in front of the television looking for anything unusual beneath the set he could see nothing out of the ordinary and what is this she said he looked over she was holding a donut in her hand peter janis said severely do you know how much fats in these things you might as well just eat a stick of butter i know ampi should give them up well you should unless you want to develop diabetes later in life why are you on the floor i was checking the tv why is it broken i dont think so he got to his feet the water is running in your shower she said thats not environmentally conscious she poured coffee handed it to him go and take your shower ive got to get to my class when he came out of the shower she was gone he pulled the covers up over the bed as close as he ever came to making it and went into the closet to dress for the day century city tuesday august am the law firm of hassle and black occupied five floors of an office building in century city they were a forwardlooking socially aware firm they represented many hollywood celebrities and wealthy activists who were committed to environmental concerns the fact that they also represented three of the biggest land developers in orange county was less often publicized but as the partners said it kept the firm balanced evans had joined the firm because of its many environmentally active clients particularly george morton he was one of four attorneys who worked almost fulltime for morton and for mortons pet charity the national environmental resource fund nerf nevertheless he was still a junior associate and his office was small with a window that looked directly at the flat glass wall of the skyscraper across the street evans looked over the papers on his desk it was the usual stuff that came to junior attorneys there was a residential sublet an employment agreement written interrogatories for a bankruptcy a form for the franchise tax board and two drafted letters threatening lawsuits on behalf of his clientsone for an artist against a gallery refusing to return his unsold paintings and one for george mortons mistress who claimed that the parking attendant at sushi roku had scratched her mercedes convertible while parking it the mistress margaret lane was an exactress with a bad temper and a propensity for litigation whenever george neglected herwhich in recent months was increasingly oftenshe would find a reason to sue somebody and the suit would inevitably land on evanss desk he made a note to call margo he didnt think she should proceed with this suit but she would take convincing the next item was a spreadsheet from a beverly hills bmw dealer who claimed that the what would jesus drive campaign had hurt his business because it denigrated luxury cars apparently his dealership was a block from a church and some parishioners had come around after services and harangued his sales staff the dealer didnt like that but it looked to evans as if his sales figures were higher this year than last evans made a note to call him too then he checked his emails sorting through twenty offers to enlarge his penis ten offers for tranquilizers and another ten to get a new mortgage now before rates started to rise there were only a halfdozen emails of importance the first from herb lowenstein asking to see him lowenstein was the senior partner on mortons account he did mostly estate management but handled other aspects of investments as well for morton estate management was a fulltime job evans wandered down the hall to herbs office lisa herb lowensteins assistant was listening on the phone she hung up and looked guilty when evans entered hes talking to jack nicholson how is jack hes good finishing a picture with meryl there were some problems lisa ray was a brighteyed twentysevenyearold and a dedicated gossip evans had long ago come to rely on her for office information of all sorts whats herb want me for something about nick drake whats this meeting about tomorrow at nine i dont know she said sounding amazed i cant find out a thing who called it mortons accountants she looked at the phone on her desk oh hes hung up you can go right in herb lowenstein stood and shook evanss hand perfunctorily he was a pleasantfaced balding man mildmannered and slightly nerdy his office was decorated with dozens of pictures of his family stacked three and four deep on his desk he got on well with evans if only because these days whenever mortons thirtyyearold daughter got arrested for cocaine possession it was evans who went downtown at midnight to post her bail lowenstein had done it for many years and now was glad to sleep through the night so he said how was iceland good cold is everything okay sure i mean between george and nick everything okay there i think so why nick is worried he called me twice in the last hour about what where are we on georges nerf donation nicks asking that is there a problem about it george wants to hold off for a while why he didnt say is it this kenner guy george didnt say he just said hold off evans wondered how lowenstein knew about kenner what do i tell nick tell him its in the works and we dont have a date for him yet but theres not a problem with it is there not that ive been told evans said okay lowenstein said in this room tell me is there a problem there might be evans was thinking that george rarely held up charitable donations and there had been a certain tension in the brief talk he had with him the night before whats this meeting about tomorrow morning lowenstein said the big conference room beats me george didnt tell you no nick is very upset well thats not unusual for nick nick has heard of this kenner guy he thinks hes a troublemaker some kind of antienvironmental guy i doubt that hes a professor at mit in some environmental science nick thinks hes a troublemaker i couldnt say he overheard you and morton talking about kenner on the airplane nick should stop listening at keyholes hes worried about his standing with george not surprising evans said nick screwed up on a big check got deposited in the wrong account i heard about that it was an error by a volunteer you cant blame nick for that it doesnt build confidence it was deposited to the international wilderness preservation society a great organization and the money is being transferred back even as we speak thats fine where are you in this nowhere i just do what the client says but you advise him if he asks me he hasnt asked it sounds like youve lost confidence yourself evans shook his head herb he said im not aware of any problem im aware of a delay thats all okay lowenstein said reaching for the phone ill calm nick down evans went back to his office his phone was ringing he answered it what are you doing today morton said not much paperwork that can wait i want you to go over and see how that vanutu lawsuit is coming jeez george its still pretty preliminary i think the filing is several months away pay them a visit morton said okay theyre in culver city ill call over there and no dont call just go but if theyre not expecting thats right thats what i want let me know what you find out peter and he hung up culver city tuesday august am the vanutu litigation team had taken over an old warehouse south of culver city it was an industrial area with potholes in the streets there was nothing to see from the curb just a plain brick wall and a door with the street number in battered metal numerals evans pushed the buzzer and was admitted to a small walledoff reception area he could hear the low murmur of voices from the other side of the wall but he could see nothing at all two armed guards stood on either side of the far door leading into the warehouse itself a receptionist sat at a small desk she gave him an unfriendly look and you are peter evans hassle and black to see mr balder you have an appointment no the receptionist looked disbelieving i will buzz his assistant thank you the receptionist talked on the phone in a low voice he heard her mention the name of the law firm evans looked at the two guards they were from a private security firm they stared back at him their faces blank unsmiling the receptionist hung up and said ms haynes will be out in a moment she nodded to the guards one of them came over and said to evans just a formality sir may i see some identification evans gave him his drivers license do you have any cameras or recording equipment on your person no evans said any disks drives flash cards or other computer equipment no are you armed sir no would you mind raising your arms for a moment when evans gave him a strange look the guard said just think of it like airport security and he patted him down but he was also clearly feeling for wires he ran his fingers over the collar of evanss shirt felt the stitching in his jacket ran his finger around his waistband and then asked him to take off his shoes finally he passed an electronic wand over him you guys are serious evans said yes we are thank you sir the guard stepped away resuming his place at the wall there was no place to sit so evans just stood there and waited it was probably two minutes before the door opened an attractive but toughlooking woman in her late twenties with short dark hair and blue eyes wearing jeans and a white shirt said mr evans im jennifer haynes her handshake was firm i work with john balder come this way they went inside they were in a narrow corridor with a locked door at the far end evans realized it was a security locktwo doors to get inside what was that all about he said indicating the guards weve had a little trouble what kind of trouble people want to know whats going on here uhhuh amp weve learned to be careful she held her card against the door and it buzzed open they entered an old warehousea vast highceilinged space separated into large rooms by glass partitions immediately to his left behind glass evans saw a room filled with computer terminals each manned by a young person with a stack of documents beside their keyboard in big lettering on the glass it said dataraw to his right there was a matching conference room labeled satellitesradiosonde evans saw four people inside that room busily discussing huge blowups of a graph on the wall jagged lines on a grid farther along there was another room marked general circulation models gcms here the walls were plastered with large maps of the world graphical representations in many colors wow evans said big operation big lawsuit jennifer haynes replied these are all our issue teams theyre mostly graduate students in climate science not attorneys each team is researching a different issue for us she pointed around the warehouse the first group does raw data meaning processed data from the goddard institute for space studies at columbia university in new york from the ushcn at oak ridge tennessee and from hadley center in east anglia england those are the major sources of temperature data from around the world i see evans said then the group over there works on satellite data orbiting satellites have recorded temperatures of the upper atmosphere since so there is more than a twentyyear record were trying to figure out what to do about it what to do about it the satellite datas a problem she said why as though she hadnt heard him she pointed to the next room the team there is doing comparative analyses of gcmsmeaning the computergenerated climate modelsfrom the s to the present as you know these models are immensely complex manipulating a million variables or more at once they are by far the most complex computer models ever created by man were dealing with american british and german models primarily i see amp evans was starting to feel overwhelmed and the team down there is doing sealevel issues around the corner is paleoclimate thosere proxy studies of course and the final team is dealing with solar irradiance and aerosols then we have an offsite team at ucla that is doing atmospheric feedback mechanisms primarily focusing on cloud cover as it varies with temperature change and thats about all of it she paused seeing the confusion on evanss face im sorry since you work with george morton i assumed you were familiar with all this stuff who said i work with george morton she smiled we know our job mr evans they passed a final glasswalled room that had no label it was filled with charts and huge photographs and threedimensional models of the earth set inside plastic cubes whats this he said our av team they prepare visuals for the jury some of the data is extremely complex and were trying to find the simplest and most forceful way to present it they walked on evans said is it really that complicated thats correct she said the island nation of vanutu is actually four coral atolls in the southern pacific which have a maximum elevation of twenty feet above sea level the eight thousand inhabitants of those islands are at risk of being flooded out by rising sea levels caused by global warming yes evans said i understand that but why do you have so many people working on the science she looked at him oddly because were trying to win the case yes amp and its not an easy case to win what do you mean evans said this is global warming everybody knows that global warming is a voice boomed from the other end of the warehouse is what a bald bespectacled man came toward them he had an ungainly gait and looked like his nickname the bald eagle as always john balder was dressed all in blue a blue suit a blue shirt and a blue tie his manner was intense his eyes narrowed as he looked at evans in spite of himself evans was intimidated to meet the famous litigator evans extended his hand peter evans hassle and black and you work with george morton yes sir i do we are indebted to mr mortons generosity we strive to be worthy of his support ill tell him that sir im sure you will you were speaking of global warming mr evans is it a subject that interests you yes sir it does and every concerned citizen of the planet i certainly agree but tell me what is global warming as you understand it evans tried to conceal his surprise he hadnt expected to be quizzed why do you ask we ask everybody who comes here were trying to get a feel for the general state of knowledge whats global warming global warming is the heating up of the earth from burning fossil fuels actually that is not correct its not not even close perhaps youd try again evans paused it was obvious he was being interrogated by a fussy and precise legal mind he knew the type only too well from law school he thought for a moment choosing his words carefully global warming is uh the heating up of the surface of the earth from the excess of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere that is produced by burning fossil fuels again not correct why not several reasons at a minimum i count four errors in the statement you just made i dont understand evans said my statementthats what global warming is in fact it is not balders tone was crisp authoritative global warming is the theory hardly a theory anymore no it is a theory balder said believe me i wish it were otherwise but in fact global warming is the theory that increased levels of carbon dioxide and certain other gases are causing an increase in the average temperature of the earths atmosphere because of the socalled greenhouse effect well okay evans said thats a more exact definition but amp mr evans you yourself believe in global warming i take it of course believe in it strongly sure everybody does when you have a strongly held belief dont you think its important to express that belief accurately evans was starting to sweat he really felt like he was back in law school well sir i guess really in this case because when you refer to global warming everybody knows what you are talking about do they i suspect that even you dont know what you are talking about evans felt a burst of hot anger before he could check himself he had blurted look just because i may not be expressing the fine details of the science im not concerned about details mr evans im concerned about the core of your strongly held beliefs i suspect you have no basis for those beliefs with all due respect thats ridiculous he caught his breath sir you mean you do have such a basis of course i do balder looked at him thoughtfully he seemed pleased with himself in that case you can be a great help to this lawsuit would you mind giving us an hour of your time uh ampi guess so would you mind if we videotaped you no but ampwhy balder turned to jennifer haynes who said were trying to establish a baseline for what a wellinformed person such as yourself knows about global warming to help us refine our jury presentation sort of a mock jury of one exactly weve interviewed several people already okay evans said i guess i could schedule that at some point now is a good time balder said he turned to jennifer get your team together in room four of course id like to help evans said but i came here to get an overview because youve heard there are problems with the lawsuit there arent but there are significant challenges balder said he glanced at his watch im about to go into a meeting he said you spend some time with ms haynes and when youre done well talk about the litigation as i see it is that all right with you there was nothing evans could do but agree vanutu team tuesday august am they put him in a conference room at the end of a long table and aimed the video camera at him from the far end just like a deposition he thought five young people drifted into the room and took seats at the table all were casually dressed in jeans and tshirts jennifer haynes introduced them so quickly that evans didnt catch their names she explained that they were all graduate students in different scientific disciplines while they were setting up jennifer slipped into a chair beside his and said im sorry john was so rough on you hes frustrated and under a lot of pressure from the case yes what kind of pressure this session may give you some idea what were dealing with she turned to the others are we ready heads nodded notebooks flipped open the camera light came on jennifer said interview with peter evans of hassle and black on tuesday august twentyfourth mr evans wed like to go over your views about the evidence that supports global warming this isnt a test wed just like to clarify how you think about the issue okay evans said lets begin informally tell us what you know about the evidence for global warming well evans said i know that temperatures around the globe have risen dramatically in the last twenty or thirty years as a result of increases in carbon dioxide that is released by industry when fossil fuels are burned okay and by a dramatic rise in temperature you mean how much i think about a degree fahrenheit or celsius fahrenheit and this rise has occurred over twenty years twenty or thirty yes and earlier in the twentieth century temperatures went up then too but not as fast okay she said now i am going to show you a graph amp she pulled out a graph on foam core backing global temperature does this look familiar to you she asked ive seen it before evans said its taken from the nasagoddard data set used by the un and other organizations do you consider the un a trustworthy source yes so we can regard this graph as accurate unbiased no monkey business yes good do you know what this graph represents evans could read that much he said its the mean global temperature from all the weather stations around the world for the last hundred years or so thats right she said and how do you interpret this graph well he said it shows what i was describing he pointed to the red line world temperatures have been rising since about but they start to go up steeply around when industrialization is most intense which is the real proof of global warming okay she said so the rapid increase in temperature since was caused by what rising carbon dioxide levels from industrialization good in other words as the carbon dioxide goes up the temperature goes up yes all right now you mentioned the temperature started to rise from up to about and we see here that it did what caused that rise carbon dioxide um ampim not sure because there was much less industrialization back in and yet look how temperatures go up was carbon dioxide rising in im not sure actually it was here is a graph showing carbon dioxide levels and temperature global temperature okay evans said just what you would expect carbon dioxide goes up and makes temperatures go up good she said now i want to direct your attention to the period from to as you see during that period the global temperature actually went down you see that yes amp global temperature vs co let me show you a closeup of that period she took out another chart this is a thirtyyear period one third of a century during which temperatures declined crops were damaged by frost in summer glaciers in europe advanced what caused the decline i dont know was carbon dioxide rising during that period yes so if rising carbon dioxide is the cause of rising temperatures why didnt it cause temperatures to rise from to i dont know evans said there must have been another factor or it could be an anomaly there are anomalies within broad secular trends just look at the stock market does the stock market have anomalies that last thirty years he shrugged or it could have been soot or particulate matter in the air there were a lot of particulates back then before environmental laws took effect or maybe some other factor these graphs show that carbon dioxide rose continuously but temperature did not it rose then fell then rose again even so i take it you remain convinced that carbon dioxide has caused the most recent temperature rise yes everybody knows thats the cause does this graph trouble you at all no evans said i admit it raises some questions but then not everything is known about the climate so no the graph doesnt trouble me okay good im glad to hear it lets move on you said this graph was the average of weather stations around the world how reliable is that weather data do you think i have no idea well for example in the late nineteenth century the data were generated by people going out to a little box and writing down the temperature twice a day maybe they forgot for a few days maybe somebody in their family was sick they had to fill it in later that was back then right but how accurate do you think weather records are from poland in the s or russian provinces since not very good i would guess and i would agree so over the last hundred years a fair number of reporting stations around the world may not have provided highquality reliable data that could be evans said over the years which country do you imagine has the bestmaintained network of weather stations over a large area the us right i think there is no dispute about that here is another graph us temperature does this graph look like the first one we saw of world temperatures not exactly what is the change in temperature since looks like uh a third of a degree a third of a degree celsius in a hundred and twenty years not very dramatic she pointed to the graph and what was the warmest year of the last century looks like does this graph indicate to you that global warming is occurring well the temperature is going up for the last thirty years yes but it went down for the previous thirty years and current temperatures in the us are roughly the same as they were in the s so does this graph argue for global warming yes evans said its just not as dramatic in the us as it is in the rest of the world but its still happening does it trouble you that the most accurate temperature record shows the least warming no because global warming is a global phenomenon its not just the us if you had to defend these graphs in a court of law do you think you could persuade a jury of your position or would a jury look at the graph and say this global warming stuff is nothing serious leading the witness he said laughing in fact evans was feeling slightly uneasy but only slightly hed heard such claims before at environmental conferences industry hacks could slap together data that they had massaged and twisted and give a convincing wellprepared speech and before evans knew it hed start to doubt what he knew as if she were reading his mind jennifer said these graphs show solid data peter temperature records from goddard institute for space studies at columbia university carbon dioxide levels from mauna loa and the law dome ice cores in antarctica all generated by researchers who believe firmly in global warming yes he said because the overwhelming consensus of scientists around the world is that global warming is happening and it is a major worldwide threat okay good she said smoothly im glad that none of this changes your views lets turn to some other questions of interest david one of the graduate students leaned forward mr evans id like to talk to you about land use the urban heat island effect and satellite data on the temperature of the troposphere evans thought oh jesus but he just nodded okay amp one of the issues were trying to address concerns how surface temperatures change with land use are you familiar with that issue not really no he looked at his watch frankly you people are working at a level of detail that is beyond me i just listen to what the scientists say and were preparing a lawsuit jennifer said based on what scientists say this level of detail is where the suit will be fought fought evans shrugged whos going to fight it nobody with any stature there isnt a reputable scientist in the world who doesnt believe in global warming on that point you are wrong she said the defense will call full professors from mit harvard columbia duke virginia colorado uc berkeley and other prestigious schools they will call the former president of the national academy of sciences they may also call some nobel prize winners they will bring in professors from england from the max planck institute in germany from stockholm university in sweden these professors will argue that global warming is at best unproven and at worst pure fantasy their research paid for by industry no doubt a few not all archconservatives neocons the focus in litigation she said will be on the data evans looked at them and saw the concern on their faces and he thought they really believe they might lose this thing but this is ridiculous evans said all you have to do is read the newspapers or watch television newspapers and television are susceptible to carefully orchestrated media campaigns lawsuits are not then forget mass media evans said and just read the scientific journals we do theyre not necessarily helpful to our side mr evans we have a lot to go over if youd hold your protestations we can get on with the issues it was at that moment that the phone buzzed and balder delivered him from his torment send the guy from hassle and black into my office he said i have ten minutes for him vanutu team tuesday august pm balder was ensconced in a glasswalled office with his feet up on a glass desk working his way through a stack of briefs and research papers he didnt take his feet down as evans came in you find it interesting he said he meant the interrogation in a way evans said but if youll pardon my saying so i get the sense theyre worried they might lose i have no doubt that we will win this case balder said no doubt whatsoever but i dont want my people thinking that way i want them worried as hell i want my team running scared before any trial and especially this one we are bringing this suit against the epa and in anticipation of that the agency has retained outside counsel in the person of barry beckman whew evans said big guns barry beckman was the most famous litigator of his generation a professor at stanford law school at twentyeight he left the university in his early thirties to go into private practice he had already represented microsoft toyota phillips and a host of other multinationals beckman had an incredibly agile mind a charming manner a quick sense of humor and a photographic memory everyone knew that when he argued before the supreme court as he had done three times already he cited document page numbers as he answered the justices questions your honor i believe you will find that in footnote on the bottom of page like that barry has his faults balder said he has so much information at his fingertips that he can easily slip into irrelevance he likes to hear himself talk his arguments drift i have beaten him once and lost to him once but one thing is sure we can expect an extremely wellprepared opposition isnt it a little unusual to hire an attorney before youve even filed its a tactic balder said the current administration doesnt want to defend this lawsuit they believe they will win but they dont want the negative publicity that will accompany their brief against global warming so they hope to intimidate us into dropping the case and of course we never would especially now that we are fully funded thanks to mr morton thats good evans said at the same time the challenges are significant barry will argue that there is insufficient evidence for global warming he will argue that the supporting science is weak he will argue that the predictions from ten and fifteen years ago have already been shown to be wrong and he will argue that even leading proponents of global warming have publicly expressed doubts about whether it can be predicted whether it is a serious problemand indeed whether its occurring at all leading proponents have said that balder sighed they have in journals ive never read anything of that sort the statements exist barry will dig them out he shook his head some experts have expressed different views at different times some have said rising carbon dioxide isnt a big problem now they say it is so far we dont have a single expert witness that cant be turned or made to look very foolish on cross evans nodded sympathetically he was familiar with this circumstance one of the first things you learned in law school was that the law was not about truth it was about dispute resolution in the course of resolving a dispute the truth might or might not emerge often it did not prosecutors might know a criminal was guilty and still be unable to convict him it happened all the time thats why balder said this case is going to hinge on the sealevel records in the pacific we are collecting all available data records now why does the case hinge on that because i believe balder said that this is a case we should bait and switch the case is about global warming but thats not where the emotional impact is for a jury juries arent comfortable reading graphs and all this talk about tenths of a degree celsius goes right over their heads its technical detail its the quibbles of experts and its incredibly boring for normal people no the jury will see this as a case about helpless victimized impoverished people being flooded out of their ancestral homelands a case about the terror of sea levels rising precipitouslyand inexplicably with no conceivable cause unless you accept that something extraordinary and unprecedented has affected the entire world in recent years something that is causing the sea levels to rise and to threaten the lives of innocent men women and children and that something is global warming balder nodded the jury will have to draw their own conclusions if we can show them a convincing record of rising sea levels we will be on very strong ground when juries see that damage has been done they are inclined to blame somebody okay evans saw where balder was going so the sealevel data is important yes but it needs to be solid irrefutable is that so hard to obtain balder cocked an eyebrow mr evans do you know anything about the study of sea levels no i just know that sea levels are rising around the world unfortunately that claim is in considerable dispute youre joking it is well known balder said that i have no sense of humor but sea level cant be disputed evans said its too simple you put a mark on a dock at high tide measure it year after year watch it go up ampi mean how difficult can it be balder sighed you think sea level is simple trust me its not have you ever heard of the geoid no the geoid is the equipotential surface of the earths gravitational field that approximates the mean sea surface that help you evans shook his head well it is a core concept in the measurement of sea levels balder flipped through the stack of papers in front of him how about glaciohydroisostatic modeling eustatic and tectonic effects on shoreline dynamics holocene sedimentary sequences intertidal foraminifera distributions carbon analysis of coastal paleoenvironments aminostratigraphy no not ringing a bell let me assure you sea level is a fiercely debated specialty he tossed the last of the papers aside thats what im working through now but the disputes within the field give added importance to finding an unimpeachable set of data and you are obtaining this data waiting for them to arrive yes the australians have several sets the french have at least one in moorea and perhaps another in papeete there is a set that was funded by the v allen willy foundation but it may be of too short a duration and other sets as well we will have to see the intercom buzzed the assistant said mr balder its mr drake on the line from nerf all right balder turned to evans extended a hand nice talking with you mr evans again our thanks to george tell him any time he wants to have a look around he can drop by we are always hard at work here good luck to you close the door on your way out balder turned away picking up the phone evans heard him say well nick what the fuck is going on at nerf are you going to fix this for me or not evans closed the door he walked out of balders office with a sense of nagging unease balder was one of the most persuasive men on the planet he had known evans was there on behalf of george morton he knew morton was on the verge of making a huge contribution to the lawsuit balder should have been totally upbeat radiating confidence and he had indeed begun that way i have no doubt we will win this lawsuit but then evans had heard the challenges are significant i do not have a single expert witness who cant be turned this is a case we should bait and switch this case will hinge on sealevel records sea level is a fiercely debated specialty we will have to see it certainly wasnt a conversation calculated to raise evanss level of confidence neither for that matter was the video session hed had with jennifer haynes discussing the scientific problems the lawsuit would face but then as he considered it he decided that these expressions of doubt were actually a sign of confidence on the part of the legal team evans was an attorney himself he had come to learn the issues surrounding the trial and they had been forthright with him it was a case they would win even though it would not be easy because of the complexity of the data and the short attention span of the jury so would he recommend that morton continue of course he would jennifer was waiting for him outside balders office she said theyre ready for you back in the conference room evans said im really sorry i cant my schedule amp i understand she said well do it another time i was wondering if your schedule was really tight or whether there was time for you and me to have lunch oh evans said without missing a beat my schedule isnt that tight good she said culver city tuesday august pm they had lunch in a mexican restaurant in culver city it was quiet there were a handful of film editors in the corner from nearby sony studios a couple of high school kids necking a group of older women in sunhats they sat in a corner booth and both ordered the special evans said balder seems to think the sealevel data is key thats what balder thinks frankly im not so sure why is that nobodys seen all the data but even if its high quality it needs to show a substantial sealevel rise to impress a jury it may not how could it not evans said with glaciers melting and breaking off antarctica even so it may not she said you know the maldive islands in the indian ocean they were concerned about flooding so a team of scandinavian researchers came in to study sea levels the scientists found no rise in several centuriesand a fall in the last twenty years a fall was that published last year she said the food came jennifer gave a dismissive wave of her hand enough shop talk for now she ate her burrito with gusto wiping her chin with the back of her hand he saw a jagged white scar running from her palm down the underside of her forearm she said god i love this food you cant get decent mexican food in dc is that where youre from she nodded i came out to help john he asked you i couldnt turn him down she shrugged so i see my boyfriend on alternate weekends he comes out here or i go back there but if this trial goes forward it will be a year maybe two years i dont think our relationship will make it what does he do your boyfriend attorney evans smiled sometimes i think everyones an attorney everyone is he does securities law not my thing whats your thing witness prep and jury selection psychological analysis of the pool thats why im in charge of the focus groups i see we know that most people we might put on the jury will have heard of global warming and most will probably be inclined to think it is real jesus id hope so evans said i mean its been an established fact for the last fifteen years but we need to determine what people will believe in the face of contrary evidence such as such as the graphs i showed you today or the satellite data you know about the satellite data evans shook his head the theory of global warming predicts that the upper atmosphere will warm from trapped heat just like a greenhouse the surface of the earth warms later but since weve had orbiting satellites that can continuously measure the atmosphere five miles up they show that the upper atmosphere is warming much less than the ground is maybe theres a problem with the data trust me the satellite data have been reanalyzed dozens of times she said theyre probably the most intensely scrutinized data in the world but the data from weather balloons agree with the satellites they show much less warming than expected by the theory she shrugged another problem for us were working on it how we think itll prove too complex for a jury the details of msusmicrowavesounding units crosstrack scanners with fourchannel radiance analysisand the questions about whether channel has been corrected for diurnal drifts and intersatellite offsets timevarying nonlinear instrumental responses ampwe hope it will make them throw up their hands anyway enough of all that she wiped her face with her napkin and again he saw the white scar that ran down the underside of her arm howd you get that he said she shrugged in law school and i thought my school was tough i taught an innercity karate class she said sometimes it went late you want any more of these chips no he said shall we get the check tell me he said theres not a lot to tell one night i got in my car to drive home and a kid jumped in the passenger seat and pulled a gun told me to start driving kid from your class no an older kid late twenties whatd you do i told him to get out he told me to drive so i started the car and as i put it in gear i asked him where he wanted me to go and he was stupid enough to point so i hit him in the windpipe i didnt hit him hard enough and he got off a round blew out the windshield then i hit him again with my elbow couple three times what happened to him he said he died jesus evans said some people make bad decisions she said whatre you staring at me like that for he was sixtwo and twoten and had a record from here to nebraska armed robbery assault with a deadly weapon attempted rapeyou name it you think i should feel sorry for him no evans said quickly you do i can see it in your eyes a lot of people do they go he was just a kid how could you do that let me tell you people dont know what the hell theyre talking about one of us was going to get killed that night im glad it wasnt me but of course it still bothers me ill bet sometimes i wake up in a cold sweat seeing the gunshot blow the windshield in front of my face realizing how close i came to dying i was stupid i should have killed him the first time evans paused he didnt know what to say you ever had a gun at your head she said no amp then you have no idea how it feels do you was there trouble about it he said you bet your ass there was trouble for a while i thought i wasnt going to be able to practice law they claimed i led him on do you believe that shit i never saw the guy in my life but then a very good attorney came to my rescue balder she nodded thats why im here and what about your arm ah hell she said the car crashed and i cut it on the broken glass she signaled to the waitress what do you say we get the check ill do that minutes later they were back outside evans blinked in the milky midday light they walked down the street so evans said i guess youre pretty good at karate good enough they came to the warehouse he shook her hand id really like to have lunch again some time she said she was so direct about it he wondered whether it was personal or whether she wanted him to know how the lawsuit was going because like balder much of what she had said was not encouraging lunch sounds great he said not too long deal will you call me count on it he said beverly hills tuesday august pm it was almost dark when he went home to his apartment and parked in the garage facing the alley he was going up the back stairs when the landlady poked her head out the window you just missed them she said who the cable repair people they just left i didnt call any cable repair people he said did you let them in of course not they said they would wait for you they just left evans had never heard of cable repair people waiting for anyone how long did they wait not long maybe ten minutes okay he got up to the secondfloor landing a tag was hooked on his doorknob sorry we missed you there was a check box to call again to reschedule service then he saw the problem the address was listed as roxbury his address was roxbury but the address was on the front door not the back door theyd just made a mistake he lifted his doormat to check on the key he kept there it was right where hed left it it hadnt been moved there was even a ring of dust around it he unlocked the door and went inside he went to the refrigerator and saw the old container of yogurt he needed to go to the supermarket but he was too tired he checked the messages to see if janis or carol had called they hadnt now of course there was the prospect of jennifer haynes but she had a boyfriend she lived in dc and amphe knew it would never work he thought of calling janis but decided not to he took a shower and was considering calling for pizza delivery he lay down on the bed to relax for a minute before he called and he fell immediately asleep century city wednesday august am the meeting was held in the big conference room on the fourteenth floor mortons four accountants were there his assistant sarah jones herb lowenstein who did estate planning a guy named marty bren who did tax work for nerf and evans morton who hated all financial meetings paced restlessly lets get to it he said i am supposedly giving ten million dollars to nerf and we have signed papers is that right right lowenstein said but now they want to attach a rider to the agreement right marty bren said its pretty standard boilerplate for them he shuffled through his papers any charity wants to have full use of the money they receive even when it is earmarked for a particular purpose maybe that purpose costs more or less than predicted or it is delayed or mired in litigation or set aside for some other reason in this case the money has been earmarked for the vanutu lawsuit and the relevant phrase nerf wants to add is said moneys to be used to defray the cost of the vanutu litigation including fees filing and copying costs ampblah blah ampor for other legal purposes or for such other purposes as nerf shall see fit in its capacity as an environmental organization morton said thats the phrase they want boilerplate as i said bren said its been in my previous donation agreements i dont recall offhand because morton said it sounds to me like they want to be able to pull the plug on this lawsuit and spend the money elsewhere oh i doubt that herb said why morton said why else would they want this boilerplate look we had a signed deal now they want a change why its not really a change bren said it sure as hell is marty if you look at the original agreement bren said calmly it says that any money not spent on the lawsuit goes to nerf for other purposes but thats only if theres money left after the lawsuit ends morton said they cant spend it on anything else until the suit is decided i think they imagine there may be long delays here why should there be delays morton turned to evans peter what is going on over there in culver city it looks like the suit is going forward evans said they have a large operation there must be forty people working on that one case i dont think they plan to give it up and are there problems with the suit there are certainly challenges evans said its complicated litigation they face strong opposing counsel theyre working hard why am i not convinced here morton said six months ago nick drake told me this damn lawsuit was a slam dunk and a great publicity opportunity and now they want a bailout clause maybe we should ask nick i got a better idea lets audit nerf murmurs in the room i dont think you have that right george make it part of the agreement im not sure you can do that they want a rider i want a rider whats the difference im not sure you can audit their entire operation george herb lowenstein said you and nick are friends of long standing youre their concerned citizen of the year auditing them seems a little out of character for your relationship you mean it looks like i dont trust them put bluntly yes i dont morton leaned on the table and looked at everyone sitting there you know what i think they want to blow off the litigation and spend all the money on this conference on abrupt climate change that nick is so excited about they dont need ten million for a conference i dont know what they need he already misplaced two hundred and fifty thousand of my money it ended up in fucking vancouver i dont know what he is doing anymore well then you should withdraw your contribution ah ah marty bren said not so fast i think theyve already made financial commitments based on the reasonable expectation that the money was coming then give them some amount and forget the rest no morton said im not going to withdraw the grant peter evans here says the litigation is going forward and i believe him nick says that the two hundred and fifty grand was a mistake and i believe him i want you to ask for an audit and i want to know what happens i will be out of town for the next three weeks you will where im taking a trip but well have to be able to reach you george i may be unreachable call sarah or have peter here get in touch with me but george thats it guys talk to nick see what he says well be in contact soon and he walked out of the room with sarah hurrying after him lowenstein turned to the others what the hell was that all about vancouver thursday august pm thunder rumbled ominously looking out the front windows of his office nat damon sighed he had always known that that submarine lease would mean trouble after the check bounced he had canceled the order hoping that that would be the end of it but it wasnt for weeks and weeks he had heard nothing but then one of the men the lawyer in the shiny suit had come back unexpectedly to poke a finger in his face and tell him that he had signed a nondisclosure agreement and could not discuss any aspect of the submarine lease with anybody or risk a lawsuit maybe well win and maybe well lose the lawyer said but either way youre out of business friend your house is mortgaged youre in debt for the rest of your life so think it over and keep your mouth shut all during this damons heart was pounding because the fact was damon had already been contacted by some sort of revenue service guy a man named kenner who was coming to damons office that very afternoon to ask a few questions he had said damon had been afraid that this kenner would show up while the lawyer was still in his office but now the lawyer was driving away his car a nondescript buick sedan with ontario plates drove through the boatyard and was gone damon started to clean up the office getting ready to go home he was toying with the idea of leaving before kenner arrived kenner was some revenue agent damon had done nothing wrong he didnt have to meet any revenue agent and if he did what would he do say he couldnt answer questions the next thing hed be subpoenaed or something dragged into court damon decided to leave there was more thunder and the crack of distant lightning a big storm was moving in as he was closing up he saw that the lawyer had left his cell phone on the counter he looked out to see if the lawyer was coming back for it not yet but surely he would realize he had left it and come back damon decided to leave before he showed up hastily he slipped the cell phone in his pocket turned out the lights and locked the office the first drops of rain were spattering the pavement as he went to his car parked right in front he opened the door and was climbing into the car when the cell phone rang he hesitated not sure what to do the phone rang insistently a jagged bolt of lightning crashed down striking the mast of one of the ships in the boatyard in the next instant there was a burst of light by the car a blast of furious heat that knocked him to the ground dazed he tried to get up he was thinking that his car had exploded but it hadnt the car was intact the door blackened then he saw that his trousers were on fire he stared stupidly at his own legs not moving he heard the rumble of thunder and realized that he had been struck by lightning my god he thought i was hit by lightning he sat up and slapped at his trousers trying to put out the fire it wasnt working and his legs were beginning to feel pain he had a fire extinguisher inside the office staggering to his feet he moved unsteadily to his office he was unlocking the door his fingers fumbling when there was another explosion he felt a sharp pain in his ears reached up touched blood he looked at his bloody fingertips fell over and died century city thursday september pm under normal circumstances peter evans spoke to george morton every day sometimes twice a day so after a week went by without hearing from him evans called his house he spoke to sarah i have no idea what is going on she said two days ago he was in north dakota north dakota the day before that he was in chicago i think he might be in wyoming today hes made noises about going to boulder colorado but i dont know whats in boulder evans said i havent a clue too early for snow has he got a new girlfriend sometimes morton disappeared when he was involved with a new woman not that i know sarah said whats he doing i have no idea it sounds like he has a shopping list a shopping list well she said sort of he wanted me to buy some kind of special gps unit you know for locating position then he wanted some special video camera using ccd or ccf or something had to be rushordered from hong kong and yesterday he told me to buy a new ferrari from a guy in monterey and have it shipped to san francisco another ferrari i know she said how many ferraris can one man use and this one doesnt seem up to his usual standards from the email pictures it looks kind of beat up maybe hes going to have it restored if he was hed send it to reno thats where his car restorer is he detected a note of concern in her voice is everything okay sarah between you and me i dont know she said the ferrari he bought is a gts daytona spyder so he already has one peter its like he doesnt know and he sounds weird when you talk to him weird in what way just ampweird not his usual self at all whos traveling with him as far as i know nobody evans frowned that was very odd morton hated being alone evanss immediate inclination was to disbelieve it what about that guy kenner and his nepali friend last i heard they were going to vancouver and on to japan so theyre not with him uh huh when i hear from him ill let him know you called evans hung up feeling dissatisfied on an impulse he dialed mortons cell phone but he got the voice mail this is george at the beep and the quick beep george this is peter evans just checking in to see if theres anything you need call me at the office if i can help he hung up and stared out the window then he dialed again center for risk analysis professor kenners office please in a moment he got the secretary this is peter evans im looking for professor kenner oh yes mr evans dr kenner said you might call he did yes are you trying to reach dr kenner yes i am hes in tokyo at the moment would you like his cell phone please she gave him the number and he wrote it down on his yellow pad he was about to call when his assistant heather came in to say that something at lunch had disagreed with her and she was going home for the afternoon feel better he said sighing with her gone he was obliged to answer his own phone and the next call was from margo lane georges mistress asking where the hell george was evans was on the phone with her for the better part of half an hour and then nicholas drake walked into his office i am very concerned drake said he stood at the window hands clasped behind his back staring at the office building opposite about what this kenner person that george is spending so much time with i dont know that theyre spending time together of course they are you dont seriously believe george is alone do you evans said nothing george is never alone we both know that peter i dont like this situation at all not at all george is a good mani dont have to tell you thatbut he is susceptible to influence including the wrong influence you think a professor at mit is the wrong influence ive looked into professor kenner drake said and there are a few mysteries about him oh his rйsumй says he spent a number of years in government department of the interior intergovernmental negotiating committee and so on yes the department of the interior has no record of his working there evans shrugged it was more than ten years ago government records being what they are amp possibly drake said but there is more professor kenner comes back to mit works there for eight years very successfully consultant to the epa consultant to department of defense god knows what elseand then he suddenly goes on extended leave and no one seems to know what happened to him since he just fell off the radar i dont know evans said his card says he is director of risk analysis but hes on leave i dont know what the hell he is doing these days i dont know who supports him i take it youve met him briefly and now he and george are great pals i dont know nick i havent seen or spoken to george in more than a week hes off with kenner i dont know that but you know that he and kenner went to vancouver actually i didnt know let me lay it out for you plainly drake said i have it on good authority that john kenner has unsavory connections the center for risk analysis is wholly funded by industry groups i neednt say more in addition mr kenner spent a number of years advising the pentagon and in fact was so involved with them that he even underwent some sort of training for a period of time you mean military training yes fort bragg and harvey point in north carolina drake said there is no question the man has military connections as well as industry connections and i am told he is hostile toward mainstream environmental organizations i hate to think of a man like that working on poor george i wouldnt worry about george he can see through propaganda i hope so but frankly i do not share your confidence this military man shows up and the next thing we know george is trying to audit us i mean my god why would he want to do that doesnt george realize what a waste of resources that involves time money everything it would be a tremendous drag on my time i wasnt aware an audit was going forward its being discussed of course we have nothing to hide and we can be audited at any time i have always said so but this is an especially busy time with the vanutu lawsuit starting up and the conference on abrupt climate change to be planned for all thats in the next few weeks i wish i could speak to george evans shrugged call his cell i have have you yes he call you back no evans said drake shook his head that man he said is my concerned citizen of the year and i cant even get him on the phone beverly hills monday september am morton sat at a sidewalk table outside a cafй on beverly drive at eight in the morning waiting for sarah to show up his assistant was ordinarily punctual and her apartment was not far away unless she had taken up with that actor again young people had so much time to waste on bad relationships he sipped his coffee glancing at the wall street journal without much interest he had even less interest after an unusual couple sat down at the next table the woman was petite and strikingly beautiful with dark hair and an exotic look she might have been moroccan it was hard to judge from her accent her clothing was chic and out of place in casual los angelestightfitting skirt spike heels chanel jacket the man who accompanied her could not have been more different he was a redfaced beefy american with slightly piggish features wearing a sweater baggy khakis and running shoes he was as big as a football player he slumped at the table and said ill have a latte sweetheart nonfat grande she said i thought you would get one for me like a gentleman im not a gentleman he said and youre no fucking lady not after you didnt come home last night so we can forget about ladies and gentlemen okay she pouted chйri do not make a scene hey i asked you to get a fucking latte whos making a scene but chйri you going to get it or not he glared at her ive really had it with you marisa you know that you dont own me she said i do as i please youve made that obvious during this conversation mortons paper had been slowly drifting downward now he folded it flat set it on his knee and pretended to read but in fact he could not take his eyes off this woman she was extremely beautiful he decided although not very young she was probably thirtyfive her maturity somehow made her more overtly sexual he was captivated she said to the football player william you are tiresome you want me to leave perhaps it is best oh fuck you he said and slapped her morton could not restrain himself hey he said take it easy there the woman gave him a smile the beefy man stood up fists bunched mind your own fucking business you dont hit the lady pal how about just you and me he said shaking his fist at that moment a beverly hills cruiser drove by morton looked at it and waved the cruiser came over to the curb everything all right one of the cops said just fine officer morton said fuck this noise the football player said and turned away he stalked off up the street the dark woman smiled at morton thank you for that no problem did i hear you say you wanted a latte she smiled again she crossed her legs exposing brown knees if you would be so kind morton was standing to get it when sarah called to him hey george sorry to be late she came jogging up in a tracksuit as always she looked very beautiful anger flashed across the dark womans features it was fleeting but morton caught it and he thought something is wrong here he didnt know this woman she had no reason to be angry probably he decided she had wanted to teach the boyfriend a lesson even now the guy was hanging around at the end of the block pretending to look in a shop window but at this early hour all the shops were closed ready to go sarah said morton made brief apologies to the woman who made little gestures of indifference he had the feeling now that she was french perhaps we will meet again he said yes she said but i doubt it i am sorry зa va have a nice day as they walked off sarah said who was that i dont know she sat down at the next table spicy little number he shrugged did i interrupt something no thats good she handed morton three manila folders this ones your contributions to nerf to date this one is the agreement for the last contribution so you have the language and this one is the cashiers check you wanted be careful with that its a big number okay its not a problem im leaving in an hour you want to tell me where morton shook his head its better you dont know century city monday september am evans had heard nothing from morton for almost two weeks he could not remember ever having gone so long without contact with his client he had lunch with sarah who was visibly anxious do you hear from him at all he said not a word what do the pilots say theyre in van nuys hes rented a different plane i dont know where he is and hes coming back amp she shrugged who knows and so it was with considerable surprise that he received sarahs call that day you better get going she said george wants to see you right away where at nerf in beverly hills hes back ill say it was a tenminute drive from his offices in century city to the nerf building of course the national environmental resource fund was headquartered in washington dc but they had recently opened a west coast office in beverly hills cynics claimed that nerf had done it to be closer to the hollywood celebrities who were so essential to their fundraising but that was just gossip evans half expected to find morton pacing outside but he was nowhere in sight evans went into the reception area and was told that morton was in the thirdfloor conference room he walked up to the third floor the conference room was glasswalled on two sides the interior was furnished with a large boardroomstyle table and eighteen chairs there was an audiovisual unit in the corner for presentations evans saw three people in the conference room and an argument in progress morton stood at the front of the room redfaced gesticulating drake was also standing pacing back and forth pointing an angry finger at morton and shouting back at him evans also saw john henley the saturnine head of pr for nerf he was bent over making notes on a yellow legal pad it was clearly an argument between morton and drake evans was not sure what to do so he stood there after a moment morton saw him and made a quick jabbing motion indicating that evans should sit down outside he did and watched the argument through the glass it turned out there was a fourth person in the room as well evans hadnt seen him at first because he was hunched down behind the podium but when that person stood evans saw a workman in clean neatly pressed overalls carrying a briefcasestyle toolbox and with a couple of electronic meters clipped to his belt on his chest pocket a logo read av network systems the workman looked confused apparently drake didnt want the workman in the room during the argument whereas morton seemed to like an audience drake wanted the guy to go morton insisted he stay caught in the middle the workman looked uncomfortable and ducked down out of sight again but soon after drake prevailed and the workman left as the workman walked past him evans said rough day the workman shrugged they got a lot of network problems in this building he said myself i think its bad ethernet cable or the routers are overheating amp and he walked on back inside the argument raged fiercer than ever it continued for another five minutes the glass was almost entirely soundproof but from time to time when they shouted evans could hear a phrase he heard morton yell god damn it i want to win and he heard drake reply its just too risky which made morton even angrier and later morton said dont we have to fight for the most important issue facing our planet and drake answered something about being practical or facing reality and morton said fuck reality at which point the pr guy henley glanced up and said my sentiments exactly or something like that evans had the distinct impression that this argument concerned the vanutu lawsuit but it seemed to range over a number of other subjects as well and then quite abruptly morton came out slamming the door so hard that the glass walls shook fuck those guys evans fell into step with his client through the glass he saw the other two men huddle whispering together fuck em george said loudly he paused and looked back if we have right on our side shouldnt we be telling the truth inside drake just shook his head sorrowfully fuck em morton said again walking off evans said you wanted me here yes morton pointed you know who that other guy was yes he said john henley correct those two guys are nerf george said i dont care how many celebrity trustees they have on their letterhead or how many lawyers they keep on staff those two run the show and everyone else rubberstamps none of the trustees really knows anything about what is going on otherwise they wouldnt be a part of this and let me tell you im not going to be a part of this not anymore they started walking down the stairs meaning what evans said to him meaning morton said im not giving them that tenmilliondollar grant for the lawsuit you told them that no he said i did not tell them that and you will not tell them that either i think ill let it be a surprise for later he smiled grimly but draw up the papers now are you sure about this george dont piss me off kid im just asking and i said draw up the papers so do it evans said he would today evans said he would do it at once evans waited until they got to the parking garage before he spoke again he walked morton to his waiting town car his driver harry opened the door for him evans said george you have that nerf banquet honoring you next week is that still going ahead absolutely morton said i wouldnt miss it for the world he got in the car and harry closed the door good day sir harry said to evans and the car drove off into the morning sunlight he called from his car sarah i know i know what is going on he wont tell me but hes really angry peter really angry i got that impression and he just left again what he left said he would be back in a week in time to fly everybody up to san francisco for the banquet drake called evanss cell phone what is going on peter i have no idea nick the mans demented the things he was saying ampcould you hear him no actually hes demented i really am worried about him i mean as a friend to say nothing of our banquet next week i mean is he going to be all right i think so hes taking a planeload of friends up there are you sure thats what sarah says can i talk to george can you set something up my understanding evans said is that he just went out of town again its that damn kenner hes behind all this i dont know whats going on with george nick all i know is hes coming to the banquet i want you to promise me youll deliver him nick evans said george does what he wants thats what im afraid of to san francisco monday october pm flying up on his gulfstream morton brought several of the most prominent celebrity supporters of nerf these included two rock stars the wife of a comedian an actor who played the president on a television series a writer who had recently run for governor and two environmental lawyers from other firms over white wine and smoked salmon canapйs the discussion became quite lively focusing on what the united states as the worlds leading economy should be doing to promote environmental sanity uncharacteristically morton did not join in instead he slumped in the back of the plane looking irritable and gloomy evans sat beside him keeping him company morton was drinking straight vodka he was already on his second i brought the papers cancelling your grant evans said taking them out of his briefcase if you still want to do this i do morton scribbled his signature hardly looking at the documents he said keep those safe until tomorrow he looked back at his guests who were now trading statistics on species loss as the rain forests of the world were cut down off to one side ted bradley the actor who played the president was talking about how he preferred his electric carwhich he pointed out he had owned for many years nowto the new hybrids that were so popular theres no comparison he was saying the hybrids are nice but theyre not the real thing at the center table ann garner who sat on the boards of environmental organizations was arguing that los angeles needed to build more public transportation so that people could get out of their cars americans she said belched out more carbon dioxide than any other people on the planet and it was disgraceful ann was the beautiful wife of a famous attorney and always intense especially on environmental issues morton sighed he turned to evans do you know how much pollution were creating right this minute well burn four hundred fifty gallons of aviation fuel to take twelve people to san francisco just by making this trip theyre generating more pollution per capita than most people on the planet will generate in a year he finished his vodka and rattled the ice in the glass irritably he handed the glass to evans who dutifully signaled for more if theres anything worse than a limousine liberal morton said its a gulfstream environmentalist but george evans said youre a gulfstream environmentalist i know it morton said and i wish it bothered me more but you know what it doesnt i like flying around in my own airplane evans said i heard you were in north dakota and chicago i was yes whatd you do there i spent money a lot of money a lot evans said you bought some art no i bought something far more expensive than art i bought integrity youve always had integrity evans said oh not my integrity morton said i bought somebody elses evans didnt know what to say to that for a minute he thought morton was joking i was going to tell you about it morton continued i got a list of numbers kid and i want you to get it to kenner it is very muchfor later hello ann ann garner was coming toward them so george are you back for a while because we need you here now the vanutu lawsuit which thank god you are backing and the climate change conference that nick has scheduled and its so importantmy god george this is crunch time evans started to stand to let ann take his seat but morton pushed him back down again ann he said i must say you look more lovely than ever but peter and i are having a small business discussion she glanced at the papers and evanss open briefcase oh i didnt know i was interrupting no no if youd just give us a minute of course im sorry but she lingered this is so unlike you george doing business on the plane i know morton said but if you must know i am feeling quite unlike myself these days that made her blink she didnt know how to take it so she smiled nodded and moved away morton said she looks wonderful i wonder who did her work her work shes had more in the last few months i think eyes maybe chin anyway he said waving his hand about the list of numbers you are to tell this to no one peter no one not anyone in the law firm and especially not anyone at george damn it why are you hiding back there evans looked over his shoulder and saw ted bradley coming toward them ted was already drinking heavily though it was only noon it hasnt been the same without you george my god the world without bradley is a boring world oops i mean without george morton is a boring world come on george get up out of there that man is a lawyer come and have a drink morton allowed himself to be led away he glanced over his shoulder at evans later he said san francisco monday october pm the grand ballroom of the mark hopkins hotel was darkened for the afterdinner speeches the audience was elegant the men in tuxedos the women in ball gowns beneath the ornate chandeliers the voice of nicholas drake boomed from the podium ladies and gentlemen it is no exaggeration to say that we face an environmental crisis of unprecedented proportions our forests are disappearing our lakes and rivers are polluted the plants and animals that make up our biosphere are vanishing at unprecedented rates forty thousand species become extinct every year thats fifty species every single day at present rates we will lose half of all species on our planet in the next few decades it is the greatest extinction in the history of earth and what is the texture of our own lives our food is contaminated with lethal pesticides our crops are failing from global warming our weather is growing worse and more severe flooding droughts hurricanes tornadoes all around the globe our sea levels are risingtwentyfive feet in the next century and possibly more and most fearsome of all new scientific evidence points to the specter of abrupt climate change as a result of our destructive behavior in short ladies and gentlemen we are confronted by a genuine global catastrophe for our planet sitting at the center table peter evans looked around at the audience they were staring down at their plates yawning leaning over and talking to one another drake wasnt getting a lot of attention theyve heard it before morton growled he shifted his heavy frame and gave a soft belch he had been drinking steadily through the evening and was now quite drunk amploss of biodiversity shrinking of habitat destruction of the ozone layer amp nicholas drake appeared tall and ungainly his tuxedo illfitting the collar of his shirt was bunched up around his scrawny neck as always he gave the impression of an impoverished but dedicated academic a latterday ichabod crane evans thought no one would ever guess that drake was paid a third of a million dollars a year to head the fund plus another hundred thousand in expenses or that he had no science background at all nick drake was a trial attorney one of five who had started nerf many years before and like all trial attorneys he knew the importance of not dressing too well ampthe erosion of bioreservoirs the rise of ever more exotic and lethal diseases amp i wish hed hurry up morton said he drummed his fingers on the table evans said nothing he had attended enough of these functions to know that morton was always tense if he had to speak at the podium drake was saying ampglimmers of hope faint rays of positive energy and none more positive and hopeful than the man whose lifelong dedication we are here to honor tonight amp can i get another drink morton said finishing the last of his martini it was his sixth he set the glass on the table with a thud evans turned to look for the waiter raising his hand he was hoping the waiter wouldnt come over in time george had had enough ampfor three decades has dedicated his considerable resources and energy to making our world a better healthier saner place ladies and gentlemen the national environmental resource fund is proud amp ah screw never mind morton said he tensed his body ready to push back from the table i hate making a fool of myself even for a good cause why should you make a fool of evans began ampmy good friend and colleague and this years concerned citizen ampmr george morton the room filled with applause and a spotlight hit morton as he stood and headed toward the podium a hunched bear of a man physically powerful solemn head down evans was alarmed when morton stumbled on the first step and for a moment he feared his boss would fall backward but morton regained his balance and as he stepped to the stage he seemed all right he shook hands with drake and moved to the podium gripping it on both sides with his large hands morton looked out at the room turning his head from side to side surveying the audience he did not speak he just stood there and said nothing ann garner sitting beside evans gave him a nudge is he all right oh yes absolutely evans said nodding but in truth he wasnt sure finally george morton began to speak id like to thank nicholas drake and the national environmental resource fund for this award but i dont feel i deserve it not with all the work that remains to be done do you know my friends that we know more about the moon than we do about the earths oceans thats a real environmental problem we dont know enough about the planet we depend on for our very lives but as montaigne said three hundred years ago nothing is so firmly believed as that which is least known evans thought montaigne george morton quoting montaigne in the glare of the spotlight morton was distinctly weaving back and forth he was gripping the podium for balance the room was absolutely silent people were not moving at all even the waiters had stopped moving between the tables evans held his breath all of us in the environmental movement morton said have seen many wonderful victories over the years we have witnessed the creation of the epa we have seen the air and water made cleaner sewage treatment improved toxic dumps cleaned up and we have regulated common poisons like lead for the safety of all these are real victories my friends we take justifiable pride in them and we know more needs to be done the audience was relaxing morton was moving onto familiar ground but will the work get done i am not sure i know my mood has been dark since the death of my beloved wife dorothy evans sat bolt upright in his chair at the next table herb lowenstein looked shocked his mouth open george morton had no wife or rather he had six exwivesnone named dorothy dorothy urged me to spend my money wisely i always thought i did now i am less sure i said before that we dont know enough but i fear that today the watchword of nerf has become we dont sue enough you could hear breath sucked in sharply all around the room nerf is a law firm i dont know if you realize that it was started by lawyers and it is run by lawyers but i now believe money is better spent on research than litigation and that is why i am withdrawing my funding for nerf and why i am for the next few moments morton could not be heard above the excited jabber of the crowd everyone was talking loudly there were scattered boos some guests got up to leave morton continued to talk seemingly oblivious to the effect he was having evans caught a few phrases ampone environmental charity is under fbi investigation amp complete lack of oversight amp ann garner leaned over and hissed get him off there what do you want me to do evans whispered go and get him hes obviously drunk that may be but i cant you have to stop this but on the stage drake was already moving forward saying all right thank you george because to tell the truth right now thank you george drake said again moving closer he was actually pushing against mortons bulk trying to shove him away from the podium okay okay morton said clinging to the podium i said what i did for dorothy my dear dead wife thank you george drake was applauding now holding his hands up at head height nodding to the audience to join with him thank you ampwho i miss desperately amp ladies and gentlemen please join me in thanking yeah okay im leaving to muted applause morton shambled off the stage drake immediately stepped up to the podium and signaled the band they started into a rousing rendition of billy joels you may be right which someone had told them was mortons favorite song it was but it seemed a poor choice under the circumstances herb lowenstein leaned over from the next table and grabbed evans by the shoulder pulling him close listen he whispered fiercely get him out of here i will evans said dont worry did you know this was going to happen no i swear to god lowenstein released evans just as george morton returned to the table the assembled group was stunned but morton was singing cheerfully with the music you may be right i may be crazy amp come on george evans said standing up lets get out of here morton ignored him ampbut it just may be a loonatic youre looking for amp george what do you say evans took him by the arm lets go ampturn out the light dont try to save me amp im not trying to save you evans said then how about another damn martini morton said no longer singing his eyes were cold a little resentful i think i fucking earned it harry will have one for you in the car evans said steering morton away from the table if you stay here youll have to wait for it and you dont want to wait for a drink right now amp evans continued talking and morton allowed himself to be led out of the room amptoo late to fight he sang too late to change me amp before they could get out of the room there was a tv camera with lights shining in their faces and two reporters shoving small tape recorders in front of morton everybody was yelling questions evans put his head down and said excuse us sorry coming through excuse us amp morton never stopped singing they made their way through the hotel lobby the reporters were running in front of them trying to get some distance ahead so they could film them walking forward evans gripped morton firmly by the elbow as morton sang i was only having fun wasnt hurting anyone and we all enjoyed the weekend for a change amp this way evans said heading for the door i was stranded in the combat zone amp and then at last they were through the swinging doors and outside in the night morton stopped singing abruptly when the cold air hit him they waited for his limousine to pull around sarah came out and stood beside morton she didnt say anything she just put her hand on his arm then the reporters came out and the lights came on again and then drake burst through the doors saying god damn it george he broke off when he saw the cameras he glared at morton turned and went back inside the cameras remained on but the three of them just stood there it was awkward just waiting after what seemed like an eternity the limousine pulled up harry came around and opened the door for george okay george evans said no not tonight harrys waiting george i said not tonight there was a deepthroated growl in the darkness and a silver ferrari convertible pulled up alongside the limousine my car morton said he started down the stairs lurching a bit sarah said george i dont think but he was singing again and you told me not to drive but i made it home alive so you said that only proves that im insayyynnne one of the reporters muttered hes insane all right evans followed morton very concerned morton gave the parking attendant a hundred dollar bill saying a twenty for you my good man he fumbled with the ferrari door these crummy italian imports then he got behind the wheel of the convertible gunned the engine and smiled ah a manly sound evans leaned over the car george let harry drive you besides he added dont we need to talk about something we do not but i thought kid get out of my way the camera lights were still on them but morton moved so that he was in the shadow cast by evanss body you know the buddhists have a saying what saying remember it kid goes like this all that matters is not remote from where the buddha sits george i really think you should not be driving will you remember what i just said to you yes wisdom of the ages goodbye kid and he accelerated roaring out of the parking lot as evans jumped back the ferrari squealed around the corner ignoring a stop sign and was gone peter come on evans turned and saw sarah standing by the limousine harry was getting in behind the wheel evans got in the back seat with sarah and they drove off after morton the ferrari turned left at the bottom of the hill disappearing around the corner harry accelerated handling the huge limousine with skill evans said do you know where hes going no idea she said who wrote his speech he did really he was working in the house all day yesterday and he wouldnt let me see what he was doing amp jesus evans said montaigne he had a book of quotations out whered he come up with dorothy she shook her head i have no idea they passed golden gate park traffic was light the ferrari was moving fast weaving among the cars ahead was the golden gate bridge brightly lit in the night morton accelerated the ferrari was going almost ninety miles an hour hes going to marin sarah said evanss cell phone rang it was drake will you tell me what the hell that was all about im sorry nick i dont know was he serious about withdrawing his support i think he was thats unbelievable hes obviously suffered a nervous breakdown i couldnt say i was afraid of this drake said i was afraid something like this might happen you remember on the plane coming back from iceland i said it to you and you told me i shouldnt worry is that your opinion now that i shouldnt worry i dont know what youre asking nick ann garner said he signed some papers on the plane thats right he did are they related to this sudden and inexplicable withdrawal of support for the organization that he loved and cherished he seems to have changed his mind about that evans said and why didnt you tell me he instructed me not to fuck you evans im sorry evans said not as sorry as you will be the phone went dead drake had hung up evans flipped the phone shut sarah said drake is mad furious off the bridge morton headed west away from the lights of the freeway onto a dark road skirting the cliffs he was driving faster than ever evans said to harry do you know where we are i believe were in a state park harry was trying to keep up but on this narrow twisting road the limousine was no match for the ferrari it moved farther and farther ahead soon they could see only the taillights disappearing around curves a quarter mile ahead were going to lose him evans said i doubt it sir but the limousine fell steadily behind after harry took one turn too fastthe big rear end lost traction and swung wide toward a cliffs edgethey were obliged to slow down even more they were in a desolate area now the night was dark and the cliffs deserted a rising moon put a streak of silver on the black water far below up ahead they no longer saw any taillights it seemed they were alone on the dark road they came around a curve and saw the next curve a hundred yards aheadobscured by billowing gray smoke oh no sarah said putting her hand to her mouth the ferrari had spun out struck a tree and flipped over it now lay upside down a crumpled and smoking mass it had very nearly gone off the cliff itself the nose of the car was hanging over the edge evans and sarah ran forward evans got down on his hands and knees and crawled along the cliffs edge trying to see into the drivers compartment it was hard to see much of anythingthe front windshield was flattened and the ferrari lay almost flush to the pavement harry came over with a flashlight and evans used it to peer inside the compartment was empty mortons black bow tie was dangling from the doorknob but otherwise he was gone he must have been thrown evans shone the light down the cliff it was crumbling yellow rock descending steeply for eighty feet to the ocean below he saw no sign of morton sarah was crying softly harry had gone back to get a fire extinguisher from the limousine evans swung his light back and forth over the rock face he did not see georges body in fact he did not see any sign of george at all no disturbance no path no bits of clothing nothing behind him he heard the whoosh of the fire extinguisher he crawled away from the cliffs edge did you see him sir harry said his face full of pain no i didnt see anything perhaps ampover there harry pointed toward the tree and he was right if morton had been thrown from the car by the initial impact he might be twenty yards back on the road evans walked back and shone his flashlight down the cliff again the battery was running down the beam was weakening but almost immediately he saw a glint of light off a mans patent leather slipper wedged among the rocks at the edge of the water he sat down in the road and put his head in his hands and cried point moody tuesday october am by the time the police were finished talking with them and a rescue team had rappelled down the cliff to recover the shoe it was three oclock in the morning they found no other sign of the body and the cops talking among themselves agreed that the prevailing currents would probably carry the body up the coast to pismo beach well find him one said in about a week or so or at least whats left by the great whites now the wreck was being cleared away and loaded onto a flatbed truck evans wanted to leave but the highway patrolman who had taken evanss statement kept coming back to ask for more details he was a kid in his early twenties it seemed he had not filled out many of these forms before the first time he came back to evans he said how soon after the accident would you say you arrived on the scene evans said im not sure the ferrari was about half a mile ahead of us maybe more we were probably going forty miles an hour so ampmaybe a minute later the kid looked alarmed you were going forty in that limo on this road well dont hold me to it then he came back and said you said you were the first on the scene you told me you crawled around at the edge of the road thats right so you would have stepped on broken glass on the road yes the windshield was shattered i had it on my hands too when i crouched down so that explains why the glass was disturbed yes lucky you didnt cut your hands yes the third time he came back he said in your estimation what time did the accident occur what time evans looked at his watch i have no idea but let me see amp he tried to work backward the speech must have started about eightthirty morton would have left the hotel at nine through san francisco then over the bridge ampmaybe ninefortyfive or ten at night so five hours ago roughly yes the kid said huh as if he were surprised evans looked over at the flatbed truck which now held the crumpled remains of the ferrari one cop was standing on the flatbed beside the car three other cops were on the street talking with some animation there was another man there wearing a tuxedo he was talking to the cops when the man turned evans was surprised to see that it was john kenner whats going on evans asked the kid i dont know they just asked me to check on the time of the accident then the driver got into the flatbed truck and started the engine one of the cops yelled to the kid forget it eddie never mind then the kid said to evans i guess everythings okay evans looked over at sarah to see if she had noticed kenner she was leaning on the limousine talking on the phone evans looked back in time to see kenner get into a dark sedan driven by the nepali guy and drive off the cops were leaving the flatbed turned around and headed up the road toward the bridge harry said looks like its time to go evans got into the limousine they drove back toward the lights of san francisco to los angeles tuesday october pm mortons jet flew back to los angeles at noon the mood was somber all the same people were on board and a few more but they sat quietly saying little the lateedition papers had printed the story that millionaire philanthropist george morton depressed by the death of his beloved wife dorothy had given a disjointed speech termed rambling and illogical by the san francisco chronicle and a few hours later had died in a tragic automobile crash while testdriving his new ferrari in the third paragraph the reporter mentioned that singlecar fatalities were frequently caused by undiagnosed depression and were often disguised suicides and this according to a quoted psychiatrist was the likely explanation for mortons death about ten minutes into the flight the actor ted bradley said i think we should drink a toast in memory of george and observe a minute of silence and to a chorus of hear hear glasses of champagne were passed all around to george morton ted said a great american a great friend and a great supporter of the environment we and the planet will miss him for the next ten minutes the celebrities on board remained relatively subdued but slowly the conversation picked up and finally they began to talk and argue as usual evans was sitting in the back in the same seat he had occupied when they flew up he watched the action at the table in the center where bradley was now explaining that the us got only percent of its energy from sustainable sources and that we needed a crash program to build thousands of offshore wind farms like england and denmark were doing the talk moved on to fuel cells hydrogen cars and photovoltaic households running off the grid some talked about how much they loved their hybrid cars which they had bought for their staff to drive evans felt his spirits improve as he listened to them despite the loss of george morton there were still lots of people like thesefamous highprofile people committed to changewho would lead the next generation to a more enlightened future he was starting to drift off to sleep when nicholas drake dropped into the seat beside his drake leaned across the aisle listen he said i owe you an apology for last night thats all right evans said i was way out of line and i want you to know im sorry for how i behaved i was upset and very worried you know george has been acting weird as hell the last couple of weeks talking strangely picking fights i guess in retrospect he was beginning to have a nervous breakdown but i didnt know did you i am not sure it was a nervous breakdown it must have been drake said what else could it have been my god the man disowns his lifes work and then goes out and kills himself by the way you can forget about any documents that he signed yesterday under the circumstances he obviously was not in his right mind and i know he added that you wouldnt argue the point differently youre already conflicted enough doing work both for him and for us you really should have recused yourself and seen to it that any papers were drawn up by a neutral attorney im not going to accuse you of malpractice but youve shown highly questionable judgment evans said nothing the threat was plain enough well anyway drake said resting his hand on evanss knee i just wanted to apologize i know you did your best with a difficult situation peter and ampi think were going to come out of this all right the plane landed in van nuys a dozen black suv limos the latest fashion were lined up on the runway waiting for the passengers all the celebrities hugged kissed air and departed evans was the last to leave he didnt rate a car and driver he climbed into his little prius hybrid which hed parked there the day before and drove through the gates and onto the freeway he thought he should go to the office but unexpected tears came to his eyes as he negotiated the midday traffic he wiped them away and decided he was too damned tired to go to the office instead he would go back to his apartment to get some sleep he was almost home when his cell phone rang it was jennifer haynes at the vanutu litigation team im sorry about george she said its just terrible everybody here is very upset as you can imagine he pulled the funding didnt he yes but nick will fight it youll get your funding we need to have lunch she said well i think today something in her voice made him say ill try phone me when youre here he hung up the phone rang again almost immediately it was margo lane mortons mistress she was angry what the fuck is going on how do you mean evans said was anybody going to fucking call me im sorry margo i just saw it on tv missing in san francisco and presumed dead they had pictures of the car i was going to call you evans said when i got to my office the truth was she had completely slipped his mind and when would that have been next week youre as bad as that sick assistant of yours youre his lawyer peter do your fucking job because you know lets face it this is not a surprise i knew this was going to happen we all did i want you to come over here i have a busy day just for a minute all right he said just for a minute west los angeles tuesday october pm margo lane lived on the fifteenth floor of a highrise apartment building in the wilshire corridor the doorman had to call up before evans was allowed in the elevator margo knew he was coming up but she still answered the door wrapped in a towel oh i didnt realize youd be here so soon come in i just got out of the shower she frequently did something like this flaunting her body evans came into the apartment and sat on the couch she sat opposite him the towel barely covered her torso so she said whats all this about george im sorry evans said but george crashed his ferrari at very high speed and was thrown from the car he fell down a cliffthey found a shoe at the bottomand into the water his body hasnt been recovered but they expect it to turn up in a week or so with her love of drama he was sure margo would start to cry but she didnt she just stared at him thats bullshit she said why do you say that margo because hes hiding or something you know it hiding from what probably nothing hed become completely paranoid you know that as she said it she crossed her legs evans was careful to keep his eyes on her face paranoid he asked dont act like you didnt know peter it was obvious evans shook his head not to me the last time he came here was a couple of days ago she said he went right to the window and stood back behind the curtain looking down onto the street he was convinced he was being followed had he done that before i dont know i hadnt seen him much lately he was traveling but whenever i called him and asked when he was coming over he said it wasnt safe to come here evans got up and walked to the window he stood to one side and looked down at the street below are you being followed too she said i dont think so traffic on wilshire boulevard was heavy the start of afternoon rush hour three lanes of cars moving fast in each direction he could hear the roar of the traffic even up there but there was no place to park to pull out from the traffic a blue prius hybrid had pulled to the curb across the street and traffic was backing up behind it honking after a moment the prius started up again no place to stop do you see anything suspicious she asked no i never did either but george didor thought he did did he say who was following him no she shifted again i thought he should have medication i told him and what did he say to that he said i was in danger too he told me i should leave town for a while go visit my sister in oregon but i wont her towel was coming loose margo tightened it lowering it across her firm enhanced breasts so im telling you george went into hiding she said and i think you better find him fast because the man needs help i see evans said but i suppose its possible he isnt in hiding that he really crashed his car amp in which case there are things you need to do now margo he explained to her that if george remained missing his assets could be ordered frozen which meant that she ought to withdraw everything from the bank account into which he put money for her every month so she would be sure to have money to live on but thats silly she protested i know hell be back in a few days just in case evans said she frowned do you know something youre not telling me no evans said im just saying it could be a while before this thing gets cleared up look she said hes sick youre supposed to be his friend find him evans said that he would try when he left margo was flouncing off to the bedroom to get dressed before going to the bank outside in the milky afternoon sunlight fatigue overwhelmed him all he wanted to do was go home and go to sleep he got in his car and started driving he was within sight of his apartment when his phone rang again it was jennifer asking where he was im sorry he said i cant come today its important peter really he said he was sorry and would call her later then lisa herb lowensteins secretary called to say that nicholas drake had been trying to reach him all afternoon he really wants to talk to you okay evans said ill call he sounds pissed okay but you better call sarah first why his phone went dead it always did in the back alley of his apartment it was a dead spot in the cellular net he slipped the phone into his shirt pocket hed call in a few minutes he drove down the alley and pulled into his garage space he walked up the back stairs to his apartment and unlocked the door and stared the apartment was a mess furniture torn apart cushions slashed open papers all over the place books tumbled out of the bookshelves and lying scattered on the floor he stood in the entrance stunned after a moment he walked into the room straightened one of the toppled chairs and sat down in it it occurred to him that he had to call the police he got up found the phone on the floor and dialed them but almost immediately the cell phone in his pocket began to ring he hung up on the police and answered the cell phone yes it was lisa we got cut off she said you better call sarah right away why shes over at mortons house there was a robbery there what i know you better call her she said she sounded upset evans flipped the phone shut he stood and walked into the kitchen everything was a mess there too he glanced into the bedroom everything was a mess all he could think was the maid wasnt coming until next tuesday how could he ever clean this up he dialed his phone sarah is that you peter yes what happened not on the phone have you gone home yet just got here so ampdid it happen to you too yes me too can you come here yes how soon she sounded frightened ten minutes okay see you she hung up evans turned the ignition of his prius and it hummed to life he was pleased to have the hybrid the waiting list in los angeles to get one was now more than six months hed had to take a light gray one which wasnt his preferred color but he loved the car and he took a quiet satisfaction in noticing how many of them there were on the streets these days he drove down the alley to olympic across the street he saw a blue prius just like the one he had seen below margos apartment it was electric blue a garish color he thought he liked his gray better he turned right and then left again heading north through beverly hills he knew there would be rush hour traffic starting at this time of day and he should get up to sunset where traffic moved a little better when he got to the traffic light at wilshire he saw another blue prius behind him that same ugly color two guys in the car not young when he made his way to the light at sunset the same car was still behind him two cars back he turned left toward holmby hills the prius turned left too following him evans pulled up to mortons gate and pressed the buzzer the security camera above the box blinked on can i help you its peter evans for sarah jones a momentary pause and then a buzz the gates swung open slowly revealing a curving roadway the house was still hidden from view while he waited evans glanced down the road to his left a block away he saw the blue prius coming up the road toward him it passed him without slowing down and disappeared around a curve so perhaps he was not being followed after all he took a deep breath and let it out slowly the gates swung wide and he drove inside holmby hills tuesday october pm it was almost four oclock as evans drove up the driveway to mortons house the property was crawling with security men there were several searching among the trees near the front gate and more in the driveway clustered around several vans marked anderson security service evans parked next to sarahs porsche he went to the front door a security man opened it ms jones is in the living room he walked through the large entryway and past the staircase that curved up to the second floor he looked into the living room prepared to see the same disarray that hed witnessed at his own apartment but here everything seemed to be in its place the room appeared exactly as evans remembered it mortons living room was arranged to display his extensive collection of asian antiquities above the fireplace was a large chinese screen with shimmering gilded clouds a large stone head from the angkor region of cambodia with thick lips and a halfsmile was mounted on a pedestal near the couch against one wall stood a seventeenthcentury japanese tansu its rich wood glowing extremely rare two hundredyearold woodcuts by hiroshige hung on the back wall a standing burmese buddha carved in faded wood stood at the entrance to the media room next door in the middle of the room surrounded by these antiquities sarah sat slumped on the couch staring blankly out the window she looked over as evans came in they got your apartment yes its a mess this house was broken into too it must have happened last night all the security people here are trying to figure out how it could have happened look here she got up and pushed the pedestal that held the cambodian head considering the weight of the head the pedestal moved surprisingly easily revealing a safe sunk in the floor the safe door stood open evans saw neatly stacked manila folders inside what was taken he said as far as i can tell nothing she said seems like everything is still in its place but i dont know exactly what george had in these safes they were his safes i rarely went into them she moved to the tansu sliding open a center panel and then a false back panel to expose a safe in the wall behind it too was open there are six safes in the house she said three down here one in the secondfloor study one in the basement and one up in his bedroom closet they opened every one cracked no someone knew the combinations evans said did you report this to the police no why not i wanted to talk to you first her head was close to his evans could smell a faint perfume he said why because she said someone knew the combinations peter you mean it was an inside job it had to be who stays in the house at night two housekeepers sleep in the far wing but last night was their night off so they werent here so nobody was in the house thats right what about the alarm i armed it myself before i went to san francisco yesterday the alarm didnt go off she shook her head so somebody knew the code evans said or knew how to bypass it what about the security cameras theyre all over the property she said inside the house and out they record onto a hard drive in the basement youve played it back she nodded nothing but static it was scrubbed the security people are trying to recover something but amp she shrugged i dont think theyll get anywhere it would take pretty sophisticated burglars to know how to wipe a hard drive who has the alarm codes and safe combinations as far as i know just george and me but obviously somebody else does too i think you should call the police he said theyre looking for something she said something that george had something they think one of us has now they think george gave it to one of us evans frowned but if thats true he said why are they being so obvious they smashed my place so i couldnt help notice and even here they left the safes wide open to be sure youd know youd been robbed amp exactly she said they want us to know what theyre doing she bit her lip they want us to panic and rush off to retrieve this thing whatever it is then theyll follow us and take it evans thought it over do you have any idea what it could be no she said do you evans was thinking of the list george had mentioned to him on the airplane the list he never got around to explaining before he died but certainly the implication was that morton had paid a lot of money for some sort of list but something made evans hesitate to mention it now no he said did george give you anything no he said me neither she bit her lip again i think we should leave leave get out of town for a while its natural to feel that way after a robbery he said but i think the proper thing to do right now is to call the police george wouldnt like it george is no longer with us sarah george hated the beverly hills police sarah amp he never called them he always used private security that may be but amp they wont do anything but file a report perhaps but amp did you call the police about your place not yet but i will okay well you call them see how it goes its a waste of time his phone beeped there was a text message he looked at the screen it said n drake come to office immed urgent listen he said i have to go see nick for a bit ill be fine ill come back he said as soon as i can ill be fine she repeated he stood and she stood too on a sudden impulse he gave her a hug she was so tall they were almost shoulder to shoulder its going to be okay he said dont worry itll be okay she returned the hug but when he released her she said dont ever do that again peter im not hysterical ill see you when you get back he left hastily feeling foolish at the door she said by the way peter do you have a gun no he said do you just a millimeter beretta but its better than nothing oh okay as he went out the front door he thought so much for manly reassurances for the modern woman he got in the car and drove to drakes office it was not until he had parked his car and was walking in the front door to the office that he noticed the blue prius parked at the end of the block with two men sitting inside it watching him beverly hills tuesday october pm no no no nicholas drake stood in the nerf media room surrounded by a halfdozen stunnedlooking graphic designers on the walls and tables were posters banners flyers coffee mugs and stacks of press releases and media kits all were emblazoned with a banner that went from green to red with the superimposed words abrupt climate change the dangers ahead i hate it drake said i just fucking hate it why because its boring it sounds like a damn pbs special we need some punch here some pizzazz well sir one of the designers said if you remember you originally wanted to avoid anything that looked like overstatement i did no i didnt henley wanted to avoid overstatement henley thought it should be made to look exactly like a normal academic conference but if we do that the media will tune us out i mean shit do you know how many climate change conferences there are every year all around the world no sir how many well um fortyseven anyway thats not the point drake rapped the banner with his knuckles i mean look at this dangers its so vague it could refer to anything i thought thats what you wantedthat it could refer to anything no i want crisis or catastrophe the crisis ahead the catastrophe ahead thats better catastrophe is much better you used catastrophe for the last conference the one on species extinction i dont care we use it because it works this conference must point to a catastrophe uh sir one said with all due respect is it really accurate that abrupt climate change will lead to catastrophe because the background materials we were given yes god damn it drake snapped itll lead to a catastrophe believe me it will now make the damn changes the graphic artists surveyed the assembled materials on the table mr drake the conference starts in four days you think i dont know it drake said you think i fucking dont know it im not sure how much we can accomplish catastrophe lose danger add catastrophe thats all im asking for how difficult can it be mr drake we can redo the visual materials and the banners for the media kits but the coffee mugs are a problem why are they a problem theyre made for us in china and made in china land of pollution whose idea was that we always have the coffee mugs made in china for well we definitely cant use them this is nerf for christs sake how many cups do we have three hundred theyre given to the media in attendance along with the press kit well get some damn ecoacceptable mugs drake said doesnt canada make mugs nobody ever complains about anything canada does get some canadian mugs and print catastrophe on them thats all the artists were looking at one another one said theres that supply house in vancouver amp but their mugs are creamcolored amp i dont care if theyre chartreuse drake said his voice rising just do it now what about the press releases another designer held up a sheet theyre fourcolor banners printed in biodegradable inks on recycled bond paper drake picked up a sheet this is recycled it looks damn good actually its fresh paper the designer looked nervous but no one will know you didnt tell me that drake said its essential that recycled materials look good and they do sir dont worry then lets move on he turned to the pr people whats the timeline of the campaign its a standard starburst launch to bring public awareness to abrupt climate change the first rep said standing up we have our initial press break on sundaymorning talk shows and in the sunday newspaper supplements theyll be talking about the start of the conference wednesday and interviewing major photogenic principals stanford levine the other people who show well on tv weve given enough lead time to get into all the major weekly newsbooks around the world time newsweek der spiegel paris match oggi the economist all together fifty news magazines to inform lead opinion makers weve asked for cover stories accepting banner folds with a graphic anything less and they didnt get us we expect covers on at least twenty okay drake said nodding we start the conference on wednesday wellknown charismatic environmentalists and major politicians from industrialized nations are scheduled to appear we have delegates from around the world so broll reaction shots of the audience will be satisfactorily colormixed industrialized countries now include india and korea and japan of course the chinese delegation will participate but there will be no speakers our two hundred invited television journalists will stay at the hilton and we will have interview facilities there as well as in the conference halls so our speakers can spread the message to video audiences around the world we will also have a number of print media people to carry the word to elite opinion makers the ones that read but do not watch tv good drake said he appeared pleased each days theme will be identified by a distinctive graphic icon emphasizing flood fire rising sea levels drought icebergs typhoons and hurricanes and so on each day we have a fresh contingent of politicians from around the world coming to attend and give interviews explaining the high level of their dedication and concern about this newly emerging problem good good drake nodded the politicians will stay for only a daysome only a few hoursand they will not have time to attend the conferences beyond a brief photoop showing them in the audience but they are briefed and will be effective then we have local schoolchildren grades four to seven coming each day to learn about the dangerssorry the catastrophein their futures and we have educational kits for gradeschool teachers so they can teach their kids about the crisis of abrupt climate change when do those kits go out they were going out today but now well hold them for rebannering okay drake said and for high schools we have some trouble there the pr guy said we showed the kits to a sample of high school science teachers and uh amp and what drake said the feedback we got was they might not go over so well drakes expression turned dark and why not well the high school curriculum is very college oriented and there isnt a lot of room for electives amp this is hardly an elective amp and uh they felt it was all speculative and unsubstantiated they kept saying things like wheres the hard science here just reporting sir god damn it drake said it is not speculative it is happening uh perhaps we didnt get the right materials that show what you are saying amp ah fuck never mind now drake said just trust me its happening count on it he turned and said in a surprised voice evans how long have you been here peter evans had been standing in the doorway for at least two minutes and had overheard a good deal of the conversation just got here mr drake all right drake turned to the others i think weve gone through this evans you come with me drake shut the door to his office i need your counsel peter he said quietly he walked around to his desk picked up some papers and slid them toward evans what the fuck is this evans looked that is georges withdrawal of support did you draw it up i did whose idea was paragraph a paragraph a yes did you add that little bit of wisdom i dont really remember then let me refresh your memory drake said he picked up the document and started to read in the event of any claim that i am not of sound mind there may be an attempt to obtain injunctive relief from the terms of this document therefore this document authorizes the payment of fifty thousand dollars per week to nerf while awaiting the judgment of a full trial said monies shall be deemed sufficient to pay ongoing costs incurred by nerf and shall by said payment deny injunctive relief did you write this evans i did whose idea was it georges george is not a lawyer he had help not from me evans said he more or less dictated that clause i wouldnt have thought of it drake snorted in disgust fifty thousand a week he said at that rate it will take us four years to receive the tenmilliondollar grant thats what george wanted the document to say evans said but whose idea was it drake said if it wasnt you who was it i dont know find out i dont know if i can evans said i mean george is dead now and i dont know who he might have consulted drake glared at evans are you with us here peter or not he started pacing back and forth because this vanutu litigation is undoubtedly the most significant lawsuit we have ever filed he lapsed into his speechmaking mode the stakes are enormous peter global warming is the greatest crisis facing mankind you know that i know that most of the civilized world knows that we must act to save the planet before it is too late yes evans said i know that do you drake said we have a lawsuit a very important lawsuit that needs our help and fifty thousand dollars a week will strangle it evans was sure that was not true fifty thousand is a lot of money he said i dont see why it should strangle because it will drake snapped because i am telling you it will he seemed surprised by his own outburst he gripped the desk got control of himself look he said we can never forget about our opponents here the forces of industry are strong phenomenally strong and industry wants to be left alone to pollute it wants to pollute here and in mexico and in china and wherever else it does its business the stakes are huge i understand evans said many powerful forces are taking an interest in this case peter yes im sure forces that will stop at nothing to be sure that we lose it evans frowned what was drake telling him their influence is everywhere peter they may have influence with members of your law firm or other people you know people whom you believe you can trustbut you cant because they are on the other side and they dont even know it evans said nothing he was just looking at drake be prudent peter watch your back dont discuss what you are doing with anyonewith anyoneexcept me try not to use your cell phone avoid email and keep an eye out in case you are followed okay amp but actually ive already been followed evans said theres a blue prius those were our guys i dont know what they are doing i called them off days ago your guys yes its a new security firm weve been trying out theyre obviously not very competent im confused evans said nerf has a security firm absolutely for years now because of the danger we face please understand me we are all in danger peter dont you understand what this lawsuit means if we win trillions of dollars that industry must pay in the coming years to halt their emissions that are causing global warming trillions with those stakes a few lives dont matter so be very damn careful evans said that he would drake shook his hand i want to know who told george about the paragraph drake said and i want that money freed up for us to use it as we see fit this is all riding on you now he said good luck peter on his way out of the building evans ran into a young man who was sprinting up the stairs they collided so hard that evans was almost knocked down the young man apologized hastily and continued on his way he looked like one of the kids working on the conference evans wondered what the crisis could be now when he got back outside he looked down the street the blue prius was gone he got into the car and drove back to mortons to see sarah holmby hills tuesday october pm traffic was heavy he crept slowly along sunset he had plenty of time to think the conversation with drake left him feeling odd there had been a funny quality to the actual meeting as if it didnt really need to happen as if drake just wanted to make sure he was able to call evans in and evans would come as if he were asserting his authority or something like that anyway evans felt something was off and evans also felt a little strange about the security firm that just didnt seem right after all nerf was one of the good guys they shouldnt be sneaking around and following people and drakes paranoid warnings were somehow not persuasive drake was overreacting as he so often did drake was dramatic by nature he couldnt help it everything was a crisis everything was desperate everything was vitally important he lived in a world of extreme urgency but it wasnt necessarily the real world evans called his office but heather had gone for the day he called lowensteins office and spoke to lisa listen he said i need your help her voice was lower conspiratorial of course peter my apartment was robbed noyou too yes me too and i really need to talk to the police well yes you certainly domy goodnessdid they take anything i dont think so he said but just to file a report all thatim kind of busy right now dealing with sarah ampit may go later into the night amp well of course do you need me to deal with the police about your robbery could you he said it would help so much why of course peter she said leave it to me she paused when she spoke again it was almost a whisper is there ah anything you dont want the police to find no he said i mean its all right with me everybody in la has a few bad habits otherwise we wouldnt be here no lisa he said actually i dont have any drugs if thats what you mean oh no she said quickly i wasnt assuming anything no pictures or anything like that no lisa nothing you know underage afraid not okay i just wanted to be sure well thanks for doing this now to get in through the door i know she said the key is under the back mat yes he paused howd you know that peter she said sounding a little offended you can count on me to know things all right well thanks dont mention it now what about margo hows she doing lisa said shes fine you went to see her this morning yes and no i mean at the hospital didnt you hear margo was coming back from the bank today and walked in while her apartment was being robbed three robberies in one day you margo sarah what is going on do you know no evans said its very mysterious it is but about margo amp oh yes so i guess she decided to fight these guys which was the wrong thing to do and they beat her up maybe knocked her unconscious she had a black eye i heard and while the cops were there interviewing her she passed out got completely paralyzed and couldnt move and she even stopped breathing youre kidding no i had a long conversation with the detective who was there he told me it just came over her and she was unable to move and was dark blue before the paramedics showed up and took her to ucla shes been in intensive care all afternoon the doctors are waiting to ask her about the blue ring what blue ring just before she became paralyzed she was slurring her words but she said something about the blue ring or the blue ring of death the blue ring of death evans said what does that mean they dont know she isnt able to talk yet does she take drugs no shes a health nut evans said well i hear the doctors say shell be okay it was some temporary paralysis ill go see her later he said when you do will you call me afterward and ill handle your apartment dont worry it was dark when he got to mortons house the security people were gone the only car parked in front was sarahs porsche she opened the front door when he rang she had changed into a tracksuit everything all right he said yes she said they came into the hallway and they crossed to the living room the lights were on and the room was warm and inviting where are the security people they left for dinner theyll be back they all left theyll be back i want to show you something she said she pulled out a wand with an electronic meter attached to it she ran it over his body like an airport security check she tapped his left pocket empty it the only thing in his pocket were his car keys he dropped them on the coffee table sarah was running the wand over his chest his jacket she touched his right jacket pocket gestured for him to empty it out whats this about he said she shook her head and didnt speak he pulled out a penny set it on the counter she waved her hand more he felt again nothing she ran the wand over his car keys there was a plastic rectangle on the chain which unlocked his car door she pried it open with a pocketknife hey listen amp the rectangle popped open evans saw electronic circuits inside a watch battery sarah pulled out a tiny bit of electronics hardly bigger than the tip of a lead pencil bingo is that what i think it is she took the electronic unit and dropped it into a glass of water then she turned to the penny she examined it minutely then twisted it in her fingers to evanss surprise it broke in half revealing a small electronic center she dropped that in the glass of water too wheres your car she said out in front we can check it later he said whats this about the security guys found bugs on me she said and all over the house the best guess is that was the reason for the robberyto plant bugs and guess what you have bugs too he looked around is the house okay the house has been electronically swept and cleared the guys found about a dozen bugs supposedly its clean now they sat together on the couch whoever is doing all this they think we know something she said and im beginning to believe theyre right evans told her about mortons comments about the list he bought a list she said evans nodded thats what he said did he say what kind of a list no he was going to tell me more but he never got around to it he didnt say anything more to you when you were alone with him not that i remember going up on the plane no amp at the table at dinner i dont think so no when you walked him to his car no he was singing all that time it was sort of embarrassing to tell you the truth and then he got in his car ampwait a minute evans sat up he did say one funny thing what was that it was some buddhist philosophical saying he told me to remember it what was it i dont remember evans said at least not exactly it was something like everything that matters is near where the buddha sits george wasnt interested in buddhism sarah said why would he say that to you everything that matters is near where the buddha sits evans said repeating it again he was staring forward into the media room adjacent to the living room sarah amp directly facing them under dramatic overhead lighting was a large wooden sculpture of a seated buddha burmese fourteenth century evans got up and walked into the media room sarah followed him the sculpture was four feet high and mounted on a high pedestal evans walked around behind the statue you think sarah said maybe he ran his fingers around the base of the statue there was a narrow space there beneath the crossed legs but he could feel nothing he crouched looked nothing there were some wide cracks in the wood of the statue but nothing was there maybe move the base evans said its on rollers sarah said they slid it to one side exposing nothing but white carpet evans sighed any other buddhas around here he said looking around the room sarah was down on her hands and knees peter she said what look he crouched down there was a roughly oneinch gap between the base of the pedestal and the floor barely visible in that gap was the corner of an envelope attached to the inside of the pedestal ill be damned its an envelope she slid her fingers in can you reach it i ampthink so ampgot it she pulled it out it was a businesssize envelope sealed and unmarked this could be it she said excited peter i think we may have found it the lights went out and the house was plunged into darkness they scrambled to their feet what happened evans said its okay she said the emergency generator will cut in at any second actually it wont a voice in the darkness said two powerful flashlights shone directly in their faces evans squinted in the harsh light sarah raised her hand to cover her eyes may i have the envelope please the voice said sarah said no there was a mechanical click like the cocking of a gun well take the envelope the voice said one way or another no you wont sarah said standing beside her evans whispered sarah amp shut up peter they cant have it well shoot if we have to the voice said sarah give them the fucking envelope evans said let them take it sarah said defiantly sarah amp bitch the voice screamed and a gunshot sounded evans was embroiled in chaos and blackness there was another scream one of the flashlights bounced on the floor and rolled pointing in a corner in the shadows evans saw a large dark figure attack sarah who screamed and kicked without thinking evans threw himself against the attacker grabbing an arm in a leather jacket he could smell the mans beery breath hear him grunting then someone else pulled him off slamming him to the ground and he was kicked in the ribs he rolled away banging against the furniture and then a new deep voice held up a flashlight and said move away now immediately the attacker stopped fighting with them and turned to this new voice evans looked back to see sarah who was on the floor another man got up and turned toward the flashlight there was a crackling sound and the man screamed and fell backward the flashlight swung to the man who had been kicking peter you down the man immediately lay on the carpet face down the man rolled over thats better the new voice said are you two all right im fine sarah said panting staring into the light who the hell are you sarah the voice said im disappointed you dont recognize me just then the lights came back up in the room sarah said john and to evanss astonishment she stepped across the body of the fallen attacker to give a grateful hug to john kenner professor of geoenvironmental engineering at mit holmby hills tuesday october pm i think i deserve an explanation evans said kenner had crouched down and was handcuffing the two men lying on the floor the first man was still unconscious its a modulated taser kenner said shoots a fivehundredmegahertz dart that delivers a fourmillisecond jolt that inactivates cerebellar functioning down you go unconsciousness is immediate but it only lasts a few minutes no evans said i meant why am i here kenner said looking up with a faint smile yes evans said hes a good friend of georges sarah said he is evans said since when since we all met a while back kenner said and i believe you remember my associate sanjong thapa as well a compact muscular young man with dark skin and a crew cut came into the room as before evans was struck by his vaguely military bearing and british accent lights are all back on professor sanjong thapa said should i call the police not just yet kenner said give me a hand here sanjong together kenner and his friend went through the pockets of the handcuffed men as i thought kenner said straightening at last no identification on them who are they thatll be a question for the police he said the men were beginning to cough and wake up sanjong lets get them to the front door they hauled the intruders to their feet and halfled halfdragged them out of the room evans was alone with sarah how did kenner get in the house he was in the basement hes been searching the house most of the afternoon and why didnt you tell me i asked her not to kenner said walking back into the room i wasnt sure about you this is a complicated business he rubbed his hands together now then shall we have a look at that envelope yes sarah sat down on the couch and tore it open a single sheet of paper neatly folded was inside she stared at it in disbelief her face fell what is it evans said without a word she handed it to him it was a bill from the edwards fine art display company of torrance california for construction of a wooden pedestal to support a statue of a buddha dated three years ago feeling dejected evans sat down on the couch next to sarah what kenner said giving up already i dont know what else to do you can begin by telling me exactly what george morton said to you i dont remember exactly tell me what you do remember he said it was a philosophical saying and it was something like everything that matters is near where the buddha sits no thats impossible kenner said in a definite tone why he wouldnt have said that why kenner sighed i should think its selfevident if he was giving instructionswhich we presume he washe wouldnt be so inexact so he must have said something else thats all i remember evans said defensively evans found kenners quick manner to be brusque almost insulting he was beginning not to like this man thats all you remember kenner said lets try again where did george make this statement to you it must have been after you left the lobby at first evans was puzzled then he remembered were you there yes i was i was in the parking lot off to one side why evans said well discuss that later kenner said you were telling me you and george went outside amp yes evans said we went outside it was cold and george stopped singing when he felt the cold we were standing on the steps of the hotel waiting for the car uhhuh amp and when it came he got into the ferrari and i was worried he shouldnt be driving and i asked him about that and george said this reminds me of a philosophical saying and i said what is it and he said everything that matters is not far from where the buddha sits not far kenner said thats what he said all right kenner said and at this moment you were amp leaning over the car the ferrari yes leaning over and when george told you this philosophical saying what did you answer back i just asked him not to drive did you repeat the phrase no evans said why not because i was worried about him he shouldnt be driving anyway i remember thinking it was sort of awkwardly phrased not remote from where the buddha sits not remote kenner said yes evans said he said to you not remote yes much better kenner said he was moving restlessly around the room his eyes flicking from object to object touching things dropping them moving on why is it much better evans said irritably kenner gestured around the room look around you peter what do you see i see a media room exactly well i dont understand sit down on the couch peter evans sat down still furious he crossed his arms over his chest and glowered at kenner the doorbell rang they were interrupted by the arrival of the police kenner said let me handle this its easier if they dont see you and he again walked out of the room from the hallway they heard several low voices discussing the two captured intruders it sounded all very chummy evans said does kenner have something to do with law enforcement not exactly what does that mean he just seems to know people evans stared at her he knows people he repeated different sorts of people yes he sent george off to see a lot of them kenner has a tremendously wide range of contacts particularly in the environmental area is that what the center for risk analysis does environmental risks im not sure why is he on sabbatical you should ask him these things okay you dont like him do you she said i like him fine i just think hes a conceited asshole hes very sure of himself she said assholes usually are evans got up and walked to where he could see into the hallway kenner was talking to the policemen signing some documents and turning over the intruders the police were joking with him standing to one side was the dark man sanjong and what about the little guy with him sanjong thapa she said kenner met him in nepal when he was climbing a mountain there sanjong was a nepali military officer assigned to help a team of scientists studying soil erosion in the himalaya kenner invited him back to the states to work with him i remember now kenners a mountain climber too and he was almost on the olympic ski team evans couldnt conceal his annoyance sarah said hes a remarkable man peter even if you dont like him evans returned to the couch sat down again folded his arms well youre right about that he said i dont i have the feeling youre not alone there she said the list of people who dislike john kenner is a long one evans snorted and said nothing they were still sitting on the couch when kenner came bounding back into the room he was again rubbing his hands all right he said all the two boys have to say is that they want to talk to a lawyer and they seem to know one imagine that but well know more in a few hours he turned to peter so mystery solved concerning the buddha evans glared at him no really its quite straightforward why dont you just tell us evans said reach your right hand out to the end table kenner said evans put his hand out there were five remote controls on the table yes he said and what are they for its a media room evans said i think weve established that yes kenner said but what are they for obviously evans said to control the television the satellite the dvd the vhs all that which one does which kenner said evans stared at the table and suddenly he got it oh my god he said youre absolutely right he was flipping them over one after another this ones the flat panel ampdvd ampsatellite amphigh def amp he stopped there was one more looks like there are two dvd controllers the second one was stubby and black and had all the usual buttons but it was slightly lighter than the other evans pulled open the battery compartment only one battery was there in place of the other was a tightly rolled piece of paper bingo he said he took the paper out all that matters is not remote from where the buddha sits thats what george had said which meant that this paper was all that matters carefully evans unrolled the tiny sheet and pressed it flat on the coffee table with the heel of his hand smoothing out the wrinkles and then he stared the paper contained nothing but columns of numbers and words fxe terror fxe snake fxe laugher fxe scorpion alt fxe terror fxe sever fxe conch fxe scorpion alt fxe terror fxe buzzard fxe old man fxe scorpion alt fxe terror fxe black mesa fxe snarl fxe scorpion evans said is this what everybodys after sarah was looking at the paper over his shoulder i dont get it what does it mean evans passed the paper to kenner he hardly glanced at it before he said no wonder they were so desperate to get this back you know what it is theres no doubt about what it is kenner said handing the paper to sanjong its a list of geographic locations locations where well have to calculate that sanjong said theyre recorded in utm which may mean the listing was intended for pilots kenner saw the blank looks on the others faces the world is a globe he said and maps are flat therefore all maps are projections of a sphere onto a flat surface one projection is the universal transverse mercator grid which divides the globe into sixdegree grids it was originally a military projection but some pilot charts use it evans said so these numbers are latitude and longitude in a different form correct a military form kenner ran his finger down the page it appears to be several alternate sets of four locations but in every instance the first and last locations are the same for whatever reason amp he frowned and stared off into space is that bad sarah said im not sure kenner said but it might be yes he looked at sanjong sanjong nodded gravely what is today he said tuesday then amptime is very short kenner said sarah were going to need georges plane how many pilots does he have two usually well need at least four how soon can you get them i dont know where do you want to go she said chile chile and leave when as soon as possible not later than midnight itll take me some time to arrange then get started now kenner said time is short sarah very short evans watched sarah go out of the room he turned back to kenner okay he said i give up whats in chile a suitable airfield i presume with adequate jet fuel kenner snapped his fingers good point peter sarah he called into the next room what kind of a plane is it gfive she called back kenner turned to sanjong thapa who had taken out a small handheld computer and was tapping away at it are you connected to akamai yes was i right ive only checked the first location so far sanjong said but yes we need to go to chile then terror is terror kenner said i think so yes evans looked from one man to the other terror is terror he said puzzled thats right kenner said sanjong said you know peters got a point evans said are you guys ever going to tell me whats going on yes kenner said but first you have your passport i always carry it good man kenner turned back to sanjong what point its utm professor its a sixdegree grid of course kenner said snapping his fingers again whats the matter with me i give up evans said whats the matter with you but kenner didnt answer he now seemed almost hyperactive his fingers twitching nervously as he picked up the remote control from the table beside peter and peered at it closely turning it in the light finally he spoke a sixdegree grid kenner said means that these locations are only accurate to a thousand meters roughly half a mile thats simply not good enough why how accurate should it be three meters sanjong said about ten feet assuming they are using pps kenner said still squinting at the remote control in which case ampah i thought so its the oldest trick in the book he pulled the entire back of the remote off exposing the circuit board he lifted that away to reveal a second folded sheet of paper it was thin hardly more than tissue paper it contained rows of numbers and symbols xбgkаoqаcбaaaaaъ яяяе h вkаoёbаcбaaaaaъяяяя яяя гpnаnйxfаcбaaaaaъї яяяв уwoа

same locations terror is terror evans said he was starting to feel foolish kenner said yes were talking about mount terror peter an inactive volcano you have heard of it no well were going there where is it i thought youd have guessed that by now kenner said its in antarctica peter ii terror to punta arenas tuesday october pm van nuys airport sank beneath them the jet turned south crossing the flat glowing expanse of the los angeles basin the flight attendant brought evans coffee on the little screen it said miles to destination flying time was nearly twelve hours the flight attendant asked them if they wanted dinner and went off to prepare it all right evans said three hours ago im coming to help sarah deal with a robbery now im flying to antarctica isnt it time somebody told me what this is about kenner nodded have you heard of the environmental liberation front elf no evans said shaking his head not me sarah said its an underground extremist group supposedly made up of exgreenpeace and earth first types who thought those organizations had gone soft elf engages in violence on behalf of environmental causes theyve burned hotels in colorado houses on long island spiked trees in michigan torched cars in california evans nodded i read about them amp the fbi and other law enforcement agencies cant infiltrate them because the organization consists of separate cells that never communicate with one another yes kenner said supposedly but cell phone conversations have been recorded weve known for some time that the group was going global planning a series of major events around the world starting a few days from now what kind of events kenner shook his head that we dont know but we have reason to think theyll be bigand destructive sarah said what does this have to do with george morton funding kenner said if elf is preparing actions around the world they need a lot of money the question is where are they getting it are you saying george has funded an extremist group not intentionally elf is a criminal organization but even so radical groups like peta fund them frankly its a disgrace but the question became whether betterknown environmental groups were funding them too betterknown groups like who any of them kenner said wait a minute sarah said are you suggesting that the audubon society and the sierra club fund terrorist groups no kenner said but im telling you that nobody knows exactly what any of these groups do with their money because government oversight of foundations and charities is extraordinarily lax they dont get audited the books dont get inspected environmental groups in the us generate half a billion dollars a year what they do with it is unsupervised evans frowned and george knew this when i met him kenner said he was already worrying about nerf what it was doing with its money it dispenses fortyfour million dollars a year evans said youre not going to tell me that nerf not directly kenner said but nerf spends nearly sixty percent of its money on fundraising it cant admit that of course itd look bad it gets around the numbers by contracting nearly all of its work to outside directmail advertisers and telephone solicitation groups these groups have misleading names like the international wildlife preservation fundthats an omahabased directmail organization that in turn outsources the work to costa rica youre kidding evans said no i am not and last year the iwpf spent six hundred fifty thousand dollars to gather information on environmental issues including three hundred thousand dollars to something called the rainforest action and support coalition rasc which turns out to be a drop box in elmira new york and an equal sum to seismic services in calgary another drop box you mean amp a drop box a dead end that was the true basis of the disagreement between morton and drake morton felt that drake wasnt minding the store thats why he wanted an external audit of the organization and when drake refused morton got really worried morton is on the nerf board he has liability so he hired a team of private investigators to investigate nerf he did evans said kenner nodded two weeks ago evans turned to sarah did you know this she looked away then back he told me i couldnt tell anyone george did i did kenner said so you were behind this no i merely consulted with george it was his ball game but the point is once you outsource the money you no longer control how it is spent or you have deniability about how it is spent jesus evans said all this time i just thought george was worried about the vanutu lawsuit no kenner said the lawsuit is probably hopeless it is very unlikely it will ever go to trial but balder said when he gets good sealevel data balder already has the good data he has had it for months what the data show no rise in south pacific sea levels for the last thirty years what kenner turned to sarah is he always like this the flight attendant set out placemats napkins and silverware ive got fusilli pasta with chicken asparagus and sundried tomatoes she said and a mixed green salad to follow would anyone like wine white wine evans said i have pulignymontrachet im not sure of the year i think its mr morton usually kept on board just give me the whole bottle evans said trying to make a joke kenner had unnerved him earlier in the evening kenner had been excited almost twitchynervous but now sitting on the airplane he was very still implacable he had the manner of a man who was telling obvious truths even though none of it was obvious to peter i had it all wrong evans said finally if what youre saying is true amp kenner just nodded slowly evans thought hes letting me put it together he turned to sarah did you know this too no she said but i knew something was wrong george was very upset for the last two weeks you think thats why he gave that speech and then killed himself he wanted to embarrass nerf kenner said he wanted intense media scrutiny of that organization because he wanted to stop what is about to happen the wine came in cut glass crystal evans gulped it held out his glass for more and what is about to happen he said according to that list there will be four events kenner said in four locations in the world roughly one day apart what kind of events kenner shook his head we now have three good clues sanjong fingered his napkin this is real linen he said in an awestruck tone and real crystal nice huh evans said draining his glass again sarah said what are the clues the first is the fact that the timing is not exact you might think a terrorist event would be precisely planned down to the minute these events are not maybe the group isnt that well organized i doubt thats the explanation the second clue we got tonight and its very important kenner said as you saw from the list there are several alternate locations for these events again youd think a terrorist organization would pick one location and stick to it but this group hasnt done that why not i assume it reflects the kind of events that are planned there must be some uncertainty inherent in the event itself or in the conditions needed for it to take place pretty vague its more than we knew twelve hours ago and the third clue evans said gesturing to the flight attendant to refill his glass the third clue we have had for some time certain government agencies track the sale of restricted high technologies that might be useful to terrorists for example they track everything that can be used in nuclear weapons productioncentrifuges certain metals and so on they track the sale of all conventional high explosives they track certain critical biotechnologies and they track equipment that might be used to disrupt communications networksthat generate electromagnetic impulses for example or highintensity radio frequencies yes amp they do this work with neural network patternrecognition computers that search for regularities in great masses of datain this case basically thousands of sales invoices about eight months ago the computers detected a very faint pattern that seemed to indicate a common origin for the widely scattered sale of certain field and electronic equipment how did the computer decide that the computer doesnt tell you that it just reports the pattern which is then investigated by agents on the ground and the pattern was confirmed elf was buying very sophisticated high technology from companies in vancouver london osaka helsinki and seoul what kind of equipment evans said kenner ticked them off on his fingers fermentation tanks for aob primersthats ammoniaoxidizing bacteria midlevel particledispersal units military grade tectonic impulse generators transportable mhd units hypersonic cavitation generators resonant impact processor assemblies i dont know what any of that is evans said few people do kenner said some of its fairly standard environmental technology like the aob primer tanks theyre used in industrial wastewater treatment some of its military but sold on the open market and some of its highly experimental but its all expensive sarah said but how is it going to be used kenner shook his head nobody knows thats what were going to find out how do you think its going to be used i hate to speculate kenner said he picked up a basket of rolls bread anyone to punta arenas wednesday october am the jet flew through the night the front of the cabin was darkened sarah and sanjong were sleeping on makeshift beds but evans couldnt sleep he sat in the back staring out the window at the carpet of clouds glowing silver in the moonlight kenner sat opposite him its a beautiful world isnt it he said water vapor is one of the distinctive features of our planet makes such beauty its surprising there is so little scientific understanding of how water vapor behaves really the atmosphere is a bigger mystery than anyone will admit simple example no one can say for sure if global warming will result in more clouds or fewer clouds wait a minute evans said global warming is going to raise the temperature so more moisture will evaporate from the ocean and more moisture means more clouds thats one idea but higher temperature also means more water vapor in the air and therefore fewer clouds so which is it nobody knows then how do they make computer models of climate evans said kenner smiled as far as cloud cover is concerned they guess they guess well they dont call it a guess they call it an estimate or parameterization or an approximation but if you dont understand something you cant approximate it youre really just guessing evans felt the beginnings of a headache he said i think its time for me to get some sleep good idea kenner said glancing at his watch we still have another eight hours before we land the flight attendant gave evans some pajamas he went into the bathroom to change when he came out kenner was still sitting there staring out the window at the moonlit clouds against his better judgment evans said by the way you said earlier that the vanutu lawsuit wont go to trial thats right why not because of the sealevel data in part yes its hard to claim global warming is flooding your country if sea levels arent rising its hard to believe sea levels arent rising evans said everything you read says that they are all the television reports amp kenner said remember african killer bees there was talk of them for years theyre here now and apparently theres no problem remember yk everything you read back then said disaster was imminent went on for months but in the end it just wasnt true evans thought that yk didnt prove anything about sea levels he felt an urge to argue that point but found himself suppressing a yawn its late kenner said we can talk about all this in the morning youre not going to sleep not yet i have work to do evans went forward to where the others were sleeping he lay down across the aisle from sarah and pulled the covers up to his chin now his feet were exposed he sat up wrapped the blanket around his toes and then lay down again the blanket only came to midshoulder he thought about getting up and asking the flight attendant for another and then he slept he awoke to harsh glaring sunlight he heard the clink of silverware and smelled coffee evans rubbed his eyes and sat up in the back of the plane the others were eating breakfast he looked at his watch hed slept for more than six hours he walked to the back of the plane better eat sarah said we land in an hour they stepped out onto the runway of marso del mar shivering in the chill wind that whipped in off the ocean the land around them was low green marshy and cold in the distance evans saw the jagged snowcovered spires of the el fogara range of southern chile i thought this was summer he said it is kenner said late spring anyway the airfield consisted of a small wooden terminal and a row of corrugated steel hangars like oversize quonset huts there were seven or eight other aircraft on the field all fourengine prop planes some had skis that were retracted above the landing wheels right on time kenner said pointing to the hills beyond the airport a land rover was bouncing toward them lets go inside the little terminal which was little more than a single large room its walls covered with faded stained air charts the group tried on parkas boots and other gear brought by the land rover the parkas were all bright red or orange i tried to get everybodys size right kenner said make sure you take long johns and microfleece too evans glanced at sarah she was sitting on the floor pulling on heavy socks and boots then she unselfconsciously stripped down to her bra and pulled a fleece top over her head her movements were quick businesslike she didnt look at any of the men sanjong was staring at the charts on the wall and seemed particularly interested in one evans went over what is it punta arenas its the record from the weather station at punta arenas near here its the closest city to antarctica in the world he tapped the chart and laughed theres your global warming evans frowned at the chart finish up everybody kenner said glancing at his watch our plane leaves in ten minutes evans said where exactly are we going to the base nearest mount terror its called weddell station run by new zealanders whats there not much mate the land rover driver said and he laughed but the way the weathers been lately youll be lucky if you can get there at all to weddell station wednesday october am evans stared out the narrow window of the hercules the vibration of the props made him sleepy but he was fascinated by what he saw beneath himmile after mile of gray ice a vista broken by intermittent fog and the occasional outcrop of black rock it was a monochromatic sunless world and it was huge enormous kenner said people have no perspective on antarctica because it appears as a fringe at the bottom of most maps but in fact antarctica is a major feature on the earths surface and a major factor in our climate its a big continent one and a half times the size of either europe or the united states and it holds ninety percent of all the ice on the planet ninety percent sarah said you mean theres only ten percent in the rest of the world actually since greenland has four percent all the other glaciers in the worldkilimanjaro the alps the himalaya sweden norway canada siberiathey all account for six percent of the planets ice the overwhelming majority of the frozen water of our planet is in the continent of antarctica in many places the ice is five or six miles thick no wonder theyre concerned that the ice here is melting evans said kenner said nothing sanjong was shaking his head evans said come on guys antarctica is melting actually its not sanjong said i can give you the references if you like kenner said while you were asleep sanjong and i were talking about how to clarify things for you since you seem to be so illinformed illinformed evans said stiffening i dont know what else one would call it kenner said your heart may be in the right place peter but you simply dont know what youre talking about hey he said controlling his anger antarctica is melting you think repetition makes something true the data show that one relatively small area called the antarctic peninsula is melting and calving huge icebergs thats what gets reported year after year but the continent as a whole is getting colder and the ice is getting thicker antarctica is getting colder sanjong had taken out a laptop and was hooking it up to a small portable bubble jet printer he flipped open his laptop screen what we decided kenner said is that were going to give you references from now on because its too boring to try and explain everything to you a sheet of paper began to buzz out of the printer sanjong passed it to evans doran p t priscu j c lyons w b walsh j e

evans said i also see warming of the peninsula of several degrees that certainly seems more significant and that peninsulas a pretty big part of the continent isnt it he tossed the paper aside frankly im not impressed sanjong said the peninsula is two percent of the continent and frankly i am surprised that you did not comment on the most significant fact in the data you were given which is when you said earlier that the antarctic is melting sanjong said were you aware that it has been melting for the last six thousand years not specifically no but generally you knew that no evans said i wasnt aware of that you thought that the antarctic melting was something new i thought it was melting faster than previously evans said maybe we wont bother anymore kenner said sanjong nodded and started to put the computer away no no evans said im interested in what you have to say im not closedminded about this im ready to hear new information you just did kenner said evans picked up the sheet of paper again and folded it carefully he slipped it into his pocket these studies are probably financed by the coal industry he said probably kenner said im sure that explains it but then everybodys paid by somebody who pays your salary my law firm and who pays them the clients we have several hundred clients you do work for all of them me personally no in fact you do most of your work for environmental clients kenner said isnt that true mostly yes would it be fair to say that the environmental clients pay your salary kenner said you could make that argument im just asking peter would it be fair to say environmentalists pay your salary yes okay then would it be fair to say the opinions you hold are because you work for environmentalists of course not you mean youre not a paid flunky for the environmental movement no the fact is youre not an environmental stooge a mouthpiece for a great fundraising and media machinea multibilliondollar industry in its own rightwith its own private agenda thats not necessarily in the public interest god damn it is this pissing you off kenner said youre damn right it is good kenner said now you know how legitimate scientists feel when their integrity is impugned by slimy characterizations such as the one you just made sanjong and i gave you a careful peerreviewed interpretation of data made by several groups of scientists from several different countries and your response was first to ignore it and then to make an ad hominem attack you didnt answer the data you didnt provide counter evidence you just smeared with innuendo oh fuck you evans said you think you have an answer for everything but theres only one problem nobody agrees with you nobody in the world thinks that antarctica is getting colder these scientists do kenner said they published the data evans threw up his hands the hell with it he said i dont want to talk about this anymore he walked to the front of the plane and sat down crossed his arms and stared out the window kenner looked at sanjong and sarah anyone feel like coffee sarah had watched kenner and evans with a certain amount of uneasiness even though she had worked for the past two years for morton she had never shared her employers passion for environmental issues all during that time sarah had been in a tempestuous exciting relationship with a handsome young actor their time together consisted of an unending series of passionate evenings angry confrontations slammed doors tearful reconciliations jealousies and infidelitiesand it had consumed her more than she cared to admit the truth was that she had paid no more attention to nerf or mortons other environmental interests than the job required at least until the sonofabitch actor appeared in the pages of people magazine with a young actress from his tv show and sarah finally decided she had had enough erased the guy from her cell phone and threw herself into her work but she certainly held the same general view about the state of the world as evans did perhaps evans was more aggressive in stating his views and more trusting of his assumptions but she basically agreed with him and here was kenner casting doubt after doubt it left her wondering whether kenner was really correct about everything he was saying and it also made her wonder just how he and morton had become friends she asked kenner did you have these same discussions with george in the last weeks of his life yes and did he argue with you the way evans is no kenner shook his head because by then he knew knew what they were interrupted by the pilots voice on the intercom good news he said the weathers broken over weddell and we will land in ten minutes for those of you who have never made a landing on ice seat belts should be low and tight and all your gear safely stowed and we really mean it the plane began a slow curving descent sarah looked out the window at a crusty expanse of white snowcovered ice in the distance she saw a series of brightly colored buildingsred blue greenbuilt on a cliff overlooking the gray and choppy ocean thats weddell station kenner said weddell station wednesday october am trudging toward structures that looked like oversize childrens building blocks evans kicked a clump of ice out of his path he was in a grumpy mood he felt relentlessly bullied by kenner whom he now recognized as one of those perpetual contrarians who argued against all conventional wisdom simply because it was conventional but since evans was stuck with this lunaticat least for the next few dayshe decided to avoid kenner as much as possible and certainly not engage him in any more conversations there was no point in arguing with extremists he looked at sarah walking across the ice airfield beside him her cheeks were flushed in the cold air she looked very beautiful i think the guy is a nut evans said kenner yeah what do you think she shrugged maybe i bet those references he gave me are fake he said theyll be easy enough to check she said they stamped their feet and entered the first building weddell research station turned out to be home to thirtyodd scientists graduate students technicians and support staff evans was pleasantly surprised to find it was quite comfortable inside with a cheerful cafeteria a game room and a large gym with a row of treadmills there were big picture windows with views of the choppy restless ocean other windows looked out over the vast white expanse of the ross ice shelf stretching away to the west the head of the station greeted them warmly he was a heavyset bearded scientist named macgregor who looked like santa claus in a patagonia vest evans was annoyed that macgregor seemed to know kenner at least by reputation the two men immediately struck up a friendly conversation evans excused himself saying he wanted to check his email he was shown to a room with several computer terminals he signed on to one and went directly to the site for science magazine it took him only a few moments to determine that the references sanjong had given him were genuine evans read the online abstracts and then the full text he began to feel a little better kenner had summarized the raw data correctly but he had drawn a different interpretation from that of the authors the authors of those papers were firmly committed to the idea of global warmingand said so in the text or at least most of them did it was a bit complicated in one paper it was clear that even though the authors gave lip service to the threat of global warming their data seemed to suggest the opposite of what they were saying in the text but that apparent confusion evans suspected was probably just the result of drawing up a paper with half a dozen authors what they said was they supported the idea of global warming and that was what counted more disturbing was the paper on the increase in ice thickness in the ross ice shelf here evans found some troubling points first the author did say that the shelf had been melting for the last six thousand years ever since the holocene era though evans could not remember reading in any article about melting antarctic ice that it had been going on for the last six thousand years if that were true it wasnt exactly news on the contrary the author suggested that the real news was the end of this longterm melting trend and the first evidence of ice thickening the author was hinting that this might be the first sign of the start of the next ice age jesus the next ice age there was a knock on the door behind him sarah stuck her head in kenner wants us she said hes discovered something looks like were going out on the ice the map covered the entire wall showing the enormous starshaped continent in the lower righthand corner was weddell station and the curving arc of the ross ice shelf weve learned kenner said that a supply ship docked five days ago bringing boxes of field material for an american scientist named james brewster from the university of michigan brewster is a very recent arrival who was permitted to come at the last minute because the terms of his research grant were unusually generous in their allowance for overheadmeaning the station would get some muchneeded money for operations so he bought his way in evans said in effect when did he get here last week where is he now out in the field kenner pointed to the map somewhere south of the slopes of mount terror and thats where were going you say this guys a scientist from michigan sarah said no kenner said we just checked with the university they have a professor james brewster all right hes a geophysicist at the university of michigan and right now hes in ann arbor waiting for his wife to deliver a baby so who is this guy nobody knows and what was his offloaded equipment evans said nobody knows that either it was helicoptered out to the field still in the original crates the guys been out there a week with two socalled graduate students whatever hes doing hes apparently working across a large area so he moves his base camp frequently nobody here knows precisely where he is kenner lowered his voice one of the graduate students came back yesterday to do some computer work but we wont use him to lead us out there for obvious reasons well use one of the staff people at weddell jimmy bolden hes very knowledgeable the weathers too dicey for helicopters so we have to take snowtracks its seventeen miles to the camp the snowtracks should get us there in two hours the outside temperatures perfect for springtime in antarcticaminus twentyfive degrees fahrenheit so bundle up any questions evans glanced at his watch wont it get dark soon we have much less nighttime now that spring is here well have daylight all the time were out there the only problem we face is right here kenner said pointing to the map we have to cross the shear zone the shear zone wednesday october pm the shear zone jimmy bolden said as they trudged toward the vehicle shed theres nothing to it you just have to be careful thats all but what is it sarah said its a zone where the ice is subjected to lateral forces shear forces a bit like the land in california but instead of having earthquakes you get crevasses lots of em deep ones we have to cross that its not a problem bolden said two years ago they built a road that crosses the zone safely they filled in all the crevasses along the road they went into the corrugated steel shed evans saw a row of boxy vehicles with red cabs and tractor treads these are the snowtracks bolden said you and sarahll go in one dr kenner in one and ill be in the third leading you why cant we all go in one standard precaution keep the weight down you dont want your vehicle to fall through into a crevasse i thought you said there was a road where the crevasses were filled in there is but the road is on an ice field and the ice moves a couple of inches a day which means the road moves dont worry its clearly marked with flags bolden climbed up onto the tread here let me show you the features of the snowtrack you drive it like a regular car clutch there handbrake accelerator steering wheel you run your heater on this switch here he pointed to a switch and keep it on at all times it will maintain the cab at around ten above zero this bulgey orange beacon on the dashboard is your transponder it turns on when you push this button here it also turns on automatically if the vehicle shifts more than thirty degrees from horizontal you mean if we fall into a crevasse sarah said trust me that isnt going to happen bolden said im just showing you the features transponder broadcasts a unique vehicle code so we can come and find you if for any reason you need to be rescued you should know the average time to rescue is two hours your food is here water here you have enough for ten days medical kit here including morphine and antibiotics fire extinguisher here expedition equipment in this boxcrampons ropes carabiners all that space blankets here equipped with mini heaters theyll keep you above freezing for a week if you crawl inside em thats about it we communicate by radio speaker in the cab microphone above the windshield voiceactivatedjust talk got it got it sarah said climbing up then lets get started professor you clear on everything i am kenner said climbing up into the adjacent cab okay bolden said just remember that whenever you are outside your vehicle it is going to be thirty below zero keep your hands and face covered any exposed skin will get frostbite in less than a minute five minutes and youre in danger of losing anatomy we dont want you folks going home without all your fingers and toes or noses bolden went to the third cab we proceed single file he said three cablengths apart no closer under any circumstances and no farther if a storm comes up and visibility drops we maintain the same distance but reduce our speed got it they all nodded then lets go at the far end of the shed a corrugated door rolled up the icy metal screeching bright sunlight outside looks like a beautiful day in the neighborhood bolden said and with a sputter of diesel exhaust he drove the first snowtrack out through the door it was a bouncing bonejolting ride the ice field that had looked so flat and featureless from a distance was surprisingly rugged when experienced up close with long troughs and steep hillocks evans felt like he was in a boat crashing through choppy seas except of course this sea was frozen and they were moving slowly through it sarah drove her hands confident on the wheel evans sat in the passenger seat beside her clutching the dashboard to keep his balance how fast are we going looks like fourteen miles an hour evans grunted as they nosed down a short trench then up again weve got two hours of this thats what he said by the way did you check kenners references yes evans said in a sulky voice were they made up no their vehicle was third in the row ahead was kenners snowtrack following behind boldens in the lead the radio hissed okay they heard bolden say over the speaker now were coming into the shear zone maintain your distance and stay within the flags evans could see nothing differentit just looked like more ice field glistening in the sunbut here there were red flags on both sides of the route the flags were mounted on sixfoothigh posts as they moved deeper into the field he looked beyond the road to the openings of crevasses in the ice they had a deep blue color and seemed to glow how deep are they evans said the deepest weve found is a kilometer bolden said over the radio some of them are a thousand feet most are a few hundred feet or less they all have that color they do yes but you dont want a closer look despite the dire warnings they crossed the field in safety leaving the flags behind now they saw to the left a sloping mountain with white clouds thats erebus bolden said its an active volcano thats steam coming from the summit sometimes it lobs chunks of lava but never this far out mount terror is inactive you see it ahead that little slope evans was disappointed the name mount terror had suggested something fearsome to himnot this gentle hill with a rocky outcrop at the top if the mountain hadnt been pointed out to him he might not have noticed it at all why is it called mount terror he said its not terrifying has nothing to do with that the first antarctic landmarks were named after the ships that discovered them bolden said terror was apparently the name of a ship in the nineteenth century wheres the brewster camp sarah said should be visible any minute now bolden said so you people are some kind of inspectors were from the iadg kenner said the international inspection agency were required to make sure that no us research project violates the international agreements on antarctica uhhuh amp dr brewster showed up so quickly kenner went on he never submitted his research grant proposal for iadg approval so well check in the field its just routine they bounced and crunched onward for several minutes in silence they still did not see a camp huh bolden said maybe he moved it what type of research is he doing kenner said im not sure bolden said but i heard hes studying the mechanics of ice calving you know how the ice flows to the edge and then breaks off the shelf brewsters been planting gps units in the ice to record how it moves toward the sea are we close to the sea evans said about ten or eleven miles away bolden said to the north sarah said if hes studying iceberg formation why is he working so far from the coast actually this isnt so far kenner said two years ago an iceberg broke off the ross shelf that was four miles wide and forty miles long it was as big as rhode island one of the biggest ever seen not because of global warming though evans said to sarah with a disgusted snort global warming couldnt be responsible for that oh no actually it wasnt responsible kenner said it was caused by local conditions evans sighed why am i not surprised kenner said theres nothing wrong with the idea of local conditions peter this is a continent it would be surprising if it didnt have its own distinctive weather patterns irrespective of global trends that may or may not exist and thats very true bolden said there are definitely local patterns here like the katabatic winds the what katabatic winds theyre gravitational winds youve probably noticed that its a lot windier here than in the interior the interior of the continent is relatively calm whats a gravitational wind evans said antarcticas basically one big ice dome bolden said the interior is higher than the coast and colder cold air flows downhill and gathers speed as it goes it can be blowing fifty eighty miles an hour when it reaches the coast today is not a bad day though thats a relief evans said and then bolden said see there dead ahead thats professor brewsters research camp brewster camp wednesday october pm it wasnt much to look at a pair of orange domed tents one small one large flapping in the wind it looked like the large one was for equipment they could see the edges of boxes pressing against the tent fabric from the camp evans could see orangeflagged units stuck into the ice every few hundred yards in a line stretching away into the distance well stop now bolden said im afraid dr brewsters not here at the moment his snowtrack is gone ill just have a look kenner said they shut the engines and climbed out evans had thought it was chilly in the cab but it was a shock to feel the cold air hit him as he stepped out onto the ice he gasped and coughed kenner appeared to have no reaction he went straight for the supply tent and disappeared inside bolden pointed down the line of flags you see his vehicle tracks there parallel to the sensor units dr brewster must have gone out to check his line it runs almost a hundred miles to the west sarah said a hundred miles thats right he has installed gps radio units all along that distance they transmit back to him and he records how they move with the ice but there wouldnt be much movement amp not in the course of a few days no but these sensors will remain in place for a year or more sending back the data by radio to weddell dr brewster is staying that long oh no hell go back im sure its too expensive to keep him here his grant allows an initial twentyoneday stay only and then monitoring visits of a week every few months but well be forwarding his data to him actually we just put it up on the internet he takes it wherever he happens to be so you assign him a secure web page exactly evans stamped his feet in the cold so is brewster coming back or what should be coming back but i couldnt tell you when from within the tent kenner shouted evans i guess he wants me evans went to the tent bolden said to sarah go ahead with him if you want to he pointed off to the south where clouds were darkening we dont want to be staying here too long looks like weather coming up we have two hours ahead of us and it wont be any fun if it socks in visibility drops to ten feet or less wed have to stay put until it cleared and that might be two or three days ill tell them she said evans pushed the tent flap aside the interior glowed orange from the fabric there were the remains of wooden crates broken down and stacked on the ground on top of them were dozens of cardboard boxes all stenciled identically they each had the university of michigan logo and then green lettering university of michigan dept of environmental science contents research materials extremely sensitive handle with care this side up looks official evans was saying you sure this guy isnt an actual research scientist see for yourself kenner said opening one cardboard carton within it evans saw a stack of plastic cones roughly the size of highway cones except they were black not orange you know what these are no evans shook his head sarah came into the tent bolden says bad weather coming and we shouldnt stay here dont worry we wont kenner said sarah i need you to go into the other tent see if you can find a computer there any kind of computerlaptop lab controller pdaanything with a microprocessor in it and see if you can find any radio equipment you mean transmitters or radios for listening anything with an antenna okay she turned and went outside again evans was still going through the cartons he opened three then a fourth they all contained the same black cones i dont get it kenner took one cone turned it to the light in raised lettering it said unit ptbcxxaw us dod evans said these are military correct kenner said but what are they theyre the protective containers for coned ptbs ptbs precisiontimed blasts theyre explosives detonated with millisecond timing by computer in order to induce resonant effects the individual blasts are not particularly destructive but the timing sets up standing waves in the surrounding material thats where the destructive power comes fromthe standing wave whats a standing wave evans said you ever watch girls play jump rope yes well if instead of spinning the rope they shake it up and down they generate loopy waves that travel along the length of the rope back and forth okay amp but if the girls shake it just right the waves appear to stop moving back and forth the rope takes on a single curved shape and holds it youve seen that well thats a standing wave it reflects back and forth in perfect synchronization so it doesnt seem to move and these explosives do that yes in nature standing waves are incredibly powerful they can shake a suspension bridge to pieces they can shatter a skyscraper the most destructive effects of earthquakes are caused by standing waves generated in the crust so brewsters got these explosives ampset in a row ampfor a hundred miles isnt that what bolden said a hundred miles right and i think theres no question what he intends our friend brewster is hoping to fracture the ice for a hundred miles and break off the biggest iceberg in the history of the planet sarah stuck her head in kenner said did you find a computer no she said theres nothing there nothing at all no sleeping bag no food no personal effects nothing but a bare tent the guys gone kenner swore all right he said now listen carefully heres what we are going to do to weddell station wednesday october pm oh no jimmy bolden said shaking his head im sorry but i cant allow that dr kenner its too dangerous why is it dangerous kenner said you take these two back to the station and ill follow brewsters snowtracks until i meet up with him no sir we all stay together sir jimmy kenner said firmly were not going to do that with all due respect sir you dont know your way around this part of the world amp you forget i am an iadg inspector kenner said i was resident in vostok station for six months in the winter of and i was resident in morval for three months in i know exactly what im doing gee i dont know amp call back to weddell the station chief will confirm it well sir if you put it that way amp i do kenner said firmly now get these two people back to base time is wasting okay if youll be all right amp bolden turned to evans and sarah then i guess we go mount up folks and well head out within minutes evans and sarah were jouncing along on the ice following behind boldens snowtrack behind them kenner was driving parallel to the line of flags heading east evans looked back just in time to see kenner stop get out check one of the flags briefly then get back in again and drive on bolden saw it too what is he doing he said in an anxious tone just looking at the unit i guess he shouldnt be getting out of his vehicle bolden said and he shouldnt be alone on the shelf its against regulations sarah had the feeling bolden was about to turn back she said i can tell you something about dr kenner jimmy whats that you dont want to make him mad really no jimmy you dont well ampokay then they drove on climbing a long rise descending on the other side brewsters camp was gone and so was kenners snowtrack ahead lay the vast white field of the ross ice shelf stretching away to the gray horizon two hours folks bolden said and then a hot shower the first hour passed uneventfully evans started to fall asleep only to be jolted awake by the sharp movements of the vehicle then he would drift off again his head nodding until the next shock sarah was driving he said to her arent you tired no not at all she said the sun was now low on the horizon and obscured by fog the landscape was shades of pale gray with almost no separation between land and sky evans yawned want me to take over ive got it thanks im a good driver i know you are he was thinking she had a definite bossy side despite her charm and her beauty she was the kind of woman who would want to control the remote i bet you want the remote he said you think so she smiled it was irritating in a certain way he thought that she did not take him seriously as a man at least not as a man she could be interested in in truth she was a little too cool for his taste a little too ice blond a little too controlled beneath that beautiful exterior the radio clicked bolden said i dont like this weather coming in we better take a shortcut what shortcut its only half a mile but itll save twenty minutes on our time follow me he turned his snowtrack left leaving the packed snow road and heading off onto the ice fields okay sarah said right behind you good work bolden said were still an hour from weddell i know this route its a piece of cake just stay directly behind me not to the left or right but directly behind you understand got it sarah said good in a matter of minutes they had moved several hundred yards from the road the ice there was bare and hard the treads of the snowtracks scratching and squeaking as they crossed it youre on ice now bolden said i noticed wont be long now evans was looking out the window he could no longer see the road in fact he wasnt sure anymore in which direction it lay everything now looked the same he felt anxious suddenly were really in the middle of nowhere the snowtrack slid laterally a little across the ice he grabbed for the dashboard sarah immediately brought the vehicle back under control jeez evans said clinging to the dashboard are you a nervous passenger she said maybe a little too bad we cant get some music is there any way to get music she asked bolden you should bolden said weddell broadcasts twentyfour hours just a minute he stopped his snowtrack and walked back to their stopped vehicle he climbed up on the tread and opened the door in a blast of freezing air sometimes you get interference from this he said and unclipped the transponder from the dash okay try your radio now sarah fiddled with the receiver twisting the knob bolden walked back to his red cab carrying the transponder his diesel engine spit a cloud of black exhaust as he put the snowtrack in gear you think theyd be a little more ecologically minded evans said looking at the exhaust as boldens snowtrack chugged forward im not getting any music sarah said never mind evans said i dont care that much they drove another hundred yards then bolden stopped again now what evans said bolden climbed out of his vehicle walked to the back of it and looked at his own treads sarah was still fiddling with the radio punching the buttons for the different transmission frequencies she got bursts of static for each im not sure this is an improvement evans said just let it go why have we stopped anyway i dont know sarah said he seems to be checking something now bolden turned and looked back at them he didnt move he just stood there and stared should we get out evans said the radio crackled and they heard is weddell cm to are you there dr kenner weddell cm tokenner can you hear hey sarah said smiling i think we finally got something the radio hissed and sputtered just found jimmy bolden unconscious inmaintenance room we dont know who isout there withbut its not oh shit evans said staring at the man in front of them that guys not bolden who is he i dont know but hes blocking the way sarah said and hes waiting waiting for what there was a loud crack from beneath them inside the cab the sound echoed like a gunshot their vehicle shifted slightly screw this sarah said were getting out of here even if i have to ram the bastard she put the snowtrack in gear and started to back away from the vehicle in front of them she shifted starting the snowtrack forward again another crack lets go evans said lets go crack crack their vehicle lurched beneath them tilted sideways at an angle evans looked out at the guy pretending to be bolden its the ice sarah said hes waiting for our weight to break through ram him evans said pointing ahead the bastard was making some hand gesture to them it took him a moment for evans to understand what it meant then he got it the man was waving goodbye sarah stomped on the accelerator and the engine rumbled forward but in the next moment the ground gave way completely beneath them and their vehicle nosed down evans saw the blueice wall of a crevasse then the vehicle began to tumble forward and they were encased for an instant in a world of eerie blue before they plunged onward into the blackness below shear zone wednesday october pm sarah opened her eyes and saw a huge blue starburst streaks radiating outward in all directions her forehead was icy cold and she had terrible pain in her neck tentatively she shifted her body checking each of her limbs they hurt but she could move all of them except her right leg which was pinned under something she coughed and paused taking stock she was lying on her side her face shoved up against the windshield which she had shattered with her forehead her eyes were just inches from the fractured glass she eased away and slowly looked around it was dark a kind of twilight faint light coming from somewhere to her left but she could see that the whole cab of the snowtrack was lying on its side the treads up against the ice wall they must have landed on a ledge of some kind she looked upwardthe mouth of the crevasse was surprisingly close maybe thirty or forty yards above her it was near enough to give her a burst of encouragement next she looked down trying to see evans but it was dark everywhere beneath her she couldnt see him at all her eyes slowly adjusted she gasped she saw her true situation there was no ledge the snowtrack had tumbled into the narrowing crevasse and wedged itself sideways within the crevasse walls the treads were against one wall the roof of the cab against the other and the cab itself was suspended over the inky downward gash the door on evanss side hung open evans was not in the cab he had fallen out into the blackness peter no answer peter can you hear me she listened there was nothing no sound or movement nothing at all and then the realization hit her she was alone down there a hundred feet down in a freezing crevasse in the middle of a trackless ice field far off the road miles from anywhere and she realized with a chill that this was going to be her tomb boldenor whoever he washad planned it very well sarah thought he had taken their transponder he could drive a few miles drop it down the deepest crevasse he could find and then go back to the base when the rescue parties set out they would head for the transponder it would be nowhere near where she was the party might search for days in a deep crevasse before giving up and if they widened the search they still wouldnt find the snowtrack even though it was only about forty yards below the surface it might as well be four hundred yards below it was too deep to be seen by a passing helicopter or even a vehicle as it drove by not that any vehicle would they would think the snowtrack had gone off the marked road and they would search along the edge of the road not way out here in the middle of the ice field the road was seventeen miles long they would spend days searching no sarah thought they would never find her and even if she could get herself to the surface what then she had no compass no map no gps no radioit lay smashed beneath her knee she didnt even know in what direction weddell station might be from her present location of course she thought she had a bright red parka that would be visible from a distance and she had supplies food equipmentall the equipment that guy had talked about before they set out what was it exactly she vaguely remembered something about climbing supplies crampons and ropes sarah bent down managed to free herself from a toolbox that had pinned her foot to the floor and then crawled to the rear of the cab balancing carefully to avoid the gaping wideopen door beneath her in the perpetual twilight of the crevasse she saw the supply locker it was crumpled slightly from the impact and she couldnt get it open she went back to the toolbox opened it took out a hammer and a screwdriver and spent the better part of the next half hour trying to pry the locker open at last with a metallic screech the door swung wide she peered inside the locker was empty no food no water no climbing supplies no space blankets no heaters nothing at all sarah took a deep breath let it out slowly she remained calm refusing to panic she considered her options without ropes and crampons she could not get to the surface what could she use instead she had a toolbox could she use the screwdriver as an ice axe probably too small perhaps she could disassemble the gearshift and make an ice axe out of the parts or perhaps she could take apart some of the tread and find parts to use she had no crampons but if she could find sharp pointed things screws or something like that she could push them through the soles of her boots and then climb and for a rope some sort of cloth perhaps ampshe looked around the interior maybe she could tear the fabric off the seats or cut it off in strips that might work in this way she kept her spirits up she kept herself moving forward even if her chance of success was small there was still a chance a chance she focused on that where was kenner what would he do when he heard the radio message he probably had already would he come back to weddell almost certainly and he would look for that guy the one they thought of as bolden but sarah was pretty sure that guy had disappeared and with his disappearance her hopes for rescue the crystal of her watch was smashed she didnt know how long she had been down there but she noticed that it was darker than before the gap above her was not as bright either the weather on the surface was changing or the sun was low on the horizon that would mean she had been down there for two or three hours already she was aware of a stiffening in her bodynot just from the fall but also she realized because she was cold the cab had lost its heat it occurred to her that perhaps she could start the motor and get heat going it was worth a try she flicked on the headlights and one of them worked glaring off the ice wall so there was still electricity from the battery she turned the key the generator made a grinding sound the engine did not kick on and she heard a voice yell hey sarah looked up toward the surface she saw nothing but the gap and the strip of gray sky beyond hey she squinted was somebody really up there she yelled back hey im down here i know where you are the voice said and then she realized the voice was coming from below her she looked down into the depths of the crevasse peter she said im fucking freezing he said his voice floated up from the darkness are you hurt no i dont think so i dont know i cant move im wedged in some kind of cleft or something how far down are you i dont know i cant turn my head to look up im stuck sarah his voice trembled he sounded frightened can you move at all she said just one arm can you see anything ice i see a blue wall its about two feet away sarah was straddling the open door peering down into the crevasse straining to see it was very dark down there but it seemed as if the crevasse narrowed quickly farther down if so he might not be that far beneath her peter move your arm can you move your arm yes wave it i am she didnt see anything just darkness okay she said stop did you see me no shit he coughed its really cold sarah i know hang on she had to find a way to see down into the cleft she looked under the dashboard near where the fire extinguisher was clipped to the car wall if there was a fire extinguisher there was probably a flashlight there too they would be sure to have a flashlight ampsomeplace not under the dashboard maybe the glove compartment she opened it shoved her hand in feeling in the darkness crunching paper her fingers closed around a thick cylinder she brought it out it was a flashlight she flicked it on it worked she shone it down into the depths of the crevasse i see that peter said i see the light good she said now swing your arm again i am now im doing it now she stared peter i dont seewait a minute she did see himjust the tips of his fingers in their red gloves protruding briefly beyond the tractor treads and the ice below peter what youre very near me she said just five or six feet below me great can you get me out i could if i had a rope theres no rope he said no i opened the supply chest theres nothing at all but its not in the supply chest he said its under the seat what yeah i saw it the ropes and stuff are under the passenger seat she looked the seat was on a steel base anchored firmly to the floor of the snowtrack there were no doors or compartments in the base it was difficult to maneuver around the seat to see but she was sure no doors on a sudden impulse she lifted up the seat cushion and saw a compartment beneath it the light of her flashlight revealed ropes hooks snow axes crampons amp got it she said you were right its all here whew he said she brought the equipment out carefully making sure none of it fell through the open door already her fingers were growing numb and she felt clumsy as she held a fiftyfoot length of nylon rope with a threepronged ice hook at one end peter she said if i lower a rope can you grab it maybe i think so can you hold the rope tight so i can pull you out i dont know i just have the one arm free the other ones pinned under me are you strong enough to hold the rope with one arm i dont know i dont think so i mean if i got my body partway out and lost my grip amp his voice broke off he sounded on the verge of tears okay she said dont worry im trapped sarah no youre not i am im trapped im fucking trapped now there was panic im going to die here peter stop she was coiling the rope around her waist as she spoke its going to be all right i have a plan what plan im going to lower an ice hook on the rope she said can you hook it onto something like your belt not my belt ampno im wedged in here sarah i cant move i cant reach my belt she was trying to visualize his situation he must be wedged in some sort of cleft in the ice it was frightening just to imagine it no wonder he was scared peter she said can you hook it onto anything ill try okay here it comes she said lowering the rope the hook disappeared into the darkness do you see it i see it can you reach it no okay ill swing it toward you she turned her wrist gently starting the rope in a lateral swing the hook vanished out of sight then swung back then out of sight again i cant ampkeep doing it sarah i am i cant get it sarah keep trying it has to be lower okay how much lower about a foot okay she lowered it a foot hows that good now swing it she did she heard him grunting but each time the hook swung back into view i cant do it sarah yes you can keep trying i cant my fingers are too cold keep trying she said here it is again i cant sarah i cant amphey what i almost got it looking down she saw the hook spinning when it came back into view hed touched it once more she said youll do it peter im trying its just i have so littlei got it sarah i got it she gave a long sigh of relief he was coughing in the darkness she waited okay he said i got it hooked on my jacket where right on the front just on my chest she was visualizing that if the hook ripped free it would tear right into his chin no peter hook it on the armpit i cant unless you pull me out a couple of feet okay say when he coughed listen sarah are you strong enough to pull me out she had avoided thinking about that she just assumed that somehow she could of course she didnt know how hard he was wedged in but ampyes she said i can do it are you sure i weigh a hundred and sixty he coughed again maybe a little more maybe ten more ive got you tied off on the steering wheel okay but ampdont drop me i wont drop you peter there was a pause how much do you weigh peter you never ask a lady that question especially in la were not in la i dont know how much i weigh she said of course she knew exactly she weighed a hundred and thirtyseven pounds he weighed over thirty pounds more than that but i know i can pull you up she said are you ready shit peter are you ready or not yeah go she drew the rope tight then crouched down planting her feet firmly on either side of the open door she felt like a sumo wrestler at the start of a match but she knew her legs were much stronger than her arms this was the only way she could do it she took a deep breath ready she said i guess sarah began to stand upright her legs burning with effort the rope stretched taut then moved upwardslowly at first just a few inches but it was moving it was moving okay stop stop what stop okay she was in midcrouch but i cant hold this for long dont hold it at all let it out slowly about three feet she realized that she must have already pulled him part of the way out of the cleft his voice sounded better much less frightened though he was coughing almost continuously peter minute im hooking it on my belt okay amp i can see up now he said i can see the tread the tread is about six feet above my head okay but when you pull me up the ropes going to rub on the edge of the tread itll be okay she said and ill be hanging right over the uh amp i wont let you go peter he coughed for a while she waited he said tell me when youre ready im ready then lets get this over with he said before i get scared there was only one bad moment she had pulled him up about four feet and he came free of the cleft and she suddenly took the full weight of his body it shocked her the rope slid three feet down he howled sarah she gripped the rope stopped it sorry fuck sorry she adjusted to the added weight started pulling again she was groaning with the effort but it was not long before she saw his hand appear above the tread and he gripped it and began to haul himself over then two hands and his head appeared that shocked her too his face was covered in thick blood his hair matted red but he was smiling keep pulling sister i am peter i am only after he finally had scrambled into the cab did sarah sink to the floor her legs began to shake violently her body trembled all over evans lying on his side coughing and wheezing beside her hardly noticed eventually the trembling passed she found the firstaid kit and began to clean his face up its only a superficial cut she said but youll need stitches if we ever get out of here amp well get out all right im glad youre confident he looked out the window at the ice above you done much ice climbing she shook her head but ive done plenty of rock climbing how different can it be more slippery and what happens when we get up there he said i dont know we have no idea where to go well follow the guys snowtracks if theyre still there if they havent blown away and you know its at least seven or eight miles to weddell peter she said if a storm comes up maybe were better off down here im not staying here she said if im going to die ill die in daylight the actual climb up the crevasse wall was not so bad once sarah got used to the way she had to kick her boots with the crampons and how hard she had to swing the axe to make it bite into the ice it took her only seven or eight minutes to cover the distance and clamber onto the surface the surface looked exactly the same as before the same dim sunlight the same gray horizon that blended with the ground the same gray featureless world she helped evans up his cut was bleeding again and his mask was red frozen stiff against his face shit its cold he said which way do you think sarah was looking at the sun it was low on the horizon but was it sinking or rising and which direction did the sun indicate anyway when you were at the south pole she frowned she couldnt work it out and she didnt dare make a mistake well follow the tracks she said at last she took off her crampons and started walking she had to admit peter was right about one thing it was much colder here on the surface after half an hour the wind came up blowing strongly they had to lean into it as they trudged forward worse the snow began to blow across the ground beneath their feet which meant were losing the tracks evans said i know theyre getting blown away i know sometimes he was such a baby what did he expect her to do about the wind what do we do he said i dont know peter ive never been lost in antarctica before well me neither they trudged onward but it was your idea to come up here peter pull yourself together pull myself together its fucking freezing sarah i cant feel my nose or my ears or my fingers or my toes or peter she grabbed him by the shoulders and shook him shut up he was silent through slots in his facemask he stared out at her his eyelashes were white with ice i cant feel my nose either sarah said we have to keep a grip she looked around turning a full circle trying to conceal her own growing desperation the wind was blowing more snow now it was becoming harder to see the world was flatter and grayer with almost no sense of depth if this weather continued they would soon not be able to see the ground well enough to avoid the crevasses then they would have to stop where they were in the middle of nowhere he said youre beautiful when youre angry you know that peter for christs sake well you are she started walking looking down at the ground trying to see the tread marks come on peter perhaps the tracks would return soon to the road if they did the road would be easier to follow in a storm and safer for walking i think im falling in love sarah peter amp i had to tell you this may be my last chance he started coughing again save your breath peter fucking freezing they stumbled on no longer speaking the wind howled sarahs parka was pressed flat against her body it became harder and harder to move forward but she pressed on she did not know how much longer she continued in that way before she raised a hand and stopped evans must not have been able to see her because he walked into her back grunted and stopped they had to put their heads together and shout to hear each other above the wind we have to stop she yelled i know and then because she didnt know what else to do she sat down on the ground and pulled her legs up and lowered her head to her knees and tried not to cry the wind grew louder and louder now it was shrieking the air was thick with flying snow evans sat down beside her were going to fucking die he said shear zone wednesday october pm she started shivering little tremulous bursts at first and then almost continuously she felt as if she were having a seizure from skiing she knew what that meant her core temperature had dropped dangerously and the shivering was an automatic physiological attempt to warm her body up her teeth chattered it was hard to speak but her mind was still working still looking for a way out isnt there a way to build a snow house evans said something the wind whipped his words away do you know how she said he didnt answer her but it was too late anyway she thought she was losing control of her body she could hardly even keep her arms wrapped around her knees the shaking was so bad and she was starting to feel sleepy she looked over at evans he was lying on his side on the ice she nudged him to get up she kicked him he didnt move she wanted to yell at him but she couldnt because her teeth were chattering so badly sarah fought to retain consciousness but the desire to sleep was becoming overpowering she struggled to keep her eyes open and to her astonishment began to see swift scenes from her lifeher childhood her mother her kindergarten class ballet lessons the high school prom amp her whole life was passing before her just like the books said happened right before you died and when she looked up she saw a light in the distance just like they said happened a light at the end of a long dark tunnel amp she couldnt fight it any longer she lay down she couldnt feel the ground anyway she was lost in her own private world of pain and exhaustion and the light before her was growing brighter and brighter and now there were two other lights blinking yellow and green amp yellow and green she fought the sleepiness she tried to push herself upright again but she couldnt her muscles were too weak her arms blocks of frozen ice she couldnt move yellow and green lights growing larger and a white light in the center very white like halogen she was starting to see details through the swirling snow there was a silver dome and wheels and large glowing letters the letters said nasa she coughed the thing emerged from the snow it was some kind of small vehicleabout three feet high no larger than those sunday lawnmowers that people drove around on it had big wheels and a flattened dome and it was beeping as it came directly toward her in fact it was going to drive right over her she realized it without concern she could do nothing to prevent it she lay on the ground dazed indifferent the wheels grew larger and larger the last thing she remembered was a mechanical voice saying hello hello please move out of the way thank you very much for your cooperation hello hello please move out of the way amp and then nothing weddell station wednesday october pm darkness pain harsh voices pain rubbing all over her body arms and legs like fire rubbed on her body she groaned a voice spoke rasping and distant it sounded like coffee grounds the rubbing continued brisk and harsh and excruciating and a sound like sandpaperscratching rough terrible something struck her in the face on the mouth she licked her lips it was snow freezing snow cousins set a voice said nod eely it was a foreign language chinese or something sarah heard several voices now she tried to open her eyes but could not her eyes were held shut by something heavy over her face like a mask or she tried to reach up but couldnt all her limbs were held down and the rubbing continued rubbing rubbing amp she groaned she tried to speak thin song now whore nod don thin song kee pub yar wok pain they rubbed her whoever they were while she lay immobilized in darkness and gradually more sensation returned to her limbs and to her face she was not glad for it the pain grew worse and worse she felt as if she were burned everywhere on her body the voices seemed to float around her disembodied there were more of them now four fiveshe was not sure anymore all women it sounded like and now they were doing something else she realized violating her sticking something in her body dull and cold not painful cold the voices floated slithered all around her at her head at her feet touching her roughly it was a dream or death maybe she was dead she thought she felt oddly detached about it the pain made her detached and then she heard a womans voice in her ear very close to her ear and very distinct the voice said sarah she moved her mouth sarah are you awake she nodded slightly i am going to take the icepack off your face all right she nodded the weight the mask was lifted open your eyes slowly she did she was in a dimly lit room with white walls a monitor to one side a tangle of green lines it was like a hospital room a woman looked down at her with concern the woman wore a white nurses uniform and a down vest the room was cold sarah could see her breath she said dont try to speak sarah didnt youre dehydrated itll be a few hours yet were bringing your temperature up slowly youre very lucky sarah youre not going to lose anything not lose anything she felt alarmed her mouth moved her tongue was dry thick feeling a sort of hissing sound came from her throat dont speak the woman said its too soon is your pain bad yes ill give you something for it she raised a syringe your friend saved your life you know he managed to get to his feet and open the radiophone on the nasa robot thats how we knew where to find you her lips moved hes in the next room we think hell be all right too now just rest she felt something cold in her veins her eyes closed weddell station thursday october pm the nurses left peter evans alone to get dressed he put on his clothes slowly taking stock of himself he was all right he decided though his ribs hurt when he breathed he had a big bruise on the left side of his chest another big bruise on his thigh and an ugly purple welt on his shoulder a line of stitches on his scalp his whole body was stiff and aching it was excruciating to put on his socks and shoes but he was all right in fact better than thathe felt new somehow almost reborn out there on the ice he had been certain he was going to die how he found the strength to get to his feet he did not know he had felt sarah kicking him but he did not respond to her then hed heard the beeping sound and when he looked up he saw the letters nasa hed realized vaguely that it was some kind of vehicle so there must be a driver the front tires had stopped just inches from his body he managed to get to his knees and haul himself up over the tires grabbing onto the struts he hadnt understood why the driver hadnt climbed out and helped him finally he managed to get to his knees in the howling wind he realized that the vehicle was low and bulbous barely four feet off the ground it was too small for any human operatorit was some kind of robot he scraped snow away from the domelike shell the lettering read nasa remote vehicle meteorite survey the vehicle was talking repeating a taped voice over and over evans couldnt understand what it was saying because of the wind he brushed away the snow thinking there must be some method of communication some antenna some then his fingers had touched a panel with a finger hole he pulled it open inside he saw a telephonea regular telephone handset bright red he held it to his frozen mask he could not hear anything from it but he said hello hello nothing more he collapsed again but the nurses told him what he had done was enough to send a signal to the nasa station at patriot hills nasa had notified weddell who sent out a search party and found them in ten minutes they were both still alive barely that had been more than twentyfour hours ago it had taken the medical team twelve hours to bring their body temperatures back to normal because the nurse said it had to be done slowly they told evans he was going to be fine but he might lose a couple of his toes they would have to wait and see it would be a few days his feet were bandaged with some kind of protective splints around the toes he couldnt fit into his regular shoes but they had found him an oversized pair of sneakers they looked like they belonged to a basketball player on evans they made huge clown feet but he could wear them and there wasnt much pain tentatively he stood he was tremulous but he was all right the nurse came back hungry he shook his head not yet pain he shook his head just you know everywhere thatll get worse she said she gave him a small bottle of pills take one of these every four hours if you need it and youll probably need it to sleep for the next few days and sarah sarah will be another half hour or so wheres kenner i think hes in the computer room which way is that she said maybe you better lean on my shoulder amp im fine he said just tell me the way she pointed and he started walking but he was more unsteady than he realized his muscles werent working right he felt shaky all over he started to fall the nurse quickly ducked sliding her shoulder under his arm tell you what she said ill just show you the way this time he did not object kenner sat in the computer room with the bearded station chief macgregor and sanjong thapa everybody was looking grim we found him kenner said pointing to a computer monitor recognize your friend evans looked at the screen yeah he said thats the bastard on the screen was a photo of the man evans knew as bolden but the id form onscreen gave his name as david r kane twentysix years old born minneapolis ba notre dame ma university of michigan current status phd candidate in oceanography university of michigan ann arbor research project dynamics of ross shelf flow as measured by gps sensors thesis advisorproject supervisor james brewster university of michigan his names kane the weddell chief said hes been here for a week along with brewster where is he now evans said darkly no idea he didnt come back to the station today neither did brewster we think they may have gone to mcmurdo and hopped the morning transport out we have a call in to mcmurdo to do a vehicle count but they havent gotten back to us yet youre sure hes not still here evans said quite sure you need an id tag to open the exterior doors here so we always know whos where neither kane nor brewster opened any doors in the last twelve hours they arent here so you think they may be on the plane mcmurdo tower wasnt sure theyre pretty casual about the daily transportif somebody wants to go they just hop on and leave its a c so theres always plenty of room you see a lot of the research grants dont permit you to leave during the period of your research but people have birthdays and family events back on the mainland so they just go and come back its unrecorded if i recall kenner said brewster came here with two graduate students wheres the other one interesting he left from mcmurdo yesterday the day you arrived so they all got out kenner said got to give them credit theyre smart he looked at his watch now lets see what if anything they left behind the name on the door said dave kane u mich evans pushed it open and saw a small room an unmade bed a small desk with a messy stack of papers and four cans of diet coke there was a suitcase lying open in the corner lets get started kenner said ill take the bed and the suitcase you check the desk evans began to go through the papers on the desk they all seemed to be reprints of research articles some were stampe u mich geo lib followed by a number window dressing kenner said when he was shown the papers he brought those papers with him anything else anything personal evans didnt see anything of interest some of the papers were highlighted in yellow marker there was a stack of by notecards with some notes written on them but they seemed to be genuine and related to the stack of papers you dont suppose this guy is really a graduate student could be though i doubt it ecoterrorists arent usually well educated there were pictures of glacier flows and satellite images of various sorts evans shuffled through them quickly then he paused at one issesc scorpion b what caught his eye was the caption listen he said on that list of four locations wasnt one of them called scorpion yes amp its right here in antarctica evans said look at this kenner started to say but it cant be and abruptly broke off this is extremely interesting peter well done it was in that stack good anything else despite himself evans felt pleased by kenners approval he searched quickly a moment later he said yes theres another one issesc scorpion b its the same basic pattern of rock outcrops in the snow evans said excitedly and i dont know about these faint lines amproads rocks covered in snow yes kenner said i think thats almost certainly correct and if theyre aerial photographs there must be a way to trace them do you think these numbers are references of some kind theres no question kenner pulled out a small pocket magnifying glass and scanned the image peering closely yes peter very well done evans beamed from the doorway macgregor said you found something can i help i dont think so kenner said well deal with this ourselves evans said but maybe he will recognize no kenner said well get the id off the nasa image files lets continue they searched in silence for several minutes more kenner took out a pocketknife and began cutting the lining of the suitcase lying open in the corner of brewsters office ah he straightened in his fingers he held two curved arcs of pale rubber what are those evans said silicon or something very similar a kind of soft plastic at any rate kenner seemed very pleased whatre they for evans said i have no idea kenner said he resumed his search of the suitcase privately evans wondered why kenner was so pleased probably he was not saying what he knew in front of macgregor but what could two bits of rubber mean anyway what could they be used for evans went through the documents on the desk a second time but found nothing more he lifted the desk lamp and looked under the base he crouched down and looked under the desk in case something was taped there he found nothing kenner closed the suitcase as i thought nothing more we were very lucky to find what we did he turned to macgregor wheres sanjong in the server room doing what you requestedcutting brewster and his team out of the system the server room was hardly larger than a closet there were twin racks of processors running floor to ceiling and the usual mesh ceiling for cabling there was a master terminal in the room on a small steel table sanjong was crowded in there with a weddell technician at his side looking frustrated kenner and evans stood outside in the hallway evans was pleased that he felt steady enough to stand his strength was coming back quickly it hasnt been easy sanjong said to kenner the procedure here is to give each weddell researcher private storage space and also direct radio and internet connections and these three guys knew how to take advantage of it apparently the third man with brewster was the computer guy within a day of his arrival he got into the system as root and installed back doors and trojans all over the place were not sure how many were trying to get them out he also added a few dummy user accounts the technician said like about twenty sanjong said but im not worried about those theyre probably just thatdummies if this guy was smartand he washed have given himself access to the system through an existing user so hed go undetected were looking now for any users who have added a new secondary password in the last week but this system doesnt have a lot of maintenance utilities its slow going what about the trojans kenner said how are they timed in computer slang a trojan was an innocentlooking program installed in the system it was designed to wake up at a later time and carry out some action it derived its name from the way the greeks won the trojan warby making a huge horse and presenting it to the trojans as a gift once the horse was within the walls of troy the greek soliders who had been hiding inside it came out and attacked the city the classic trojan was one installed by a disgruntled employee it erased all the hard drives in a business three months after the employee was fired but there were many variations timing on all of the ones i found here is short sanjong said one day two days from now we found one that is three days from now nothing after that so just as we suspected kenner said exactly sanjong said nodding they intended it to happen soon intended what evans said the calving of the big iceberg kenner said why soon they would still have been here im not sure they would have but in any case the timing was determined by something else yes what evans said kenner gave him a look we can go into it later he turned back to sanjong and what about the radio connects we disabled all the direct connects right away he said and i assume you did work on the ground at the location itself i did kenner said what did you do on the ground evans said random disconnects of what tell you later so were redundant sanjong said no because we cant be sure theres not someone else embedded in this place who will undo our work i wish evans said i knew what the hell you guys were talking about amp later kenner said this time the look was sharp evans was silent he felt a little wounded macgregor said ms jones is awake and getting dressed all right kenner said i believe our work here is done wheels up in an hour to go where evans said i thought that was obvious kenner said helsinki finland en route friday october am the plane flew back through the dazzling morning light sarah was sleeping sanjong was working on his laptop kenner stared out the window evans said all right what did you disconnect randomly the cone charges kenner said they were laid out in a precise pattern four hundred meters apart i disconnected fifty at random mostly along the eastern end of the line that will suffice to prevent the standing wave from being generated so no iceberg thats the idea and why are we going to helsinki were not i only said that for the benefit of the technician were going to los angeles okay and why are we going to los angeles because thats where the nerf conference on abrupt climate change is being held this is all related to the conference kenner nodded these guys are trying to break off an iceberg to coincide with the conference exactly all part of any good starburst media plan you arrange an event with good visuals that reinforces the point of the conference you seem awfully calm about it evans said its the way things are done peter kenner shrugged environmental concerns dont come to the publics attention by accident you know what do you mean well take your favorite fear global warming the arrival of global warming was announced dramatically by a prominent climatologist james hansen in he gave testimony before a joint house and senate committee headed by senator wirth of colorado hearings were scheduled for june so hansen could deliver his testimony during a blistering heat wave it was a setup from the beginning that doesnt bother me evans said its legitimate to use a government hearing as a way to make the public aware really so youre saying that in your mind theres no difference between a government hearing and a press conference im saying hearings have been used that way many times before true but it is unquestionably manipulative and hansens testimony wasnt the only instance of media manipulation thats occurred in the course of the global warming sales campaign dont forget the lastminute changes in the ipcc report ipcc what lastminute changes the un formed the intergovernmental panel on climate change in the late s thats the ipcc as you knowa huge group of bureaucrats and scientists under the thumb of bureaucrats the idea was that since this was a global problem the un would track climate research and issue reports every few years the first assessment report in said it would be very difficult to detect a human influence on climate although everybody was concerned that one might exist but the report announced with conviction that there was now a discernable human influence on climate you remember that vaguely well the claim of a discernable human influence was written into the summary report after the scientists themselves had gone home originally the document said scientists couldnt detect a human influence on climate for sure and they didnt know when they would they said explicitly we dont know that statement was deleted and replaced with a new statement that a discernable human influence did indeed exist it was a major change is that true evans said yes changing the document caused a stir among scientists at the time with opponents and defendants of the change coming forward if you read their claims and counterclaims you cant be sure whos telling the truth but this is the internet age you can find the original documents and the list of changes online and decide for yourself a review of the actual text changes makes it crystal clear that the ipcc is a political organization not a scientific one evans frowned he wasnt sure how to answer hed heard of the ipcc of course although he didnt know much about it amp but my question is simpler peter if something is real if it is a genuine problem that requires action why does anybody have to exaggerate their claims why do there have to be carefully executed media campaigns i can give you a simple answer evans said the media is a crowded marketplace people are bombarded by thousands of messages every minute you have to speak loudlyand yes maybe exaggerate a littleif you want to get their attention and try to mobilize the entire world to sign the kyoto treaty well lets consider that when hansen announced in the summer of that global warming was here he predicted temperatures would increase degrees celsius over the next ten years do you know what the actual increase was im sure youll tell me it was less than that much less peter dr hansen overestimated by three hundred percent the actual increase was degrees okay but it did increase and ten years after his testimony he said that the forces that govern climate change are so poorly understood that longterm prediction is impossible he did not say that kenner sighed sanjong sanjong pecked at his laptop proceedings of the national academy of sciences october hansen didnt say that prediction was impossible he said quote the forcings that drive longterm climate change are not known with an accuracy sufficient to define future climate change endquote and he argued that in the future scientists should use multiple scenarios to define a range of possible climate outcomes well that isnt exactly stop quibbling kenner said he said it why do you think balder is worried about his witnesses in the vanutu case its because of statements like these however you attempt to reframe it its a clear statement of limited knowledge and its hardly the only one the ipcc itself made many limiting statements but hansen still believes in global warming yes he does and his prediction kenner said was wrong by three hundred percent so what you are ignoring the implication of an error that large kenner said compare it to other fields for example when nasa launched the rocket carrying the mars rover they announced that in two hundred and fifty three days the rover would land on the surface of mars at pm california time in fact it landed at pm that is an error of a few thousandths of a percent the nasa people knew what they were talking about okay fine but there are some things you have to estimate youre absolutely right kenner said people estimate all the time they estimate sales they estimate profits they estimate delivery dates they estimateby the way do you estimate your taxes for the government yes quarterly how accurate does that estimate have to be well theres no fixed rule peter how accurate without penalty maybe fifteen percent so if you were off by three hundred percent youd pay a penalty yes hansen was off by three hundred percent climate is not a tax return in the real world of human knowledge kenner said to be wrong by three hundred percent is taken as an indication you dont have a good grasp on what you are estimating if you got on an airplane and the pilot said it was a threehour flight but you arrived in one hour would you think that pilot was knowledgeable or not evans sighed climate is more complicated than that yes peter climate is more complicated it is so complicated that no one has been able to predict future climate with accuracy even though billons of dollars are being spent and hundreds of people are trying all around the world why do you resist that uncomfortable truth weather prediction is much better evans said and thats because of computers yes weather prediction has improved but nobody tries to predict weather more than ten days in advance whereas computer modelers are predicting what the temperature will be one hundred years in advance sometimes a thousand years three thousand years and they are doing better arguably they arent look kenner said the biggest events in global climate are the el niсos they happen roughly every four years but climate models cant predict themnot their timing their duration or their intensity and if you cant predict el niсos the predictive value of your model in other areas is suspect i heard they can predict el niсos that was claimed in but it is not true kenner shook his head climate science simply isnt there yet peter one day it will be but not now to los angeles friday october pm another hour passed sanjong was working continuously on the laptop kenner sat motionless staring out the window sanjong was accustomed to this he knew that kenner could stay silent and immobile for several hours he only turned away from the window when sanjong swore whats the matter kenner said i lost our satellite connection to the internet its been in and out for a while were you able to trace the images yes that was no problem i have the location fixed did evans really think these were images from antarctica yes he thought they showed black outcrops against snow i didnt disagree with him the actual location sanjong said is a place called resolution bay its in northeast gareda how far from los angeles roughly six thousand nautical miles so the propagation time is twelve or thirteen hours yes well worry about it later kenner said we have other problems first peter evans slept fitfully his bed consisted of a padded airplane seat laid flat with a seam in the middle right where his hip rested he tossed and turned waking briefly hearing snatches of conversation between kenner and sanjong at the back of the plane he couldnt hear the whole conversation over the drone of the engines but he heard enough because of what i need him to do hell refuse john amphe likes it or not ampevans is at the center of everything peter evans was suddenly awake he strained to hear now he raised his head off the pillow so he could hear better didnt disagree with him actual location ampresolution bay ampgareda how far amp ampthousand miles amp ampthe propagation time ampthirteen hours amp he thought propagation time what the hell were they talking about on impulse he jumped up strode back there and confronted them kenner didnt blink sleep well no evans said i did not sleep well i think you owe me some explanations about what the satellite pictures for one i couldnt very well tell you right there in the room in front of the others kenner said and i hated to interrupt your enthusiasm evans went and poured himself a cup of coffee okay what do the pictures really show sanjong flipped his laptop around to show evans the screen dont feel bad you would never have had any reason to suspect the images were negatives theyre often used that way to increase contrast negatives amp the black rocks are actually white theyre clouds evans sighed and what is the land mass its an island called gareda in the southern part of the solomon chain which is amp off the coast of new guinea north of australia so this is an island in the south pacific evans said this guy in antarctica had a picture of a pacific island correct and the scorpion reference is amp we dont know sanjong said the actual location is called resolution bay on the charts but it may be known locally as scorpion bay and what are they planning down there kenner said we dont know that either i heard you talking about propagation times propagation times for what actually you misheard me kenner said smoothly i was talking about interrogation times interrogation times evans said yes we were hoping wed be able to identify at least one of the three men in antarctica since we have good photographs of all three and we know the photographs are accurate because people on the base saw them but im afraid were out of luck sanjong explained that they had transmitted photos of brewster and the two graduate students to several databases in washington where patternrecognition computers checked them against individuals with known criminal records sometimes you got lucky and the computer found a match but this time no match had come back its been several hours so i think were out of luck as we expected kenner said yes sanjong said as we expected because these guys dont have criminal records evans said no they very well may then why didnt you get a match because this is a netwar kenner said and at the moment we are losing it to los angeles friday october pm in media accounts kenner explained the environmental liberation front was usually characterized as a loose association of ecoterrorists operating in small groups on their own initiative and employing relatively unsophisticated means to create havocstarting fires trashing suvs in car lots and so on the truth was quite different only one member of elf had ever been apprehendeda twentynineyearold graduate student at the university of california at santa cruz he was caught sabotaging an oil rig in el segundo california he denied any association with the group and insisted he was acting alone but what troubled authorities was the fact that he was wearing an appliance on his forehead that changed the shape of his skull and made his eyebrows jut out prominently he was also wearing false ears it wasnt much of a disguise but it was troubling because it suggested that he knew quite a lot about the patternmatching programs used by the government those programs were tuned to look past changes in facial hairwigs beards and mustachessince that was the most common method of disguise they were also designed to compensate for changes in age such as increased heaviness in the face drooping features receding hairlines but ears didnt change the shape of the forehead didnt change so the programs were therefore weighted to rely on the configuration of ears and the shape of the forehead changing these parts of the face would result in a nomatch outcome on a computer the guy from santa cruz knew that he knew security cameras would photograph him when he got near the rig so he changed his appearance in a way that would prevent identification by computer similarly the three extremists at weddell clearly had formidable backing to carry out their hightech terrorist act it took months of planning costs were high and they obviously had indepth support to obtain academic credentials university stencils on their shipping boxes shell companies for their antarctic shipments false websites and dozens of other details necessary for the undertaking there was nothing unsophisticated about their plan or the way they had executed it and they would have succeeded kenner said except for that list george morton obtained shortly before his death all of which suggested that if elf was once a loose association of amateurs it was no longer now it was a highly organized networkone that employed so many channels of communication among its members email cell phones radio text messaging that the network as a whole eluded detection the governments of the world had long worried about how to deal with such networks and the netwars that would result from trying to fight them for a long time the concept of a netwar was theoretical kenner said there were studies coming out of rand but nobody in the military was really focusing on it the notion of a networked enemy or terrorists or even criminals was too amorphous to bother with but it was the amorphous quality of the networkfluid rapidly evolvingthat made it so difficult to combat you couldnt infiltrate it you couldnt listen in on it except by accident you couldnt locate it geographically because it wasnt in any one place in truth the network represented a radically new kind of opponent and one that required radically new techniques to combat it the military just didnt get it kenner said but like it or not were in a netwar right now and how do you fight a netwar evans said the only way to oppose a network is with another network you expand your listening posts you decrypt around the clock you employ techniques of networked deception and entrapment such as what its technical kenner said vaguely we rely on the japanese to spearhead that effort they are the best at it in the world and of course we extend our feelers in multiple directions at the same time based on what weve just learned at weddell we have lots of irons in the fire kenner had databases being searched he had state organizations mobilized he had inquiries into where the terrorists had obtained their academic credentials their encrypted radio transmitters their explosive charges their computerized detonation timers none of this was commonplace stuff and it could be traced given enough time is there enough time evans said im not sure evans could see that kenner was worried so what is it you want me to do just one very simple thing kenner said whats that kenner smiled iii angel los angeles saturday october am is this really necessary peter evans said with a worried look it is kenner said but its illegal evans said its not kenner said firmly because you are a lawenforcement officer evans said of course dont worry about it they were flying in over los angeles approaching the runway at van nuys the california sun shone through the windows sanjong was hunched over the dining table in the middle of the plane in front of him lay evanss cell phone the back removed sanjong was attaching a thin gray plate the size of his thumbnail right on top of the battery but what exactly is it evans said flash memory sanjong said itll record four hours of conversation in a compressed format i see evans said and what am i supposed to do just carry the phone in your hand and go about your business and if i get caught he said you wont get caught kenner said you can take it anywhere youll go right through any security no problem but if they have bug sweepers amp they wont detect you because youre not transmitting anything its got a burst transmitter for two seconds every hour it transmits the rest of the time nothing kenner sighed look peter its just a cell phone everyone has them i dont know evans said i feel bad about this i mean im not a stool pigeon sarah came to the back yawning clearing her ears whos a stool pigeon its how i feel evans said thats not the issue kenner said sanjong sanjong took out a printed list passed it to evans it was mortons original sheet now with additions to it fxe terror mt terror antarctica fxe snake snake butte arizona fxe laugher laugher cay bahamas fxe scorpion resolution solomon is alt fxe terror mt terror antarctica fxe sever sever city arizona fxe conch conch cay bahamas fxe scorpion resolution solomon is alt fxe terror mt terror antarctica fxe buzzard buzzard gulch utah fxe old man old man is turks amp caicos fxe scorpion resolution solomon is alt fxe terror mt terror antarctica fxe black mesa black mesa new mexico fxe snarl snarl cay bwi fxe scorpion resolution solomon is as you see sanjong has identified the precise gps locations kenner said youve undoubtedly noticed a pattern in the list the first incident we know about the second incident will take place somewhere in the american deserteither utah arizona or new mexico the third incident will be somewhere in the caribbean east of cuba and the fourth incident will be in the solomon islands yes so our concern right now is for the second incident kenner said and the problem is that from utah to arizona to new mexico there are fifty thousand square miles of desert unless we can get additional information well never find these guys but you have exact gps locations amp which they will undoubtedly change now that they know of the trouble in antarctica you think they have already changed plans of course their network knew something was wrong as soon as we arrived at weddell yesterday i think thats why the first guy left i think hes actually the leader of the three the other two were just foot soldiers so you want me to go see drake evans said right and find out whatever you can i hate this evans said i understand kenner said but we need you to do it evans looked at sarah who was rubbing her eyes still sleepy he was annoyed to see that she had arisen from her bed perfectly composed her face uncreased beautiful as ever how are you he said to her i need to brush my teeth she said how long until we land ten minutes she got up and walked to the back of the plane evans looked out the window the sunlight was glaring harsh he hadnt had enough sleep the line of stitches in his scalp pinched his body ached from being wedged in the damned crevasse for so long just to rest his elbow on the armrest of the seat was painful he sighed peter kenner said those guys tried to kill you i wouldnt be too careful about the niceties when you fight back maybe so but im a lawyer and you could be a dead lawyer kenner said i dont advise it it was with a sense of unreality that peter evans merged his hybrid car onto the san diego freeway twelve lanes of roaring traffic on an expanse of concrete as wide as half a football field sixtyfive percent of the surface area of los angeles was devoted to cars people had to wedge themselves in what little was left it was an inhuman design and it was environmentally absurd everything was so far apart you couldnt walk anywhere the pollution was incredible and people like kenner did nothing but criticize the good work of environmental organizations without whose efforts the environment of a place like los angeles would be much much worse face it he thought the world needed help it desperately needed an environmental perspective and nothing in kenners smooth manipulation of facts would change that truth his thoughts rambled on in this way for another ten minutes until he crossed mulholland pass and came down toward beverly hills he looked at the passenger seat beside him the doctored cell phone glinted in the sunlight he decided to take it to drakes office right away get this whole thing over with he telephoned drakes office and asked to talk to him he was told drake was at the dentist and would return later in the day the secretary wasnt sure exactly when evans decided to go to his apartment and take a shower he parked in the garage and walked through the little garden to his apartment the sun was shining down between the buildings the roses were in bloom beautiful the only thing that marred it he thought was the lingering odor of cigar smoke in the air it was offensive to think that somebody had smoked a cigar and that what remained was sssst evans he paused he looked around he could see nothing evans heard an intense whisper like a hiss turn right pick a damn rose what dont talk you idiot and stop looking around come over here and pick a rose evans moved toward the voice the cigar smell was stronger behind the tangle of the bushes he saw an old stone bench that he had never noticed before it was crusted with algae hunched down on the bench was a man in a sportcoat smoking a cigar who are dont talk the man whispered how many times do i have to tell you take the rose and smell it thatll give you a reason to stay a minute now listen to me im a private investigator i was hired by george morton evans smelled the rose inhaling cigar smoke i have something important for you the guy said ill bring it to your apartment in two hours but i want you to leave again so theyll follow you leave your door unlocked evans turned the rose in his fingers pretending to examine it in fact he was looking past the rose at the man on the bench the mans face was familiar somehow evans was sure he had seen him before amp yeah yeah the man said as if reading his thoughts he turned his lapel to show a badge av network systems i was working in the nerf building now you remember right dont nod for christs sake just go upstairs change your clothes and leave for a while go to the gym or whatever just go these assholes he jerked his head toward the street have been waitin for you so dont disappoint them now go his apartment had been put back together very well lisa had done a good jobthe slashed cushions had been flipped over the books were back in the bookcase they were out of order but he would deal with that later from the large windows in his living room evans looked out toward the street he could see nothing except the green expanse of roxbury park the kids playing at midday the clusters of gossiping nannies there was no sign of surveillance it looked perfectly normal selfconsciously he started unbuttoning his shirt and turned away he went to the shower letting the hot spray sting his body he looked at his toes which were dark purple a worrisome unnatural color he wiggled them he didnt have much sensation but other than that they seemed to be all right he toweled off and checked his messages there was a call from janis asking if he was free tonight then another nervous one from her saying her boyfriend had just come back into town and she was busy which meant dont call her back there was a call from lisa herb lowensteins assistant asking where he was lowenstein wanted to go over some documents with him it was important a call from heather saying that lowenstein was looking for him a call from margo lane saying she was still in the hospital and why hadnt he called her back a call from his client the bmw dealer asking when he was coming to the showroom and about ten hangups far more than he usually had the hangups gave him a creepy feeling evans dressed quickly putting on a suit and tie he came back into the living room and feeling uneasy clicked on the television set just in time for the local noon news he was heading for the door when he heard two new developments emphasize once again the dangers of global warming the first study out of england says global warming is literally changing the rotation of the earth shortening the length of our day evans turned back to look he saw two coanchors a man and a woman the man was explaining that even more dramatic was a study that showed that the greenland ice cap was going to melt entirely away that would cause sea levels to rise twenty feet so i guess its goodbye malibu the anchor said cheerfully of course that wouldnt happen for a few years yet but its coming ampunless we all change our ways evans turned away from the television and headed for the door he wondered what kenner would have to say about this latest news changing the rotation speed of the earth he shook his head at the sheer enormity of it and melting all the ice in greenland evans could imagine kenners discomfiture but then hed probably just deny it all the way he usually did evans opened the door carefully ensured that it would remain unlocked closed it behind him and headed for his office century city saturday october am he ran into herb lowenstein in the hall walking toward a conference room jesus lowenstein said where the hell have you been peter nobody could find you ive been doing a confidential job for a client well next time tell your damn secretary how to reach you you look like shit what happened you get in a fight or something and whats that above your ear jesus are those stitches i fell uhhuh what client were you doing this confidential job for nick drake actually funny he didnt mention it no no and he just left i spent the whole morning with him hes very unhappy about the document rescinding the tenmilliondollar grant from the morton foundation especially that clause i know evans said he wants to know where the clause came from i know where did it come from george asked me not to divulge that george is dead not officially this is bullshit peter where did the clause come from evans shook his head im sorry herb i have specific instructions from the client were in the same firm and hes my client too he instructed me in writing herb in writing horseshit george didnt write anything handwritten note evans said nick wants the terms of the document broken im sure he does and i told him wed do that for him lowenstein said i dont see how morton was not in his right mind but he was herb evans said youll be taking ten million out of his estate and if anybody whispers in the ear of his daughter shes a total cokehead who goes through cash like a monkey through bananas and if anybody whispers in her ear this firm will be liable for the ten million and for punitive damages for conspiracy to defraud have you talked to the other senior partners about this course of action youre being obstructive im being cautious maybe i should express my concerns in an email to you this is not how you advance in this firm peter evans said i think i am acting in the firms best interest i certainly dont see how you can abrogate this document without at the very least first obtaining written opinions from attorneys outside the firm but no outside attorney would countenance he broke off he glared at evans drake is going to want to talk to you about this ill be happy to do that ill tell him youll call fine lowenstein stalked off then he turned back and what was all that business about the police and your apartment my apartment was robbed for what drugs no herb my assistant had to leave the office to help you with a police matter thats true as a personal favor and it was after hours if i recall lowenstein snorted and stomped off down the hall evans made a mental note to call drake and get this entire business behind him los angeles saturday october am in the hot midday sun kenner parked his car in the downtown lot and walked with sarah out onto the street heat shimmered off the pavement the signs there were all in spanish except for a few english phraseschecks cashed and money loaned from scratchy loudspeakers mariachi music blared out kenner said all set sarah checked the small sports bag on her shoulder it had nylon mesh at either end the mesh concealed the video lens yes she said im ready together they walked toward the large store on the corner braders armynavy surplus sarah said whatre we doing here elf purchased a large quantity of rockets kenner said she frowned rockets small ones lightweight about two feet long theyre outdated versions of an s warsaw pact device called hotfire handheld wireguided solid propellant range of about a thousand yards sarah wasnt sure what all that meant so these are weapons i doubt thats why they bought them how many did they buy five hundred with launchers wow lets just say theyre probably not hobbyists above the doors a banner in flaking yellow and green paint read camping gear paintball paratrooper jackets compass sleeping bags much much more the front door chimed as they went in the store was large and disorderly filled with military stuff on racks and piled in untidy heaps on the floor the air smelled musty like old canvas there were few people inside at this hour kenner walked directly to the kid at the cash register flashed his wallet and asked for mr brader in the back the kid smiled at sarah kenner went to the back of the store sarah stayed at the front so she said i need a little help do my best he grinned he was a crewcut kid maybe nineteen or twenty he had a black tshirt that said the crow his arms looked like he worked out im trying to find a guy sarah said and slid a sheet of paper toward him you think any guy would be trying to find you the kid said he picked up the paper it showed a photograph of the man they knew as brewster who had set up camp in antarctica oh yeah the kid said immediately sure i know him he comes in sometimes whats his name i dont know but hes in the store now now she glanced around for kenner but he was in the back huddled with the owner she didnt want to call to him or do anything to cause attention the kid was standing on tiptoes looking around yeah hes here i mean he was in here a few minutes ago came in to buy some timers where are your timers ill show you he came around the counter and led her through the stacks of green clothing and the boxes piled seven feet high she couldnt see over them she could no longer see kenner the kid glanced over his shoulder at her what are you like a detective sort of you want to go out they were moving deeper into the store when they heard the chime of the front door she turned to look over stacks of flak jackets she had a glimpse of a brown head a white shirt with a red collar and the door closing hes leaving amp she didnt think she just turned and sprinted for the door the bag banged against her hip she jumped over stacked canteens running hard hey the kid yelled behind her you coming back she banged through the door she was out on the street glaring hot sun and shoving crowds she looked left and right she didnt see the white shirt and red collar anywhere there hadnt been time for him to cross the street she looked around the corner and saw him strolling casually away from her toward fifth street she followed him he was a man of about thirtyfive dressed in cheap golftype clothes his pants were rumpled he wore dirty hiking boots he had tinted glasses and a small trim moustache he looked like a guy who spent a lot of time outdoors but not a construction guymore of a supervisor maybe a building contractor building inspector something like that she tried to notice the details to remember them she gained on him then decided that was a bad idea and dropped back brewster stopped in front of one window and looked at it intently for a few moments then went on she came to the window it was a crockery store displaying cheap plates she wondered then if he already knew he was being followed to trail a terrorist on a downtown street felt like something out of a movie but it was more frightening than she anticipated the surplus store seemed very far behind her she didnt know where kenner was she wished he were here also she was hardly inconspicuous the crowd on the sidewalk was largely hispanic and sarahs blond head stuck up above most peoples she stepped off the curb and walked along the street gutter hanging at the edge of the crowd that way she lost six inches of height but still she was uncomfortably aware that her hair was distinctively blonde but there was nothing she could do about that she let brewster get twenty yards ahead of her she didnt want to allow more distance than that because she was afraid shed lose him brewster crossed fifth street and continued on he went another half a block and then turned left down an alley sarah got to the alley entrance and paused there were garbage bags stacked at intervals she could smell the rotten odor from where she was a big delivery truck blocked the far end of the alley and no brewster he had vanished it wasnt possible unless he had walked through one of the back doors that opened onto the alley there were doors every twenty feet or so many of them recessed into the brick wall she bit her lip she didnt like the idea that she couldnt see him but there were delivery men down at the truck amp she started down the alley she looked at each door as she passed it some were boarded shut some were locked a few had grimy signs giving the name of the firm and saying use front entrance or press bell for service no brewster she had gotten halfway down the alley when something made her look back she was just in time to see brewster step out of a doorway and head back to the street moving quickly away from her she ran as she passed the doorway she saw an elderly woman standing in the door the sign on the door said munro silk and fabrics who is he she shouted the old woman shrugged shaking her head wrong door they all do she said something more but by then sarah couldnt hear she was back on the sidewalk still running heading toward fourth she could see brewster half a block ahead he was walking quickly almost a jog he crossed fourth a pickup truck pulled over to the side a few yards ahead it was battered blue with arizona license plates brewster jumped in the passenger side and the truck roared off sarah was scribbling down the license plate when kenners car screeched to a stop alongside her get in she did and he accelerated forward where were you she said getting the car i saw you leave did you film him she had forgotten all about the bag on her shoulder yes i think so good i got a name for this guy from the store owner yes but its probably an alias david poulson and a shipping address for the rockets no for the launch stands where kenner said flagstaff arizona ahead they saw the blue pickup they followed the pickup down second past the los angeles times building past the criminal courts and then onto the freeway kenner was skilled he managed to stay well back but always kept the truck in sight youve done this before sarah said not really what is that little card you show everybody kenner pulled out his wallet and handed it to her there was a silver badge looking roughly like a police badge except it said nsia on it and there was an official license for national security intelligence agency with his photograph ive never heard of the national security intelligence agency kenner nodded took the wallet back what does it do stays below the radar kenner said have you heard from evans you dont want to tell me nothing to tell kenner said domestic terrorism makes domestic agencies uncomfortable theyre either too harsh or too lenient everyone in nsia is specially trained now call sanjong and read him the license plate on that pickup see if he can trace it so you do domestic terrorism sometimes ahead the pickup truck moved onto the interstate freeway heading east past the clustered yellowing buildings of county general hospital where are they going she said i dont know he said but this is the road to arizona she picked up the phone and called sanjong sanjong wrote down the license and called back in less than five minutes its registered to the lazybar ranch outside sedona he told kenner its apparently a guest ranch and spa the truck hasnt been reported stolen okay who owns the ranch its a holding company great western environmental associates they own a string of guest ranches in arizona and new mexico who owns the holding company im checking on that but itll take some time sanjong hung up ahead the pickup truck moved into the right lane and turned on its blinker its pulling off the road kenner said they followed the truck through an area of seedy industrial parks sometimes the signs said sheet works or machine tooling but most of the buildings were blocky and unrevealing the air was hazy almost a light fog after two miles the truck turned right again just past a sign that said ltsi corp and beneath that a small picture of an airport with an arrow it must be a private airfield kenner said whats ltsi she said he shook his head i dont know farther down the road they could see the little airfield with several small prop planes cessnas and pipers parked to one side the truck drove up and parked alongside a twinengine plane twin otter kenner said is that significant short takeoff large payload its a workhorse aircraft used for firefighting all sorts of things brewster got out of the truck and walked to the cockpit of the plane he spoke briefly to the pilot then he got back in the truck and drove a hundred yards down the road pulling up in front of a huge rectangular shed of corrugated steel there were two other trucks parked alongside it the sign on the shed said ltsi in big blue letters brewster got out of the truck and came around the back as the driver of the truck got out son of a bitch sarah said the driver was the man they knew as bolden he was now wearing jeans a baseball cap and sunglasses but there was no doubt about his identity easy kenner said they watched as brewster and bolden walked into the shed through a narrow door the door closed behind them with a metallic clang kenner turned to sarah you stay here he got out of the car walked quickly to the shed and went inside she sat in the passenger seat shading her eyes against the sun and waited the minutes dragged she squinted at the sign on the side of the shed because she could detect small white lettering beneath the large ltsi initials but she was too far away to make out what it said she thought of calling sanjong but didnt she worried about what would happen if brewster and bolden came out but kenner remained inside she would have to follow them alone she couldnt let them get away amp that thought led her to slide over into the drivers seat she rested her hands on the wheel she looked at her watch surely nine or ten minutes had already passed she scanned the shed for any sign of activity but the building was clearly made to be as unobtrusive and as unrevealing as possible she looked at her watch again she began to feel like a coward just sitting there all her life she had confronted the things that frightened her that was why she had learned to ski black diamond ice to rock climb even though she was too tall to scuba dive wrecks now she was just sitting in a hot car waiting as the minutes ticked by the hell with it she thought and she got out of the car at the door to the shed there were two small signs one said ltsi lightning test systems international the second said warning do not enter test bed during discharge intervals whatever that meant sarah opened the door cautiously there was a reception area but it was deserted on a plain wooden desk was a handwritten sign and a buzzer press buzzer for assistance she ignored the buzzer and opened the inner door which was ominously marked no trespassing high voltage discharge authorized personnel only she went through the door and came into an open dimly lit industrial spacepipes on the ceiling a catwalk rubbertile floor underfoot it was all quite dark except for a twostory glasswalled chamber in the center which was brightly lit it was a fairly large space roughly the size of her living room inside the chamber she saw what looked like an airplane jet engine mounted on a small section of wing at the side of the room was a large metal plate set against the wall and outside the room was a control panel a man was sitting in front of the panel brewster and bolden were nowhere to be seen inside the room a recessed monitor screen flashed clear area now a computer voice said please clear the test area testing begins in ampthirty seconds sarah heard a slowly building whine and the chugging of a pump but nothing was happening that she could see curious she moved forward ssst she looked around but could not see where the sound was coming from ssst she looked up kenner was above her on the catwalk he gestured for her to join him pointing to a set of stairs at the corner of the room the computer voice said testing begins in amptwenty seconds she climbed the stairs and crouched beside kenner the whine had now built to a shriek and the chugging was rapid almost a continuous sound kenner pointed to the jet engine and whispered theyre testing airplane parts he explained quickly that airplanes were frequently struck by lightning and all their components had to be lightning proof he said something else too but she couldnt really hear him over the increasing noise inside the center room the lights went off leaving just a faint blue glow over the jet engine and its smoothly curved cowling the computer voice was counting backward from ten testing begins ampnow there was a snap so loud it sounded like a gunshot and a bolt of lightning snaked out from the wall and struck the engine it was immediately followed by more bolts from the other walls striking the engine from all sides the lightning crackled over the cowling in jagged whitehot fingers then abruptly shot down to the floor where sarah saw a domeshaped piece of metal about a foot in diameter she noticed a few of the lightning bolts seemed to shoot directly to this dome missing the engine entirely as the test continued the lightning bolts grew thicker brighter they made a long crack as they shot through the air and etched black streaks over the metal cowl the fan blades were struck by one bolt causing the fan to spin silently as sarah watched it seemed as if more and more of the bolts did not strike the engine but instead struck the small dome on the floor until finally there was a white spiderweb of lightning strikes coming from all sides going directly to the dome and then abruptly the test ended the whining sound stopped and the room lights came on faint hazy smoke rose from the engine cowling sarah looked over at the console and saw brewster and bolden standing behind the seated technician all three men walked into the central room where they crouched beneath the engine and inspected the metal dome what is it sarah whispered kenner put a finger to his lips and shook his head he looked unhappy inside the room the men upended the dome and sarah had a glimpse of its complexitygreen circuit boards and shiny metal attachments but the men were clustered around it talking excitedly and it was hard for her to see then they put the dome back down on the floor again and walked out of the room they were laughing and slapping each other on the back apparently very pleased with the test she heard one of them say something about buying a round of beer and there was more laughter and they walked out through the front door the test area was silent they heard the outer door slam shut she and kenner waited she looked at kenner he waited motionless for a full minute just listening then when they still heard nothing he said lets have a look at that thing they climbed down from the catwalk on the ground level they saw and heard nothing the facility was apparently deserted kenner pointed to the inner chamber they opened the door and went inside the interior of the chamber was bright there was a sharp smell in the air ozone kenner said from the strikes he walked directly to the dome on the floor what do you think it is sarah said i dont know but it must be a portable charge generator he crouched turned the dome over you see if you can generate a strong enough negative charge he broke off the dome was empty its electronic innards had been removed with a clang the door behind them slammed shut sarah whirled bolden was on the other side of the door calmly locking it with a padlock oh shit she said over at the console she saw brewster turning knobs flipping switches he flicked an intercom theres no trespassing in this facility folks its clearly marked guess you didnt read the signs amp brewster stepped away from the console the room lights went dark blue sarah heard the start of the whine beginning to build the screen flashed clear area now and she heard a computer voice say please clear the test area testing begins in ampthirty seconds brewster and bolden walked out without looking back sarah heard bolden say i hate the smell of burning flesh and they were gone slamming the door the computer voice said testing begins in ampfifteen seconds sarah turned to kenner what do we do outside the facility bolden and brewster got into their car bolden started the engine brewster put a hand on the other mans shoulder lets just wait a minute they watched the door a red light began to flash slowly at first then faster and faster test has started brewster said damn shame bolden said how long you figure they can survive one bolt maybe two but by the third one theyre definitely dead and probably on fire damn shame bolden said again he put the car in gear and drove toward the waiting airplane iv flash city of commerce saturday october pm inside the test chamber the air took on a sizzly electric quality like the atmosphere before a storm sarah saw the hairs on her arm standing up her clothing was sticking to her body flattened by the electric charge got a belt kenner said no amp hairclip no anything metal no damn it no kenner flung himself against the glass wall but just bounced off he kicked it with his heel nothing happened he slammed his weight against the door but the lock was strong ten seconds to test the computer voice said what are we going to do sarah said panicked take your clothes off what now do it he was stripping off his shirt ripping it off buttons flying come on sarah especially the sweater she had a fluffy angora sweater and bizarrely she recalled it had been a present from her boyfriend one of the first things he ever bought her she tore it off and the tshirt beneath skirt kenner said he was down to his shorts pulling off his shoes what is this its got a zipper she fumbled getting the skirt off she was down to her sports bra and panties she shivered the computer voice was counting backward ten ampnine ampeight amp kenner was draping the clothes over the engine he took her skirt draped it over too he arranged the angora sweater to lie on the top what are you doing lie down he said lie flat on the floormake yourself as flat as you canand dont move she pressed her body against the cold concrete her heart was pounding the air was bristling she felt a shiver down the back of her neck three amptwo ampone amp kenner threw himself on the ground next to her and the first lightning bolt crashed through the room she was shocked by the violence of it the blast of air rushing over her body her hair was rising into the air she could feel the weight of it lift off her neck there were more boltsthe crashing sound was terrifyingblasting blue light so bright she saw it even though she squeezed her eyes shut she pressed herself against the ground willing herself to be even flatter exhaling thinking now is a time for prayer but suddenly there was another kind of light in the room yellower flickering and a sharp acrid smell fire a piece of her flaming sweater fell on her bare shoulder she felt searing pain its a fire dont move kenner snarled the bolts were still blasting coming faster and faster crackling over the room but she could see out of the corner of her eye that the clothes heaped on the engine were aflame the room was filling with smoke she thought my hair is burning and she could feel it suddenly hot at the base of her neck along her scalp amp and suddenly the room was filled with blasting water and the lightning had stopped and the sprinkler nozzles hissed overhead she felt cold the fires went out the concrete was wet can i get up now yes kenner said you can get up now he spent several more minutes trying to break the glass without success finally he stopped and stared his hair matted by the sizzling water i dont get it he said you cant have a room like this without a safety mechanism to enable someone to get out they locked the door you saw it yourself right locking it from the outside with a padlock that padlock must be there to make sure nobody can enter the room from the outside while the facility is closed but there still has to be some way to get out from the inside if there is i dont see it she was shivering her shoulder hurt where she was burned her underwear was soaked through she wasnt modest but she was cold and he was nattering on amp there just has to be a way he said turning slowly looking you cant break the glass amp no he said you cant but that seemed to suggest something to him he bent and carefully examined the glass frame looking at the seam where the glass met the wall running his finger along it she shivered while she watched him the sprinklers were still on still spraying she was standing in three inches of water she could not understand how he could be so focused so intent on ill be damned he said his fingers had closed on a small latch flush with the mounting he found another on the opposite side of the window flicked it open and then he pushed the window which was hinged in the center and rotated it open he stepped through into the outer room nothing to it he said he extended his hand can i offer you some dry clothes thank you she said and took his hand the ltsi washrooms werent anything to write home about but sarah and kenner dried off with paper towels and found some warm coveralls and sarah began to feel better staring in the mirror she saw that shed lost two inches of hair around her left side the ends were ragged black twisted could have been worse she said thinking ponytails for a while kenner tended to her shoulder which he said was just a firstdegree burn with a few blisters he put ice on it telling her that burns were not a thermal injury but were actually a nerve response within the body and that ice in the first ten minutes reduced the severity of the burn by numbing the nerve and preventing the response so if you were going to blister ice prevented it from happening she tuned out his voice she couldnt actually see the burned area so she had to take his word for it it was starting to hurt he found a firstaid kit brought back aspirin aspirin sarah said better than nothing he dropped two tablets in her hand actually most people dont know it but aspirins a true wonder drug it has more painkilling power than morphine and it is antiinflammatory antifever not right now she said please she just couldnt take another of his lectures he said nothing he just put on the bandage he seemed to be good at that too is there anything youre not good at she said oh sure like what dancing no i can dance but im terrible at languages thats a relief she herself was good at languages shed spent her junior year in italy and was reasonably fluent in italian and french and shed studied chinese and what about you he said what are you bad at relationships she said staring in the mirror and pulling at the blackened strands of her hair beverly hills saturday october pm as evans climbed the steps to his apartment he could hear the television blaring it seemed louder than before he heard cheers and laughter some sort of show with a live studio audience he opened the door and went into the living room the private investigator from the courtyard was sitting on the couch his back to evans while he watched television his jacket was off and flung over a nearby chair he had his arm draped across the back of the sofa his fingers drummed impatiently i see youve made yourself at home evans said pretty loud dont you think would you mind turning it down the man didnt answer he just continued to stare at the tv did you hear me evans said turn it down would you the man did not move just his fingers moving restlessly on the back of the couch evans walked around to face the man im sorry i dont know your name but he broke off the investigator hadnt turned to look at him but continued to stare fixedly at the tv in fact no part of his body moved he was immobile rigid his eyes didnt move they didnt even blink the only part of his body that moved was his fingers on the top of the couch they almost seemed to be twitching in spasm evans stepped directly in front of the man are you all right the mans face was expressionless his eyes stared forward seeming to look straight through evans sir the investigator was breathing shallowly his chest hardly moving his skin was tinged with gray can you move at all what happened to you nothing the man was rigid just like the way they described margo evans thought the same rigidity the same blankness evans picked up the phone and dialed called for an ambulance to his address okay help is coming he said to the man the private detective gave no visible response but even so evans had the impression that the man could hear that he was fully aware inside his frozen body but there was no way to be sure evans looked around the room hoping to find clues as to what had happened to this man but the apartment seemed undisturbed one chair in the corner seemed to have been moved the guys smelly cigar was on the floor in the corner as if it had rolled there it had burned the edge of the rug slightly evans picked up the cigar he brought it back to the kitchen ran it under the faucet and tossed it in the wastebasket then he had an idea he went back to the man you were going to bring me something amp there was no movement just the fingers on the couch is it here the fingers stopped or almost stopped they still moved slightly but there was clearly an effort being made can you control your fingers evans said they started then stopped again so you can okay now is the thing you wanted me to see here fingers moved then stopped i take that as a yes okay evans stepped back in the distance he heard an approaching siren the ambulance would be here in a few minutes he said i am going to move in one direction and if it is the right direction move your fingers the fingers started then stopped as if to signal yes okay evans said he turned and took several steps to his right heading toward the kitchen he looked back the fingers did not move so its not that way he now moved toward the television directly in front of the man the fingers did not move all right then evans turned left walking toward the picture windows still the fingers did not move there was only one direction remaining he moved behind the investigator heading toward the door since the man could not see him evans said now i am walking away from you toward the front door amp the fingers did not move maybe you didnt understand evans said i wanted you to move your fingers if i was heading in the right direction amp fingers moved scratching the couch yeah okay but which direction i went in all four directions and the doorbell rang evans opened it and two paramedics rushed in bringing a stretcher and now there was pandemonium they were asking him rapidfire questions and loading the guy onto the stretcher the police arrived a few moments later with still more questions they were the beverly hills police so they were polite but they were insistent this man was paralyzed in evanss apartment and evans did not seem to know anything about it finally a detective came through the door he wore a brown suit and introduced himself as ron perry he gave evans his card evans gave him his own card perry looked at it then looked at evans and said havent i seen this card before it looks familiar oh yeah i remember it was at that apartment on wilshire where the lady was paralyzed she was my client and now its happened again the same paralysis perry said is that a coincidence or what i dont know evans said because i wasnt here i dont know what happened somehow people just become paralyzed wherever you go no evans said i told you i dont know what happened is this guy a client too no then who is he i have no idea who he is no howd he get in here evans was about to say he had left the door open for him but he realized that was going to be a long explanation and a difficult one i dont know i uh ampsometimes i dont lock my door you should always lock your door mr evans thats just common sense of course youre right doesnt your door lock automatically when you leave i told you i dont know how he got in my apartment evans said looking directly into the detectives eyes the detective returned the stare howd you get those stitches in your head i fell looks like quite a fall it was the detective nodded slowly you could save us a lot of trouble if youd just tell me who this guy is mr evans youve got a man in your apartment you dont know who he is you dont know how he got here forgive me if i feel youre maybe leaving something out i am okay perry took out his notebook go ahead the guys a private detective i know that you do evans said the paramedics checked his pockets found a license in his wallet go on he told me he had been hired by a client of mine uhhuh which client is that perry was writing i cant tell you that evans said he looked up from his pad mr evans im sorry thats privileged the detective gave a long sigh okay so this guy is a private investigator hired by a client of yours right evans said the investigator contacted me and said he wanted to see me to give me something to give you something right he didnt want to give it to the client he couldnt because the client is uh unavailable i see so he came to you instead yes and he was a bit paranoid and wanted to meet me in my apartment so you left the door to your apartment open for him yes some guy youd never seen before yes well i knew he was working for my client how did you know that evans shook his head privileged okay so this guy comes into your apartment where are you i was at my office evans quickly recounted his movements during the intervening two hours people saw you at the office yes conversations yes more than one person yes you see anybody else besides people in the law firm i stopped to get gas attendant will recognize you yes i had to go in to use my credit card which station shell on pico okay so you were gone two hours you come back here and the guy is amp as you saw him paralyzed and what was he going to give you i have no idea you didnt find anything in the apartment no anything else you want to tell me no another long sigh look mr evans if two people i knew were mysteriously paralyzed id be a little worried but you dont seem worried believe me im worried evans said the detective frowned at him okay he said finally you have a client privilege youre invoking i have to tell you that ive gotten calls from ucla and from the cdc on this paralysis thing now that theres a second case there are going to be more calls he flipped his notebook shut im going to need you to come by the station and give us a signed statement can you do that later today i think so four oclock yes fine the address is on the card just ask for me at the desk parking is under the building okay evans said see you then the detective said and turned to leave evans shut the door behind him and leaned against it he was glad to finally be alone he walked around the apartment slowly trying to focus his thoughts the television was still on but the sound was turned off he looked at the couch where the private investigator had been sitting the indentation of his body was still visible he still had half an hour before he was supposed to meet with drake but he wanted to know what the pi had brought to him where was it evans had moved in every direction of the compass and each time the man had indicated with his fingertips that it was the wrong direction which meant what he hadnt brought the thing it was somewhere else or that whoever paralyzed him had taken it so it was no longer there evans sighed the critical questionis it herewas one he hadnt asked the detective evans just assumed it was there and suppose it was where would it be north south east west all wrong which meant amp what he shook his head he was having trouble concentrating the truth was the private investigators paralysis had unnerved him more than he wanted to admit he looked at the couch and the indentation the guy couldnt move it must have been terrifying and the paramedics had lifted him up bodily like a sack of potatoes and put him on the stretcher the cushions on the couch were in disarray a reminder of their efforts idly evans straightened up the couch putting the cushions in place fluffing them amp he felt something inside a slit in one cushion he stuck his hand deeper into the padding damn he said of course it was obvious in retrospect moving away in every direction was wrong because the investigator wanted evans to move toward him the guy was sitting on the thing which he had slipped inside the couch cushion it turned out to be a shiny dvd evans dropped it in the dvd player and watched as a menu came up a list of dates they were all in the last few weeks evans clicked on the first date he saw a view of the nerf conference room it was a side angle from the corner of the room waist high it must have been from a camera hidden in the speakers podium or something evans thought undoubtedly the investigator had installed the camera the day evans had seen him in the nerf conference room at the bottom of the screen was a running time code numbers flickering but evans stared at the image itself which showed nicholas drake talking to john henley the pr guy drake was upset throwing up his hands i hate global warming drake said almost shouting i fucking hate it its a goddamn disaster its been established henley said calmly over many years its what we have to work with to work with but it doesnt work drake said thats my point you cant raise a dime with it especially in winter every time it snows people forget all about global warming or else they decide some warming might be a good thing after all theyre trudging through the snow hoping for a little global warming its not like pollution john pollution worked it still works pollution scares the shit out of people you tell em theyll get cancer and the money rolls in but nobody is scared of a little warming especially if it wont happen for a hundred years you have ways to play it henley said not anymore drake said weve tried them all species extinction from global warmingnobody gives a shit theyve heard that most of the species that will become extinct are insects you cant raise money on insect extinctions john exotic diseases from global warmingnobody cares hasnt happened we ran that huge campaign last year connecting global warming to the ebola and hanta viruses nobody went for it sealevel rise from global warmingwe all know where thatll end up the vanutu lawsuit is a fucking disaster everybodyll assume the sea level isnt rising anywhere and that scandinavian guy that sea level expert hes becoming a pest hes even attacking the ipcc for incompetence yes henley said patiently thats all true amp so you tell me drake said how the hell im supposed to play global warming because you know what i have to raise to keep this organization going john i need fortytwo million dollars a year the foundations will only give me a quarter of that this year the celebrities show up at the fundraisers but they dont give us shit theyre so egotistical they think showing up should be payment enough of course we sue the epa every year and they may cough up three four million with epa grants maybe five total that still leaves a big gap john global warming isnt going to cut it i need a fucking cause a cause that works i understand henley said still very calm but you are forgetting the conference oh christ the conference drake said these assholes cant even get the posters right bendix is our best speaker hes got a family problem wife is having chemo gordon was scheduled but hes got some lawsuit about his research ampseems his notebooks were faked amp those are details nicholas henley said im asking you to stay with the big picture at that moment the phone rang drake answered it listened briefly then he put his hand over the phone and turned to henley we have to continue this later john ive got an emergency here henley got up and left the room the clip ended the screen went black evans stared at the blank screen he felt as if he were going to be ill a wave of dizziness passed over him his stomach churned he held the remote in his hand but he did not press the buttons the moment passed he took a breath on reflection he realized that what he had seen wasnt really surprising perhaps drake was more explicit in privateeveryone wasand obviously he felt under pressure to raise money but the frustration he expressed was perfectly understandable from the beginning the movement had had to fight apathy in the broader society human beings didnt think in the long term they didnt see the slow degradation of the environment it had always been an uphill battle to rouse the public to do what was really in its own best interest that fight was far from over in fact it was just beginning and it was probably true that it wasnt easy to raise money for global warming so nicholas drake had his work cut out for him and environmental organizations were really working with very small funds fortyfour million for nerf the same for the nrdc maybe fifty for the sierra club the big one was the nature conservancy they had three quarters of a billion but what was that compared with the zillions of dollars that could be mobilized by corporations it was david and goliath and drake was david as he had said himself on every occasion evans glanced at his watch in any case it was time to go see drake he took the dvd out of the player slipped it into his pocket and left the apartment on his way he reviewed what he was going to say he went over it again and again trying to make it perfect he had to do it carefully because everything kenner had told him to say was a lie beverly hills saturday october am peter peter nicholas drake said shaking his hand warmly i am very pleased to see you youve been away yes but you havent forgotten my request no nick have a seat evans sat down and drake sat behind the desk go ahead i traced the origin of that clause yes yes you were right george did get the idea from a lawyer i knew it who an outside attorney not in our firm evans spoke carefully saying just what kenner had instructed him to say who unfortunately nick theres documentation redlined drafts with georges handwritten comments ah shit from when six months ago six months apparently george has been concerned for some time about ampthings the groups he supports he never told me nor me evans said he chose an outside attorney i want to see this correspondence drake said evans shook his head the attorney will never permit it george is dead privilege continues after death swidler and berlin v united states this is bullshit peter and you know it evans shrugged but this attorney plays by the book and i have arguably overstepped proper bounds by saying as much as i have drake drummed his fingers on the desk top peter the vanutu lawsuit is desperately in need of that money i keep hearing evans said that that lawsuit may be dropped nonsense because the data sets dont show any rise in pacific sea level id be careful about saying things like that drake said where did you hear that because that has to be disinformation from industry peter there is no question sea levels are rising around the world its been scientifically demonstrated time and again why just the other day i was looking at the satellite measurements of sea level which are a relatively new way to make those measurements the satellites show a rise of several millimeters just in the last year was that published data evans said i dont remember offhand drake said giving him an odd look it was in one of the briefing summaries i get evans hadnt planned to ask questions like these they had just somehow come out of his mouth unbidden and he was uncomfortably aware that his tone was skeptical no wonder drake was giving him an odd look i dont mean anything evans said quickly its just that i heard these rumors amp and you wanted to get to the bottom of it drake said nodding as is only natural im glad you brought this to my attention peter ill get on the horn with henley and find out whats being disseminated of course its an endless battle you know we have those neanderthals at the competitive enterprise institute and the hoover foundation and the marshall institute to deal with groups financed by rightwing radicals and braindead fundamentalists but unfortunately they have a tremendous amount of money at their disposal yes i understand evans said he turned to go do you need me for anything else ill be frank drake said im not happy are we back to fifty thousand a week under the circumstances i think we have no option then we will have to manage drake said the lawsuits going fine by the way but i have to focus my energies on the conference oh right when does that start wednesday drake said four days from now now if youll excuse me amp of course evans said he walked out of the office leaving his cell phone on the side table across from the desk evans had gone all the way down the stairs to the ground floor before he realized drake hadnt asked him about his stitches everyone else he had seen that day had made some comment about them but not drake of course drake had a lot on his mind with the preparations for the conference directly ahead evans saw the groundfloor conference room bustling with activity the banner on the wall read abrupt climate changethe catastrophe ahead twenty young people clustered around a large table on which stood a scale model of the interior of an auditorium and the surrounding parking lot evans paused to watch for a moment one of the young people was putting wooden blocks in the parking lot to simulate cars he wont like that another one said he wants the slots nearest the building reserved for news vans not buses i left three spaces over here for news the first kid said isnt that enough he wants ten ten spaces how many news crews does he think are going to show up for this thing i dont know but he wants ten spaces and hes told us to arrange extra power and phone lines for an academic conference on abrupt climate change i dont get it how much can you say about hurricanes and droughts hell be lucky to have three crews hey hes the boss mark off the ten slots and be done with it that means the buses have to go way in the back ten slots jake okay okay next to the building because the line feeds are very expensive the auditoriums charging us an arm and a leg for the extra utilities at the other end of the table a girl was saying how dark will it be in the exhibition spaces will it be dark enough to project video no theyre limited to flat panels some of the exhibitors have allinone projectors oh that should be all right a young woman came up to evans as he was standing looking into the room can i help you sir she looked like a receptionist she had that bland prettiness yes he said nodding toward the conference room i was wondering how i arrange to attend this conference its by invitation only im afraid she said its an academic conference not really open to the public ive just left nick drakes office evans said and i forgot to ask him oh well actually i have some comp tickets at the reception desk do you know which day youll be attending all of them evans said thats quite a commitment she said smiling if youll come this way sir amp it was only a short drive from nerf to the conference headquarters in downtown santa monica workmen on a cherry picker were placing letters on the large sign so far it said abrupt climate cha and beneath the catastr his car was hot in the midday sun evans called sarah on the car phone its done i left my phone in his office okay i was hoping youd call earlier i dont think that matters anymore no why i think kenner already found out what he needed he did here talk to him evans thought shes with him kenner speaking its peter he said where are you in santa monica go back to your apartment and pack some hiking clothes then wait there for what change all the clothes you are wearing now take nothing with you that you are wearing right now why later click the phone was dead back in his apartment he hastily packed a bag then he went back to the living room while he waited he put the dvd back into the player and waited for the menu of dates he chose the second date on the list on the screen he once again saw drake and henley it must have been the same day because they were dressed in the same clothes but now it was later drake had his jacket off hung over a chair ive listened to you before drake was saying he sounded resentful and your advice didnt work think structurally henley said leaning back in his chair staring up at the ceiling fingertips tented what the hell does that mean drake said think structurally nicholas in terms of how information functions what it holds up what holds it up this is just pr bullshit nicholas henley said sharply i am trying to help you sorry drake looked chastened he hung his head a little watching the video evans thought is henley in charge here for a moment it certainly appeared that way now then henley said let me explain how you are going to solve your problem the solution is simple you have already told me there was a loud pounding on evanss door evans stopped the dvd and just to be safe removed it from the player and slipped it into his pocket the pounding continued impatient as he went to the door it was sanjong thapa he looked grim we have to leave he said right now v snake diablo sunday october pm the helicopter thumped over the arizona desert twenty miles east of flagstaff not far from canyon diablo in the back seat sanjong handed evans pictures and computer printouts speaking of the environmental liberation front he said we assume their networks are up but so are ours all our networks are running he said and we picked up an unexpected clue from one of them of all things the southwestern parks management association which is its an organization of state park managers from all the western states and they discovered that something very odd had happened a large percentage of the state parks in utah arizona and new mexico were booked in advance and paid for to reserve them for company picnics school celebrations institutional birthday parties and so on for this weekend in each case they were family affairs involving parents and kids sometimes grandparents too true this was a long threeday weekend but nearly all the advance bookings were for monday only a handful had been for saturday or sunday none of the park superintendents could remember such a thing happening before i dont get it evans said they didnt either sanjong said they thought it might be some cult thing and because the parks cant be used for religious purposes they got on the phone and called some of the organizations and they found in every case that the organization had received a special donation to fund the function on this particular weekend donation from whom charitable organizations in every case the situation was the same theyd receive a letter saying thank you for your recent request for funding we are pleased to say we can support your gettogether at suchandsuch park on monday october eleventh the check has already been sent in your name enjoy your gathering but the groups never requested the booking no so theyd call the charity and someone would tell them it must have been a mixup but since the checks were already sent out they might as well go ahead and use the park that day and a lot of the groups decided they would and these charitable organizations were none you ever heard of the amy rossiter fund the fund for a new america the roger v and eleanor t malkin foundation the joiner memorial foundation all together about a dozen charities real charities sanjong shrugged we assume not but were checking that now evans said i still dont get it somebody wants those parks used this weekend yes but why sanjong handed him a photograph it was an aerial shot in false colors and it showed a forest the trees bright red against a dark blue ground sanjong tapped the center of the picture there in a clearing in the forest evans saw what looked like a spiderweb on the grounda series of concentric lines connecting fixed points like a spiderweb and that is its a rocket array the launchers are the fixed points the lines are the power cables to control the launch his finger moved across the picture and you see theres another array here and a third one here the three arrays form a triangle approximately five miles on each side evans could see it three separate spiderwebs set in clearings in the forest three rocket arrays amp yes we know they have purchased five hundred solidstate rockets the rockets themselves are quite small close analysis of the picture elements indicates that the launchers are four to six inches in diameter which means the rockets are capable of going up about a thousand feet or so not more than that each array has about fifty rockets wired together probably not set to fire at the same time and you notice the launchers are placed quite far apart amp but for what purpose evans said these things are out in the middle of nowhere they shoot up a thousand feet and then fall back down is that it whats the point of that we dont know sanjong said but we have another clue the picture youre holding in your hands was taken yesterday but here is a picture from a flyby this morning he handed evans a second picture showing the same terrain the spiderwebs were gone what happened evans said they packed up and left you see in the first picture there are vans parked at the edge of the clearings apparently they just put everything in the vans and moved because they were spotted its unlikely they know they were spotted then what we think they had to move to a more favorable setting more favorable for what evans said whats going on it may be significant sanjong said that at the time they purchased the rockets they also purchased a hundred and fifty kilometers of microfilament wire he was nodding to evans as if that was supposed to explain everything a hundred and fifty kilometers amp sanjong flicked his eyes toward the helicopter pilot and shook his head we can go into it in greater detail later on peter and then he looked out the window evans stared out the opposite window he saw mile after mile of eroded desert landscape cliffs brown with streaks of orange and red the helicopter rumbled northward he could see the helicopters shadow racing over the sand distorted twisted then recognizable again rockets he thought sanjong had given him this information as if he were supposed to figure it out on his own five hundred rockets groups of fifty launchers set widely apart one hundred and fifty kilometers of microfilament wire perhaps that was supposed to mean something but peter evans didnt have the faintest idea what it could possibly be groups of small rockets for what microfilament for what in his head it was easy enough to calculate that if this microfilament was attached to the rockets each rocket would have about a third of a kilometer of wire and a third of a kilometer was amproughly a thousand feet which was how high sanjong said the rockets could go anyway so these rockets were flying a thousand feet into the air dragging a microfilament wire behind them what was the point of that or was the wire intended to be used to retrieve them later on but no he thought that couldnt be the rockets would fall back into the forest and any microfilament would snap and why were the rockets spaced widely apart if they were only a few inches in diameter couldnt they be packed closer together he seemed to recall that the military had rocket launchers where the rockets were so close together the fins almost touched so why should these rockets be far apart a rocket flies up ampdragging a thin wire ampand it gets to a thousand feet ampand amp and what perhaps he thought there was some instrumentation in the nose of each rocket the wire was a way to transmit information back to the ground but what instrumentation what was the point of all this he glanced back at sanjong who was now hunched over another photograph whatre you doing trying to figure out where theyve gone evans frowned as he saw the picture in sanjongs hand it was a satellite weather map sanjong was holding a weather map did all this have to do with weather flagstaff sunday october pm yes kenner said leaning forward in the booth of the restaurant they were in the back of a steakhouse in flagstaff the jukebox at the bar was playing old elvis presley dont be cruel kenner and sarah had showed up just a few minutes before sarah evans thought looked drawn and worried not her usual cheerful self we think this is all about the weather kenner was saying in fact were sure it is he paused while a waitress brought salads then continued there are two reasons to think so first elf has bought a considerable amount of expensive technology that seems to have no use in common except perhaps attempts to influence the weather and second the hold on hold on evans said you said attempts to influence the weather exactly influence how control it sanjong said evans leaned back in the booth this is crazy he said i mean youre telling me these guys think they can control the weather they can sarah said but how evans said how could they do it most of the research is classified then how do they get it good question kenner said and wed like to know that answer but the point is we assume that these rocket arrays are designed to produce major storms or to amplify the power of existing storms by doing what they cause a change in the electric potentials of the infracumulus strata im glad i asked evans said thats very clear we dont really know the details kenner said although im sure well find out soon enough the strongest evidence sanjong said comes from the pattern of park rentals these guys have arranged for lots of picnics over a large areathree states in point of fact which means they are probably going to decide at the last minute where to act based on existing weather conditions decide what evans said what are they going to do nobody spoke evans looked from one to another well we know one thing kenner said they want it documented because if theres one thing you can count on at a school picnic or a company outing with families and kids its lots of cameras lots of video lots of stills and then of course the news crews will come sanjong said they will why blood draws cameras kenner said you mean theyre going to hurt people i think its clear kenner said that theyre going to try an hour later they all sat on lumpy motel beds while sanjong hooked a portable dvd player to the television set in the room they were in a crappy motel room in shoshone arizona twenty miles north of flagstaff on the screen evans once again saw henley talking to drake ive listened to you before drake said resentfully and it didnt work think structurally henley answered he was leaning back in his chair staring up at the ceiling fingertips tented what the hell does that mean drake said think structurally nicholas in terms of how information functions what it holds up what holds it up this is just pr bullshit nicholas henley said sharply i am trying to help you sorry drake looked chastened he hung his head a little watching the screen evans said does it look like henley is in charge here hes always been in charge kenner said didnt you know that on the screen henley was saying let me explain how you are going to solve your problem nicholas the solution is simple you have already told me that global warming is unsatisfactory because whenever there is a cold snap people forget about it yes i told you so what you need henley said is to structure the information so that whatever kind of weather occurs it always confirms your message thats the virtue of shifting the focus to abrupt climate change it enables you to use everything that happens there will always be floods and freezing storms and cyclones and hurricanes these events will always get headlines and airtime and in every instance you can claim it is an example of abrupt climate change caused by global warming so the message gets reinforced the urgency is increased i dont know drake said doubtfully thats been tried the last couple of years yes on a scattered individual basis isolated politicians making claims about isolated storms or floods clinton did it gore did it that blithering science minister in england did it but were not talking about isolated politicians nicholas we are talking about an organized campaign throughout the world to make people understand that global warming is responsible for abrupt and extreme weather events drake was shaking his head you know he said how many studies show no increase in extreme weather events please henley snorted disinformation from skeptics thats hard to sell there are too many studies amp what are you talking about nicholas its a snap to sell the public already believes that industry is behind any contrary view he sighed in any case i promise you there will soon be more computer models showing that extreme weather is increasing the scientists will get behind this and deliver what is needed you know that drake paced he looked unhappy but it just doesnt make sense he said its not logical to say that freezing weather is caused by global warming whats logic got to do with it henley said all we need is for the media to report it after all most americans believe that crime in their country is increasing when it has actually been declining for twelve years the us murder rate is as low as it was in the early s but americans are more frightened than ever because so much more airtime is devoted to crime they naturally assume there is more in real life too henley sat up in his chair think about what i am saying to you nicholas a twelveyear trend and they still dont believe it there is no greater proof that all reality is media reality the europeans are more sophisticated trust meitll be even easier to sell abrupt climate change in europe than in the us you just do it out of brussels because bureaucrats get it nicholas theyll see the advantages of this shift in emphasis drake did not reply he walked back and forth hands in his pockets staring at the floor just think how far we have come henley said back in the s all the climate scientists believed an ice age was coming they thought the world was getting colder but once the notion of global warming was raised they immediately recognized the advantages global warming creates a crisis a call to action a crisis needs to be studied it needs to be funded it needs political and bureaucratic structures around the world and in no time at all a huge number of meteorologists geologists oceanographers suddenly became climate scientists engaged in the management of this crisis this will be the same nicholas abrupt climate change has been discussed before and it hasnt caught on thats why you are holding a conference henley said patiently you hold a wellpublicized conference and it happens to coincide with some dramatic evidence for the dangers of abrupt climate and by the end of the conference you will have established abrupt climate change as a genuine problem i dont know amp stop whining dont you remember how long it took to establish the global threat of nuclear winter nicholas it took five days on one saturday in nobody in the world had ever heard of nuclear winter then a big media conference was held and by the following wednesday the entire world was worried about nuclear winter it was established as a bona fide threat to the planet without a single published scientific paper drake gave a long sigh five days nicholas henley said they did it youll do it your conference is going to change the ground rules for climate the screen went black my god sarah said evans said nothing he just stared at the screen sanjong had stopped listening some minutes before he was working with his laptop kenner turned to evans when was that segment recorded i dont know evans slowly came out of his fog he looked around the room in a daze i have no idea when it was recorded why youve got the remote in your hand kenner said oh sorry evans pressed the buttons brought the menu up saw the date it was two weeks ago so mortons been bugging drakes offices for two weeks kenner said looks like it evans watched as the recording ran again this time with the sound off he stared at the two men drake pacing and worried henley just sitting there sure of himself evans was struggling to assimilate what he had heard the first recording had seemed reasonable enough to him there drake was complaining about the problems of publicizing a genuine environmental threat global warming when everybody naturally ceased to care about the topic in the middle of a snowstorm all that made sense to evans but this conversation amphe shook his head this one worried him sanjong clapped his hands together and said i got it i have the location he turned his laptop so everyone could see the screen this is nexrad radar from flagstaffpulliam you can see the precipitation center forming northeast of payson there should be a storm there by midday tomorrow how far is that from us sarah said about ninety miles kenner said i think we better get in the helicopter and do what evans said its ten oclock at night for gods sake dress warmly kenner said the world was green and black the trees slightly fuzzy through the lenses the nightvision goggles pressed heavily against his forehead there was something wrong with the straps they cut into his ears and were painful but everybody was wearing them looking out the windows of the helicopter at the miles of forest below they were looking for clearings and had already passed a dozen or more some were inhabited the houses dark rectangles with glowing windows in a couple of clearings the buildings were completely blackghost towns abandoned mining communities but they hadnt yet found what they were looking for theres one sanjong said pointing evans looked off to his left and saw a large clearing the familiar spiderweb pattern of launchers and cables was partially obscured in tall grass to one side stood a large trailer truck of the size used to deliver groceries to supermarkets and indeed in black lettering he saw a ampp printed on the side panels food terrorists sarah said but no one laughed and then the clearing had flashed past the helicopter continuing onward the pilot had explicit instructions not to slow down or to circle any clearing that was definitely one evans said where are we now tonto forest west of prescott the pilot said ive marked the coordinates sanjong said we should find two more in a fivemile triangle the helicopter thumped onward into the night it was another hour before they located the remaining spiderwebs and the helicopter headed home mckinley park monday october am the morning was warm and sunny although dark clouds threatened to the north at mckinley state park the lincoln middle school was having its annual outing there were balloons attached to the picnic tables the barbecue grills were smoking and about three hundred kids and their families were playing on the grassy field beside the waterfall throwing frisbees and baseballs more were playing along the banks of the nearby cavender river which meandered peacefully through the park the river was low at the moment with sandy banks on either side and small rocky pools where the younger children played kenner and the others were parked to one side watching when that river overflows kenner said itll take out the entire park and everyone in it its a pretty big park evans said will it really overflow that much doesnt take much the water will be muddy and fast moving six inches of fast water is enough to knock a person off his feet then they slide its slippery they wont be able to get back up again therere rocks and debris in the water mud blinds them they hit things lose consciousness most drownings occur because people try to move across very low water but six inches amp muddy water has power kenner said six inches of mud will take a car no problem lose traction sweep it right off the road happens all the time evans found this hard to believe but kenner was now talking about some famous flood in colorado the big thompson where a hundred and forty people died in a matter of minutes cars crushed like beer cans he said people with clothes ripped off their bodies by mud dont kid yourself but here evans said pointing to the park if the water starts to rise there will be enough time to get out amp not if its a flash flood nobody here will know until its too late thats why were going to make sure they dont have a flash flood he checked his watch looked up at the darkening sky and then walked back to the cars they had three suvs in a row kenner would drive one sanjong would drive one peter and sarah would drive the third kenner opened the back door to his car he said to peter do you have a gun no you want one you think i need one you might when was the last time you were on a range uh its been a while in truth evans had never fired a gun in his life and until this moment he was proud of it he shook his head im not much of a gun guy kenner had a revolver in his hands he had opened the round barrelthing and was checking it sanjong was over by his own car checking an evillooking rifle matte black stock with a telescopic sight his manner was quick practiced a soldier uneasily evans thought what is this the ok corral well be all right sarah said to kenner i have a gun you know how to use it i do what is it a millimeter beretta kenner shook his head can you handle a sure he gave her a gun and a holster she clipped the holster to the waistband of her jeans she seemed to know what she was doing evans said do you really expect us to shoot somebody not unless you have to kenner said but you may need to defend yourself you think theyll have guns they might yes jesus its okay sarah said personally ill be happy to shoot the bastards her voice was hard angry all right then kenner said that about does it lets mount up evans thought mount up jesus this was the ok corral kenner drove to the other side of the park and spoke briefly to a state trooper whose blackandwhite patrol car stood at the edge of a clearing kenner had arranged radio contact with the trooper in fact they were all going to be in radio contact because the plan required a high degree of coordination they would have to hit the three spiderweb sites at the same time as kenner explained it the rockets were intended to do something called charge amplification of the storm it was an idea from the last ten years when people first began to study lightning in the field in actual storms the old idea was that each lightning strike decreased the storms intensity because it reduced the difference in electrical charge between the clouds and the ground but some researchers had concluded that lightning strikes had the opposite effectthey increased the power of storms dramatically the mechanism for this was not known but was presumed to be related to the sudden heat of the lightning bolt or the shockwave it created adding turbulence to the already turbulent storm center in any case there was now a theory that if you could make more lightning the storm would get worse and the spiderwebs evans said theyre little rockets with microfilaments attached they go up a thousand feet into the cloud layer where the wire provides a lowresistance conduction pathway and creates a lightning strike so the rockets cause more lightning thats what theyre for yes thats the idea evans remained doubtful who pays for all this research he said the insurance companies kenner shook his head its all classified he said you mean its military correct the military pays for weather research think about it kenner said evans was not inclined to do so he was deeply skeptical of all things military the notion that they were paying for weather research struck him as the same sort of ludicrous excess as the sixhundreddollar toilet seats and thousanddollar wrenches that had become so notorious if you ask me its all a waste of money elf doesnt think so kenner said it was then that sanjong spoke with considerable intensity evans had forgotten that he was a soldier sanjong said that whoever could control the weather would control the battlefield it was an ageold military dream of course the military would spend money on it youre saying it actually works yes sanjong said why do you think we are here the suv wound up into the wooded hills north of mckinley park this was an area of intermittent dense forest and open grassy fields in the passenger seat sarah looked at peter he was goodlooking and he had the strong physique of an athlete but sometimes he behaved like such a wimp you ever do any sports she said sure what squash a little soccer oh hey he said just because i dont shoot guns ampim a lawyer for christs sake she was disappointed with him and not even sure why probably she thought because she was nervous and wanted somebody competent to be with her she liked being around kenner he was so knowledgeable so skilled he knew what was going on he was quick to respond to any situation whereas peter was a nice guy but amp she watched his hands on the wheel he drove well and that was important today it was no longer sunny they were close to the storm clouds the day was dark gloomy threatening the road ahead was deserted as it wound through the forests they hadnt seen a car since they left the park how much farther evans said sarah consulted the gps looks like another five miles he nodded sarah shifted in her seat moving so the holstered gun would not press against her hip she glanced at the passengerside mirror oh shit what behind them was a battered blue pickup truck with arizona plates auroraville monday october am weve got trouble sarah said why evans said he glanced in the rearview mirror saw the truck what is it sarah had the radio in her hand kenner they spotted us who did evans said who are they the radio clicked where are you kenner said on highway were about four miles away okay kenner said stick with the plan do your best who is it evans said looking in the mirror the blue pickup was advancing fast very fast in the next instant it banged into the back of their car evans was startled swerved got control again what the fuck he said just drive peter sarah took the revolver from its holster she held the gun on her lap looked out the side mirror the blue truck had dropped back for a moment but now raced forward again here he comes perhaps because peter stepped on the gas the impact was surprisingly gentle it was hardly more than a nudge peter careened around the curves glancing at the rearview mirror again the blue truck dropped back it followed them for the next half mile but it was never closer than five or six car lengths i dont get it evans said are they going to ram us or not guess not she said see what happens if you slow down he slowed the suv dropping their speed to forty the blue truck slowed too falling back farther theyre just following us she said why the first scattered drops of rain spattered the windshield the road ahead was spotted but they werent yet in full rain the blue truck dropped even farther back now they came around a curve and immediately ahead of them saw a big silver eighteenwheeler with a big trailer it was rumbling slowly along the road not going more than thirty miles an hour on its back doors it said a ampp oh shit evans said in the back mirror they saw the blue truck still following theyve got us front and back he swerved out trying to pass the big trailer but as soon as he did the driver moved toward the center of the road evans immediately fell back were trapped he said i dont know she said i dont get it the trailer blocked them at the front but behind them the blue truck was farther back than ever several hundred yards down the road she was still puzzling over this situation when a bolt of lightning crashed down at the side of the road as they drove past it couldnt have been more than ten yards away a whitehot dazzling blast of light and sound they both jumped jesus that was close evans said yes amp ive never seen one that close before she could answer a second bolt crashed down directly in front of them the sound was explosive evans swerved involuntarily even though the bolt was gone holy shit by then sarah had a suspicion just as the third bolt hit the car itself a deafening crash and a sudden pressure that made knife pains in her ears and a blast of white that enveloped the car evans screamed in fear and let go of the wheel sarah grabbed it and straightened the car in the road a fourth bolt smashed down by the drivers side just inches from the car the driversside window cracked and splintered holy shit evans was saying holy shit what is this to sarah it was only too obvious they were attracting lightning the next bolt cracked down and was immediately followed by another which smashed into the hood and spread burning white jagged fingers over the car and then was gone there was a huge black indentation in the hood i cant do this evans was saying i cant i cant do this drive peter sarah said grabbing his arm and squeezing hard drive two more bolts hit them in rapid succession sarah smelled the odor of something burningshe wasnt sure what but now she understood why they had been so gently rammed the blue pickup had stuck something onto their car some kind of electronic thing and it was drawing the lightning to them what do we do what do we do evans was whimpering he howled as each new bolt struck but they were trapped driving on a narrow road hemmed in by dense pine forest on both sides of the road amp something she should know forest ampwhat about the forest a lightning bolt cracked the rear window with explosive force another bolt struck them so hard it bounced the car on the macadam as if it had been hit by a hammer the hell with this evans said and spun the wheel turning off the highway and onto a dirt track in the forest sarah saw a sign flash by the name of a town on a battered post they were plunged into near darkness under the huge green pines but the lightning immediately stopped of course she thought the trees even if their car was attracting lightning it would strike the taller trees first a moment later it did they heard a sharp crack just behind them and lightning flashed down the side of a tall pine splitting the trunk open with what looked like steam and bursting the tree into flames were going to start a forest fire i dont care evans said he was driving fast the vehicle was bouncing over the dirt road but it was an suv and it rode high so sarah knew they would be all right looking back she saw the tree burning and the fire spreading laterally in fingers along the ground kenner on the radio sarah whats happening we had to leave the road were being struck by lightning a lot evans yelled all the time find the attractor kenner said i think its attached to the car sarah said as she spoke a bolt smashed down on the road just ahead of them the glare was so bright she saw green streaks before her eyes then dump the car kenner said go out as low as you can he clicked off evans continued to race forward the suv bouncing on the ruts i dont want to leave he said i think were safer inside they always say dont leave your car because youre safer inside the rubber tires insulate you but somethings on fire she said sniffing the car jolted and bounced sarah tried to keep her balance just holding onto her seat not touching the metal of the doors i dont care i think we should stay evans said the gas tank might explode amp i dont want to leave he said im not leaving his knuckles were white gripping the wheel ahead sarah saw a clearing in the forest it was a large clearing with high yellow grass a lightning bolt smashed down with a fearsome crack shattering the side mirror which blew apart like a bomb a moment later they heard a soft whump the car tilted to one side oh shit evans said it blew a tire so much for the insulation she said the car was now grinding the underside scraping over a dirt rut metal squealing peter she said all right all right just let me get to the clearing i dont think we can wait but the rut ended the road flattened and evans drove forward creaking on the rim into the clearing raindrops spattered the windshield above the grass sarah saw the roofs of wooden buildings bleached by the sun it took her a moment to realize that this was a ghost town or a mining town directly ahead was a sign auroraville pop another lightning bolt crashed down and evans hit the sign knocking it over peter i think were here okay yeah let me get a little closer now peter he stopped the car and they flung open their doors in unison sarah threw herself bodily onto the ground and another bolt crashed so close to her that the blast of hot air knocked her sideways and sent her rolling on the ground the roar of the lightning was deafening she got up on hands and knees and scrambled around to the back of the vehicle evans was on the other side of the suv yelling something but she couldnt hear him she examined the rear bumper there was no attachment no device there was nothing there but she had no time to think because another bolt struck the back of the suv rocking it and the rear window shattered sprinkling her with shards of glass she fought panic and scrambled forward staying low as she moved around the suv and through the grass toward the nearest building evans was somewhere ahead yelling to her but she couldnt hear him over the rumbling thunder she just didnt want another bolt not now if she could just go a few more seconds amp her hands touched wood a board a step she crawled forward quickly pushing aside the grass and now she saw a porch a dilapidated building and swinging from the roof a sign bleached so gray she couldnt see what it said evans was inside and she scrambled forward ignoring the splinters in her hands and he was yelling yelling and she finally heard what he was saying look out for the scorpions they were all over the wooden porchtiny pale yellow with their stingers in the air there must have been two dozen they moved surprisingly fast scampering sideways like crabs stand up she got to her feet and ran feeling the arachnids crunch under her feet another lightning bolt smashed into the buildings roof knocking down the sign which fell in a cloud of dust onto the porch but then she was inside the building and evans was standing there fists raised yelling yes yes we did it she was gasping for breath at least they werent snakes she said chest heaving evans said what therere always rattlers in these old buildings oh jesus outside thunder rumbled and the lightning started again through the shattered grimy window sarah was looking at the suv and thinking that now that they had left the car there were no more lightning strikes on the suv ampthinkinghing on the bumper ampthen why had the pickup nudged the suv what was the point she turned to ask evans if he had noticed and a lightning bolt blasted straight down through the roof smashing it open to the dark sky sending boards flying in all directions and blasting into the ground right where she had been standing the lightning left a blackened pattern of jagged streaks like the shadow of a thorn bush on the floor the ozone smell was strong wisps of smoke drifted up from the dry floorboards this whole building could go evans said he was already flinging a side door open heading outside stay low sarah said and followed him out the rain was coming down harder big splattering drops that struck her back and shoulders as she ran to the next building it had a brick chimney and looked generally better built but the windows were the same broken and thickly coated with dust and grime they tried the nearest door but it was jammed shut so they ran around to the front and found that door wide open sarah ran inside a lightning bolt smashed down behind her sagging the roof over the porch splintering one of the side posts as it streaked down into the ground the shockwave blasted the front windows in a shower of dirty glass sarah turned away covering her face and when she looked out again she realized she was in a blacksmiths shop there was a large firepit in the center of the room and above it all sorts of iron implements hanging from the ceiling and on the walls she saw horseshoes tongs metal of all sorts this room was full of metal the thunder rumbled ominously we have to get out of here evans shouted this is the wrong place to he never finished the next bolt knocked him off his feet as it came crashing down through the ceiling spinning the iron implements then smashing into the firepit blasting the bricks outward in all directions sarah ducked covering her head and ears felt bricks striking her shoulders back legsknocking her overand then there was a burst of pain in her forehead and she saw brief stars before blackness settled over her and the rumble of thunder faded to endless silence forest monday october am kenner was fifteen miles away driving east on route listening to sarahs radio her transmitter was still on clipped to her belt it was hard to be sure what was happening because each lightning strike produced a burst of static that lasted for the next fifteen seconds nevertheless he understood the most important pointevans and sarah had gotten away from the suv but the lightning hadnt stopped in fact it seemed that the lightning was following them kenner had been yelling into his handset trying to get sarahs attention but apparently she had turned her volume down or was too busy dealing with what was happening in the ghost town he kept saying its following you over and over but she never answered now there was a long burst of static followed by silence kenner switched channels sanjong yes professor have you been listening yes where are you kenner said i am on route going north i estimate i am three miles from the web any lightning yet no but the rain has just started here first drops on the windshield okay hang on he went back to sarahs channel there was still static but it was fading sarah are you there sarah sarah kenner heard a cough a distant cough sarah a click a bang someone fumbling with the radio a cough this is peter evans whats happening there dead what shes dead sarahs dead she got hit with a brick and she fell and then there was a lightning strike that hit her full on the body and shes dead im right here beside her shes dead oh shit shes dead amp try mouthtomouth im telling you shes dead peter mouthtomouth oh god ampshes blue amp that means shes alive peter like a corpse acorpse peter listen to me but evans wasnt hearing anything the idiot had his finger on the radio button kenner swore in frustration and then suddenly a new blast of static kenner knew what it meant there had been another lightning strike a bad one sanjong now kenner heard nothing but static on sanjongs channel too it lasted ten seconds fifteen seconds so sanjong had a strike too only then did kenner realize what must be causing it sanjong came back coughing are you all right i had a lightning strike very near the car i cannot imagine so close sanjong kenner said i think its the radios you think whered we get them i had them fedexed from dc package delivered to you personally no to the motel the owner gave it to me when i checked in ampbut the box was sealed amp throw your radio away kenner said theres no cellular net we wont be in communic nothing more just a blast of static peter there was no answer only silence on the radio not even static now peter answer me peter are you there nothing dead kenner waited a few moments there was no answer from evans the first drops of rain splashed on kenners windshield he rolled down his window and threw his radio away it bounced on the pavement and went into the grass on the other side of the road kenner had gone another hundred yards down the road when a bolt of lightning crashed down behind him on the opposite side of the road it was the radios all right somebody had gotten to the radios in dc or in arizona it was hard to know for sure and at this point it didnt matter their carefully coordinated plan was now impossible to carry out the situation was suddenly very dangerous they had planned to hit all three rocket arrays at the same time that would not happen now of course kenner could still hit his array if sanjong was still alive he might get to the second array but their attack would not be coordinated if one of them were later than the other the second rocket team would have been informed by radio and would be waiting with guns ready kenner had no doubt about that and sarah and evans were either dead or unable to function their car was broken down certainly they would never make it to the third array so just one rocket array taken out maybe two would that be enough maybe he thought kenner looked at the road ahead a pale strip under dark skies he did not think about whether his friends were alive or not perhaps all three were dead but if kenner did not stop the storm there would be hundreds dead children families paper plates in the mud while the searchers dug out the bodies somehow he had to stop it he drove forward into the storm mckinley monday october am mommy mommy brad hit me mommy make him stop all right kids amp bradley how many times do i have to tell you leave your sister alone standing to one side of mckinley park trooper miguel rodriguez of the arizona highway patrol stood by his car and watched the picnic in progress it was now eleventhirty in the morning and the kids were getting hungry they were starting to fight all around the park barbecues were going the smoke rising into an everdarkening sky some of the parents looked upward with concern but nobody was leaving the park and the rain hadnt started here even though they had heard the crack of lightning and the rumble of thunder a few miles to the north rodriguez glanced at the bullhorn resting on the seat of his car for the last half hour he had waited impatiently for the radio call from agent kenner telling him to clear the park but the call hadnt yet come and agent kenner had given him explicit instructions do not clear mckinley park before he was given the word trooper rodriguez didnt understand why it was necessary to wait but kenner had been insistent he said it was a matter of national security rodriguez didnt understand that either how was a damn picnic in a park a matter of national security but he knew an order when he heard one so rodriguez waited impatient and uneasy and watched the sky even when he heard the weather service announce a flash flood advisory for the eastern counties from kayenta to two guns and camp paysonan area that included mckinleyrodriguez still waited he could not know that the radio call he was waiting for would never come auroraville monday october am in retrospect what saved peter evans was the slight tingling he had felt holding the radio in his sweating palm in the minutes before evans had realized that something was causing the lightning to follow them wherever they went he didnt know any science but assumed it must be something metallic or electronic talking to kenner he had felt the faint electric tingle from the handsetand on an impulse he had flung it across the room it landed against a large iron viselike contraption that looked like a bear trap the lightning crashed down a moment later glaring white and roaring and evans threw himself flat across sarahs dead body lying there dizzy with fear his ears ringing from the blast he thought for a moment that he felt some movement from her body beneath him he got up quickly and began to cough the room was full of smoke the opposite wall was on fire the flames still small but already licking up the wall he looked back at sarah blue and cold there was no question in his mind that she was dead he must have imagined her movement but he pinched her nose and began to give her mouthtomouth her lips were cold it frightened him he was sure she was dead he saw hot embers and ash floating in the smoky air he would have to leave before the entire building came down around him he was losing his count blowing into her lungs there was no point anyway he heard the flames crackling around him he looked up and saw that the ceiling timbers were starting to burn he felt panic he jumped to his feet ran to the door and threw it open and went outside he was stunned to feel hard rain coming downpelting him soaking him instantly it shocked him to his senses he looked back and saw sarah lying on the floor he couldnt leave her he ran back grabbed both her arms and dragged her out of the house her inert body was surprisingly heavy her head sagged back eyes closed her mouth hanging open she was dead all right out in the rain once more he dropped her in the yellow grass got down on his knees and gave her more mouthtomouth he was not sure how long he kept up his steady rhythm one minute two minutes maybe five it was clearly pointless but he continued long past any reason because in a strange way the rhythm relieved his own sense of panic it gave him something to concentrate on he was out there in the middle of a pelting downpour with a ghost town in flames around him anyway and sarah retched her body rose up suddenly and he released her in astonishment she had a spasm of dry heaves and then fell into a fit of coughing sarah amp she groaned she rolled over he grabbed her in his arms and held her she was breathing but her eyes fluttered wildly she didnt seem to be conscious sarah come on amp she was coughing her body shaking he wondered if she was choking to death sarah amp she shook her head as if to clear it she opened her eyes and stared at him oh man she said do i have a headache he thought he was going to cry sanjong glanced at his watch the rain was coming down harder now the wipers flicking back and forth it was very dark and he had turned on his headlights he had thrown his radio away many minutes before and the lightning had stopped around his car but it was continuing elsewherehe heard the rumble of distant thunder checking the gps he realized he was only a few hundred yards from the spiderweb he was meant to disrupt he scanned the road ahead looking for the turnoff that was when he saw the first cluster of rockets firing skyward like black birds streaking straight up into the dark and roiling clouds and in a moment a cluster of lightning bolts came blasting downward carried on the wires ten miles to the north kenner saw the rocket array fire upward from the third spiderweb he guessed there were only about fifty rockets in that array which meant there were another hundred still on the ground he came to the side road turned right and came instantly into a clearing there was a large eighteenwheeler parked to one side there were two men in yellow rain slickers standing beside the cab one of them held a box in his handsthe firing device kenner didnt hesitate he spun the wheel of the suv and drove right for the cab the men were stunned for a moment and at the last moment jumped aside just as kenner scraped along the side of the cab screeching metal and then turned into the rocket field itself in his rearview mirror he saw the men scrambling up but by now he was within the spiderweb array driving along the line of wires trying to crush the launch tubes under his wheels as he hit them he could hear thunk thunk thunk he hoped that would disrupt the firing pattern but he was wrong directly ahead he saw another fifty rockets spout flames and rush upward into the sky sanjong was inside the second clearing he saw a wooden cabin off to the right and a large truck parked beside it there were lights in the cabin and he saw shapes moving in the windows there were men in there wires came out from the front door of the cabin and disappeared in the grass he drove straight for the cabin and he pushed the cruise control on the steering wheel from the front door he saw one man come out cradling a machine gun flame spurted from the barrel and sanjongs windshield shattered he threw open his door and jumped out of the suv holding his rifle away from his body then landing and rolling in the grass he looked up just in time to see the suv smash into the cabin there was a lot of smoke and shouting sanjong was only about twenty yards away he waited after a moment the man with the machine gun came running around to the side of the suv to look for the driver he was shouting excitedly sanjong fired once the man fell backward he waited a second man came out yelling in the rain he saw the fallen man and jumped back huddling behind the front bumper of the suv he leaned forward and called to the fallen man sanjong shot at him the man disappeared but sanjong was not certain he had hit him he had to change position now the rain had matted down the grass so there was not as much cover as he would have liked he rolled quickly moving laterally about ten yards and then crawled forward cautiously trying to get a view into the cabin but the car had smashed in the front door and the lights inside were now out he was sure there were more men in the cabin but he did not see anyone now the shouting had stopped there was just the rumble of thunder and the patter of rain he strained listening he heard the crackle of radios and voices there were still men in the cabin he waited in the grass rain dripped in evanss eyes as he spun the wrench tightening the lug nuts on the front wheel of the suv the spare tire was now securely in place he wiped his eyes and then briefly tightened each lug nut in turn just to be sure it was a rough road going back to the main highway and now with this rain it would be muddy he didnt want the wheel coming loose sarah was waiting for him in the passenger seat he had halfdragged halfcarried her back to the vehicle she was still dazed out of it so he was surprised to hear her shouting something over the sound of the rain evans looked up he saw headlights in the distance on the far side of the clearing he squinted it was the blue pickup truck peter he dropped the lug wrench and ran for the drivers side sarah had already started the engine he got behind the wheel and put the suv in gear the blue truck was gaining on them coming across the clearing lets go sarah said evans stepped on the gas turned and drove into the forestheading back the way they had come behind them the burning building had been put out by the rain it was now a smoldering wreck hissing clouds of steam the blue pickup drove past the building without a pause and came down the road after them kenner turned and came back toward the eighteenwheeler the men were standing there holding the firing box one had a pistol out and began firing at kenner kenner accelerated hard driving straight at them he hit the man with the pistol his body was thrown into the air over the top of the suv the second man had somehow gotten away kenner spun the wheel as he came back he saw the man he had hit staggering to his feet in the grass the other man was nowhere to be seen the staggering man raised his gun just as kenner hit him again he went down and the suv bounced over his body kenner was looking for the other manthe man with the firing box he didnt see him anywhere he spun the wheel there was only one place the man could have gone kenner drove straight for the truck sanjong was waiting in the grass when he heard the sound of a truck engine his view was blocked by his own crashed suv the truck was behind the suv he heard someone put it into gear backing up sanjong got to his feet and began to run a bullet whined past him he dropped to the ground again they had left someone in the house he stayed low in the grass and crawled forward heading for the truck bullets snapped in the grass all around him somehow they had his position even in the grass that meant amp he twisted turning to face the house he wiped the rain out of his eyes and looked through the sights of his rifle the guy was on the roof of the cabin barely visible except when he rose up to fire sanjong fired just below the roofline he knew the bullet would pass right through the wood he didnt see the man again but the mans rifle slid down the roof as sanjong watched he got to his feet and ran toward the truck but it was already driving away heading out from the clearing a pair of red taillights in the rain disappearing onto the main road kenner was out of his suv and on the ground he could see the last guy a silhouette under the big eighteenwheeler dont shoot me dont shoot me the guy was yelling come out slowly with your hands empty kenner shouted i want to see your hands just dont shoot amp come out real slow and a sudden burst of machine gun fire the wet grass around him snapped kenner pressed his face into the wet earth and waited go faster sarah said looking over her shoulder their suv bounced in the mud headlights jumping wildly i dont think i can amp evans said theyre gaining she said you have to go faster they were almost out of the forest evans could see the highway just a few dozen yards ahead he remembered that the last section of the dirt track was less eroded and he accelerated heading there and came out onto the highway going south what are you doing sarah said we have to go to the rocket field its too late now he said were going back to the park but we promised kenner its too late he said look at the storm its already full blown we have to get back to help those families in the park he turned the windshield wipers on full force and raced down the road in the storm behind them the pickup truck turned and followed them trooper miguel rodriguez had been watching the waterfall an hour ago it had been a clear mist coming over the cliff s edge now it was tinged with brown and it had more volume the river too was starting to rise it was flowing faster and beginning to turn a muddy brown but it was still not raining at the park the air had turned distinctly humid and there had been scattered raindrops for a few minutes but then the rain had stopped a few families had abandoned their barbecues a halfdozen more were packing up their cars in anticipation of the coming storm but most had chosen to ignore it the school principal was walking among the picnickers telling people the weather would pass urging everyone to stay rodriguez was edgy he tugged at his uniform collar uncomfortable in the dampness he paced back and forth beside his open car door he heard the police radio announce flash flood warnings for clayton county which was where mckinley park was located he didnt want to wait any longer but still he hesitated he couldnt understand why kenner hadnt called him the park was located in a canyon and there was every sign of a potential flash flood rodriguez had lived in northern arizona his whole life he knew he should clear the park now why hadnt kenner called he drummed his fingers on the door of the car he decided to give it five more minutes five minutes no more what worried him most at the moment was the waterfall the brown tinge had put people off and most of the crowd had moved away but a few teenagers were still playing in the pool at the base of the fall rodriguez knew that rocks could come over the cliff any minute now even small rocks would have enough force to kill a person at the bottom rodriguez was thinking about clearing the waterfall area when he noticed something strange up at the top of the cliff where the water came over the lip he saw a van with an antenna it looked like a tv station van there was no lettering on the side but there was a logo of some kind still he couldnt make it out from this distance he saw a cameraman get out of the van and take a position by the waterfall crouching down with a camera mounted on his shoulder and looking down into the park a woman in a skirt and blouse stood by his side pointing in this direction and that apparently telling him where to film because he was turning the camera where she pointed it was definitely a news crew he thought a news crew for a school picnic rodriguez squinted trying to identify the vans logo it was yellow and blue sort of swirly interlocking circles he didnt recognize it as one of the local stations but there was something distinctly creepy about this crew coming here right as the storm was descending on the park he decided hed better walk over and have a talk with them kenner didnt want to kill the guy now huddled beneath the semi no member of elf had ever been captured and this one seemed a likely candidate kenner could tell from the sound of the guys voice that he was scared and he sounded young maybe in his twenties probably he was shaken by the death of his friend certainly he couldnt handle a machine gun very well now this guy was afraid he was going to die too maybe he was having second thoughts about his cause come out now kenner yelled to him come out and everything will be all right fuck you the guy said who the fuck are you anyway what is your fucking problem dont you get it man were trying to save the planet youre breaking the law kenner said the law the guy said contemptuously the laws owned by the corporations that pollute the environment and destroy human life the only one killing people is you kenner said thunder was rumbling and lightning flickered dimly behind the inky clouds it was absurd to be having this conversation in the middle of a storm but it was worth it to get the guy alive hey im not killing anyone the guy said not even you youre killing little kids kenner said in the park youre killing families on a picnic casualties are inevitable in accomplishing social change history tells us that kenner wasnt sure whether the guy believed what he was saying had been fed it at college or was just distracted by fear then again maybe it was meant to be a distraction amp he looked to his right beneath his own vehicle and he saw a pair of feet moving around the suv and heading toward him ah hell he thought it was disappointing he aimed carefully and shot once hitting the man behind the suv in the ankle the guy screamed in pain and went down on his back kenner could see him under the car he wasnt young maybe forty or fortyfive bearded he carried a machine gun and he was rolling over to shoot kenner fired twice the mans head jerked back he dropped the machine gun and did not move his body sprawled awkwardly in the grass the man under the semi began to fire his own machine gun the bullets were flying wildly kenner heard several thunk into his suv kenner lay in the grass head down when the shooting stopped he yelled last chance fuck you kenner waited there was a long pause he listened to the sound of the rain it was coming down very hard now he waited the guy yelled did you hear me you fucking asshole i heard you kenner said and shot once it was a real desert downpour evans thought gripping the steering wheel the rain was coming down in dense sheets even with the windshield wipers going as fast as they could he found it almost impossible to see the road ahead he had dropped his speed to fifty then forty now he was down to thirty the pickup truck behind them had slowed too there was no real choice he passed one or two other cars but they were all pulled over to the side of the road it was the sensible thing to do the pavement was awash in water and whenever the pavement dipped a little it formed a lake or a rushing rivulet sometimes he could not tell how deep the water was and he didnt want to soak his ignition he gunned the engine to keep it dry he didnt see any road signs it was almost as dark as night out there and he had his headlights on but they seemed to make no difference he could see only a few yards ahead through the rain he looked over at sarah but she was just staring forward not moving not speaking he wondered if she was all right looking in the rearview mirror he could sometimes see the lights of the pickup truck following him and sometimes not there was that much rain i think were almost to the park he said but i cant be sure the interior of the windshield was starting to fog up he rubbed it with the back of his arm and his elbow making a squeaking sound on the glass now he could see a little better they were at the top of a gentle hill heading down toward oh shit what sarah said look at the bottom of the hill was a fifteenfoot culvert the road passing over a series of large pipes carrying water from a small stream earlier the stream had been little more than a silvery trickle in a rocky bed but it had broadened and risen so that it now flowed over the surface of the road the water moving swiftly evans couldnt tell how deep it was probably not very deep peter sarah said youve stopped the car i know you cant stop i dont know if i can go through this he said i dont know how deep six inches of water is enough to carry away a car youve got no choice in his rearview mirror he saw the lights of the pickup truck he headed down the hill toward the culvert he kept his eyes on the mirror waiting to see what the truck did it had slowed as well but it was still following as he drove the suv down the hill keep your fingers crossed evans said ive got everything crossed he entered the water it was whooshing up on the sides of the car spraying up as high as the windows and gurgling under the floorboards he was terrified that he would lose the ignition but so far so good he gave a sigh he was approaching the middle now and it wasnt that deep no more than two two and a half feet he would make it okay peter amp sarah pointed ahead there was a large eighteenwheeler coming down the road toward them its lights were flaring it wasnt slowing down at all hes an idiot evans said moving slowly in the water he turned right moving farther toward his side of the road to make room in response the truck moved directly into his lane it did not slow down then he saw the logo above the cab it said in red letters a ampp peter do something like what do something several tons of roaring steel were coming right at him he glanced in the rearview mirror the blue pickup truck was still behind him closing in they had him front and back they were going to drive him off the road the semi was in deeper water now roaring forward the water plumed high on both sides peterrrrr there wasnt any choice he spun the wheel and drove off the road plunging into the water of the rushing stream the suv nosed down and water came over the hood up to the windshield and for a moment he thought they were going to sink right there then the bumper crunched against the rocks of the streambed and the wheels gained purchase and the car straightened for a thrilling moment he thought he was going to be able to drive the car along the streambedthe river wasnt that deep not reallybut almost at once the engine died and he felt the rear end pull loose and spin around and they were carried helplessly along in the river evans turned the ignition trying to start the engine again but it wasnt working the suv moved gently rocking and bumping against rocks occasionally it would stop and he considered getting out but then it would begin to float downstream again he looked over his shoulder the road was surprisingly far back now that the engine was out the car was fogging up quickly he had to rub all the windows to see out sarah was silent gripping the arms of her seat the car came to a stop again against a rock should we get out she said i dont think so he said he could feel the car shuddering in the moving water i think we should she said the car started to move again he tried the ignition but it would not start up the alternator whirred and sputtered then he remembered sarah he said open your window what open your window oh she flicked the switch it doesnt work evans tried his own window on the drivers side it didnt work either the electrical systems were shot on a chance he tried the rear windows the left window opened smoothly hey success sarah said nothing she was looking forward the stream was moving faster the car picking up speed he kept rubbing the fogged windows trying to see but it was difficult and suddenly the car gave a sharp jolt and afterward the movement was different it went swiftly ahead turning slowly in circles the wheels no longer touched rock where are we what happened together they rubbed the windshield frantically to get it clean oh jesus sarah said when she saw they were in the middle of a rushing river muddy brown and moving fast standing waves of churning water there were big tree branches and debris moving swiftly along the car was going faster and faster every second and water was coming in through the floor now their feet were wet evans knew what that meant they were sinking i think we should get out peter no he was looking at the standing waves of churning water there were rapids big boulders sinkholes maybe if they had helmets and body protection they might try to go into the current but without helmets they would die the car tilted to the right then came back up but he had the feeling that sooner or later it would roll onto its side and sink and he had the feeling it would sink fast he looked out the window and said does this look familiar what river is this who cares sarah yelled and then evans said look trooper rodriguez saw the suv bouncing and spinning down the river and immediately hit his car siren he grabbed the bullhorn and turned to the picnickers folks please clear the area we have a flash flood now everybody move to higher ground and do it now he hit the siren again now folks leave your things for later go now he looked back at the suv but it was already almost out of sight headed down the river toward the mckinley overpass and right beyond mckinley overpass was the cliffs edge a ninetyfoot drop the car and its occupants wouldnt survive it and there was nothing they could do about it evans couldnt think couldnt planit was all he could do to hang on the suv rolled and turned in the churning water the vehicle was sinking lower and the water now sloshing at knee height was freezing cold and seemed to make the car more unstable its movements more unpredictable at one point he banged heads with sarah who grunted but she was not saying anything either then he banged his head on the door post saw stars briefly ahead he saw an overpass a roadway held up with big concrete stanchions each stanchion had caught debris floating downriver the pylons were now wrapped with a tangled mat of tree branches burned trunks old boards and floating junk so that there was little room to pass by sarah he yelled unbuckle your seat belt his own belt was now under the chilly water he fumbled with it as the car rolled i cant she said i cant get it he bent to help her what are we going to do were going to get out he said the car raced forward then slammed into a mass of branches it shuddered in the current but held position it clanged against an old refrigerator a refrigerator evans thought that bobbed in the water nearby the pylon loomed above them the river was so high the road overpass was only about ten feet above them we have to get out sarah he said my belt is stuck i cant he bent to help her plunging his hands into the water fumbling for the belt he couldnt see it in the mud he had to do it by feel and he felt the car begin to move it was going to break free sanjong was driving furiously along the upper road he saw peter and sarah in their suv riding the current toward the bridge he saw them crash against the pylon and hold precariously there the traffic on the bridge was swarming away from the park passengers panicking honking horns confusion sanjong drove across the bridge and jumped out of his car he began to run across the bridge toward the car in the water below evans hung on desperately as the suv rolled and spun in the churning water the refrigerator clanged against them again and again branches stuck through the shattered windows the tips quivering like fingers sarahs seat belt was jammed the latch was crumpled or something evanss fingers were numb in the cold he knew that the car wouldnt stay in position very long he could feel the current pulling at it dragging it laterally i cant get it open sarah he said the water had risen it was now almost chest high what do we do she said her eyes were panicky for an instant he didnt know and then he thought im an idiot and he threw himself bodily across her plunged his head underwater and felt for the door post on her side of the car he dragged a threefoot length of the seat belt away from the post and brought his head back up gasping for air slide out he yelled slide out she understood immediately putting her hands on his shoulder and shoving as she slithered out from the belt his head went back under the water but he could feel her getting free she moved into the backseat kicking him in the head as she went he was back up above the water gasping now climb out he yelled the car was starting to move the branches creaking the refrigerator clanging sarahs athleticism stood her in good stead she slipped through the rear window and hung onto the car go for the branches climb he was afraid the current would take her if she held onto the car he was scrambling back into the rear seat then squeezing himself through the window the car was pulling loose trembling at first then distinctly moving rolling around the debris pile and he was still half out the window peter sarah shouted he lunged throwing himself forward into the branches scratching his face but feeling his hands close around large branches and he pulled his body clear of the car just as the current ripped it away dragging it under the bridge the car was gone he saw sarah climbing up the debris stack reaching up for the concrete railing of the roadway he followed her shivering from cold and fear in a few moments he felt a strong hand reach down and pull him up the rest of the way he looked up and saw sanjong grinning at him my friend you are a lucky one evans came over the railing and toppled onto the ground gasping exhausted distantly he heard the sound of a police siren and a bullhorn barking orders he became aware of the traffic on the bridge the honking horns the panic come on sarah said helping him up somebodys going to run over you if you stay here trooper rodriguez was still getting everybody into their cars but there was pandemonium in the parking lot and a traffic jam on the bridge the rain was starting to come down hard that was making people move faster rodriguez cast a worried eye at the waterfall noting that it was a darker brown and flowing more heavily than before he saw then that the tv crew had gone the van was no longer atop the cliff that was odd he thought youd think theyd have stayed to film the emergency exit cars were honking on the bridge where traffic was stalled he saw a number of people standing there looking over the other side which could only mean that the suv had gone over the cliff rodriguez slipped behind the wheel to radio for an ambulance that was when he heard that an ambulance had already been called to dos cabezas fifteen miles to the north apparently a group of hunters had gotten into a drunken argument and there had been some shooting two men were dead and a third was injured rodriguez shook his head damn guys went out with a rifle and a bottle of bourbon each and then had to sit around drinking because of the rain and before you knew it couple of them were dead happened every year especially around the holidays flagstaff monday october pm i dont see why this is necessary sarah said sitting up in bed she had electrodes stuck to her chest and legs please dont move the nurse said were trying to get a record they were in a small screenedoff cubicle in the flagstaff hospital emergency room kenner evans and sanjong had insisted she come there they were waiting outside she could hear them talking softly but im twentyeight years old sarah said im not going to have a heart attack the doctor wants to check your conduction pathways my conduction pathways sarah said theres nothing wrong with my conduction pathways maam please lie down and dont move but this is and dont talk she lay down she sighed she glanced at the monitor which showed squiggly white lines this is ridiculous theres nothing wrong with my heart no there doesnt seem to be the nurse said nodding to the monitor youre very lucky sarah sighed so can i get up now yes and dont you worry yourself about those burn marks the nurse said theyll fade over time sarah said what burn marks the nurse pointed to her chest theyre very superficial sarah sat up and looked down her blouse she saw the white adhesive tags of the electrodes but she also saw pale brown streaks jagged marks that ran across her chest and abdomen like zigzags or something what is this she said its from the lightning she said what you were struck by lightning the nurse said what are you talking about the doctor came in an absurdly young man prematurely balding he seemed very busy and preoccupied he said dont worry about those burn marks theyll fade in no time at all its from lightning pretty common actually do you know where you are in flagstaff hospital do you know what day it is monday thats right very good look at my finger please he held his finger up in front of her face moved it left and right up and down follow it thats good thank you you have a headache i did she said not anymore are you telling me i was struck by lightning you sure as heck were he said bending to hit her knees with a rubber hammer but youre not showing any signs of hypoxia hypoxia amp lack of oxygen we see that when theres a cardiac arrest she said what are you talking about its normal not to remember the doctor said but according to your friends out there you arrested and one of them resuscitated you said it took four or five minutes you mean i was dead would have been if you hadnt gotten cpr peter resuscitated me it had to be peter she thought i dont know which one now he was tapping her elbows with the hammer but youre a very lucky young woman around here we get three four deaths a year from strikes and sometimes very serious burns youre just fine was it the young guy she said peter evans him the doctor shrugged he said when was your last tetanus i dont understand evans said on the news report it said they were hunters a hunting accident or an argument of some kind thats right kenner said but youre telling me you guys shot them evans looked from kenner to sanjong they shot first kenner said jesus evans said three deaths he bit his lip but in truth he was feeling a contradictory reaction he would have expected his native caution to take overa series of killings possibly murders he was an accomplice or at the very least a material witness he could be tied up in court disgraced disbarred amp that was the path his mind usually followed that was what his legal training had emphasized but at this moment he felt no anxiety at all extremists had been discovered and they had been killed he was neither surprised nor disturbed by the news on the contrary he felt quite satisfied to hear it he realized then that his experience in the crevasse had changed himand changed him permanently someone had tried to kill him he could never have imagined such a thing growing up in suburban cleveland or in college or law school he could never have imagined such a thing while living his daily life going to work at his firm in los angeles and so he could not have predicted the way that he felt changed by it now he felt as if he had been physically movedas if someone had picked him up and shifted him ten feet to one side he was no longer standing in the same place but he had also been changed internally he felt a kind of solid impassivity he had not known before there were unpleasant realities in the world and previously he had averted his eyes from them or changed the subject or made excuses for what had occurred he had imagined that this was an acceptable strategy in lifein fact that it was a more humane strategy he no longer believed that if someone tried to kill you you did not have the option of averting your eyes or changing the subject you were forced to deal with that persons behavior the experience was in the end a loss of certain illusions the world was not how you wanted it to be the world was how it was there were bad people in the world they had to be stopped thats right kenner was saying nodding slowly three deaths isnt that right sanjong thats right sanjong said screw em evans said sanjong nodded kenner said nothing the jet flew back to los angeles at six oclock sarah sat in the front staring out the window she listened to the men in the back kenner was talking about what would happen next the dead men were being idd their guns and trucks and clothes were being traced and the television film crew had already been found it was a truck from kbbd a cable station in sedona theyd gotten an anonymous call saying that the highway patrol had been derelict and had allowed a picnic to proceed despite flash flood warnings and disaster was probable that was why they had gone to the park apparently it never occurred to anyone to question why theyd got an anonymous call half an hour before a flash flood warning had been issued from the nexrad center the call had been traced however it had been placed from a pay phone in calgary canada thats organization kenner said they knew the phone number of the station in arizona before they ever started this thing why calgary evans said why from there that seems to be one primary location for this group kenner said sarah looked at the clouds the jet was above the weather the sun was setting a golden band in the west the view was serene the events of the day seemed to have occurred months before years before she looked down at her chest and saw the faint brownish markings from the lightning shed taken an aspirin but it was still beginning to hurt slightly to burn she felt marked a marked woman she no longer listened to what the men were saying only to the sound of their voices she noticed that evanss voice had lost its boyish hesitancy he was no longer protesting everything kenner said he sounded older somehow more mature more solid after a while he came up to sit with her you mind company no she gestured to a seat he dropped into it wincing slightly he said you feel okay im okay you a little sore well very sore i think i got banged around in the car she nodded and looked out the window for a while then she turned back when were you going to tell me she said tell you what that you saved my life for the second time he shrugged i thought you knew i didnt she felt angry when she said it she didnt know why it should make her angry but it did maybe because now she felt a sense of obligation or ampor ampshe didnt know what she just felt angry sorry he said thanks she said glad to be of service he smiled got up and went to the back of the plane again it was odd she thought there was something about him some surprising quality she hadnt noticed before when she looked out the window again the sun had set the golden band was turning richer and darker to los angeles monday october pm in the back of the plane evans drank a martini and stared at the monitor mounted on the wall they had the satellite linkup of the news station in phoenix there were three anchors two men and a woman at a curved table the graphic behind their heads read killings in canyon country and apparently referred to the deaths of the men in flagstaff but evans had come in too late to hear the news theres other news from mckinley state park where a flash flood warning saved the lives of three hundred schoolchildren on a school picnic officer mike rodriguez told our own shelly stone what happened there followed a brief interview with the highway patrol officer who was suitably laconic neither kenner nor his team was mentioned then there was footage of evanss overturned suv smashed at the bottom of the cliff rodriguez explained that fortunately no one was in the car when it was carried away by the floodwater evans gulped his martini then the anchors came back onscreen and one of the men said flood advisories remain in effect even though it is unseasonable for this time of year looks like the weathers changing the anchorwoman said tossing her hair yes marla there is no question the weather is changing and here with that story is our own johnny rivera they cut to a younger man apparently the weatherman thanks terry hi everybody if youre a longtime resident of the grand canyon state youve probably noticed that our weather is changing and scientists have confirmed that whats behind it is our old culprit global warming todays flash flood is just one example of the trouble aheadmore extreme weather conditions like floods and tornadoes and droughtsall as a result of global warming sanjong nudged evans and handed him a sheet of paper it was a printout of a press release from the nerf website sanjong pointed to the text ampscientists agree there will be trouble ahead more extreme weather events like floods and tornadoes and drought all as a result of global warming evans said this guys just reading a press release thats how they do it these days kenner said they dont even bother to change a phrase here and there they just read the copy outright and of course what hes saying is not true then whats causing the increase in extreme weather around the world evans said there is no increase in extreme weather thats been studied repeatedly the studies show no increase in extreme weather events over the past century or in the last fifteen years and the gcms dont predict more extreme weather if anything global warming theory predicts less extreme weather so hes just full of shit evans said right and so is the press release onscreen the weatherman was saying is becoming so bad that the latest news isget thisglaciers on greenland are melting away and will soon vanish entirely those glaciers are three miles thick folks thats a lotta ice a new study estimates sea levels will rise twenty feet or more so sell that beach property now evans said what about that one it was on the news in la yesterday i wouldnt call it news kenner said scientists at reading ran computer simulations that suggested that greenland might lose its ice pack in the next thousand years thousand years evans said might evans pointed to the television he didnt say it could happen a thousand years from now imagine that kenner said he left that out but you said it isnt news amp you tell me kenner said do you spend much time worrying about what might happen a thousand years from now no think anybody should no there you are when he had finished his drink he suddenly felt sleepy his body ached however he shifted in his seat something hurthis back his legs his hips he was bruised and exhausted and a little tipsy he closed his eyes thinking of news reports of events a thousand years in the future all reported as if it were uptotheminute important lifeanddeath news a thousand years from now his eyes were heavy his head fell to his chest then jerked up abruptly as the intercom came on fasten your seat belts the captain said we are landing in van nuys van nuys monday october pm all he wanted to do was sleep but when he landed he checked his cell phone messages and discovered that he had been missed to put it mildly mr evans this is eleanor in nicholas drakes office you left your cell phone i have it for you and mr drake would like to speak to you peter its jennifer haynes at john balders office wed like you to come to the office no later than ten oclock tomorrow please its quite important call me if for some reason you cant make it see you then peter call me its margo im out of the hospital mr evans this is ron perry at the beverly hills police department youve missed your four oclock appointment to dictate a statement i dont want to issue a warrant for your arrest call me you have the number this is herb lowenstein where the hell are you we dont hire junior associates to have them disappear day after day there is work to be done here balders office has been calling they want you at the culver city office tomorrow morning by ten am sharp my advice is be there or start looking for another job mr evans this is ron perry from beverly hills police please return my call asap peter call me margo peter want to get together tonight its janis call me mr evans i have mr drake for you at the nerf office peter its lisa in mr lowensteins office the police have been calling for you i thought you would want to know peter its margo when i call my lawyer i expect to get a call back dont be an asshole call me this is ron perry from the beverly hills police department if i do not hear from you i will have to ask the judge to issue a warrant for your arrest evans its herb lowenstein you really are a dumb shit the police are going to issue a warrant for your arrest deal with it at once members of this firm do not get arrested evans sighed and hung up sarah said trouble no but it doesnt look like i will be getting any sleep for a while he called the detective ron perry and was told that perry was gone for the day and would be in court in the morning his cell phone would be off evans left a number for him to call back he called drake but he was gone for the day he called lowenstein but he was not in the office he called margo but she did not answer he called jennifer haynes and said that he would be there tomorrow at ten oclock dress professionally she said why youre going to be on television culver city tuesday october am there were two white camera trucks parked outside the offices of the vanutu litigation team evans went inside and found workmen setting up lights and changing fluorescent light bulbs in the ceiling four different video crews were walking around inspecting different angles but nobody was shooting yet the offices themselves he noticed had been considerably transformed the graphs and charts on the walls were now much more complicated and technical looking there were huge blowup photographs of the pacific nation of vanutu as seen from the air and from the ground several featured the erosion of the beaches and houses leaning at an angle ready to slide into the water there was a school picture from the vanutu school beautiful brownskinned kids with smiling faces in the center of the room there was a threedimensional model of the main island specially lit for cameras jennifer was wearing a skirt and blouse and heels she looked startlingly beautiful in a dark mysterious way evans noticed that everyone was better dressed than at his first visit all the researchers were now in jackets and ties the jeans and tshirts were gone and there seemed to be a lot more researchers so evans said what is this about broll jennifer said were shooting broll for the stations to use as background and cutaways and of course were making a video press kit as well but you havent announced the lawsuit yet that happens this afternoon here outside the warehouse press conference at one pm youll be there of course well i didnt i know john balder wants you there representing george morton evans felt uneasy this could create a political problem for him at the firm there are several attorneys more senior than i who handled georges drake specifically asked for you he did something about your involvement in getting the papers signed to finance this suit so that was it evans thought they were putting him on television so he would not be able later to say anything about the gift of ten million dollars to nerf no doubt they would stick him in the background for the announcement ceremony maybe make a brief acknowledgment of his presence then drake would say that the ten million was coming and unless evans stood up and contradicted him his silence would be taken as acquiescence later if he developed any qualms they could say but you were there evans why didnt you speak up then i see evans said you look worried i am amp let me tell you something she said dont worry about it but you dont even know just listen to me dont worry about it she was looking directly into his eyes okay amp of course she meant well but despite her words evans was experiencing an unpleasant sinking feeling the police were threatening to issue a warrant for his arrest the firm was complaining about his absences now this effort to force him into silenceby putting him on television he said why did you want me here so early we need you to sit in the hot seat again as part of our test for jury selection im sorry i cant yes you have to same thing as before want some coffee sure you look tired lets get you to hair and makeup half an hour later he was back in the deposition room at the end of the long table there was again a crew of eager young scientific types looking down at him today jennifer said we would like to consider issues of global warming and land use are you familiar with this only slightly evans said jennifer nodded to one of the researchers at the far end raimundo will you give him the background the researcher had a heavy accent but evans could follow him it is well known he said that changes in land use will cause changes in average ground temperature cities are hotter than the surrounding countrysidewhat is called the urban heat island effect croplands are warmer than forested lands and so on uhhuh evans said nodding he hadnt heard about these land use concepts but it certainly stood to reason raimundo continued a high percentage of weather stations that were out in the countryside forty years ago are now surrounded by concrete and skyscrapers and asphalt and so on which makes them register warmer i understand evans said he glanced away through the glass wall he saw film crews moving around the warehouse shooting various things he hoped the crews wouldnt come in he didnt want to sound stupid in front of them these facts raimundo said are well known within the field so researchers take the raw temperature data from stations near cities and reduce them by some amount to compensate for the urban heat island effect evans said and how is this reduction calculated different ways depending on who does it but most algorithms are based on population size the larger the population the greater the reduction evans shrugged that sounds like the right way to do it unfortunately he said it probably isnt do you know about vienna it was studied by bohm a few years back vienna has had no increase in population since but it has more than doubled its energy use and increased living space substantially the urban heat island effect has increased but the calculated reduction is unchanged because it only looks at population change so the heating from cities is being underestimated evans said its worse than that jennifer said it used to be assumed that urban heating was unimportant because the urban heat island effect was only a fraction of total warming the planet warmed about degrees celsius in the last thirty years cities are typically assumed to have heated by around degree celsius yes so so those assumptions are wrong the chinese report that shanghai warmed degree celsius in the last twenty years alone thats more than the total global warming of the planet in the last hundred years and shanghai is not unique houston increased degrees celsius in the last twelve years cities in south korea are heating rapidly manchester england is now degrees warmer than the surrounding countryside even small towns are much hotter than the surrounding areas jennifer reached for her charts anyway she said the point is that the graphs you see are not raw data they have already been adjusted with fudge factors to compensate for urban heating but probably not enough at that moment the door opened and one of the four video crews came in their camera light shining without hesitation jennifer reached for some charts and brought them up she whispered broll is silent so we need to be active and provide visuals she turned toward the camera and said let me show you some examples of weather station data here for instance is a record of the average temperature for pasadena since pasadena ca as you see jennifer said a dramatic rise in temperature and here is berkeley since berkeley ca a surprisingly incomplete record but we are using raw data so you can see missing years and you see a clear warming trend indisputable wouldnt you agree i would evans said thinking that it wasnt much of a trendless than a degree now here is death valley one of the hottest driest places on earth no urbanization has occurred here again missing years death valley ca evans said nothing it must be an anomaly he thought jennifer put up more graphs mcgill nv guthrie ok these are stations from the nevada desert and the oklahoma plains she said they show temperatures that are flat or declining and not only rural areas here is boulder colorado its only of interest because ncar is located therethe national center for atmospheric research where so much global warming research is done boulder co here are some more small cities truman missouri where the buck stops amp truman mo greenville sc ann arbor mi evans said well you have to admit its not very dramatic im not sure what you consider dramatic truman has gotten colder by degrees greenville by degrees ann arbor by one degree since if the globe is warming these places have been left out lets look at some bigger places evans said like charleston i happen to have charleston she thumbed through her graphs charleston sc evans said so a bigger city gets warmer what about new york i have several records from new york city and state new york ny syracuse ny albany ny oswego ny as you see jennifer said new york city is warmer but many other parts of the state from oswego to albany have become colder since evans was acutely aware of the cameras on him he nodded in what he hoped was a judicious thoughtful manner and said and where does this data come from from the historical climatology network data set she said its a government dataset maintained at oak ridge national laboratories well evans said its quite interesting however id like to see the data from europe and asia this is after all a global phenomenon certainly jennifer said she too was playing to the cameras but before we do that id like your reaction to the data so far as you can see many places in the united states do not seem to have become warmer since im sure you cherrypicked your data evans said to some degree as we can be sure the defense will do but the results do not surprise me evans said weather varies locally it always has and always will a thought occurred to him by the way why are all these graphs since temperature records go much further back than that your point is well taken jennifer said nodding it definitely makes a difference how far back you go for example amp west point ny here is west point new york from to trending down and amp west point ny here is west point from to this time the trend is up not down ahha evans said so you were massaging the data you picked the interval of years that made you look good absolutely jennifer said nodding but the trick only works because temperatures in many parts of the us were warmer in the s than they are today its still a trick yes it is the defense will not miss the opportunity to show the jury numerous examples of this trick from environmental fundraising literature selecting specific years that appear to show things are getting worse evans registered her insult to environmental groups in that case he said lets not permit any tricks at all use the full and complete temperature record how far back does it go at west point back to okay then suppose you use that evans felt confident proposing this because it was well known that a worldwide warming trend had begun at about every place in the world had gotten warmer since then and the graph from west point would reflect that jennifer seemed to know it too because she suddenly appeared very hesitant turning away thumbing through her stack of graphs frowning as if she couldnt find it you dont have that particular graph do you evans said no no believe me i have it yes here and then she pulled it out west point ny evans took one look and saw that she had sandbagged him as you predicted this graph is quite telling she said for the last one hundred seventyfour years there has been no change in the average temperature at west point it was degrees fahrenheit in and it is degrees in but thats just one record evans said recovering quickly one of many one of hundreds thousands youre saying that other records will show other trends im sure they will especially using the full record from and you are correct she said different records do show different trends evans sat back satisfied with himself hands crossed over his chest new york ny new york city a rise of degrees fahrenheit in a hundred seventyeight years albany ny albany a decline of half a degree in a hundred eighty years evans shrugged local variations as i said before but i wonder jennifer said how these local variations fit into a theory of global warming as i understand it global warming is caused by an increase in socalled greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide that trap heat in the earths atmosphere and prevent it from escaping into space is that your understanding yes evans said grateful he did not have to summon a definition on his own so according to the theory jennifer said the atmosphere itself gets warmer just as it would inside a greenhouse yes and these greenhouse gases affect the entire planet yes and we know that carbon dioxidethe gas we all worry abouthas increased the same amount everywhere in the world amp she pulled out another graph co levels yes amp and its effect is presumably the same everywhere in the world thats why its called global warming yes amp but new york and albany are only a hundred forty miles apart you can drive between them in three hours their carbon dioxide levels are identical yet one got a lot warmer and the other got slightly colder is that evidence for global warming weather is local evans said some places are warmer or colder than others and always will be but we are talking about climate not weather climate is weather over a long time period yes amp so i would agree with you if both locations got warmer albeit by different amounts but here one got warmer and one got colder and as we saw west pointwhich is midway between themremained unchanged evans said i think the theory of global warming predicts that some places will get colder really why is that im not sure but i read it somewhere the earths entire atmosphere warms and as a result some places get colder i believe so as you think about it now does that claim make sense to you no evans said but you know climate is a complex system which means what to you it means its uh complicated it doesnt always behave the way you think it will thats certainly true jennifer said but going back to new york and albany the fact that these two locations are so close yet their temperature records are so different could lead a jury to wonder whether were really measuring something other than a global effect you would agree that in the last hundred eightyfive years new york has grown to a city of eight million whereas albany has grown much less yes evans said and we know that the urban heat island effect makes cities hotter than the surrounding countryside yes amp and this urban heat effect is a local effect unrelated to global warming yes amp so tell me how do you know that the dramatic increase in temperature in new york is caused by global warming and not just from an excess of concrete and skyscrapers well evans hesitated i dont know the answer to that but i assume it is known because if cities like new york become larger and hotter than they were before they will raise the average global temperature will they not i assume they will in which case as cities expand all around the world we might see an increase in average ground temperature simply because of urbanization without any global atmospheric effect at all i am sure the scientists have thought of that already evans said im sure they can answer that yes they can their answer is that they have subtracted a factor from the raw data to compensate for the urban heat effect well there you are excuse me mr evans youre a lawyer surely you are aware of the extraordinary efforts that are made in a lawsuit to be certain the evidence is untainted yes but you dont want anybody to be able to change it yes amp but in this case the evidence is the raw temperature data and it is tainted by the very scientists who claim global warming is a worldwide crisis tainted its adjusted downward but the question the defense will ask is have they adjusted downward enough i dont know evans said this is getting very specialized and nitpicky hardly its a core issue urbanization versus greenhouse gases as the cause of the increased average surface temperature and the defense will have a good argument on their side jennifer said as i said before several recent studies suggest the reduction for urban bias has in fact been too small at least one study suggests that half of the observed temperature change comes from land use alone if thats true then global warming in the past century is less than three tenths of a degree not exactly a crisis evans said nothing he tried to look intelligent for the cameras of course jennifer continued that study can be debated too but the point remains as soon as anybody adjusts the data they open themselves to the claim that their adjustment was incorrect thats better ground for the defense and the larger point the defense will make is that we have allowed the data to be adjusted by the very people who have the most to gain from that adjustment youre saying that climate scientists are unethical im saying it is never a good policy for the fox to guard the hen house such procedures are never allowed in medicine for example where doubleblind experimental designs are required so youre saying climate scientists are unethical no im saying that there are good reasons why doubleblind procedures are instituted look every scientist has some idea of how his experiment is going to turn out otherwise he wouldnt do the experiment in the first place he has an expectation but expectation works in mysterious waysand totally unconsciously do you know any of the studies of scientific bias no evans shook his head okay simple example a group of genetically identical rats are sent to two different labs for testing one lab is told that the rats were bred for intelligence and will run a maze faster than normal the other lab is told that the rats are dumb and will run a maze slowly results come backfaster in one lab slower in the other yet the rats are genetically identical okay so they fudged they said they didnt anyway theres much more she said next example a group of survey takers are told look we know that pollsters can influence results in subtle ways we want to avoid that so you knock on the door and the minute someone answers you start reading only what is on this card hello i am doing a survey and i am reading from this card in order not to influence you ampet cetera the poll takers say nothing except what is on the card one group of pollsters is told this questionnaire will get seventy percent positive answers they tell another group you can expect thirty percent positive answers identical questionnaires the results come backseventy and thirty how evans said it doesnt matter she said all that matters is that hundreds of studies prove again and again that expectations determine outcome people find what they think theyll find thats the reason for doubleblind experiments to eliminate bias the experiment is divided up among different people who do not know each other the people who prepare the experiment do not know the people who conduct the experiment or the people who analyze the results these groups never communicate in any way their spouses and children never meet the groups are in different universities and preferably in different countries thats how new drugs are tested because thats the only way to prevent bias from creeping in okay amp so now were talking about temperature data it has to be adjusted in all kinds of ways not just for urban heat bias lots of other things stations move they upgrade and the new equipment may read hotter or colder than before the equipment malfunctions and you have to decide whether to throw out certain data you deal with lots of judgment calls in putting together the temperature record and thats where the bias creeps in possibly possibly you dont know jennifer said but whenever you have one team doing all the jobs then youre at risk for bias if one team makes a model and also tests it and also analyzes the results those results are at risk they just are so the temperature data are no good the temperature data are suspect a decent attorney will tear them apart to defend them what we intend to do is abruptly the camera crew got up and left the room jennifer rested her hand on his arm dont worry about any of that the footage they shot was without sound i just wanted it to look like a lively discussion i feel foolish you looked good thats all that matters for tv no he said leaning closer to her i mean when i gave those answers i wasnt saying what i really think im uh ampim asking someim changing my mind about a lot of this stuff really yes he said speaking quietly those graphs of temperature for instance they raise obvious questions about the validity of global warming she nodded slowly looking at him closely he said you too she continued to nod they lunched at the same mexican restaurant as before it was almost empty as before the same sony film editors laughing at the corner table they must come here every day evans thought but somehow everything was different and not just because his body ached and he was on the verge of falling asleep any moment evans felt as if he had become a different person and their relationship was different too jennifer ate quietly not saying much evans had the sense she was waiting for him after a while he said you know it would be crazy to imagine that global warming wasnt a real phenomenon crazy she said nodding i mean the whole world believes it yes she said the whole world does but in that war room we think only about the jury and the defense will have a field day with the jury you mean the example you told me oh its much worse than that we expect the defense to argue like this ladies and gentlemen of the jury youve all heard the claim that something called global warming is occurring because of an increase in carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere but what you havent been told is that carbon dioxide has increased by only a tiny amount theyll show you a graph of increasing carbon dioxide that looks like the slope of mount everest but heres the reality carbon dioxide has increased from parts per million to parts per million sixty parts per million is the total increase now thats such a small change in our entire atmosphere that it is hard to imagine how can we visualize that jennifer sat back swung her hand wide next theyll bring out a chart showing a football field and theyll say imagine the composition of the earths atmosphere as a football field most of the atmosphere is nitrogen so starting from the goal line nitrogen takes you all the way to the seventyeightyard line and most of whats left is oxygen oxygen takes you to the ninetynineyard line only one yard to go but most of what remains is the inert gas argon argon brings you within three and a half inches of the goal line thats pretty much the thickness of the chalk stripe folks and how much of that remaining three inches is carbon dioxide one inch thats how much co we have in our atmosphere one inch in a hundredyard football field she paused dramatically then continued now ladies and gentlemen of the jury she said you are told that carbon dioxide has increased in the last fifty years do you know how much it has increased on our football field it has increased by threeeighths of an inchless than the thickness of a pencil its a lot more carbon dioxide but its a minuscule change in our total atmosphere yet you are asked to believe that this tiny change has driven the entire planet into a dangerous warming pattern evans said but thats easily answered wait she said theyre not done first raise doubts then offer alternative explanations so now they take out that temperature chart for new york city that you saw before a fivedegree increase since and they say back in the population of new york was a hundred twenty thousand today its eight million the city has grown by six thousand percent to say nothing of all those skyscrapers and airconditioning and concrete now i ask you is it reasonable to believe that a city that has grown by six thousand percent is hotter because of a tiny increase in little old carbon dioxide around the world or is it hotter because it is now much much bigger she sat back in her chair but its easy to counter that argument evans said there are many examples of small things that produce big effects a trigger represents a small part of a gun but its enough to fire it and anyway the preponderance of the evidence peter she said shaking her head if you were on the jury and you were asked that question about new york city what would you conclude global warming or too much concrete what do you think anyway i think its probably hotter because its a big city right but you still have the sealevel argument unfortunately she said the sea levels at vanutu are not significantly elevated depending on the database either theyre flat or theyve increased by forty millimeters half an inch in thirty years almost nothing then you cant possibly win this case evans said exactly she said although i have to say your trigger argument is a nice one if you cant win evans said then what is this press conference about thank you all for coming john balder said stepping up to a cluster of microphones outside the offices photographers strobes flashed i am john balder and standing with me is nicholas drake the president of the national environmental resource fund here also is jennifer haynes my lead counsel and peter evans of the law firm of hassle and black together we are announcing that we will be filing a lawsuit against the environmental protection agency of the united states on behalf of the island nation of vanutu in the pacific standing in the back peter evans started to bite his lip then thought better of it no reason to make a facial expression that might be construed as nervous the impoverished people of vanutu balder said stand to become even more impoverished by the greatest environmental threat of our times global warming and the danger of abrupt climate changes that will surely follow evans recalled that just a few days before drake had called abrupt climate change a possibility on the horizon now it had been transformed into a certainty in less than a week balder spoke in vivid terms about how the people of vanutu were being flooded out of their ancestral homeland emphasizing the tragedy of young children whose heritage was washing away in raging surf caused by a callous industrial giant to the north it is a matter of justice for the people of vanutu and of the future of the entire world now threatened by abrupt weather that were announcing this lawsuit today then he opened the floor to questions the first one was when exactly are you filing this lawsuit the issue is technically complex balder said right now we have in our offices forty research scientists working on our behalf day and night when they have finished their labors we will make our filing for injunctive relief where will you file in los angeles federal district court what damages are you asking another said what is the administrations response will the court hear it the questions were coming quickly now and balder was in his element evans glanced over at jennifer standing on the other side of the podium she tapped her watch evans nodded then looked at his own watch made a face and exited the podium jennifer was right behind him they went inside the warehouse and past the guards and evans stared in amazement culver city tuesday october pm the lights were turned down most of the people evans had seen earlier were gone the rooms were being stripped the furniture stacked up the documents packed into legal storage boxes movers were carrying out stacks of boxes on rolling dollies evans said whats going on our lease is up jennifer said so youre moving she shook her head no were leaving what do you mean i mean were leaving peter looking for new jobs this litigation is no longer being actively pursued over a loudspeaker they heard balder say we fully expect to seek an injunction within the next three months i have complete confidence in the forty brilliant men and women who are assisting us in this groundbreaking case evans stepped back as movers carried a table past him it was the same table he had been interviewed at just three hours before another mover followed lugging boxes of video equipment how is this going to work evans said hearing balder over the loudspeaker i mean people are going to know whats happening amp whats happening is perfectly logical jennifer said we will file a request for a preliminary injunction our pleading has to work its way through the system we expect it will be rejected by the district court for jurisdiction so we will take it to the ninth circuit and then we expect to go to the supreme court the litigation cannot proceed until the issue of injunction is resolved which could take several years therefore we sensibly put our large research staff on hold and close our expensive offices while we wait with a skeleton legal team in place is there a skeleton team in place no but you asked how it would be handled evans watched as the boxes rolled out the back door nobody ever intended to file this lawsuit did they lets put it this way she said balder has a remarkable winning record in the courtroom theres only one way to build a record like thatyou dump the losers long before you ever get to trial so hes dumping this one yeah because i guarantee you no court is going to grant injunctive relief for excess carbon dioxide production by the american economy she pointed to the loudspeaker drake got him to emphasize abrupt climate change that nicely dovetails with drakes conference which starts tomorrow yes but look she said you know as well as i do that the whole purpose of this case was to generate publicity theyve got their press conference theres no need to pursue it further she was asked by movers where to put things evans wandered back into the interrogation room and saw the stack of foam core graphs in the corner he had wanted to see the ones she hadnt shown him so he pulled a few out they showed foreign weather stations around the world alice springs australia clyde nwt christchurch nz kamenskoe siberia of course he knew that these particular charts had been chosen to prove the oppositions point so they showed little or no warming but still it troubled him that there should be so many like these from all around the world he saw a stack marked europe and shuffled through them quickly rome italy paris le bourget milanolinate stuttgart germany navacerrada spain gцteborg sweden there was another stack marked asia he flipped through it choshi japan lahore city pakistan takayama japan tokyo japan peter she was calling him her own office was already packed up she had only a few boxes of things he helped her carry them out to her car so he said whatre you doing now going back to dc and your boyfriend i dont think so she said then what actually i thought id go with you with me youre working with john kenner arent you evans said how did you know that she just smiled heading out the back door they heard the loudspeaker from the conference drake was talking now thanking the press for coming urging them to attend his forthcoming conference and saying that the real danger from global warming was its potential for abrupt climate change and then he said excuse me but i regret to say i have an extremely sad announcement to make i have just been handed a note that says the body of my dear friend george morton has just been found culver city tuesday october pm the full story was on the news that afternoon the body of millionaire financier george morton had washed up on the shore near pismo beach the identification was made from clothing and from a watch on the victims wrist the body itself was mutilated the result of shark attacks the newscaster said the family of the philanthropist had been notified but no date for the memorial service had been set there was a statement from mortons close friend nicholas drake director of nerf drake said that morton had devoted his life to the environmental movement and to the work of organizations like nerf which had just recently named him their concerned citizen of the year if anyone was concerned about the terrible changes that are taking place around our globe it was george morton drake said ever since we learned he was missing we have been hoping against hope that he would be found in good spirits and good health i am saddened to learn that this is not the case i mourn the loss of my dear and dedicated friend the world is poorer without him evans was driving when lowenstein called him on the car phone whatre you doing coming back from the press conference i was ordered to attend well youre going to san francisco why mortons been found somebody has to identify the body what about his daughter shes in rehab what about his exwife what about evans youre officially assigned make your arrangements the forensic guys dont want to delay the autopsy so they need him idd before dinner but get your ass up there i dont know what youre bitching about take the guys plane for christs sake youve certainly been helping yourself to it lately from what i hear now that hes dead youd better be more careful oh one more thing since youre not family theyll need two people to id him well i can take sarah his secretary no drake wants you to take ted bradley why how the hell do i know bradley wants to go drake wants to indulge him keep him happy bradley probably thinks therell be news cameras there he is an actor after all and he was georges close friend sort of he was at the banquet table with you but sarah would be evans what part of this do you not understand youre going to san francisco and you are taking bradley with you period evans sighed where is he hes in sequoia you have to stop and get him sequoia national park its on the way but bradleys already been notified my secretary will give you the number for the san francisco morgue goodbye evans dont screw up click jennifer said problem no but i have to go to san francisco ill come with you she said who is sarah mortons personal secretary his old assistant ive seen pictures of her jennifer said she doesnt look very old where did you see pictures in a magazine they were at a tennis tournament shes a championship tennis player something like that i guess i would have thought that since you spent so much time with morton youd know her well not really he said shrugging i mean weve spent a little time in the last few days uhhuh she looked at him amused peter she said i dont care shes very pretty its only natural no no he said reaching for the phone its nothing like that desperate to put an end to this conversation he dialed the beverly hills police and asked for detective perry the detective was not yet back from court evans left a message and hung up he turned to jennifer how does it work if they issue a warrant for your arrest criminal she said not my area sorry me neither somebody going to arrest you i hope not then lisa herb lowensteins chatty assistant called hi peter i have the numbers for mr bradley and for the san francisco morgue they close at eight can you make it by then herb wants to know hes very upset about what ive never seen him this way i mean not for a few weeks whats the matter i think hes upset about george such a shock and then drake is giving him fits he must have called five times today and i think they were discussing you me yes lisa lowered her voice taking on a conspiratorial tone herb had his door closed while he was talking but i uh i heard a few things like what evans said dont say anything i wont i mean i wasnti just thought that you would want to know i do because theres a lot of talk here she said dropping her voice even lower about whether you have to leave leave the firm be uh let go i thought you would want to know i do thanks whos talking well herb and don blandings and a couple of other senior partners bob and louise because for some reason nick drake is furious with you and somebody you are spending time with a person named kanner or connor i see mr drake is very upset about mr connor why is that he says he is a spy for industry for polluters i see anyway the feeling is mr drake is an important client and youve pissed him off even so they would never dare fire you if morton were alive but hes not anymore and youre gone all the time and the police are calling here for you which i have to tell you is not good it makes everybody nervous and then theywhat are you doing with this mr connor anyway its a long story peter i told you she sounded sulky he knew he would have to trade information okay he said trying to sound reluctant im carrying out an assignment that morton gave me before he died really what is it its a secret i cant tell you yet george morton gave you an assignment in writing he said thinking that will cool their jets wow really they dont dare fire you if youre on the business of the firm lisa i have to go and if they did you would have such a wrongful termination action lisa amp okay okay i know you cant talk but just ampgood luck he hung up jennifer was smiling that was very skillfully done she said thank you but he wasnt smiling back as far as he was concerned the world was closing in around him it didnt feel good and he was still very very tired he called sarah to arrange for the plane but got her voice mail he called the pilot and was told that he was in the air what do you mean hes flying right now where i cant tell you that sir would you like his voice mail no evans said i need to charter a plane when would you like it in half an hour to go to san francisco with a stop at whatever the airport is nearest sequoia returning tonight ill see what i can do and then fatigue overcame him he pulled over to the side of the road and got out of the car jennifer said whats the matter you know the way to van nuys sure then you drive he dropped into the passenger seat and fastened his seat belt he watched her pull into traffic and then closed his eyes and slept sequoia tuesday october pm the forest floor was dark and cool shafts of sunlight filtered down from the magnificent trees rising all around them the air smelled of pine the ground was soft underfoot it was a pleasant spot with sunlight dappling the forest floor but even so the television cameras had to turn on their lights to film the thirdgrade schoolchildren who sat in concentric circles around the famous actor and activist ted bradley bradley was wearing a black tshirt that set off his makeup and his dark good looks these glorious trees are your birthright he said gesturing all around him they have been standing here for centuries long before you were born before your parents or your grandparents or your greatgrandparents were born some of them before columbus came to america before the indians came before anything these trees are the oldest living things on the planet they are the guardians of the earth they are wise and they have a message for us leave the planet alone dont mess with it or with us and we must listen to them the kids stared openmouthed transfixed the cameras were trained on bradley but now these magnificent treeshaving survived the threat of fire the threat of logging the threat of soil erosion the threat of acid rainnow face their greatest threat ever global warming you kids know what global warming is dont you hands went up all around the circle i know i know im glad you do bradley said gesturing for the kids to put their hands down the only person talking today would be ted bradley but you may not know that global warming is going to cause a very sudden change in our climate maybe just a few months or years and it will suddenly be much hotter or much colder and there will be hordes of insects and diseases that will take down these wonderful trees what kind of insects one kid asked bad ones bradley said the ones that eat trees that worm inside them and chew them up he wiggled his hands suggesting the worming in progress it would take an insect a long time to eat a whole tree a girl offered no it wouldnt bradley said thats the trouble because global warming means lots and lots of insects will comea plague of insectsand theyll eat the trees fast standing to one side jennifer leaned close to evans do you believe this shit evans yawned he had slept on the flight up and had dozed off again in the ride from the airport to this grove in sequoia national park he felt groggy now looking at bradley groggy and bored by now the kids were fidgeting and bradley turned squarely to the cameras he spoke with the easy authority he had mastered while playing the president for so many years on television the threat of abrupt climate change he said is so devastating for mankind and for all life on this planet that conferences are being convened all around the world to deal with it there is a conference in los angeles starting tomorrow where scientists will discuss what we can do to mitigate this terrible threat but if we do nothing catastrophe looms and these mighty magnificent trees will be a memory a postcard from the past a snapshot of mans inhumanity to the natural world were responsible for catastrophic climate change and only we can stop it he finished with a slight turn to favor his good side and a piercing stare from his baby blues right into the lens i have to peepee one girl said the plane lifted off the runway and rose over the forest sorry to rush you evans said but we have to get to the morgue before six no problem no problem bradley smiled indulgently after his talk he had taken a few minutes to sign autographs for the kids the cameras filmed that as well he turned to jennifer giving her his best smile and what do you do miss hadley im on the global warming legal team good so youre one of us hows the lawsuit going just fine she said glancing at evans i get the feeling youre as brilliant as you are beautiful bradley said actually no she said evans could see that the actor was annoying her youre being modest its very charming im being honest she said and telling you i dont like flattery hardly flattery in your case he said and hardly honest in yours she replied believe me when i say that i genuinely admire what youre doing bradley said i cant wait for you people to stick it to the epa we have to keep the pressure on thats why i did this thing with the kids its a surefire television segment for abrupt climate change and i thought it went extremely well didnt you reasonably well considering considering that it was all bullshit jennifer said bradleys smile remained fixed but his eyes narrowed im not sure what youre referring to he said im referring to all of it ted the whole speech sequoias are sentinels and guardians of the planet they have a message for us well they do theyre trees ted big trees they have about as much of a message for mankind as an eggplant i think you are missing and theyve managed to survive forest fires hardlytheyre dependent on fires because thats how they reproduce redwoods have tough seeds that only burst open in the heat of a fire fires are essential for the health of the redwood forest i think bradley said rather stiffly that you may have missed my point really what did i miss i was trying to conveyperhaps a bit lyricallythe timeless quality of these great primeval forests and timeless primeval do you know anything about these forests yes i think i do his voice was tight he was visibly angry now look out the window jennifer said pointing to the forest as they flew above it how long do you think your primeval forest has looked the way it does now obviously for hundreds of thousands of years not true ted human beings were here for many thousands of years before these forests ever appeared did you know that he was clenching his jaw he did not answer then let me lay it out for you she said twenty thousand years ago the ice age glaciers receded from california gouging out yosemite valley and other beauty spots as they left as the ice walls withdrew they left behind a gunky damp plain with lots of lakes fed by the melting glaciers but no vegetation at all it was basically wet sand after a few thousand years the land dried as the glaciers continued to move farther north this region of california became arctic tundra with tall grasses supporting little animals like mice and squirrels human beings had arrived here by then hunting the small animals and setting fires okay so far jennifer said no primeval forests yet im listening ted growled he was clearly trying to control his temper she continued at first arctic grasses and shrubs were the only plants that could take hold in the barren glacial soil but when they died they decomposed and over thousands of years a layer of topsoil built up and that initiated a sequence of plant colonization that was basically the same everywhere in postglacial north america first lodgepole pine comes in thats around fourteen thousand years ago later its joined by spruce hemlock and aldertrees that are hardy but cant be first these trees constitute the real primary forest and they dominated this landscape for the next four thousand years then the climate changed it got much warmer and all the glaciers in california melted there were no glaciers at all in california back then it was warm and dry there were lots of fires and the primary forest burned it was replaced by a plainstype vegetation of oak trees and prairie herbs and a few douglas fir trees but not many because the climate was too dry for fir trees then around six thousand years ago the climate changed again it became wetter and the douglas fir hemlock and cedar moved in and took over the land creating the great closedcanopy forests that you see now but someone might refer to these fir trees as a pest plantan oversized weedthat invaded the landscape crowding out the native plants that had been there before them because these big canopy forests made the ground too dark for other trees to survive and since there were frequent fires the closedcanopy forests were able to spread like mad so theyre not timeless ted theyre merely the last in line bradley snorted theyre still six thousand years old for gods sake but jennifer was relentless not true she said scientists have shown that the forests continuously changed their composition each thousandyear period was different from the one before it the forests changed constantly ted and then of course there were the indians what about them the indians were expert observers of the natural world so they realized that oldgrowth forests sucked those forests may look impressive but theyre dead landscapes for game so the indians set fires making sure the forests burned down periodically they made sure there were only islands of oldgrowth forest in the midst of plains and meadows the forests that the first europeans saw were hardly primeval they were cultivated ted and its not surprising that one hundred fifty years ago there was less oldgrowth forest than there is today the indians were realists today its all romantic mythology she sat back in her chair well thats a very nice speech bradley said but those are technical objections people arent interested and its a good thing because youre saying that these forests arent really old and therefore arent worth preserving whereas i say they are reminders of the beauty and power of the natural world and should be preserved at all costs especially from the dire threat of global warming jennifer blinked she said i need a drink ill join you there bradley said for evanswho had intermittently been attempting to call detective perry while this discussion was taking placethe most disturbing aspect was the implication of constant change evans had never really focused on the idea that indians had lived at the same time as the glaciers of course he knew that this was true he knew that early indians had hunted the mammoth and other large mammals to extinction but he had never considered the possibility that they would also have burned forests and changed the environment to suit their purposes but of course they had equally disturbing was the image of so many different forests taking over one after another evans had never wondered what had existed before the redwood forests he too had considered them primeval nor had he ever thought about the landscape that the glaciers would have left behind thinking about it now he realized that it probably looked like the land he had recently seen in icelandcold wet rocky and barren it stood to reason that generations of plants would have to grow there building up a layer of topsoil but in his mind he had always imagined a sort of animated movie in which the glaciers receded and redwood trees popped up immediately along the receding edge the glaciers pulled away leaving redwood forest behind he realized now how silly that view had been and evans had also noticed in passing how frequently jennifer had spoken of a changing climate first it was cold and wet then it was warm and dry and the glaciers melted then it was wetter again and the glaciers came back changing and changing again constant change after a while bradley excused himself and went to the front of the plane to call his agent evans said to jennifer how did you know all that stuff for the reason bradley himself mentioned the dire threat of global warming we had a whole team researching dire threats because we wanted to find everything we could to make our case as impressive as possible and she shook her head the threat of global warming she said is essentially nonexistent even if it were a real phenomenon it would probably result in a net benefit to most of the world the pilot clicked on the intercom telling them to take their seats because they were on their final approach to san francisco san francisco tuesday october pm the anteroom was gray cold and smelled of disinfectant the man behind the desk wore a lab coat he typed at his keyboard morton ampmorton ampyes george morton okay and you are amp peter evans im mr mortons attorney evans said and im ted bradley ted said he started to extend his hand then thought better of it pulled it back oh hey the technician said i thought you looked familiar youre the secretary of state actually im the president right right the president i knew id seen you before your wife is a drunk no actually the secretary of states wife is a drunk oh i dont get to see the show that often its off the air now that explains it but its in syndication in all the major markets evans said if we could make the identification now amp okay sign here and ill get you visitor tags jennifer remained in the anteroom evans and bradley walked into the morgue bradley looked back who is she anyway shes an attorney working on the global warming team i think shes a plant for industry shes obviously some kind of extremist she works right under balder ted well i can understand that bradley said snickering id like her working under me too but did you listen to her for gods sake oldgrowth forests suck thats industry talking he leaned closer to evans i think you should get rid of her get rid of her shes up to no good why is she with us now anyway i dont know she wanted to come why are you with us ted i have a job to do the sheet draping the body was spotted with gray stains the technician lifted it back oh jesus ted bradley said turning quickly away evans forced himself to gaze at the body morton had been a large man in life and now he was even larger his torso purple gray and bloated the odor of decay was strong indenting the puffy flesh was an inchwide ring around one wrist evans said the watch yeah we took it off the technician said barely got it over the hand you need to see it yes i do evans leaned closer and stiffened his body against the smell he wanted to look at the hands and the nails morton had had a childhood injury to the fourth nail on his right hand leaving the nail dented deformed but one of the hands of this body was missing and the other was gnawed and mangled there was no way he could be sure of what he was seeing behind him bradley said are you done yet not quite jesus man the technician said so will the show go back on the air no its been canceled why i liked that show they should have consulted you bradley said evans was looking at the chest now trying to recall the pattern of chest hair that morton had had hed seen him often enough in a bathing suit but the bloating the stretching of the skin made it difficult he shook his head he could not be sure it was morton are you done yet bradley said yes evans said the drape went back on and they walked out the technician said lifeguards in pismo made the discovery called the police the police idd him from the clothes he still had clothes on uhhuh one leg of the pants and most of the jacket custom made they called the tailor in new york and he confirmed that they had been made for george morton will you be taking his effects with you i dont know evans said well youre his lawyer amp yes i guess i will you have to sign for them they went back outside where jennifer was waiting she was talking on her cell phone she said yes i understand yes okay we can do that she flipped the phone shut when she saw them finished yes and was it amp yes ted said it was george evans said nothing he went down the hall and signed for the personal effects the technician brought out a bag and handed it to evans evans fished in it and pulled out the shreds of the tuxedo there was a small nerf pin on the inside pocket of the jacket he reached in and came out with the watch a rolex submariner it was the same watch morton wore evans looked at the back it was engraved gm evans nodded put it back in the bag all these things belonged to george just touching them now made him feel inexpressibly sad i guess that does it he said time to go they all walked back to the waiting car after they got in jennifer said we have to make another stop oh evans said yes we have to go to the oakland municipal garage why the police are waiting for us oakland tuesday october pm it was an enormous concrete structure adjacent to a vast parking lot on the outskirts of oakland it was lit by harsh halogen lights behind the cyclone fence most of the cars in the lot were junkers but a few cadillacs and bentleys were there too their limousine pulled up to the curb why are we here bradley said i dont understand a policeman came to the window mr evans peter evans thats me come this way please they all started to get out of the car the cop said just mr evans bradley sputtered but we are sorry sir they just want mr evans youll have to wait here jennifer smiled at bradley ill keep you company great evans got out of the car and followed the policeman through the metal door into the garage itself the interior space was divided into long bays where cars were worked on in a row most of the bays seemed to be given over to the repair of police cars evans smelled the sharp odor of acetylene torches he sidestepped patches of motor oil and gobs of grease on the floor he said to the cop accompanying him whats this about theyre waiting for you sir they were heading for the rear of the garage they passed several crushed and bloodcovered wrecks seats drenched in blood shattered windows dark red some wrecks had pieces of string that stretched out from them in various directions one wreck was being measured by a pair of technicians in blue lab coats another crash was being photographed by a man with a camera on a tripod is he a policeman evans said nah lawyer we have to let em in so you deal with car wrecks here when its appropriate they came around the corner and evans saw kenner standing with three plainclothes policemen and two workers in blue lab coats they were all standing around the crushed body of mortons ferrari spyder now raised on a hydraulic lift with bright lights shining up at it ah peter kenner said did you make the identification of george yes good man evans came forward to stand beneath the car various sections of the underside had been marked with yellow cloth tags evans said okay whats up the plainclothesmen looked at one another then one of them began to speak weve been examining this ferrari mr evans i see that this is the car that mr morton recently bought in monterey i believe so when was that purchase made i dont know exactly evans tried to think back not long ago last month or so his assistant sarah told me george had bought it who bought it she did what was your involvement i had none she merely informed me that george had bought a car you didnt make the purchase or arrange insurance anything like that no all that would have been done by georges accountants you never saw paperwork on the car no and when did you first see the actual car itself the night george drove it away from the mark hopkins hotel evans said the night he died did you ever see the car prior to that evening no did you hire anyone to work on the car no the car was transported from monterey to a private garage in sonoma where it remained for two weeks before being taken to san francisco did you arrange the private garage no the rental was in your name evans shook his head i dont know anything about that he said but morton often put rentals and leases in the name of his accountants or attorneys if he didnt want the owner or lessee to be publicly known but if he did that he would inform you not necessarily so you didnt know your name was being used no who worked on the car in san jose i have no idea because mr evans somebody did rather extensive work on this ferrari before morton ever got into it the frame was weakened at the places you see marked by the yellow tags antiskidprimitive in a vehicle this oldwas disabled and the discs were crossloosened on the left front right rear are you following me here evans frowned this car was a death trap mr evans someone used it to kill your client lethal changes were made in a garage in sonoma and your name is on the lease downstairs in the car ted bradley was grilling jennifer haynes she might be pretty but everything about her was wrongher manner her toughguy attitude and most of all her opinions she had said she was working on the lawsuit and that her salary was paid by nerf but ted didnt think it was possible for one thing ted bradley was very publicly associated with nerf and as a hired employee she should have known that and she should have treated his opinions with respect to call the information he had shared with those kids bullshita talk he didnt have to give a moment he had offered out of the goodness of his heart and his dedication to the environmental causeto call that bullshit was outrageous it was confrontational in the extreme and it showed absolutely no respect plus ted knew that what he had said was true because as always nerf had given him a talking points memo listing the various things to be emphasized and nerf would not have told him to say anything that was untrue and the talking points said nothing about the fucking ice age everything jennifer had said was irrelevant those trees were magnificent they were sentinels of the environment just as the talking points claimed in fact he pulled the talking points out of his jacket pocket to be sure id like to see that jennifer said i bet you would what is your problem she said see he thought that kind of attitude aggressive and confrontational she said youre one of those television stars who thinks everyone wants to touch your dick well guess what oh big swinging one i dont i think youre just an actor and i think youre a plant youre a corporate spy i must not be a very good one she said because you found me out because you shot your mouth off thats why its always been my problem all during this conversation bradley felt a peculiar tension building in his chest women did not argue with ted bradley sometimes they were hostile for a while but that was only because they were intimidated by him his good looks and his star power they wanted to screw him and often hed let them but they did not argue with him this one was arguing and it excited him and angered him in equal proportions the tension building up inside him was almost unbearable her calmness just sitting there the direct way she looked into his eyes the complete lack of intimidationit was an indifference to his fame that drove him wild all right hell she was beautiful he grabbed her face in both hands and kissed her hard on the mouth he could tell she liked it to complete his dominance he stuck his tongue down her throat then there was a blinding flash of painin his neck his headand he must have lost consciousness for a moment because the next thing he knew he was sitting on the floor of the limousine gasping and watching blood drip all over his shirt ted was not sure how he had gotten there he was not sure why he was bleeding or why his head was throbbing then he realized that his tongue was bleeding he looked up at her she crossed her legs coolly giving him a glimpse up her skirt but he didnt care he was resentful you bit my tongue no asshole you bit your own tongue you assaulted me she raised an eyebrow you did you assaulted me he looked down jesus this was a new shirt too from maxfields she stared at him you assaulted me he repeated so sue me i think i will better consult your lawyer first why she nodded her head toward the front of the car youre forgetting the driver what about him he saw it all so what you encouraged me he said hissing you were being seductive any guy knows the signs apparently you didnt hostile ballbreaker he turned and took the vodka bottle from the rack he needed it to rinse out his mouth he poured himself a glass and looked back she was reading the talking points she held the paper in her hands he lunged for it thats not yours she was quick holding the paper away from him she raised her other hand edge on like a chopping knife care to try your luck again ted fuck you he said and took a big gulp of the vodka his tongue was on fire what a bitch he thought what a goddamned bitch well shed be looking for a new job tomorrow hed see to that this bimbo lawyer couldnt fuck around with ted bradley and get away with it standing beneath the crashed ferrari evans endured another ten minutes of grilling by the plainclothesmen who encircled him fundamentally the story didnt make sense to him evans said george was a good driver if all these changes were made to the car wouldnt he have noticed something was wrong perhaps but not if he was drinking heavily well he was drinking thats for sure and who got him the drinks mr evans george got his own drinks the waiter at the banquet said you were pushing drinks at morton thats not true i was trying to limit his drinking abruptly they changed course who worked on the ferrari mr evans i have no idea we know you rented a private garage outside sonoma on route it was fairly quiet and out of the way any person or persons who worked on the car would have been able to come and go as they wished without being seen why would you choose such a garage i didnt choose it your name is on the lease how was the lease arranged by phone who paid for it it was paid in cash by whom delivered by messenger you have my signature on anything fingerprints no just your name evans shrugged then im sorry but i dont know anything about this its well known that im george mortons attorney anybody could have used my name if anything was done to this car it was done without my knowledge he was thinking that they should have been asking sarah about all this but then if they were good at their jobs theyd already have talked to her and sure enough she appeared from around the corner talking on a cell phone and nodding to kenner that was when kenner stepped forward okay gentlemen unless you have further questions ill take mr evans into custody on my recognizance i dont believe he is a flight risk he will be safe enough with me the cops grumbled but in the end they agreed kenner handed out his card and then he headed back toward the entrance his arm firmly on evanss shoulder sarah followed some distance behind the cops stayed with the ferrari as they neared the door kenner said sorry about all that but the police didnt tell you everything the fact is they photographed the car from various angles and fed the shots into a computer that simulates crashes and the computergenerated simulation didnt match the photos of the actual crash i didnt know you could do that oh yes everybody uses computer models these days they are de rigueur for the modern organization armed with their computer simulation the police went back to the wreck itself where they now decided that it had been monkeyed with they never imagined this during their previous examinations of the wreck but now they do clear example of using a computer simulation to alter your version of reality they trusted the simulation and not the data from the ground uhhuh and of course their simulation was optimized for the most common vehicle types on american roads the computer had no ability to model the behavior of a fortyyearold limitedproduction italian racing car they ran the simulation anyway evans said but whats all this about a garage in sonoma kenner shrugged you dont know sarah doesnt know nobody can even verify if the car was ever there but the garage was rentedid guess by george himself though well never know for sure back outside evans threw open the door to his limo and climbed in he was astonished to see ted bradley covered in blood all down his chin and shirt front what happened he slipped jennifer said and hurt himself to los angeles tuesday october pm on the flight back sarah jones was overcome with confused feelings first of all she was profoundly distressed by the fact that george mortons body had been recovered in some part of her mind she had been hoping against hope that he would turn up alive then there was the question of peter evans just as she was starting to like himstarting to see a side of him that was not wimpy but rather tough and resilient in his own bumbling wayjust as she was beginning in fact to have the first stirrings of feelings toward the man who had saved her life suddenly there was this new woman jennifer somebody and peter was obviously taken with her and in addition there was the arrival of ted bradley sarah had no illusions about ted she had seen him in action at innumerable nerf gatherings and she had even once allowed him to work his charms on hershe was a sucker for actorsbut at the last moment decided he reminded her too much of her ex what was it about actors anyway they were so engaging so personal in their approach so intense in their feelings it was hard to realize that they were just selfabsorbed people who would do anything to get you to like them at least ted was and how had he been injured bitten his own tongue sarah had the feeling it had to do with this jennifer undoubtedly ted had made a pass at her the woman was pretty enough in a streetsmart kind of way dark hair toughish face compact body muscular but skinny a typical speededup new york typein every way sarahs opposite and peter evans was fawning over her fawning it was sort of disgusting but she had to admit she was disappointed personally as well just as she had started to like him she sighed as for bradley he was talking to kenner about environmental issues showing off his extensive knowledge and kenner was looking at bradley the way a python looks at a rat so kenner said global warming represents a threat to the world absolutely bradley said a threat to the whole world what sort of threat are we talking about crop failures spreading deserts new diseases species extinction all the glaciers melting kilimanjaro sealevel rise extreme weather tornadoes hurricanes el niсo events that sounds extremely serious kenner said it is bradley said it really is are you sure of your facts of course you can back your claims with references to the scientific literature well i cant personally but scientists can actually scientific studies do not support your claims for example crop failureif anything increased carbon dioxide stimulates plant growth there is some evidence that this is happening and the most recent satellite studies show the sahara has shrunk since as for new diseasesnot true the rate of emergence of new diseases has not changed since but well have diseases like malaria coming back to the us and europe not according to malaria experts bradley snorted and folded his hands across his chest species extinction hasnt been demonstrated either in the s norman myers predicted a million species would be extinct by the year paul ehrlich predicted that fifty percent of all species would be extinct by the year but those were just opinions do you know what we call opinion in the absence of evidence we call it prejudice do you know how many species there are on the planet no neither does anybody else estimates range from three million to one hundred million quite a range wouldnt you say nobody really has any idea your point being its hard to know how many species are becoming extinct if you dont know how many there are in the first place how could you tell if you were robbed if you didnt know how much money you had in your wallet to begin with and fifteen thousand new species are described every year by the way do you know what the known rate of species extinction is no thats because there is no known rate do you know how they measure numbers of species and species extinctions some poor bastard marks off a hectare or an acre of land and then tries to count all the bugs and animals and plants inside it then he comes back in ten years and counts again but maybe the bugs have moved to an adjacent acre in the meantime anyway can you imagine trying to count all the bugs in an acre of land it would be difficult to put it mildly and very inaccurate kenner said which is the point now about all the glaciers meltingnot true some are some arent nearly all of them are kenner smiled thinly how many glaciers are we talking about dozens how many glaciers are there in the world ted i dont know guess maybe uh two hundred there are more than that in california there are one hundred sixty thousand glaciers in the world ted about sixtyseven thousand have been inventoried but only a few have been studied with any care there is mass balance data extending five years or more for only seventynine glaciers in the entire world so how can you say theyre all melting nobody knows whether they are or not kilimanjaro is melting why is that global warming actually kilimanjaro has been rapidly melting since the slong before global warming the loss of the glacier has been a topic of scholarly concern for over a hundred years and it has always been something of a mystery because as you know kilimanjaro is an equatorial volcano so it exists in a warm region satellite measurements of that region show no warming trend at the altitude of the kilimanjaro glacier so why is it melting sulking you tell me because of deforestation ted the rain forest at the base of the mountain has been cut down so the air blowing upward is no longer moist experts think that if the forest is replanted the glacier will grow again thats bullshit ill give you the journal references now thensealevel rise was that the next threat you mentioned yes sea level is indeed rising ahhah as it has been for the last six thousand years ever since the start of the holocene sea level has been rising at the rate of ten to twenty centimetersthats four to eight inchesevery hundred years but its rising faster now actually not satellites prove it actually they dont computer models prove its rising faster computer models cant prove anything ted a prediction cant ever be proofit hasnt happened yet and computer models have failed to accurately predict the last ten or fifteen years but if you want to believe in them anyway there is no arguing with faith now what was next on your list extreme weatheragain not true numerous studies show there is no increase look ted said you may enjoy putting me down but the fact is lots of people think there will be more extreme weather including more hurricanes and tornadoes and cyclones in the future yes indeed lots of people think so but scientific studies do not bear them out thats why we do science ted to see if our opinions can be verified in the real world or whether we are just having fantasies all these hurricanes are not fantasies kenner sighed he flipped open his laptop what are you doing one moment kenner said let me bring it up us hurricane strikes by decade here is the actual data ted kenner said us hurricane strikes over the last hundred years are clearly not increasing and similarly extreme weather is not more frequent globally the data simply do not agree with you now you also mentioned el niсo events yes amp as you know el niсo is a global weather pattern that begins when ocean temperatures along the west coast of south america remain above normal for several months once its triggered el niсo lasts about a year and a half affecting weather around the world el niсo occurs roughly every four yearstwentythree times in the last century and it has been occurring for thousands of years so it long precedes any claim of global warming but what threat does el niсo represent to the us ted there was a major el niсo in floods crops ruined like that all that happened but the net economic effect of the last el niсo was a gain of fifteen billion dollars because of a longer growing season and less use of winter heating oil thats after deducting billion for flooding and excess rain in california still a net benefit id like to see that study bradley said ill make sure you get it because of course it also suggests that if global warming really does occur it will probably benefit most nations of the world but not all no ted not all so what exactly is your point bradley said youre saying that we dont need to pay any attention to the environment that we can just leave it alone and let industry pollute and everything will be hunkydory for a moment it looked to sarah as if kenner would get angry but he did not he said if you oppose the death penalty does it also mean you are in favor of doing nothing at all about crime no ted said you can oppose the death penalty but still favor punishing criminals yes of course then i can say that global warming is not a threat but still favor environmental controls cant i but it doesnt sound like you are saying that kenner sighed sarah was listening to this exchange thinking bradley wasnt really hearing what kenner had to say as if to prove her thoughts bradley continued well arent you saying that the environment needs no protection from us isnt that what you are really saying kenner said no in a way that suggested that the conversation was over sarah thought ted really is a fool he has a severely limited understanding of what he is talking about ted was an actor with a script at a loss if the conversation moved away from scripted lines she turned away and looked toward the front of the cabin she saw peter talking to jennifer their heads together there was a sort of intimacy in their gestures that was instantly recognizable she was glad when the pilot announced they were landing in los angeles van nuys tuesday october pm sanjong thapa was waiting at the airport looking worried he and kenner got immediately into a car and drove off sarah went home to her apartment bradley climbed into an suv limo and left with an irritable wave he was already on his cell phone peter evans drove jennifer to her car which was back in culver city there was an awkward moment saying goodbye he wanted to kiss her but sensed some reserve and didnt she promised she would call him in the morning he drove home thinking of her sarah did not enter his mind it was almost midnight when evans got back to his apartment he was very tired and was stripping off his shirt when the phone rang it was janis the exercise instructor where have you been you cute thing traveling he said i have called you every single day she said sometimes more sometimes every hour uhhuh whats up my boyfriend broke up with me im sorry to hear that evans said was it very can i come over she said he sighed you know janis im really tired amp i need to talk to you i promise i wont stay if you dont want me to im only about a block away five minutes he sighed again louder this time janis tonight is not okay good see you in five click he sighed he took his shirt off and tossed it in the hamper she never listened that was the trouble he decided that when she got to his apartment he would just tell her to leave thats all just go or then again maybe he wouldnt janis was uncomplicated he was ready for an uncomplicated exchange he pulled off his shoes and dropped them on the floor on the other hand he didnt want janis around in the morning if jennifer called would jennifer call she said she would did jennifer know his home number he wasnt sure maybe not he decided to take a shower he might not hear janis in the shower so he unlocked the front door for her and headed for the bathroom the hallway was dark and he had just a fleeting glimpse of a dark shadow before something hit him on the head very hard evans yelled the pain was intense making him gasp and he fell to his knees he groaned someone hit him again this time in the ear and he fell over on his side disoriented he found himself staring at a pair of feet in dirty socks he was being dragged into the living room he was dropped unceremoniously on the floor there were three men moving around him they had dark masks over their faces like ski masks one of them stepped on both his arms pinning him down flat on his back another one sat on his legs and said dont talk dont move a growly menacing voice evans couldnt move anyway he still felt disoriented he looked around for the third man he heard sloshing water he glimpsed what looked like a plastic baggie hold him good the third man spoke in a whisper he crouched by evanss shoulder pulled up the shirtsleeve exposing the flesh of his arm he was wheezing softly behind the black mask in the same whisper he said you know what this is he held up the baggie the water was cloudy evans saw what looked like a fleshy ball and in a panic he thought oh god they cut somebodys balls off but then he saw the ball moving undulating it was brown with white spots about the size of a golf ball you know the man said evans shook his head you will the man whispered and unzipped the baggie he pushed it against the underside of evanss arm evans felt wetness the man was manipulating the baggie squeezing the ball evans was trying to see but it was hard to see exactly what was the ball moved it spread extended what looked like wings no not wings it was a tiny octopus tiny it could not have weighed more than a few ounces brownish with white rings the man was squeezing the baggie compressing it pushing the little octopus toward the flesh of evanss arm and then he understood evans moaned and began to struggle trying to move against his captors but they had him firmly and he felt the touch of the octopus a kind of sticky sensation like cellophane or sticky putty or something he lifted his head in horror and saw that the man was snapping the baggie with his finger trying to goad the octopus which had wrapped itself against the skin of evanss arm and in a flash the rings on the octopus changed from white to blue the blue ring of death that means hes mad the third man holding the baggie said you wont feel it but evans did it was a bite from the tiny beak a single sting almost like the sting of a needle evans jerked his arm and the man withdrew the baggie and sealed it again he whispered hold him good he went away a moment then came back with a kitchen rag he wiped the underside of evanss arm wiped the water off the floor still whispering he said you wont feel anything for a few minutes he walked over to the phone dont try to call anybody he said and ripped the phone off the wall smashing it on the floor the men released him they moved quickly to the door opened it and were gone he coughed and got to his hands and knees he looked at his underarm the bite looked like a dimple in the flesh a small pink spot just at the edge of the hairs of his armpit nobody would ever see it he did not feel anything except a sort of dull tingling at the spot where the bite had occurred his mouth was dry but that was probably from fear his head hurt he reached up felt blood realized that they had torn open some of his stitches jesus he tried to get to his feet but his arm gave way and he fell down again rolling on the floor he was still disoriented he stared into the lights in the ceiling his apartment had that cottagecheese kind of ceiling he hated that ceiling he wanted to do something about it but it was too expensive anyway he had always thought he would be moving soon he was still disoriented he got onto his elbows his mouth was very dry now it was the effect of the poison some kind of a toad no he thought that wasnt right it wasnt a toad it was a amp he couldnt remember octopus thats right it was a little octopus hardly bigger than a thumbnail cute little thing the indians in the amazon used them for poison for their arrowheads no he thought that was toads no octopus in the amazon or were there he was confused becoming more confused he broke into a cold sweat was that part of it too he had to get to a phone he might only have a few minutes of consciousness left he crawled to the nearest object which was an easy chair amphed had it in law school it was pretty ratty he had intended to get rid of it when he moved here but he hadnt gotten around to it yet ampthe living room needed a chair right in this spot amphed had it recovered in fabric his second year in law school amppretty dirty now ampwho had time to go shopping with his mind racing he pulled himself up until his chin was resting on the seat of the chair he was gasping for breath it felt as if he had climbed a mountain he thought why am i here why is my chin on the chair then he remembered that he was trying to climb up to sit in it sit in the chair he got the elbow of his good arm up onto the seat and began to press himself up finally he was able to heave his chest onto the chair then the rest of his body his limbs were getting numb and cold and heavier by the minute they were becoming too heavy to move his whole body was getting heavy he managed to get himself almost upright in the chair there was a phone on the table beside him but his arm was too heavy to reach for it he tried but he could not reach out at all now his fingers moved slightly but that was all his body was very cold and very heavy he began to lose his balance slowly at first and then sliding over sideways until his chest rested on the arm of the chair and his head hung over the side and there he stayed unable to move he could not lift his head he could not move his arms he could not even move his eyes he stared at the fabric of the chair and the carpet on the floor and he thought this is the last thing i will see before i die vi blue beverly hills wednesday october am how long peter evans stared at the carpet he did not know the arm of the chair pressing against his chest impeded his breathing but it was becoming more difficult to breathe in any case images from his life flashed into consciousnessthe basement where he played with his first computer the blue bicycle that was stolen the same day he got it the boxed corsage for his senior prom date standing up in professor whitsons con law class his legs shaking while old whitson took him apart peter hello peter and terrorized him they were all terrorized by whitson and the dinner that was the final interview for his la job where he spilled soup all over his shirt and the partners pretended not to notice and peter peter what are you doing there peter get up peter he felt hands on his shoulders burning hot hands and with a grunt he was hauled back into sitting position there thats better janis peered at him her face inches from his whats the matter with you what did you take talk to me but he could not talk he could not move at all she was wearing a leotard top and jeans and sandals if she moved to one side she was out of his field of view peter a puzzled tone i think something is really wrong have you been doing ecstasy did you have a stroke youre too young for a stroke but it could happen i guess especially with your diet i told you no more than sixtyfive grams of fat a day if you were a vegetarian you would never have a stroke why dont you answer me she touched his jaw a questioning look on her face evans was feeling distinctly lightheaded because he could hardly breathe anymore it was as if he had a twentyton stone on his chest even though he was sitting up the great stone weighed on him he thought call the hospital i dont know what to do peter she said i just wanted to talk to you tonight and now youre like this i mean i guess its a bad time but its kind of scary too i have to be honest i wish you would answer me can you answer me call the hospital maybe youll hate me for this but i dont know what you took that makes you this way so im going to call and get an ambulance im really sorry and i dont want to get you into trouble but this is freaking me out peter she went out of his field of view but he heard her picking up the phone on the table next to his chair he thought good hurry she said something is wrong with your phone oh jesus she stepped back into his field of view your phone is not working did you know that use your cell phone do you have your cell phone i left mine in the car go get it maybe one of the other phones in your apartment is working you need to call your service provider peter its not safe to be without phoneswhats this somebody tore the phone out of the wall have we been having a fit of pique knocking on the door it sounded like the front door helllo anybody here hello peter a womans voice he couldnt see who it was he heard janis say who are you who are you im janis im peters friend im sarah i work with peter youre tall where is peter sarah said hes over there janis said somethings wrong with him evans could see none of this because he could not move his eyes and now he saw the first gray spots that signaled the impending loss of consciousness it took every ounce of energy he possessed to move his chest and fill his lungs the tiniest bit peter sarah said she moved into his field of view she looked at him are you paralyzed she said yes call the hospital hes sweating sarah said cold sweats he was that way when i found him janis said she turned to sarah what are you doing here anyway how well do you know peter did you call an ambulance sarah said no because my phone is in my car and ill do it sarah flipped open her cell phone it was the last thing evans remembered brentwood wednesday october am it was late the house was dark all around him nicholas drake was sitting at his desk in his home in brentwood near santa monica he was precisely miles from the beach he had recently measured it in his car so he felt secure there it was a good thing too because nerf had bought this house for him only one year before there had been some discussion about that because they had also bought him a townhouse in georgetown but drake had pointed out that he needed a residence on the west coast in which to entertain celebrities and important contributors california was after all the most environmentally conscious state in the nation it had been the first to pass antismoking laws almost ten years before new york or any other eastern state did and even when a federal court overturned the epa on the issue of secondhand smoke in saying that the epa had violated its own rules of evidence and banned a substance they had failed to prove caused any harm at allthe federal judge was from a tobacco state obviouslyeven then california did not budge the antismoking laws stayed in fact santa monica was about to ban all smoking outdoors even at the beach now that was progress it was easy here but as for getting major funds ampwell that was another matter there were some rich people in the entertainment industry who could be counted on but for the real money in californiathe investment bankers portfolio managers ceos real estate trust funders people with five hundred million to a couple billion serious moneywell those people werent so easy those people inhabited a different california those people belonged to golf courses that didnt allow actors to join the big money was in the hands of pioneers and tech entrepreneurs and they were very smart and very tough a lot of them knew their science christ a lot of them were scientists which was why they presented such a challenge to drake if he wanted that bonus for making his numbers for the year he was staring at the screen thinking it was time for a scotch when a new window opened and the cursor blinked scorpiol can you talk speaking of dimwits he thought he typed yes i can drake shifted in his seat adjusting the light over his desk so it would illuminate his face he looked at the camera lens mounted just above his screen the window opened up he saw ted bradley sitting at his desk in his house in the san fernando valley well it was just as you said bradley said evans has gone over to the dark side and he was with that girl jennifer who works on the lawsuit amp jennifer haynes yeah shes a wiseass bitch drake said nothing he was listening to the sound of the voice bradley had been drinking again he said ted weve talked about this before not everybody likes it when you come on to them yeah they do i mean mostly they do ted this is not the impression we want to make well she insulted me all right so jennifer haynes was there amp shes a stooge for big oil and coal gotta be and who else was there sarah jones uhhuh she flew up to see the body i dont know why she was there she was with a guy named kenner a real asshole another knowitall describe him forties dark kind of butch looks military to me uhhuh anyone else no nobody foreign no other people no just the ones i described would you say that peter evans knew kenner yeah pretty well i would say so it was your impression they were working together yes i would say very much together all right ted drake said i like your instincts here he watched as bradley preened on the monitor i think you may be on to something evans could prove a problem to us ill say hes been one of our trusted attorneys why he was in my office just the other day getting an assignment from me if hes turned on us he could do damage damn turncoat ted said hes another bennett arnold i want you to stick close to him for the next week or so my pleasure hang out with him stay by his side buddybuddy you know i got you nick ill be on him like glue im sure hell be at the opening of the conference later this morning drake said and he thought or then again he might not make it westwood wednesday october am kenner said i must say it was an excellent choice hapalochlaena fasciata the most deadly of the three species of blueringed octopus so named because when it is threatened it changes color and produces bright blue rings on its skin its found everywhere in the coastal waters of australia the animal is very tiny the bite is small and almost undetectable and envenomation is often deadly there is no antivenom and a bites not likely to be quickly recognized at a hospital in los angeles really a masterful choice evans who was lying in the emergency room at ucla with a respirator on his face just stared he was still unable to speak but he was no longer so frightened janis had gone home in a huff mentioning something about teaching an early class sarah was sitting by his bed rubbing his hand gently and looking beautiful where would they have gotten one i imagine they have several kenner said theyre delicate and dont live very long anyway but they are captured in fairly large numbers because the aussies are trying to make an antivenin you probably know the australians lead the world in deadly poisonous animals the most poisonous snake the most poisonous mollusk the most poisonous fishall from australia or found there evans thought great but now of course ucla has seen three cases theyre on it yes we are an intern said coming into the room he checked evanss iv and his respirator he said we have your preliminary blood work its a tetrodotoxin like the others you should be up and around in about three more hours lucky guy he smiled winningly at sarah then walked out again anyway im glad youre all right kenner said it would have been embarrassing to lose you evans thought what is he talking about he was increasingly able to use his eye muscles and he glanced over at sarah but she just smiled oh yes kenner said i need you alive peter at least for a while sitting in a corner of the room on his cell phone sanjong said okay we have some action kenner said is it where we thought yes what happened we just got the receipt notice they rented an aircraft last month a c transport whew kenner said what does that mean sarah said big aircraft they probably need it to spray she looked puzzled spray sanjong said its pretty clear theyre going to disseminate aob ammoniaoxidizing bacteria in large quantities and perhaps some hydrophilic nanoparticles as well to do what control the path of a storm kenner said theres some evidence that disseminated aob at altitude can shift a hurricane or cyclone track hydrophilic nanoparticles potentiate the effect at least in theory i dont know if its been tried on a large system theyre going to control a hurricane theyre going to try maybe not sanjong said tokyo says some recent cellular and internet traffic suggests that the project may be canceled then they dont have the initial conditions looks like they dont no evans coughed oh good kenner said youre coming around he patted his arm just rest now peter try and sleep if you can because as you know today is the big day the big day sarah said the conference begins in about five and a half hours kenner said he stood to go then turned back to evans im going to have sanjong stay with you the rest of the night he said i think youll be all right here but theyve already made one attempt on your life and i dont want them to try another sanjong smiled and sat on the chair beside the bed a stack of magazines beside him he opened the latest issue of time magazine the cover story was climate change doomsday ahead he also had newsweek abrupt climate changea new scandal for the administration and the economist climate change rears its ugly head and parismatch climat le nouveau pйril amйricain sanjong smiled cheerfully just rest now he said evans closed his eyes santa monica wednesday october am at nine oclock that morning the invited attendees to the conference were milling around on the floor not taking their seats evans was standing near the entrance drinking coffee he felt incredibly tired but he was all right hed been a little shaky in his legs earlier but that had passed the delegates were clearly academic types many dressed casually in a manner to suggest an outdoorsy lifestylekhakis and llbean shirts hiking boots patagonia vests it looks like a lumberjack convention doesnt it jennifer said standing beside evans youd never know these guys spend most of their time in front of computer monitors is that true evans said a lot of them yes and the hiking shoes she shrugged the rugged look is in at the moment at the podium nicholas drake tapped the microphone good morning everyone he said we will begin in ten minutes then he stepped away and huddled with henley waiting for the tv cameras jennifer said they had some electrical problems this morning crews are still setting up so of course everything waits for television at the entrance to the convention hall there was a commotion and shouting evans looked over and saw an elderly man in a tweed coat and tie struggling with two security guards but i have been invited he said i am supposed to be here sorry sir the guards were saying your name is not on the sheet but i tell you i have been invited oh boy jennifer said shaking her head whos that that is professor norman hoffman ever heard of him no why the ecology of thought hes a famous sociologist or should i say a notorious one extremely critical of environmental beliefs a bit of a mad dog we had him over to the war room to ask him his views that was a mistake the guy never shuts up he talks a mile a minute and goes off on tangentsin every directionand you cant turn him off its like a tv set that changes channels every few seconds and theres no remote no wonder they dont want him here oh yes he would cause trouble he already is over by the entrance the old man was struggling with the security guards let go of me how dare you i was invited by george morton himself he and i are personal friends george morton invited me the mention of george morton sparked something evans went over to the old man jennifer said youll be sorry amp he shrugged excuse me he said coming up to the guards im mr mortons attorney can i help you the old man writhed in the grip of the guards im professor norman hoffman and george morton invited me up close evans saw that the old man was messily shaven unkempt his hair wild why do you think i would come to this horrible convocation for one reason only george asked me to he wanted my impression of it although i could have told him weeks ago there are no surprises to be had here i can assure you it will unfold with all the stately ceremony of any cheap funeral evans was thinking jennifer had been right to warn him about this guy he said politely do you have a ticket sir no i dont have a ticket i dont need a ticket what dont you understand young man i am professor norman hoffman and i am a personal friend of george mortons anyway he said they took my ticket who did one of those guards evans said to the guards did you take his ticket he didnt have a ticket do you have a stub evans said to hoffman no damn it i do not have a stub i do not need a stub i do not need any of this frankly im sorry professor but however i managed to hold on to this he gave evans the torn corner of a ticket it was a genuine ticket where is the rest i told you they took it a guard standing to one side beckoned to evans evans went over to him the guard turned his cupped hand revealing the rest of the ticket in his palm im sorry sir he said but mr drake gave specific orders this gentleman was not to be allowed in but he has a ticket evans said perhaps youd like to take it up with mr drake by now a television crew had wandered over drawn by the commotion hoffman immediately played to the cameras struggling anew dont bother with drake hoffman yelled to evans drake wont let truth into these proceedings he turned to the camera nicholas drake is an immoral fraud and these proceedings are a travesty to the poor of the world i bear witness to the dying children of africa and asia breathing their last because of conferences like this fearmongers immoral fearmongers he struggled maniacally his eyes were wild there was spittle on his lips he certainly appeared crazy and the cameras switched off the crews turned away seemingly embarrassed at once hoffman stopped his struggle never mind ive said my piece no one is interested as usual he turned to his guards you can let me go i have had enough of this chicanery i cannot bear to be here another minute let me go evans said let him go the guards released hoffman he immediately dashed into the center of the room where a crew was now interviewing ted bradley hoffman stepped in front of bradley and said this man is a pimp he is an ecopimp for a corrupt establishment that makes its living by spreading false fears dont you understand false fears are a plague a modern plague then the guards were on hoffman again dragging him bodily out of the hall he didnt struggle this time he just went limp his heels scraping on the ground as he was carried out all he said was be careful i have a bad back you hurt me and ill sue you for assault they set him outside on the curb dusted him off released him have a good day sir i intend to my days are numbered evans hung back with jennifer watching hoffman i wont say i told you jennifer said just who is he anyway hes a professor emeritus at usc he was one of the first people to study in a rigorous statistical fashion the media and its effect on society hes quite interesting but as you see he has developed uh strong opinions you think morton really invited him here peter i need your help a voice said evans turned and saw drake striding toward him what is it that nut drake said nodding to hoffman is probably going to go straight to the police and claim he was assaulted we dont need that this morning go talk to him see if you can calm him down cautiously evans said i dont know what i can do amp get him to explain his nutty theories drake said thatll keep him busy for hours but then ill miss the conf we dont need you here we need you there with the cuckoo there was a large crowd outside the conference center the overflow was watching the proceedings on a big tv screen with subtitles running underneath the speaker evans pushed through the gathering i know why you are following me hoffman said when he saw evans and it wont work professor youre the bright young poseur nick drake sent to put me off my purpose not at all sir yes you are dont lie to me i dont like to be lied to all right evans said its true i was sent by drake hoffman stopped he seemed startled by the honesty i knew it and what did he tell you to do stop you from going to the police all right then youve succeeded go and tell him i am not going to the police it looks like you are oh it looks like i am youre one of those people who care what it looks like no sir but you i dont care what it looks like i care what is do you have any idea what is im not sure i follow you what is your line of work im a lawyer i should have known everybody is a lawyer these days extrapolating the statistical growth of the legal profession by the year every single person in the united states will be a lawyer including newborn infants they will be born lawyers what do you suppose it will be like to live in such a society professor evans said you made some interesting comments in the hall interesting i accused them of flagrant immorality and you call that interesting im sorry evans said trying to move the discussion toward hoffmans views you didnt explain why you think i do not think anything young man i know that is the purpose of my researchto know things not to surmise them not to theorize not to hypothesize but to know from direct research in the field its a lost art in academia these days young manyou are not that youngwhat is your name anyway peter evans and you work for drake mr evans no for george morton well why didnt you say so hoffman said george morton was a great great man come along mr evans and i will buy you some coffee and we can talk do you know what i do im afraid i dont sir i study the ecology of thought hoffman said and how it has led to a state of fear santa monica wednesday october am they were sitting on a bench across the street from the conference hall just beyond the milling crowds near the entrance it was a busy scene but hoffman ignored everything around him he spoke rapidly with great animation moving his hands so wildly that he often slapped evans in the chest but he never seemed to notice ten years ago i began with fashion and slang he said the latter being of course a kind of verbal fashion i wanted to know the determinants of change in fashion and speech what i quickly found is that there are no identifiable determinants fashions change for arbitrary reasons and although there are regularitiescycles periodicities and correlationsthese are merely descriptive not explanatory are you following me i think so evans said in any case i realized that these periodicities and correlations could be regarded as systems in themselves or if you will ecosystems i tested that hypothesis and found it heuristically valuable just as there is an ecology of the natural world in the forests and mountains and oceans so too there is an ecology of the manmade world of mental abstractions ideas and thought that is what i have studied i see within modern culture ideas constantly rise and fall for a while everybody believes something and then bit by bit they stop believing it eventually no one can remember the old idea the way no one can remember the old slang ideas are themselves a kind of fad you see i understand professor but why why do ideas fall out of favor you are wondering hoffman said he was talking to himself the answer is simplythey do in fashion as in natural ecology there are disruptions sharp revisions of the established order a lightning fire burns down a forest a different species springs up in the charred acreage accidental haphazard unexpected abrupt change that is what the world shows us on every side professor amp but just as ideas can change abruptly so too can they hang on past their time some ideas continue to be embraced by the public long after scientists have abandoned them left brain right brain is a perfect example in the s it gains popularity from the work of sperry at caltech who studies a specific group of brainsurgery patients his findings have no broader meaning beyond these patients sperry denies any broader meaning by it is clear that the left and right brain notion is just wrongthe two sides of the brain do not work separately in a healthy person but in the popular culture the concept does not die for another twenty years people talk about it believe it write books about it for decades after scientists have set it aside yes all very interesting similarly in environmental thought it was widely accepted in that there is something called the balance of nature if you just left nature alone it would come into a selfmaintaining state of balance lovely idea with a long pedigree the greeks believed it three thousand years ago on the basis of nothing just seemed nice however by no scientist believes in the balance of nature anymore the ecologists have all given it up as simply wrong untrue a fantasy they speak now of dynamic disequilibrium of multiple equilibrium states but they now understand that nature is never in balance never has been never will be on the contrary nature is always out of balance and that means professor evans said id like to ask you that means that mankind which was formerly defined as the great disrupter of the natural order is nothing of the sort the whole environment is being constantly disrupted all the time anyway but george morton amp yes yes you wonder what i discussed with george morton i am coming to that we are not off topic because of course morton wanted to know about environmental ideas and particularly the idea of environmental crisis what did you tell him if you study the media as my graduate students and i do seeking to find shifts in normative conceptualization you discover something extremely interesting we looked at transcripts of news programs of the major networksnbc abc cbs we also looked at stories in the newspapers of new york washington miami los angeles and seattle we counted the frequency of certain concepts and terms used by the media the results were very striking he paused what did you find evans said taking his cue there was a major shift in the fall of before that time the media did not make excessive use of terms such as crisis catastrophe cataclysm plague or disaster for example during the s the word crisis appeared in news reports about as often as the word budget in addition prior to adjectives such as dire unprecedented dreaded were not common in television reports or newspaper headlines but then it all changed in what way these terms started to become more and more common the word catastrophe was used five times more often in than it was in its use doubled again by the year and the stories changed too there was a heightened emphasis on fear worry danger uncertainty panic why should it have changed in ah a good question critical question in most respects seemed like a normal year a soviet sub sank in norway tiananmen square in china the exxon valdez salmon rushdie sentenced to death jane fonda mike tyson and bruce springsteen all got divorced the episcopal church hired a female bishop poland allowed striking unions voyager went to neptune a san francisco earthquake flattened highways and russia the us france and england all conducted nuclear tests a year like any other but in fact the rise in the use of the term crisis can be located with some precision in the autumn of and it seemed suspicious that it should coincide so closely with the fall of the berlin wall which happened on november ninth of that year hoffman fell silent again looking at evans in a significant way very pleased with himself evans said im sorry professor i dont get it neither did we at first we thought the association was spurious but it wasnt the berlin wall marks the collapse of the soviet empire and the end of the cold war that had lasted for half a century in the west another silence another pleased look im sorry evans said finally i was thirteen years old then and amp he shrugged i dont see where you are leading i am leading to the notion of social control peter to the requirement of every sovereign state to exert control over the behavior of its citizens to keep them orderly and reasonably docile to keep them driving on the right side of the roador the left as the case may be to keep them paying taxes and of course we know that social control is best managed through fear fear evans said exactly for fifty years western nations had maintained their citizens in a state of perpetual fear fear of the other side fear of nuclear war the communist menace the iron curtain the evil empire and within the communist countries the same in reverse fear of us then suddenly in the fall of it was all finished gone vanished over the fall of the berlin wall created a vacuum of fear nature abhors a vacuum something had to fill it evans frowned youre saying that environmental crises took the place of the cold war that is what the evidence shows of course now we have radical fundamentalism and post terrorism to make us afraid and those are certainly real reasons for fear but that is not my point my point is there is always a cause for fear the cause may change over time but the fear is always with us before terrorism we feared the toxic environment before that we had the communist menace the point is although the specific cause of our fear may change we are never without the fear itself fear pervades society in all its aspects perpetually he shifted on the concrete bench turning away from the crowds has it ever occurred to you how astonishing the culture of western society really is industrialized nations provide their citizens with unprecedented safety health and comfort average life spans increased fifty percent in the last century yet modern people live in abject fear they are afraid of strangers of disease of crime of the environment they are afraid of the homes they live in the food they eat the technology that surrounds them they are in a particular panic over things they cant even seegerms chemicals additives pollutants they are timid nervous fretful and depressed and even more amazingly they are convinced that the environment of the entire planet is being destroyed around them remarkable like the belief in witchcraft its an extraordinary delusiona global fantasy worthy of the middle ages everything is going to hell and we must all live in fear amazing how has this world view been instilled in everybody because although we imagine we live in different nationsfrance germany japan the usin fact we inhabit exactly the same state the state of fear how has that been accomplished evans said nothing he knew it wasnt necessary well i shall tell you how he said in the old daysbefore your time petercitizens of the west believed their nationstates were dominated by something called the militaryindustrial complex eisenhower warned americans against it in the s and after two world wars europeans knew very well what it meant in their own countries but the militaryindustrial complex is no longer the primary driver of society in reality for the last fifteen years we have been under the control of an entirely new complex far more powerful and far more pervasive i call it the politicolegalmedia complex the plm and it is dedicated to promoting fear in the populationunder the guise of promoting safety safety is important please western nations are fabulously safe yet people do not feel they are because of the plm and the plm is powerful and stable precisely because it unites so many institutions of society politicians need fears to control the population lawyers need dangers to litigate and make money the media need scare stories to capture an audience together these three estates are so compelling that they can go about their business even if the scare is totally groundless if it has no basis in fact at all for instance consider silicon breast implants evans sighed shaking his head breast implants yes you will recall that breast implants were claimed to cause cancer and autoimmune diseases despite statistical evidence that this was not true we saw highprofile news stories highprofile lawsuits highprofile political hearings the manufacturer dow corning was hounded out of the business after paying billion and juries awarded huge cash payments to plaintiffs and their lawyers four years later definitive epidemiological studies showed beyond a doubt that breast implants did not cause disease but by then the crisis had already served its purpose and the plm had moved on a ravenous machine seeking new fears new terrors im telling you this is the way modern society worksby the constant creation of fear and there is no countervailing force there is no system of checks and balances no restraint on the perpetual promotion of fear after fear after fear amp because we have freedom of speech freedom of the press that is the classic plm answer thats how they stay in business hoffman said but think if it is not all right to falsely shout fire in a crowded theater why is it all right to shout cancer in the pages of the new yorker when that statement is not true weve spent more than twentyfive billion dollars to clear up the phony powerline cancer claim so what you say i can see it in your face youre thinking were rich we can afford it its only twentyfive billion dollars but the fact is that twentyfive billion dollars is more than the total gdp of the poorest fifty nations of the world combined half the worlds population lives on two dollars a day so that twentyfive billion would be enough to support thirtyfour million people for a year or we could have helped all the people dying of aids in africa instead we piss it away on a fantasy published by a magazine whose readers take it very seriously trust it it is a stupendous waste of money in another world it would be a criminal waste one could easily imagine another nuremberg trialthis time for the relentless squandering of western wealth on trivialitiesand complete with pictures of the dead babies in africa and asia that result he hardly paused for breath at the very least we are talking about a moral outrage thus we can expect our religious leaders and our great humanitarian figures to cry out against this waste and the needless deaths around the world that result but do any religious leaders speak out no quite the contrary they join the chorus they promote what would jesus drive as if they have forgotten that what jesus would drive is the false prophets and fearmongers out of the temple he was getting quite heated now we are talking about a situation that is profoundly immoral it is disgusting if truth be told the plm callously ignores the plight of the poorest and most desperate human beings on our planet in order to keep fat politicians in office rich news anchors on the air and conniving lawyers in mercedesbenz convertibles oh and university professors in volvos lets not forget them hows that evans said what does this have to do with university professors well thats another discussion is there a short version evans said not really thats why headlines arent news peter but i will try to be succinct he said the point is this the world has changed in the last fifty years we now live in the knowledge society the information society whatever you want to call it and it has had enormous impact on our universities fifty years ago if you wanted to lead what was then called the life of the mind meaning to be an intellectual to live by your wits you had to work in a university the society at large had no place for you a few newspaper reporters a few magazine journalists could be considered as living by their wits but that was about it universities attracted those who willingly gave up worldly goods to live a cloistered intellectual life teaching timeless values to the younger generation intellectual work was the exclusive province of the university but today whole sectors of society live the life of the mind our entire economy is based on intellectual work now thirtysix percent of workers are knowledge workers thats more than are employed in manufacturing and when professors decided they would no longer teach young people but leave that task to their graduate students who knew much less than they did and spoke english poorlywhen that happened the universities were thrown into crisis what good were they anymore they had lost their exclusive hold on the life of the mind they no longer taught the young only so many theoretical texts on the semiotics of foucault could be published in any single year what was to become of our universities what relevance did they have in the modern era he stood up as if energized by this question then abruptly he sat down again what happened he continued is the universities transformed themselves in the s formerly bastions of intellectual freedom in a world of babbittry formerly the locus of sexual freedom and experimentation they now became the most restrictive environments in modern society because they had a new role to play they became the creators of new fears for the plm universities today are factories of fear they invent all the new terrors and all the new social anxieties all the new restrictive codes words you cant say thoughts you cant think they produce a steady stream of new anxieties dangers and social terrors to be used by politicians lawyers and reporters foods that are bad for you behaviors that are unacceptable cant smoke cant swear cant screw cant think these institutions have been stood on their heads in a generation it is really quite extraordinary the modern state of fear could never exist without universities feeding it there is a peculiar neostalinist mode of thought that is required to support all this and it can thrive only in a restrictive setting behind closed doors without due process in our society only universities have created thatso far the notion that these institutions are liberal is a cruel joke they are fascist to the core im telling you he broke off and pointed down the walkway who is this fellow pushing toward us through the crowd he looks oddly familiar evans said thats ted bradley the actor where have i seen him he plays the president on television oh yes him ted came to a halt in front of them panting peter he said ive been looking everywhere for you is your cell phone on no because sarah has been trying to reach you she says its important we have to leave town right away and bring your passport evans said we what does this have to do with you im coming with you ted said as they started to walk away hoffman clutched at evanss sleeve holding him back he had a new thought we havent talked about involution he said professor it is the next step in the development of nationstates indeed it is already happening you must see the irony after all twentyfive billion dollars and ten years later the same rich elitists who were terrified of powerline cancer are buying magnets to strap to their ankles or put on their mattressesimported japanese magnets are the best the most expensivein order to enjoy the healthful effects of magnetic fields the same magnetic fieldsonly now they cant get enough of them professor evans said i have to go why dont these people just lie back against a tv screen snuggle up to a kitchen appliance all the things that terrified them before well talk later evans said pulling his arm away they even sell magnets in the health magazines healthy living through magnetic fields insanity no one remembers even a few years ago george orwell no memory who is that guy bradley said as they headed off he seems a little wound up doesnt he santa monica wednesday october am the record of catastrophe is contained within the ice cores the speaker said droning on at the podium he was russian and spoke with a heavy accent these ice cores from greenland show that in the last one hundred thousand years there have been four abrupt climate change events some have occurred very quickly in a few years while the mechanisms by which these events occurred are still being studied they demonstrate that there can be trigger effects in climate whereby small changesincluding manmade changescan produce catastrophically large effects we have seen a foretaste of such effects in recent days with the calving of the worlds largest iceberg and the terrible loss of life from the flash flood in the american southwest and it is no difficulty to predict we will see more he paused as drake hurried up onto the stage whispered in his ear then stepped down again looking at his watch uh i must beg the forgiveness of you the speaker said i seem to have brought up an outdated version of my remarks word processors that was a part from an old talk from what i wanted to say was that the calving of the iceberg in larger than many american statesand the dangerously unseasonal weather around the world including the sunny southwest portends further climate instability it is just beginning sarah jones standing in the back was talking with ann garner the wife of a prominent hollywood lawyer and a major contributor to nerf ann was emphatic as always and talking nonstop ill tell you what i heard ann was saying i heard there is an industrysponsored campaign to discredit ngos industry is afraid of the growing power of the environmental movement and they are desperate desperate to stop it we have had our modest successes in recent years and it is driving them crazy and im sorry sarah said just a minute ann she turned to look at the russian speaker at the podium what did he say she thought she walked quickly to the press table where reporters were lined up with their laptops open they were getting realtime transcripts of the conference she looked over the shoulder of ben lopez the reporter for the los angeles times ben didnt mind he had been after her for months hi ya sweet thing hi ben mind if i look at something she touched the mouse scrolling up the screen sure be my guest nice perfume she read can be trigger effects in climate whereby small changes including manmade changes can produce catastrophically large effects we have had a foretaste of such effects in recent days with the calving of the worlds largest iceberg and the terrible loss of life from the flash flood in the american southwest and it is no difficulty to predict we will see more while she watched the text changed the strikeout disappearing and replaced with new text can be trigger effects in climate whereby small changes including manmade changes can produce catastrophically large effects we have had a foretaste of such effects with large effects we have had a foretaste of such effects with the calving of the iceberg in larger than many american states and the dangerously unseasonal weather around the world including the sunny southwest portends further climate instability holy shit she said something wrong ben said did you see what he said yeah poor guy probably has jet lag to beat hell and obviously hes struggling with english amp the original remarks were gone the record was corrected but there was no doubt about it the russian had known in advance about the iceberg and the flash flood it was written into his speech and somebody had forgotten to tell him when he got off the plane that it never happened he knew in advance but now the record was corrected the remarks stricken she glanced at the video camera in the back recording the proceedings no doubt the remarks would disappear from the video record as well the son of a bitch knew in advance hey ben said i dont know what youre so upset about clue me in will you later she said i promise she patted his shoulder and went back to ann so ann said what we are facing is an industrypromoted campaign well orchestrated well financed pervasive and ultra rightwing that is intent on destroying the environmental movement that stands in its way after what she had just seen sarah was in no mood to put up with this blather ann she said did it ever cross your mind you might be paranoid no anyway even paranoids have enemies how many industry executives serve on the nerf board right now sarah said uh not that many sarah knew that there were thirty board members of whom twelve were industry figures this was the case with all modern environmental groups they had all had industry representatives over the last twenty years did you ask your corporate board members about this secret industry campaign no she said she was looking at sarah oddly do you think sarah said that it is possible that ngos like nerf could be the ones who are engaged in a secret campaign what are you talking about ann said stiffening sarah were the good guys are we yes we are ann said whats going on with you sarah in the parking lot outside the convention hall sanjong thapa sat in the car with his laptop on his knees he had easily hacked the wifi network used by the journalists and was receiving the conference transcript which was instantaneously saved he had done it that way because he was afraid he might be discovered and locked out at any moment but now it meant that he had the complete transcript including the revisions kenner he thought was going to love this on another screen sanjong was monitoring the satellite images from the western atlantic off the coast of florida a large highpressure mass was beginning to rotate forming the ragged beginnings of a hurricane clearly an event was scheduled around a hurricane but for some reason it had been abandoned and now he was tracking other investigative leads in particular kenner was concerned about a small research submarine known as doev and the tender ship av scorpio that submarine and its tender ship had been leased by canuco a natural gas corporation based in calgary to conduct research in the south pacific looking for undersea gas deposits the tender had sailed to port moresby new guinea some two months before and had subsequently left that harbor and had been spotted near bougainville in the solomon islands nothing of great interest there until it became known that canuco was not a registered canadian corporation and that it had no assets other than a website and web address the owner of the site was canuco leasing corp another nonexistent company the lease payments had been made from a cayman island account and paid in euros the name of the account was seismic services also in calgary and sharing the same postal address as canuco they were obviously the same entity and it was seismic services that had originally attempted to lease a submarine and presumably had later caused the death of nat damon in vancouver now there were agencies in washington searching satellite maps trying to find the av scorpio somewhere in the solomon island chain but the solomons had scattered cloud cover and the satellite passes had not yet revealed the ships location that in itself was worrisome it suggested that the ship had already hidden itself in some way perhaps by going into a covered dock somewhere in the south pacific and it was a big ocean equally worrisome was the fact that the tender had sailed first to vancouver where it had taken on thirty tons of industrial equipment in fiveton cartons the canadian government had thought the company was illegally transporting automobiles in the cartons so they opened one the customs officers instead found some complex equipment that they listed as diesel generators generators sanjong didnt know what was in those cartons but he was sure they werent diesel generators because you didnt have to go to vancouver to get a bunch of generators so it was worrisome hey you he looked up and saw two security guards walking across the parking lot toward his car obviously his wifi hack had been detected it was time to go he turned the key in the ignition and drove away waving cheerfully to the security guards as he passed them sarah whats going on youre just staring into space nothing ann sarah shook her head just thinking about what and what do you mean about my being paranoid ann put her hand on sarahs arm really im a little concerned about you sarah thought and im concerned about you in truth it was sarah who was feeling a distinct paranoid chill she looked around the room and her eyes met drakes he was staring at her studying her from across the room for how long had he seen her quick dash to the reporters desk had he deduced the meaning of it did he know she knew sarah ann said shaking her arm listen sarah said im really sorry but i have to go sarah im worried about you ill be fine she started to leave the room ill just come with you ann said falling into step with her id rather you didnt im concerned for your welfare i think i need to be alone for a while sarah said is that any way to treat a friend ann said i insist darling you need a little mothering i can see that and im here for you sarah sighed nicholas drake watched as sarah left the room ann was sticking with her just as he had asked ann was dedicated and tenacious sarah would be no match for her unless she elected to turn and literally run but if she did that ampwell they would have to take stronger action these were critical times and sometimes strong action was essential just as in wartime but drake suspected dire action would not prove necessary true kenner had managed to disrupt the first two events but only because elf was a bunch of amateurs their brand of doityourself schoolboy spontaneity was unsuited to the demands of modern media drake had said that to henley a dozen times henley shrugged it off he was concerned about deniability well nerf could certainly deny they knew these clowns what a bunch of fuckups but this last event was different it had been planned far more carefullyit had to beand it was in professional hands kenner would never be able to disrupt it he could not even get there in time drake thought and between ted bradley and ann drake had lots of eyes and ears on that team as they progressed and just to be sure he had other surprises in store for kenner as well he flipped open his phone and dialed henley weve got them covered he said good where are you i am about to deliver the news to v henley said i am pulling up to his house now through binoculars kenner watched as the silver porsche convertible pulled into the driveway of the beach house a tall dark man in a blue golf shirt and tan slacks got out he wore a baseball cap and dark glasses but kenner recognized him at once as henley the head of pr for nerf that closed the circle he thought he put the binoculars down on the fence and paused to consider the implications do you know who he is sir the young fbi agent said standing by his side he was just a kid no more than twentyfive yes kenner said i know who he is they were standing on the cliffs of santa monica overlooking the beach and the ocean the beach here was several hundred yards wide from the shore to the bike path then a line of houses packed close together along the coast highway then six lanes of roaring traffic even though they abutted the highway the houses were phenomenally expensivetwenty or thirty million dollars each it was said and perhaps much more they were inhabited by some of the wealthiest people in california henley was putting up the cloth top on his porsche he moved in a precise almost fussy way then he went to the gate and buzzed it the house he was entering was ultramodern curving shapes of glass it glistened like a jewel in the morning sun henley went inside the gate closed behind him but you dont care about people entering the house the fbi agent said thats right kenner said i dont you dont want a list or a record of who no but it might prove no kenner said the kid was trying to be helpful but it was annoying i dont care about any of that i just want to know when they all leave like if they go on vacation or something yes kenner said what if they leave a maid behind they wont kenner said actually sir im pretty sure they will these guys always leave somebody to watch the house no kenner said this house will clear out everybody will go the kid frowned whose house is it anyway it belongs to a man named v allen willy kenner said he might as well tell him hes a philanthropist uhhuh what is he mixed up in the mob or something you might say kenner said sort of a protection racket it figures the kid said nobody makes that much money without a story behind it you know what i mean kenner said he did in fact v allen willys story was as typically american as horatio algers al willy had started a chain of inexpensive clothing stores taking clothes sewn in thirdworld sweatshops and selling them in western cities for thirty times the cost after ten years he sold his company for million soon after he became by his own definition a radical socialist a crusader for a sustainable world and an advocate for environmental justice the exploitations he had found so profitable he now attacked with the money he had made from them he was fiery and righteous and with the v added to his name memorable too however his attacks often led companies to pull out of their third world factories which were then taken over by chinese corporations that paid local workers even less than before thus by any sensible account v allen willy was exploiting workers twiceonce to make his fortune and a second time to assuage his guilty conscience at their expense he was a strikingly handsome man and not stupid just an egotistical and impractical dogooder currently he was said to be writing a book on the precautionary principle he had also started the v allen willy foundation which supported the cause of environmental justice through dozens of organizations including nerf and he was important enough to rate a personal visit from henley himself so hes a rich environmentalist the fbi kid said thats right kenner said the kid nodded okay he said but i still dont get it what makes you think a rich guy would leave his house empty i cant tell you that kenner said but he will and i want to know the minute it happens he handed the agent a card call this number the kid looked at the card thats it thats it kenner said and when is this going to happen soon kenner said his phone buzzed he flipped it open it was a text message from sanjong they found av scorpio i have to go kenner said freeway wednesday october pm nonsense ted bradley said sitting back in the passenger seat as evans drove to van nuys you cant have all the fun pietro i know youve been going on these secret excursions for the last week im coming too you cant come ted evans said they wont allow it let me worry about that okay he said grinning evans thought whats going on bradley was staying so close he was practically holding his hand he refused to leave him alone evanss cell phone rang it was sarah where are you she said almost to the airport i have ted with me uhhuh she said in the vague tone that meant she couldnt talk well we just got to the airport and there seems to be a problem what kind of a problem legal she said what does that mean evans said but even as he spoke he was turning off the road toward the gate leading to the runway and he could see for himself herb lowenstein was standing there with eight security guards and it looked like they were sealing the doors to mortons jet evans went through the gate and got out of the car whats going on herb the aircraft is being sealed herb said as required by law what law george mortons estate is now in probate in case youve forgotten and the contents of said estate including all bank accounts and real property must be sealed pending federal evaluation and assessing of death taxes this aircraft will remain sealed until the conclusion of that evaluation six to nine months from now at that moment kenner pulled up in a town car he introduced himself shook hands with lowenstein so its a matter of probate he said thats right lowenstein said kenner said im surprised to hear you say that why george morton is deceased is he i hadnt heard they found his body yesterday evans and bradley went up and made the identification and the medical examiner concurred lowenstein hesitated fractionally i presume so you presume surely youve received documentation from the medical examiner to that effect the autopsy was performed last night i presumei believe that we have the documentation may i see it i believe it is at the office kenner said may i see it that would merely cause unnecessary delay of my work here lowenstein turned to evans did you or did you not make a positive identification of mortons body i did evans said and you ted yeah bradley said i did it was him all right it was george poor guy kenner said to lowenstein id still like to see the medical examiners notification lowenstein snorted you have no basis for such a request and i formally deny it i am the senior attorney in charge of the estate i am his designated executor and i have already told you that my office has the documentation in hand i heard you kenner said but i seem to remember that to falsely declare probate is fraud that could be quite serious for an officer of the court such as you look lowenstein said i dont know what your game is i merely want to see the document kenner said calmly theres a fax machine in the flight office right there he pointed to the building near the airplane you can have the document sent over in a few seconds and resolve this matter without difficulty or barring that you can call the medical examiners office in san francisco and confirm that they have in fact made a positive identification but we are in the presence of two eyewitnesses who these are the days of dna testing kenner said looking at his watch i recommend that you make the calls he turned to the security officers you can open the aircraft the security officers looked nonplussed mr lowenstein just a minute just a goddamned minute lowenstein said and stalked off toward the office putting his cell phone to his ear as he went open the plane kenner said he flipped open his wallet and showed the guards his badge yes sir they said another car pulled up and sarah got out with ann garner ann said whats the fuss just a little misunderstanding kenner said he introduced himself to her i know who you are she said with barely concealed hostility i thought you might kenner said smiling and i have to say she continued its guys like yousmart and unscrupulous and immoralwho have made our environment the polluted mess that it now is so lets just get that on the table right away i dont like you mr kenner i dont like you personally and i dont like what you do in the world and i dont like anything you stand for interesting kenner said perhaps some day you and i could have a detailed and specific conversation about exactly what is wrong with our environment and exactly who is responsible for making it a polluted mess whenever you want she said angrily good you have legal training no scientific training no what is your background i worked as a documentary film producer before i quit to raise my family ah but i am very dedicated to the environment and i have been all my life she said i read everything i read the science section of the new york times every tuesday cover to cover of course the new yorker and the new york review i am extremely well informed well then kenner said i look forward to our conversation the pilots were driving up to the gate they waited while it opened i think we can leave in a few minutes kenner said he turned to evans why dont you confirm that that is all right with mr lowenstein okay evans said and headed toward the flight office just so you know ann said were going with you i am and so is ted that will be delightful kenner said inside the flight office evans found lowenstein hunched over a phone in the back room reserved for pilots but im telling you the guy isnt going for it he wants documentation lowenstein said and then after a pause look nick im not going to lose my license over this one the guys got a law degree from harvard evans knocked on the door everything okay for us to leave just a minute lowenstein said into the phone he put his hand over the receiver youre going to leave now thats right unless you have the document amp it seems there is some confusion about the exact status of mortons estate then were going herb okay okay he turned back to the phone theyre leaving nick he said you want to stop them do it yourself in the cabin everyone was sitting down kenner went around passing out sheets of paper whats this bradley said with a glance to ann its a release kenner said ann was reading aloud liable in the event of death serious bodily injury disability dismembermentdismemberment thats right kenner said you need to understand that where we are going is extremely dangerous i strongly advise both of you not to come but if you insist on ignoring my advice you need to sign that where are we going bradley said i cant tell you that until the plane is in the air why is it dangerous do you have a problem signing the form kenner said no hell bradley scrawled his signature ann ann hesitated bit her lip and signed the pilot closed the doors the engines whined as they taxied up the runway the flight attendant asked what they would like to drink pulignymontrachet evans said ann said where are we going to an island off the coast of new guinea why there is a problem kenner said that has to be dealt with you want to be any more specific not right now the plane rose above the cloud layer in los angeles and turned west over the pacific en route wednesday october pm sarah felt relieved when jennifer haynes went to the front of the cabin to take a nap falling instantly asleep but she found it awkward to have ann and ted onboard conversation in the cabin was stilted kenner was not saying much ted was drinking heavily he said to ann just so you know mr kenner doesnt believe in anything that normal people believe in not even global warming or kyoto of course he doesnt believe in kyoto ann said hes an industry hit man representing coal and oil interests kenner said nothing he just handed her his card institute for risk analysis ann read aloud thats a new one ill add it to the list of phony rightwing fronts kenner said nothing because its all disinformation ann said the studies the press releases the flyers websites the organized campaigns the bigmoney smears let me tell you industry was thrilled when the us didnt sign kyoto kenner rubbed his chin and said nothing ann said were the worlds largest polluter and our government doesnt give a damn kenner smiled blandly so now the united states is an international pariah isolated from the rest of the world and justifiably despised because we failed to sign the kyoto protocol to attack a global problem she continued to goad him in this way and finally it seemed he had had enough tell me about kyoto ann he said why should we have signed it why because we have a moral obligation to join the rest of the civilized world in reducing carbon emissions to below levels what effect would that treaty have the whole world knows that it would reduce global temperatures in the year by how much i dont know what youre driving at dont you the answer is well known the effect of kyoto would be to reduce warming by degrees celsius in the year four hundredths of a degree do you dispute that outcome i certainly do four what hundredths of a degree thats ridiculous so you dont believe that would be the effect of the kyoto protocol well maybe because the united states didnt sign it no that would be the effect if we did sign it four hundredths of a degree no she said shaking her head i dont believe thats true the figure has been published a number of times in scientific journals i can give you the references raising his glass bradley said to ann this guy is real big on references as opposed to rhetoric kenner said nodding yes i am bradley belched four hundredths of a degree in a hundred years what a bunch of bullshit one could say so i just did bradley said but kyotos a first step ann said thats the point because if you believe in the precautionary principle as i do i didnt think the purpose of kyoto was to take a first step kenner said i thought the purpose was to reduce global warming well it is then why make a treaty that wont accomplish that that wont in effect do anything at all its a first step as i said tell me do you think its possible to reduce carbon dioxide of course there are a host of alternative energy sources just waiting to be adopted wind power solar waste geothermal tom wigley and a panel of seventeen scientists and engineers from around the world made a careful study and concluded it is not possible their paper was published in science they said there is no known technology capable of reducing carbon emissions or even holding them to levels many times higher than today they conclude that wind solar and even nuclear power will not be sufficient to solve the problem they say totally new and undiscovered technology is required thats crazy ann said amory lovins laid it all out twenty years ago wind and solar conservation energy efficiency theres no problem apparently there is lovins predicted that thirtyfive percent of us power would come from alternative energy by the year the actual figure turned out to be six percent not enough subsidies no country in the world produces thirtyfive percent renewable energy ann but countries like japan do much better than we do kenner said japan is five percent renewable germany is five percent england two percent denmark eight percent well she said it just means we have more work to do no question about that wind farms chop birds to pieces so they might not be so popular but solar panels would work silent efficient amp solar is great she said yes kenner said and all we need is about twentyseven thousand square kilometers of panels to do the job just cover the state of massachusetts with solar panels and wed be done of course by our energy needs will triple so maybe new york would be a better choice or texas nobody i know cares about texas ann said well there you are kenner said cover ten percent of texas and youre in business although he added texans would probably prefer to cover los angeles first youre making a joke not at all lets settle on nevada its all desert anyway but im curious to hear about your personal experience with alternative energy what about you yourself ann have you adopted alternative sources yes i have solar heating for my swimming pool the maid drives a hybrid what do you drive well i need a bigger car for the kids how big well i drive an suv sometimes what about your residence you have solar panels for your electricity well i had consultants come to the house only jerrymy husbandsays its too expensive to install but im working on him and your appliances amp every single one is energystar every one thats good and how large is your family i have two boys seven and nine wonderful how big is your house i dont know exactly how many square feet she hesitated ah hell tell him ann bradley said she has a huge fucking house must be ten fifteen thousand square feet absolutely beautiful and the grounds got to be an acre acre and a half sprinklers going day and night and such gorgeous landscapingshe has fundraisers there all the time always wonderful events kenner looked at her twelve thousand ann said square feet for four people kenner said well my motherinlaw lives with us sometimes and of course the maid in the back and do you have a second home kenner said shit shes got two bradley said got a fabulous place in aspen and a great house in maine as well that we inherited ann said my husband and that apartment in london bradley said is that yours or your husbands company or what the company kenner said how about travel you use private jets well i mean we dont own one but we catch rides whatever we go when people are going anyway we fill the plane up which is a good thing of course kenner said but i must admit im a little confused about the philosophy hey she said suddenly angry i live in a milieu where i have to keep up a certain standard its necessary for my husbands business andanyway where do you live i have an apartment in cambridge how big nine hundred square feet i do not own a car i fly coach i dont believe you she said i think youd better bradley said this guy knows what hes shut up ted ann said youre drunk not yet im not he said looking wounded im not judging you ann kenner said quietly i know youre a dedicated advocate im just trying to figure out what your real position is on the environment my position is human beings are heating the planet and poisoning the planet and we have a moral obligation to the biosphereto all the plants and animals that are being destroyed and to the unborn generations of human beingsto keep these catastrophic changes from taking place she sat back nodding her head so our moral obligation is to othersother plants animals and other people exactly we need to do what is in their interest what is in the interest of all of us conceivably their interest is not the same as ours conflict of interest is the usual case every creature has a right to live on the planet surely you dont believe that kenner said i do im not speciesist every living creature even the malaria parasite well it is part of nature then do you oppose the elimination of polio and smallpox they were part of nature too well i would have to say its part of the arrogant pattern of mankind changing the world to suit his purposes a testosteronedriven impulse not shared by women you didnt answer me kenner said do you oppose the elimination of polio and smallpox youre playing with words hardly is changing the world to suit ones purposes unnatural of course it is interfering with nature ever seen a termite mound a beaver dam those creatures change the environment dramatically affecting many other creatures are they interfering with nature the world is not in danger she said from termite mounds arguably it is the total weight of termites exceeds the total weight of all the humans in the world a thousand times greater in fact do you know how much methane termites produce and methane is a more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide i cant continue this ann said you enjoy arguing i dont i just want to make the world a better place im going to go read a magazine now she went to the front of the plane and sat down her back to kenner sarah stayed where she was her intentions are good she said and her information is bad kenner said a prescription for disaster ted bradley roused himself he had watched the debate between kenner and ann he liked ann he was pretty sure he had gone to bed with her when he was drinking he sometimes couldnt remember but he had a vaguely fond memory of ann and he assumed that was the reason for it i think youre being harsh bradley said in his presidential tone why should you call someone like ann a prescription for disaster she cares very much about these issues she has devoted her life to them really she cares so what kenner said caring is irrelevant desire to do good is irrelevant all that counts is knowledge and results she doesnt have the knowledgeand worse she doesnt know it human beings dont know how to do the things she believes ought to be done like what like managing the environment we dont know how to do that what are you talking about bradley said throwing his hands in the air this is nonsense of course we can manage the environment really do you know anything about the history of yellowstone park the first national park ive been there thats not what i asked could you just get to the point bradley said its pretty late for qanda professor you know what i mean all right then kenner said ill tell you yellowstone park he explained was the first wilderness to be set aside as a natural preserve anywhere in the world the region around the yellowstone river in wyoming had long been recognized for its wondrous scenic beauty lewis and clark sang its praises artists like bierstadt and moran painted it and the new northern pacific railroad wanted a scenic attraction to draw tourists west so in in part because of railroad pressure president ulysses grant set aside two million acres and created yellowstone national park there was only one problem unacknowledged then and later no one had any experience trying to preserve wilderness there had never been any need to do it before and it was assumed to be much easier than it proved to be when theodore roosevelt visited the park in he saw a landscape teeming with game there were thousands of elk buffalo black bear deer mountain lions grizzlies coyotes wolves and bighorn sheep by that time there were rules in place to keep things as they were soon after that the park service was formed a new bureaucracy whose sole job was to maintain the park in its original condition yet within ten years the teeming landscape that roosevelt saw was gone forever and the reason for this was the park managerscharged with keeping the park in pristine conditionhad taken a series of steps that they thought were in the best interest of preserving the park and its animals but they were wrong well bradley said our knowledge has increased with time amp no it hasnt kenner said thats my point its a perpetual claim that we know more today and its not borne out by what actually happened which was this the early park managers mistakenly believed that elk were about to become extinct so they tried to increase the elk herds within the park by eliminating predators to that end they shot and poisoned all the wolves in the park and they prohibited indians from hunting in the park though yellowstone was a traditional hunting ground protected the elk herds exploded and ate so much of certain trees and grasses that the ecology of the area began to change the elk ate the trees that the beavers used to make dams so the beavers vanished that was when the managers discovered beavers were vital to the overall water management of the region when the beavers disappeared the meadows dried up the trout and otter vanished soil erosion increased and the park ecology changed even further by the s it had become abundantly clear there were too many elk so the rangers began to shoot them by the thousands but the change in plant ecology seemed to be permanent the old mix of trees and grasses did not return it also became increasingly clear that the indian hunters of old had exerted a valuable ecological influence on the park lands by keeping down the numbers of elk moose and bison this belated recognition came as part of a more general understanding that native americans had strongly shaped the untouched wilderness that the first white men sawor thought they were seeingwhen they first arrived in the new world the untouched wilderness was nothing of the sort human beings on the north american continent had exerted a huge influence on the environment for thousands of yearsburning plains grasses modifying forests thinning specific animal populations and hunting others to extinction in retrospect the rule forbidding indians from hunting was seen as a mistake but it was just one of many mistakes that continued to be made in an unbroken stream by park managers grizzlies were protected then killed off wolves were killed off then brought back animal research involving field study and radio collars was halted then resumed after certain species were declared endangered a policy of fire prevention was instituted with no understanding of the regenerative effects of fire when the policy was finally reversed thousands of acres burned so hotly that the ground was sterilized and the forests did not grow back without reseeding rainbow trout were introduced in the s soon killing off the native cutthroat species and on and on and on so what you have kenner said is a history of ignorant incompetent and disastrously intrusive intervention followed by attempts to repair the intervention followed by attempts to repair the damage caused by the repairs as dramatic as any oil spill or toxic dump except in this case there is no evil corporation or fossil fuel economy to blame this disaster was caused by environmentalists charged with protecting the wilderness who made one dreadful mistake after anotherand along the way proved how little they understood the environment they intended to protect this is absurd bradley said to preserve a wilderness you just preserve it you leave it alone and let the balance of nature take over thats all that is required absolutely wrong kenner said passive protectionleaving things alonedoesnt preserve the status quo in a wilderness any more than it does in your backyard the world is alive ted things are constantly in flux species are winning losing rising falling taking over being pushed back merely setting aside wilderness doesnt freeze it in its present state any more than locking your children in a room will prevent them from growing up ours is a changing world and if you want to preserve a piece of land in a particular state you have to decide what that state is and then actively even aggressively manage it but you said we dont know how to do that correct we dont because any action you take causes change in the environment ted and any change hurts some plant or animal its inevitable preserving oldgrowth forest to help the spotted owl means kirtlands warbler and other species are deprived of the newgrowth forest they prefer there is no free lunch but no buts ted name an action that had only positive consequences okay i will banning cfcs for the ozone layer that harmed third world people by eliminating cheap refrigerants so that their food spoiled more often and more of them died of food poisoning but the ozone layer is more important perhaps to you they might disagree but were talking about whether you can take an action that does not have harmful consequences okay solar panels water recycling systems for houses enables people to put houses in remote wilderness areas where formerly they could not because of lack of water and power invades wilderness and thus endangers species that were previously unmolested banning ddt arguably the greatest tragedy of the twentieth century ddt was the best agent against mosquitoes and despite the rhetoric there was nothing anywhere near as good or as safe since the ban two million people a year have died unnecessarily from malaria mostly children all together the ban has caused more than fifty million needless deaths banning ddt killed more people than hitler ted and the environmental movement pushed hard for it but ddt was a carcinogen no it wasnt and everybody knew it at the time of the ban it was unsafe actually it was so safe you could eat it people did just that for two years in one experiment after the ban it was replaced by parathion which is really unsafe more than a hundred farm workers died in the months after the ddt ban because they were unaccustomed to handling really toxic pesticides we disagree about all this only because you lack the relevant facts or are unwilling to face up to the consequences of the actions of organizations you support banning ddt will someday be seen as a scandalous blunder ddt was never banned youre right countries were just told that if they used it they wouldnt get foreign aid kenner shook his head but the unarguable point based on un statistics is that before the ddt ban malaria had become almost a minor illness fifty thousand deaths a year worldwide a few years later it was once again a global scourge fifty million people have died since the ban ted once again there can be no action without harm a long silence followed ted shifted in his seat started to speak then closed his mouth again finally he said okay fine he adopted his most lofty presidential manner you have persuaded me i grant you the point so so the real question with any environmental action is do the benefits outweigh the harm because there is always harm okay okay so when do you hear any environmental group speak that way never theyre all absolutists they go before judges arguing that regulations should be imposed with no consideration of costs at all the requirement that regulations show a costbenefit was imposed on them by the courts after a period of wretched excess environmentalists screamed bloody murder about costbenefit requirements and theyre still screaming they dont want people to know how much their forays into regulation actually cost society and the world the most egregious example was the benzene regulations in the late s that were so expensive for so little benefit that they ended up costing twenty billion dollars for every year of life saved do you agree with that regulation well when you put it in those terms no what other terms are there ted besides the truth twenty billion dollars to save one year of life that was the cost of the regulation should you support organizations that push for such wasteful regulation no the lead benzene lobbying group in congress was nerf are you going to resign from its board of course not kenner just nodded slowly and there we have it sanjong was pointing to the computer screen and kenner came over sliding into the seat next to him the screen showed an aerial image of a tropical island heavily forested and a broad curving bay of blue water the photo seemed to be taken from a lowflying airplane around the bay were four weathered wood shacks those are new sanjong said they went up in the last twentyfour hours they look old yes but theyre not close inspection suggests that they are artificial they may be made out of plastic instead of wood the largest one appears to be a residence and the other three house equipment what kind of equipment kenner said nothing has been visible in the photographs the equipment was probably offloaded at night but i went back and got a decent description from hong kong customs the equipment consists of three hypersonic cavitation generators mounted in carbon matrix resonant impact assembly frames hypersonic cavitation equipment is for sale they got it i dont know how kenner and sanjong were huddled together speaking in low tones evans drifted over leaned in close whats a hypersonic whateveritis he said quietly cavitation generator kenner said its a highenergy acoustic device the size of a small truck that produces a radially symmetric cavitation field evans looked blank cavitation sanjong explained refers to the formation of bubbles in a substance when you boil water thats cavitation you can boil water with sound too but in this case the generators are designed to induce cavitation fields in a solid evans said what solid the earth kenner said i dont get it evans said theyre going to make bubbles in the ground like boiling water something like that yes why they were interrupted by the arrival of ann garner is this a boysonly meeting she said or can anyone sit in of course sanjong said tapping the keyboard the screen showed a dense array of graphs we were just reviewing the carbon dioxide levels of ice cores taken from vostok and from north grip in greenland you guys cant keep me in the dark forever you know ann said sooner or later we will land this plane and then im going to find out what youre really up to thats true kenner said why not tell me now kenner just shook his head the pilot clicked the radio check your seat belts please he said prepare for landing in honolulu ann said honolulu where did you think we were going i thought and then she broke off sarah thought she knows where we are going while they refueled at honolulu a customs inspector came onboard and asked to see their passports he seemed amused by the presence of ted bradley whom he referred to as mr president bradley in turn was pleased by the attention from a man in uniform after the customs officer checked their passports he said to the group your destination is filed as gareda in the solomon islands i just want to make sure youre aware of the travel advisory for gareda most embassies have warned visitors against going there in view of the current conditions what current conditions ann said there are rebels active on the island there have been a number of murders the australian army went in last year and captured most of the rebels but not all there have been three murders in the last week including two foreigners one of the corpses was uh mutilated and the head was taken what the head was taken not while he was alive ann turned to kenner thats where we are going gareda kenner nodded slowly what do you mean the head was taken presumably it was for the skull the skull she repeated so ampyoure talking about headhunters amp kenner nodded im getting off this plane she said and gathering up her hand bag walked down the stairs jennifer was just waking up whats her problem she doesnt like goodbyes sanjong said ted bradley was stroking his chin in what he imagined was a thoughtful manner he said a foreigner had his head cut off apparently it was worse than that the customs officer said jesus whats worse than that bradley said laughing the customs officer said the situation on the ground is not entirely clear the reports are conflicting bradley stopped laughing no seriously i want to know whats worse than beheading there was a brief silence they ate him sanjong said bradley rocked back in his chair they ate him the customs officer nodded parts of him he said at least thats the report holy shit bradley said which parts never mind i dont want to know jesus christ they ate the guy kenner looked at him you dont have to go ted he said you can leave too i have to admit im thinking about it he said in his judicious presidential tone getting eaten is not a distinguished end to a career think of any of the greats think of elviseaten john lennoneaten i mean its not how we want to be remembered he fell silent lowering his chin to his chest sunk deep in thought then raising it again it was a gesture hed done a hundred times on television but no he said finally ill accept the danger if youre going im going were going kenner said to gareda wednesday october pm it was nine hours flight time to kontag airport in gareda the cabin was dark most of them slept kenner as usual stayed awake sitting in the back with sanjong talking quietly peter evans woke up about four hours into the flight his toes still burned from the antarctic episode and his back was very sore from his being bounced around in the flash flood but the pain in his toes reminded him that he was supposed to check them daily to see if they were becoming infected he got up and went to the back of the plane where kenner was sitting he pulled off his socks and inspected his toes sniff em kenner said what smell them you have any gangrene youll smell it first they hurt burn mostly just at night kenner nodded youll be all right i think youll keep them all evans sat back thinking how strange it was to have a conversation about losing his toes somehow it made his back hurt more he went into the bathroom at the back of the plane and rummaged through the drawers looking for painkillers all they had was advil so he took that then came back that was a clever story you arranged in honolulu he said too bad it didnt work on ted kenner just stared its not a story sanjong said there were three murders yesterday oh and they ate somebody that was the report oh evans said going forward into the dark cabin evans saw sarah sitting up she whispered cant sleep no a little achy you yeah toes hurt from the frostbite me too she nodded toward the galley any food back there i think so she got up headed back he trailed after her she said the tops of my ears hurt too mine are okay he said she rummaged around found some cold pasta she held a plate out to him he shook his head she spooned out a plate for herself and began to eat so how long have you known jennifer i dont really know her he said i just met her recently at the law office why is she coming with us i think she knows kenner she does kenner said from his chair how shes my niece really sarah said how long has she been your nienever mind im sorry its late shes my sisters kid her parents died in a plane crash when she was eleven oh shes been on her own a lot oh evans looked at sarah and thought once again that it was a kind of trick how she could get up from sleeping and appear beautiful and perfect and she had on that perfume that had driven him quietly crazy from the moment he first smelled it well sarah said she seems very nice i dont uh theres nothing amp its fine she said you dont have to pretend with me peter im not pretending he said leaning slightly closer smelling her perfume yes you are she moved away from him and sat down opposite kenner what happens when we get to gareda she said the thing about her evans thought was that she had the most chilling ability to instantly behave as if he did not exist right now she was not looking at him she was focusing all her attention on kenner talking with apparent concentration to kenner and behaving as if no one else were there was that supposed to be provocative he thought was that supposed to be a turnon to get him excited and start the chase because it didnt make him feel that way at all it pissed him off he wanted to slap his hand down on the counter make a big noise and say hello earth to sarah or something like that but somehow he thought that that would make things worse he could imagine her annoyed glance youre such a baby something like that it made him long for somebody uncomplicated the way janis was uncomplicated just a great body and a voice you could tune out that was exactly what he needed now he gave a long sigh she heard it glanced up at him and then patted the seat beside her come sit here peter she said and join the conversation and she gave him a big dazzling smile he thought i am very confused this is resolution bay sanjong said holding out his computer screen it showed the bay then zoomed back to show a map of the entire island its on the northeast side of the island the airport is on the west coast its about twentyfive miles away the island of gareda looked like a big avocado immersed in the water with jagged edges along the shore there is a mountain spine running along the center of the island sanjong said in places its three thousand feet high the jungle in the interior of the island is very dense essentially impenetrable unless you follow the roads or one of the footpaths through the jungle but we cant make our way cross country so we take a road sarah said maybe sanjong said but the rebels are known to be in this area here he circled the center of the island with his finger and they have split up in two or possibly three groups their exact locations are not known they have taken over this small village here pavutu near the north coast that seems to be their headquarters and they presumably have roadblocks up and probably patrols on the jungle paths then how do we get to resolution bay kenner said by helicopter if we can ive arranged for one but this is not the most reliable part of the world if we cant do that well head out by car see how far we can get but at this point we just dont know how were going to do it evans said and when we get to resolution bay there are four new structures on the beach we have to take them down and dismantle the machinery inside make them inoperable we also have to find their submarine tender and dismantle the submarine what submarine sarah said they leased a small twoman research sub its been in the region for the last two weeks doing what were pretty sure we know now the whole solomon island chain of more than nine hundred islands is located within a very active geological part of the world in terms of plate tectonics the solomons are a part of the world where plates crunch together thats why they have many volcanoes there and so many earthquakes its a very unstable region the pacific plate collides and slides under the oldowan java plateau the result is the solomon trench a huge undersea feature that curves in an arc all along the northern side of the island chain its very deep between two thousand and six thousand feet the trench is just north of resolution bay too so its an active geological region with a deep trench evans said i still dont see the game lot of undersea volcanoes lot of slope debris and therefore the potential for landslides kenner said landslides evans rubbed his eyes it was late undersea landslides kenner said sarah said theyre trying to cause an undersea landslide we think so somewhere along the slope of the solomon trench probably at the fivehundred to onethousandfoot depth evans said and what would that do an undersea landslide kenner said to sanjong show them the big map sanjong brought up a map of the entire pacific basin from siberia to chile australia to alaska okay kenner said now draw a straight line out from resolution bay and see where it takes you california right in about eleven hours evans frowned an undersea landslide amp displaces an enormous volume of water very quickly that is the most common way a tsunami is formed once propagated the wave front will travel right across the pacific at five hundred miles an hour holy shit evans said how big a wave are we talking actually its a series whats called a wave train the undersea landslide in alaska in generated a wave fortyseven feet high but the height of this one is impossible to anticipate because wave height is a function of the shoreline it hits in parts of california it could be up to sixty feet high a sixstory building oh boy sarah said and how much time do we have before they do this evans said the conference runs two more days the wave will take a day to cross the pacific so amp we have one day at most yes one day to land make our way to resolution bay and stop them stop who ted bradley said yawning and coming back toward them jesus do i have a headache or what how about a little hair of the dog he paused stared at the group looking from face to face hey whats going on here you guys look like i interrupted a funeral to gareda thursday october am three hours later the sun came up and the plane began its descent now it was flying low passing over green forested islands fringed in an unearthly pale blue they saw few roads and few towns mostly small villages ted bradley looked out the window isnt it beautiful he said truly unspoiled paradise this is what is vanishing in our world seated opposite him kenner said nothing he too was staring out the window dont you think the problem bradley said is that we have lost contact with nature no kenner said i think the problem is i dont see many roads dont you think bradley said thats because its the white man not the natives who wants to conquer nature to beat it into submission no i dont think that i do bradley said i find that people who live closer to the earth in their villages surrounded by nature that those people have a natural ecological sense and a feeling for the fitness of it all spent a lot of time in villages ted kenner said as a matter of fact yes i shot a picture in zimbabwe and another one in botswana i know what i am talking about uhhuh you stayed in villages all that time no i stayed in hotels i had to for insurance but i had a lot of experiences in villages there is no question that village life is best and ecologically soundest frankly i think everyone in the world should live that way and certainly we should not be encouraging village people to industrialize thats the problem i see so you want to stay in a hotel but you want everybody else to stay in a village no youre not hearing where do you live now ted kenner said sherman oaks is that a village no well its a sort of a village i suppose you could say ampbut i have to be in la for my work bradley said i dont have a choice ted have you ever stayed in a thirdworld village even for one night bradley shifted in his seat as i said before i spent a lot of time in the villages while we were shooting i know what im talking about if village life is so great why do you think people want to leave they shouldnt leave thats my point you know better than they do kenner said bradley paused then blurted well frankly if you must know yes i do know better i have the benefit of education and broader experience and i know firsthand the dangers of industrial society and how it is making the whole world sick so yes i think i do know what is best for them certainly i know what is ecologically best for the planet i have a problem kenner said with other people deciding what is in my best interest when they dont live where i do when they dont know the local conditions or the local problems i face when they dont even live in the same country as i do but they still feelin some faroff western city at a desk in some glass skyscraper in brussels or berlin or new yorkthey still feel that they know the solution to all my problems and how i should live my life i have a problem with that whats your problem bradley said i mean look you dont seriously believe everybody on the planet should do whatever they want do you that would be terrible these people need help and guidance and youre the one to give it to these people okay so its not politically correct to talk this way but do you want all these people to have the same horrific wasteful living standard that we do in america and to a lesser extent europe i dont see you giving it up no ted said but i conserve where i can i recycle i support a carbonneutral lifestyle the point is if all these other people industrialize it will add a terrible terrible burden of global pollution to the planet that should not happen i got mine but you cant have yours its a question of facing realities bradley said your realities not theirs at that point sanjong beckoned to kenner excuse me kenner said and got up walk away if you want bradley said but you know i speak truth he gestured to the flight attendant and held up his glass just one more sweetie one more for the road sanjong said the helicopters not there yet whats the matter it was coming over from another island theyve closed the air space because theyre worried the rebels have surfacetoair missiles kenner frowned how long until we land ten minutes keep your fingers crossed abandoned ted bradley slid to the other side of the plane to sit with peter evans isnt it gorgeous he said look at that water crystalline and pure look at the depth of that blue look at those beautiful villages in the heart of nature evans was staring out the window but saw only poverty the villages were clusters of corrugated tin shacks the roads red mud ruts the people looked poorly dressed and moved slowly there was a depressing disconsolate feeling about them he imagined sickness disease infant death amp gorgeous bradley said pristine i cant wait to get down there this is as good as a vacation did anyone here know the solomons were so beautiful from the front jennifer said inhabited by headhunters for most of history yes well thats all in the past bradley said if it ever existed at all i mean all that talk about cannibalism everybody knows it is not true i read a book by some professor there never were any cannibals anywhere in the world its all a big myth another example of the way the white man demonizes people of color when columbus came to the west indies he thought they told him there were cannibals there but it wasnt true i forget the details there are no cannibals anywhere just a myth why are you staring at me that way evans turned bradley was talking to sanjong who was indeed staring well bradley said youre giving me a look okay buddy boy does that mean you disagree with me youre truly a fool sanjong said in an astonished voice have you ever been to sumatra cant say that i have new guinea no always wanted to go buy some tribal art great stuff borneo no but i always wanted to go there too that sultan whats his name he did a great job remodeling the dorchester in london well sanjong said if you go to borneo you will see the dyak longhouses where they still display the skulls of the people they killed oh thats just touristattraction stuff in new guinea they had a disease called kuru transmitted by eating the brains of their enemies thats not true gajdusek won a nobel prize for it they were eating brains all right but that was a long time ago sixties seventies you guys just like to tell scare stories bradley said at the expense of the indigenous people of the world come on face the facts human beings are not cannibals sanjong blinked he looked at kenner kenner shrugged absolutely beautiful down there bradley said looking out the window and it looks like were going to land vii resolution gareda thursday october am kotak field was sticky with humid heat they walked to the small open shack that was marked kastom in roughly painted letters to one side of the building was a wooden fence and a gate marked with a red handprint and a sign that said nogot rot ah nougat rot bradley said must be a local tooth problem actually sanjong said the red hand means kapu forbidden the sign says no got right which is pidgin for you dont have permission to pass huh i see evans found the heat almost unbearable he was tired after the long plane ride and anxious about what lay ahead of them alongside him jennifer walked casually seemingly fresh and energetic youre not tired evans said to her i slept on the plane he looked back at sarah she too seemed to have plenty of energy striding forward well im pretty tired you can sleep in the car jennifer said she didnt seem very interested in his condition he found it a little irritating and it was certainly debilitatingly hot and humid by the time they reached the customs house evanss shirt was soaked his hair was wet sweat was dripping off his nose and chin onto the papers he was supposed to fill out the pen from the ink ran in the puddles of his sweat he glanced up at the customs officer a dark muscular man with curly hair and wearing pressed white trousers and a white shirt his skin was dry he looked almost cool he met evanss eyes and smiled oh waitman dis no taim bilong san you tumas hotpela evans nodded yes true he said he had no idea what the man had said sanjong translated its not even the hot time of summer but youre too much hot you tumas hot ya he got that right whered you learn pidgin new guinea i worked there a year doing what but sanjong was hurrying on with kenner who was waving to a young man who had driven up in a land rover the man jumped out he was dark wearing tan shorts and a tshirt his shoulders were covered in tattoos his grin was infectious hey jon kanner hamamas klok he pounded his chest with his fist and hugged kenner he has a happy heart sanjong said they know each other the newcomer was introduced all around as henry with no other name hanri he said grinning broadly pumping their hands then he turned to kenner i understand there is trouble with the helicopter kenner said what no trabel me got klostu long he laughed its just over there my friend he said in perfectly accented british english good kenner said we were worried yas but serious jon we better hariyap mi yet harim planti yangpelas krosim pasim birua got plenti masket noken stap gut ya evans had the impression henry was speaking pidgin so the rest of them would not understand kenner nodded i heard that too he said lots of rebels here theyre mostly young boys and angry and well armed figures i worry for the helicopter my friend why do you know something about the pilot yes i do why who is the pilot henry giggled and slapped kenner on the back i am well then we should go they all started down the road away from the airfield the jungle rose up on both sides of the road the air buzzed with the sound of cicadas evans looked back with longing at the beautiful white gulfstream jet poised on the runway against a blue sky the pilots in their white shirts and black trousers were checking the wheels he wondered if he would ever see the airplane again kenner was saying and we heard henry some people were killed henry made a face no just killed jon olpela ya so we heard ya distru so it was true the rebels did it henry nodded oh this new chif him name sambuca like a drink dont ask why this name him crazy man jon longlong man tru everything back to olpela for dis guy old ways are better allatime allatime well the old ways are better ted bradley said trudging along behind if you ask me henry turned you got cell phones you got computers you got antibiotics medicines hospitals and you say the old ways are better yes because they are bradley said they were more human they allowed more of the human texture to life believe me if you ever had a chance to experience these socalled modern miracles yourself you would know that theyre not so great i got a degree at the university of melbourne henry said so i have some familiarity oh well then bradley said and under his breath he muttered might have told me asshole by the way henry said take my advice dont do that here dont talk under your breath why not in this country some pelas think it means youve been possessed by a demon and theyll get scared and they might kill you i see charming so in this country if you have something to say you speak up ill remember that sarah walked alongside bradley but she was not listening to the conversation henry was a character caught between worlds sometimes speaking in an oxbridge accent sometimes dropping into pidgin it didnt bother her she was looking at the jungle the air on the road was hot and still trapped between the huge trees that rose up on both sides of the path the trees were forty fifty feet high covered in twisted vines and at ground level in the darkness beneath the canopy above huge ferns grew so thickly they presented an impenetrable barrier a solid green wall she thought you could walk five feet into that and get lost forever youd never find your way out again along the road were the rusted hulks of longabandoned cars windshields smashed chassis crumpled and corroded brown and yellow as she walked past she saw ripped upholstery old dashboards with clocks and speedometers ripped out leaving gaping holes they turned right onto a side path and she saw the helicopter ahead she gasped it was beautiful painted green with a crisp white stripe the metal blades and struts gleaming everybody commented on it yes the outside is good henry said but i think the inside the engine maybe is not so good he wiggled his hand so so great bradley said speaking for myself id prefer it the other way around they opened the doors to get in in the back were stacks of wooden crates with sawdust they smelled of grease i got the supplies you wanted he said to kenner and enough ammunition oh ya all things you asked for then we can go kenner said in the back sarah buckled her belt she put on headphones the engines whined and the blades spun faster the helicopter shuddered as it started to lift off we have too many people henry said so we will have to hope for the best cross your fingers and giggling maniacally he lifted off into the blue sky to resolution thursday october am the jungle slid beneath them mile after mile of dense canopy forest in places wisps of mist clung to the trees particularly at the higher altitudes sarah was surprised at how mountainous the island was how rugged the terrain she saw no roads at all from time to time they passed over a small village in a jungle clearing otherwise nothing but miles of trees henry was flying due north intending to drop them off along the coast a few miles west of resolution bay charming villages ted bradley said as they flew over another one what do the people grow here nothing lands no good here they work the copper mines henry said oh thats too bad not if you live here biggest money they ever saw people kill to work in the mines what i mean to say is they kill some murders occur every year bradley was shaking his head terrible just terrible but look down there he said pointing theres a village has actual thatched huts is that the old style the old way of doing things still kept alive no man henry said thats a rebel village thats new style big thatch haus very impressive big house for chif he explained that sambuca had instructed the people in every village to build these huge threestory structures of thatch complete with ladders going up to high walkways at the third level the idea was to give rebels a view over the jungle so they could see the arrival of australian troops but in the old days henry said the people never had such buildings in gareda the architecture was low and open erected mostly to protect against rain and let smoke out there was no need for high buildings which were impractical since they would blow down in the next cyclone anyway but sambuca he wants them now so he makes the yangpelas the young fellows build them there may be six or eight on this island now in rebel territory so were going over rebel territory now bradley said so far so good henry said and he giggled again not so long now well see the coast in four five minutes andoh damn shit what they were skimming the forest canopy i made a big mistake what mistake bradley said tumas longwe es youre too far east kenner said damn shit damn damn shit hang on henry banked the helicopter steeply but not before they all glimpsed a huge clearing with four of the enormous thatch structures interspersed with the more common houses of wood and corrugated tin there were a halfdozen trucks clustered in the muddy center of the clearing some of the trucks had machine guns mounted on their backs what is this bradley said looking down this is much bigger than the others this pavutu rebel headquarters and then the clearing was gone the helicopter moving swiftly away henry was breathing hard they could hear his breath over the earphones kenner said nothing he was staring intently at henry well i think were all right bradley said it looks like they didnt see us oh yeah henry said nice wish why bradley said even if they did see uswhat can they do they have radios henry said theyre not stupid these yangpelas what do you mean they want this helicopter why can they fly it orait orait yes because they want me too henry explained that for months now no helicopters had been allowed on the island this one had been brought over only because kenner had pulled some very important strings but it was specifically not to fall into rebel hands well they probably think were going south bradley said i mean we are arent we these boys know better henry said they know they know what bradley said kenner said the elf would have had to buy off the rebels in order to land on the island so the rebels know theres something going on at resolution bay when they saw this helicopter they knew where it was going these boys arent stupid henry said again i never said they were bradley protested ya but you think it i know you waitman this in the back of your tongue you think it i promise you i did not bradley said really i have no such feelings at all you simply didnt understand me ya henry said sarah was sitting in the middle of the second seat wedged between ted and jennifer peter and sanjong were behind in the little backseat with all the boxes she couldnt really see out the windows so she had trouble following the discussion she wasnt sure what it was all about so she asked jennifer do you understand whats going on jennifer nodded as soon as the rebels saw the helicopter they knew it was going to resolution now whatever we do theyll be expecting it to show up in that area they have radios and theyre in different groups scattered around they can keep an eye on us and theyll be there when we land i am very sorry henry said so very sorry never mind kenner said his voice was neutral what do we do now henry said kenner said continue exactly as planned go north and put us down on the coast there was no mistaking the urgency in his voice in the backseat pushed up against sanjong smelling the grease that coated the machine guns peter evans wondered where this urgency came from he looked at his watch it was nine in the morning which meant that of their original twentyfour hours only twenty remained but this was a small island and it should allow plenty of time and then he had a thought wait a minute he said what time is it in los angeles sanjong said theyre on the other side of the dateline twentyseven hours behind no i mean elapsed time actual time difference six hours and you calculated a transit time of what thirteen hours sanjong said i think we made a mistake evans said biting his lip he wasnt sure how much he should say in front of henry and indeed sanjong was shaking his head indicating not now but they had made a mistake there was no doubt about it assuming that drake wanted the tidal wave to hit on the last day of the conference he would surely want it to happen during the morning that would provide the most visible disaster and it would allow the whole afternoon for discussion and media interviews afterward every television camera in america would be at that conference talking to the scientists who just happened to be there it would create a gigantic media event so evans thought assume the wave was to hit los angeles no later than noon tomorrow subtract thirteen hours for the wave front to cross the pacific that meant the wave had to be propagated at eleven pm los angeles time which meant that the local time in gareda would be ampfive pm five pm today they didnt have a day to stop this thing from happening they had just eight hours so that was the reason for kenners urgency that was why he was going ahead with his plan despite the new problem he had no choice and he knew it he had to land on the coast somewhere very near resolution there wasnt enough time to do anything else even though it was possible they were heading right into a trap leaving the forest behind the helicopter burst out over blue water and turned around going east evans saw a narrow sandy beach with patches of ragged lava rock and mangrove swamps clinging to the waters edge the helicopter swung low and followed the beach heading east how far from resolution are we kenner said five six kilometers henry said and how far from pavutu maybe ten kilometers on a mud track okay kenner said lets find a place to put down theres a good place i know maybe one kilometer ahead fine go there evans was thinking five kilometers walking on a beach that was about three miles should take them an hour and a half at most they could make it to resolution bay well before noon that would give them this the spot henry said a finger of rugged lava protruded into the ocean centuries of waves had smoothed it enough to make a landing possible do it kenner said the helicopter circled prepared to descend evans was looking out over at the dense wall of jungle where it met the beach he saw tire tracks in the sand and a sort of gap in the trees that was probably a road and those tire tracks say listen evans said i think sanjong jabbed him in the ribs hard evans grunted what is it peter kenner said uh nothing were going down henry said the helicopter descended smoothly slowly settling onto the lava waves lapped at the edge of the rock pad it was peaceful kenner looked out the bubble canopy scanning the area okay this good spot henry said he seemed nervous now that they were down i dont want to stay so long jon because maybe they come soon amp yeah i understand kenner cracked open the door then paused so alla okay jon just fine henry very nice spot get out and open this back door for us will you yeah jon i think you can get it get out and with astonishing swiftness there was a gun jammed against henrys head henry sputtered and moaned in fear as he fumbled with his door but jon i need to stay inside jon youve been a bad boy henry kenner said you going to shoot me now jon not now kenner said and abruptly he shoved him out henry tumbled onto the sharp lava howling in pain kenner slid over to the pilots seat and shut the door immediately henry was up pounding on the canopy his eyes wild he was terrified jon jon please jon sorry henry kenner pushed the stick and the helicopter began to rise into the air they had not climbed twenty feet before a dozen men emerged from the jungle all along the beach and began firing at them with rifles kenner swung out over the ocean going north away from the island looking back they could see henry standing forlorn on the lava some of the men were running toward him he threw up his hands little shit bradley said he would have gotten us killed he may still kenner said they flew due north over open water so what do we do now sarah said land on the other side of the bay walk in from the other side no kenner said thats what theyll expect us to do so then amp we wait a few minutes and go back to the western side same as before they wont be expecting that they may well go to a different spot farther away from the bay no closer wont elf hear us doesnt matter by now they know were coming in the back sanjong was breaking open the wooden cases and reaching for the guns he stopped abruptly bad news he said what no guns he pushed a lid higher these crates contain ammunition but no guns that little bastard bradley said what do we do now sarah said we go in anyway kenner said he turned the helicopter and skimming the water headed back to gareda resolution thursday october am the western arc of resolution bay consisted of a hilly junglecovered spine that jutted out into the water terminating in a rocky point the outer side of the spine flattened into a rocky plateau some fifty feet above the beach which curved off to the west the plateau was protected by high overhanging trees that was where the helicopter now stood covered in a camouflage tarp overlooking the beach below evans glanced back at it hoping that it would blend into the landscape but instead it was only too obviously visible especially when seen from above the group was now already fifty feet above it as they scrambled and clawed up the jungle slope that rose steeply from the beach it was surprisingly tough going they were climbing single file and had to be careful because the ground underfoot was muddy bradley had already slipped and slid some ten yards down his whole left side was covered in black mud and evans could see that there was a fat leech on the back of his neck but he decided not to point it out just then no one spoke the team of six climbed in silence trying to make as little noise as possible despite their best efforts they were fairly noisy the undergrowth crackling beneath their feet small branches snapping as they reached to pull themselves up kenner was somewhere farther ahead leading the way evans couldnt see him sanjong was bringing up the rear he had a rifle slung over his shoulder he had brought it with him and assembled it from a small briefcase in the copter kenner carried a pistol the rest of them were unarmed the air was still wet and stupefyingly hot the jungle buzzed an incessant background drone of insects halfway up the slope it began to rain lightly at first and then a stupendous tropical downpour in a moment they were drenched water streamed down the hillside it was slipperier than ever now they were two hundred feet above the beach and the prospect of losing footing was clearly nervousmaking peter looked up at sarah who was just ahead of him she moved with her usual agility and grace she seemed to be dancing up the hillside there were times he thought huffing his way along when he really resented her and jennifer who was ahead of sarah was climbing with equal ease she hardly reached for the tree limbs though evans was grabbing for them constantly feeling panic as his fingers slipped on the funguscovered bark watching jennifer he had the sense that she was almost too good at this too skilled going up this treacherous jungle hill she radiated a kind of indifference as if it were all to be expected it was the attitude of an army ranger or the member of some elite force tough experienced conditioned unusual he thought for a lawyer more than unusual but then she was kenners niece and farther up was bradley with the leech on his neck he was muttering and cursing and grunting with every step finally jennifer punched him then held a finger to her lips be quiet bradley nodded and though he clearly disliked taking advice from her he was silent from then on at around three hundred feet they felt the stirring of a breeze and soon after they climbed onto the crest of the ridge the foliage was so thick they could not see down into resolution bay below but they could hear the shouts of working men and the intermittent rumble of machinery briefly there was a kind of electronic hum a sound that started softly then built quickly until in a few moments it seemed literally to fill the air and to make evanss eardrums ache then the sound was gone evans looked at kenner kenner just nodded sanjong climbed a tree scaling it quickly from his vantage point he could look down on the valley he came back down and pointed to a hill leading down to the bay he shook his head too steep at this point he indicated they should circle around and descend on a more gentle slope so they started out following the ridge around the bay most of the time they could see nothing but the sixfoottall ferns dripping with water after half an hour there was a sudden break in the foliage and they had a panoramic view of resolution bay spread out below them the bay was about a mile wide and had structures set at intervals on the sand the largest one was to the far right at the eastern edge of the bay three others of equal size were arranged at intervals making a sort of triangle in the western section of the bay evans could see there was something funny about the houses though something odd about the wood that was used he squinted sanjong nudged him he wiggled his hand in the air evans looked yes it was true the wooden structures were moving fluttering in the air they were tents tents made to look like wooden structures and pretty good ones too it was no wonder they had fooled the aerial survey evans thought as they watched men emerged from one or another of the tents and shouted to others down the beach they were speaking english but it was difficult to make out what they were saying at this distance most of it seemed to be technical sanjong nudged evans again evans saw him make a kind of pyramid with three fingers then he began to wiggle the fingers so apparently they were tuning the generators in the tent or something like that the others in the group did not seem to be interested in the details they were breathing hard catching their breaths in the soft breeze and staring down at the bay and probably thinking as evans was that there were a lot of men down there at least eight or ten all in jeans and work shirts christ theres a lot of those bastards bradley muttered jennifer nudged him hard in the ribs he mouthed oh sorry she shook her head she mouthed youll get us killed bradley made a face he clearly thought she was being melodramatic then from the jungle below them they heard a cough they froze they waited in silence they heard the buzz of cicadas the occasional call of distant birds it came again the same soft cough as if the person was trying not to make noise sanjong crouched down listening hard the cough came a third time and to evans there was the strangest sensation of familiarity about it it reminded him of his grandfather who had had heart failure when evans was a kid his grandfather used to cough like that in the hospital weakly little coughs now there was silence they had not heard the cougher move awayif he had he was truly noiselessbut the sound stopped kenner looked at his watch they waited five minutes then he signaled for them to continue moving east curving around the bay just as they were leaving they heard the cough once more this time there were three in succession uh uh uh then nothing kenner signaled move out they had not gone a hundred yards when they came upon a path it was a clear trail even though the overhanging branches hung low it must be an animal trail evans thought wondering vaguely what kind of animals they might be there were probably feral pigs here there were pigs everywhere he vaguely remembered stories of people being surprised by pigs gored by the tusks of an aggressive boar that charged out of the underbrush the first thing he heard however was a mechanical click he knew instantly what it was the sound of a gun being cocked the entire group froze strung out in single file nobody moved another click and another click evans looked around quickly he saw nobody it seemed they were alone in the jungle then he heard a voice dai nogot sok waitman indai stopim evans had no idea what it meant but the meaning was clear enough to them all nobody moved from the bushes ahead a young boy emerged he was wearing boots without socks green shorts a madonna world tour tshirt and a baseball cap that said perth glory a halfsmoked cigarette stub hung from his lips he had an ammunition belt over one shoulder and a machine gun slung over the other shoulder he was five feet tall and could not have been more than ten or eleven he pointed his gun with casual insolence okay waitman you prisner biulong me savve bookim dano and he jerked his thumb indicating they should move forward gohet for a moment they were all too astonished to move then from the jungle on both sides of the path other boys emerged bradley said what is this the lost boys without expression one of the kids slammed the butt of his rifle into bradleys stomach bradley gasped and went down stopim waitman bilong toktok oh jesus bradley said rolling on the ground the kid hit him again this time in the head and kicked him hard bradley moaned antap antap the kid said gesturing for him to get up when bradley didnt respond the kid kicked him again antap sarah went over and helped bradley to his feet bradley was coughing sarah was smart enough not to say anything oh nais mari the kid said then he pushed her away from bradley antap but as they trudged forward one of the kids went over to bradley and squeezed the back of his arm the triceps he laughed taiis gut evans felt a chill as the words sank in these boys were speaking a version of english he could decipher it if he thought about it a little and played the words back in his head nais mari was nice mary maybe mary was a word for woman antap was and up and taiis gut was taste good they walked single file through the jungle the kids at their side kenner was in the lead then ted who was bleeding from his head and sarah and jennifer then evans evans glanced over his shoulder sanjong was not behind him all he saw was another ragged kid with a rifle antap antap the kid made a threatening gesture with his rifle evans turned and hurried forward there was something chilling about being herded by children except these werent children he was only too aware of the cold look in their eyes they had seen a lot in their lives they lived in another world it was not evanss world but he was now in theirs up ahead he saw a pair of jeeps at the side of a muddy road he looked at his watch it was ten oclock seven hours to go but somehow it didnt seem important anymore the kids pushed them into the jeeps and then they drove off down a muddy track into the dark and trackless interior of the jungle pavutu thursday october am there were times sarah thought when she really did not want to be a woman that was how she felt as she was driven into the muddy village of pavutu the rebel stronghold in the back of an open jeep the village seemed to be populated almost entirely by men who came yelling into the clearing to see who had arrived but there were women too including older women who stared at her height and her hair and then came up and poked at her as if she might not be real jennifer who was shorter and darker stood beside her and attracted no attention at all nevertheless they were herded together into one of the huge thatch houses inside the house was a large open space a kind of central room three stories high there was a ladder made of wood leading up to a series of landings going all the way to the top where there was a kind of catwalk and a viewing area in the center of the room was a fire and at the fire sat a heavyset man with pale skin and a dark beard he wore sunglasses and had a sort of beret with the jamaican flag on it this it seemed was sambuca they were shoved in front of him and he leered at them but it was clear to sarahshe had an instinct for these thingsthat he was not interested in them he was interested in ted and in peter kenner he inspected briefly then looked away killim they pushed kenner out the door poking him with the butts of their rifles they were clearly excited at the prospect of executing him no nau sambuca said in a growl behain it took sarah a moment to translate in her head not now behind which must mean later on she thought so kenner had a reprieve at least for a while sambuca turned and stared at the others in the room meris he said with a dismissive wave goapim meri behain sarah had the distinct impression from the grins on the faces of the boys that they were being given the freedom to do with the two women what they wanted go up em she and jennifer were led off to a back room sarah remained calm of course she knew things were bad but they were not bad yet she was noticing that jennifer did not appear to be shaken in the least she had the same flat uninterested expression that she might have if she was walking toward a company cocktail party the boys took the two women into a thatched room at the back of the larger building there were two posts sunk in the earthen floor one of the kids took out a pair of handcuffs and cuffed jennifer to one post her hands behind her back then he cuffed sarah to the other post in the same way then another kid reached up and squeezed sarahs tit smiled knowingly and walked out of the room charming jennifer said when they were alone you all right so far yes there were drums starting to beat from somewhere outside in the courtyard between the thatch buildings good jennifer said its not over yet sanjong is right he is but we came a long way in the jeeps yes at least two or three miles i tried to see the odometer but it was spattered with mud but on foot even running itll take him a while he had a rifle yes can you get free jennifer shook her head its too tight through the open door they saw bradley and evans being led away to another room they glimpsed the two men only for a moment not long after kenner followed he glanced into their room giving what seemed to sarah a meaningful look but she couldnt be sure jennifer sat down on the bare earth leaning back against the pole she said might as well sit down it could be a long night sarah sat down too a moment later a young boy looked in and saw that they were sitting he came into the room looked at their handcuffs and then walked out again outside the drums were louder people must have been starting to gather because the women could hear shouts and murmurs going to be a ceremony jennifer said and im afraid i know what it is in the next room evans and kenner were also handcuffed around two posts because there was not a third post ted bradley was handcuffed and left seated on the ground his head was no longer bleeding but he had a huge bruise over his left eye and he looked distinctly frightened but his eyelids were drooping as if he might fall asleep whats your impression of village life so far ted kenner said still think its the best way to live this isnt village life this is savagery its all part of it no its not these young kids that fat creepy guy ampthis is lunacy this is everything gone wrong you just dont get it do you kenner said you think civilization is some horrible polluting human invention that separates us from the state of nature but civilization doesnt separate us from nature ted civilization protects us from nature because what you see right now all around youthis is nature oh no no no humans are kind cooperative amp horseshit ted there are genes for altruism wishful thinking ted all cruelty springs from weakness some people like cruelty ted leave him alone evans said why should i come on ted arent you going to answer me oh fuck you ted said maybe were all going to get killed here by these juvenile delinquent creeps but i want you to know if its the last fucking thing i say in my life that you are a major and unrelenting asshole kenner you bring out the worst in everybody youre a pessimist youre an obstructionist youre against all progress against everything that is good and noble you are a rightwing pig in ampin ampin whatever the fuck you are wearing whatever those clothes are wheres your gun i dropped it where back in the jungle you think sanjong has it i hope so is he coming to get us kenner shook his head hes doing the job we came to do you mean hes going to the bay yes so nobody is coming to get us no ted nobody were fucked he said were fucking fucked i cant believe it and he started to cry two boys entered the room carrying two heavy hemp ropes they attached one rope to each of bradleys wrists tying them firmly then they walked out again the drums beat louder out in the center of the village people took up a rhythmic chant jennifer said can you see out the door from where you are yes keep an eye out tell me if someone is coming all right sarah said she glanced back and saw that jennifer had arched her back and was gripping the pole between her hands she had also bent her legs so her soles touched the wood and proceeded to shimmy up the pole at a remarkable speed like an acrobat she got to the top raised her cuffed hands clear of the top of the pole and then jumped lightly to the ground anybody she said no amphowd you learn to do that keep looking out the door jennifer slid back against her pole again as if she were still handcuffed to it anybody yet no not yet jennifer sighed we need one of those kids to come in she said soon outside sambuca was giving a speech screaming brief phrases that were each answered by a shout from the crowd their leader was building them up working them into a frenzy even in teds room they could feel it building bradley was curled in fetal position crying softly two men came in much older than the boys they unlocked his handcuffs they lifted him to his feet each man took a rope together they led him outside a moment later the crowd roared pavutu thursday october pm hey cutie pie jennifer said when a boy stuck his head in the door she grinned you like what you see cutie pie she shifted her pelvis suggestively the boy looked suspicious at first but he came deeper into the room he was older than the others maybe fourteen or fifteen and he was bigger he was carrying a rifle and wore a knife on his belt you want to have some fun want to let me go jennifer said smiling with a little pout you understand me my arms hurt baby want to have fun he gave a laugh sort of a gurgle from deep in his throat he moved toward her and pushed her legs open then crouched down in front of her oh let me go first please amp no meri he said laughing and shaking his head he knew he could have her while she remained cuffed to the pole he was kneeling between her legs fumbling with his shorts but it was clumsy holding the gun so he set the gun down what happened next was very fast jennifer arched her back and kicked her legs up clipping the kid under the chin snapping his head back she continued the motion crunching into a ball swinging her arms under her hips and butt and then up her legs so now her hands were in front of her instead of behind as the kid staggered to his feet she slammed him in the side of the head with both hands he went down on his knees she dove on him knocking him over and pounded his head into the ground then she pulled the knife off his belt and cut his throat she sat on his body while he shivered and spasmed and the blood poured from his throat and onto the bare earth it seemed to take a long time when the body was finally motionless she got off him and rifled through his pockets sarah watched the whole thing her mouth open damn it jennifer said damn it whats the matter he doesnt have the key she rolled the body over grunting with the effort she got blood on her arms from the flowing throat she paid no attention to it where are the damn keys maybe the other kid has it which one cuffed us i dont remember sarah said i was confused she was staring at the body looking at all the blood hey jennifer said get over it you know what these guys are going to do theyre going to beat us up gangbang us and then kill us fuck em we kill as many as we can and try to get out of here alive but i need the damn key sarah struggled to her feet good idea jennifer said she came over and crouched down in front of sarah what stand on my back and shimmy up get yourself off the pole and hurry outside the crowd was screaming and roaring a constant and ugly sound ted bradley blinked in the bright sunlight he was disoriented by pain and fear and by the sight that greeted his eyes two lines of old women forming a corridor for him to walk down all applauding him wildly in fact beyond the old women was a sea of facesdarkskinned men and young girls and kids hardly waist high and they were all yelling and cheering dozens of people crowded together they were cheering him despite himself ted smiled it was a weak smile sort of a halfsmile because he was tired and hurt but he knew from experience that it would convey just the right hint of subtle pleasure at their response as he was carried forward by the two men he nodded and smiled he allowed his smile to become broader at the far end of the women was sambuca himselfbut he too was applauding wildly his hands high in the air a broad smile on his face ted didnt know what was happening here but obviously he had misunderstood the meaning of the whole thing either that or they had figured out who he was and now thought better of their original plan it wouldnt be the first time the women were cheering so loudly as he was carried forward their mouths gaping with excitement that he tried to shake off the men who were holding him he tried to walk unaided and he did but now that he was closer he noticed that the applauding women had heavy sticks resting against their hips as they cheered some had baseball bats and some lengths of metal pipe and as he came closer they continued to shout but they picked up their bats and sticks and began to strike him heavy blows on the face and shoulders and body the pain was instant and incredible and he sank down to the ground but immediately the men with the ropes hauled him up again and dragged him while the women beat him and screamed and beat him and the pain streaked through his body and he felt a vague detachment an emptiness but still the blows came merciless again and again and finally barely conscious he came to the end of the line of women and saw a pair of poles the men quickly tied his arms to the two poles in a way that kept him upright and now the crowd fell silent his head was bowed he saw blood dripping from his head onto the ground and he saw two naked feet appear in his line of vision and the blood spattered on the feet and someone lifted his head it was sambuca though bradley could barely focus on his face the world was gray and faint but he saw that sambuca was grinning at him revealing a row of yellow pointed teeth and then sambuca held up a knife so ted could see it and smiled again and with two fingers grabbed the flesh of teds cheek and sliced it off with the knife there was no pain surprisingly no pain but it made him dizzy to see sambuca hold up the bloody chunk of his cheek and grinning open his mouth and take a bite the blood ran down sambucas chin as he chewed grinning all the while bradleys head was spinning now he was nauseated and terrified and revolted and he felt a pain at his chest he looked down to see a young boy of eight or nine cutting flesh from his underarm with a pocket knife and a woman raced forward screaming for the others to get out of the way and she hacked a slice from the back of his forearm and then the whole crowd was upon him and the knives were everywhere and they were cutting and yelling and cutting and yelling and he saw one knife move toward his eyes and felt his trousers tugged down and he knew nothing more pavutu thursday october pm evans listened to the crowd cheering and yelling somehow he knew what was happening he looked at kenner but kenner just shook his head there was nothing to do no help was coming there was no way out the door opened and two boys appeared they carried two heavy hemp ropes now visibly soaked in blood they walked up to evans and carefully knotted the ropes to his hands evans felt his heart start to pound the boys finished and left the room outside the crowd was roaring dont worry kenner said theyll let you wait a while theres still hope hope for what evans said in a burst of anger kenner shook his head just amphope jennifer was waiting for the next kid to come in the room he did finally and took one look at the fallen boy and began to bolt but jennifer had her arms around his neck she yanked him back into the room with her hands over his mouth so he couldnt scream and she made a sudden quick twist and let him fall to the ground he wasnt dead but he would be there a while but in that moment when she had looked outside she had seen the keys they were out in the thatch passageway on a bench across the hall there were two guns in the room now but there was no point in firing them it would just bring everybody on them jennifer didnt want to look outside again she heard murmuring voices she couldnt be sure whether they were coming from the next room or from the hallway she couldnt make a mistake she leaned back against the wall by the door and moaned softly at first and then louder because the crowd was still very noisy she moaned and moaned nobody came did she dare to look out she took a breath and waited evans was trembling the bloodsoaked ropes were cold on his wrists he couldnt stand the waiting he felt like he was going to pass out outside the crowd was slowly becoming quieter they were settling down he knew what that meant soon it would be time for the next victim then he heard a quiet sound it was a man coughing softly insistently kenner understood first in here he said loudly there was a whacking sound as a machete blade poked through the thatched wall evans turned he saw the slash in the wall widen and a thick brown hand reached in to pull the slash wider open still a heavily bearded face peered through the gash at them for a moment evans did not recognize him but then the man put his finger to his lips and there was something in the gesture that was familiar and evans suddenly saw past the beard george it was george morton alive morton stepped through into the room keep it down he hissed you took your sweet time kenner said turning so morton could unlock his cuffs morton gave kenner a pistol then it was evanss turn with a click his hands were free evans tugged at the hemp ropes trying to get them off his wrists but they were securely tied morton whispered where are the others kenner pointed to the room next door he took the machete from morton you take peter ill get the girls with the machete kenner stepped out into the hallway morton grabbed evans by the arm evans jerked his head lets go but do as he says kid they stepped through the slash in the wall and into the jungle beyond kenner moved down the empty hallway there were openings at both ends he could be surprised at any moment if the alarm went up they were all dead he saw the keys on the bench picked them up and went to the door of the womens room looking into the room he saw that the poles were abandoned he didnt see either of the women staying outside he tossed the keys into the room its me he whispered a moment later he saw jennifer scramble from her hiding place behind the door to grab the keys in a few seconds she and sarah had both unlocked each other they grabbed the boys guns and started for the door too late from around the corner three heavyset young men were coming toward kenner they all carried machine guns they were talking and laughing not paying attention kenner slipped into the womens room he pressed back against the wall gestured for the two women to go back to the poles they made it just in time as the men entered the room jennifer said hi guys with a big smile at that moment the men registered the two fallen boys and the bloodsoaked earth but it was too late kenner took one jennifer got the second with her knife the third was almost out the door when kenner hit him with the butt of the gun there was the crack of skull he went down hard it was time to go out in the courtyard the crowd was growing restless sambuca squinted the first waitman was long dead the body cooling at his feet no longer as appetizing as he was before and those in the crowd who had not tasted glory were clamoring for their piece for the next opportunity the women were resting their bats and pipes on their shoulders talking in small clusters waiting for the game to continue where was the next man sambuca barked an order and three men ran toward the thatch building it was a long muddy slide down the steep hill but evans didnt mind he was following morton who seemed to know his way around the jungle very well they fell to the bottom landing in a shallow running stream the water pale brown with peat morton signaled for him to follow and ran splashing down the streambed morton had lost a lot of weight his body was trim and fit his face tight hard looking evans said we thought you were dead dont talk just go theyll be after us in a minute and even as he spoke evans could hear someone sliding down the hillside after them he turned and ran down the stream slipping over wet rocks falling getting up and running again kenner came down the hillside with the two women right behind him they banged against gnarled roots and protruding brambles as they slid down but it was still the fastest way to get away from the village he could see from the streaks in the mud ahead of him that morton had gone that way too and he was sure that he had no more than a minutes head start before the alarm was sounded they came crashing down through the last of the undergrowth to the streambed they heard gunshots from the village above so their escape had already been discovered the bay kenner knew was off to the left he told the others to go ahead running in the streambed what about you evans said ill be with you in a minute the women headed off moving surprisingly quickly kenner eased back to the muddy track raised his gun and waited it was only a few seconds before the first of the rebels came down the slope he fired three quick bursts the bodies caught in the gnarled branches one tumbled all the way to the streambed kenner waited the men above would expect him to run now so he waited sure enough in a couple of minutes he heard them starting down again they were noisyfrightened kids he fired again and heard screams but he didnt think hed hit anything they were just screams of fear but from now on he was sure they would take a different route down and it would be slower kenner turned and ran sarah and jennifer were moving fast through the water when a bullet whined past sarahs ear hey she shouted its us oh sorry morton said as they caught up to him which way jennifer said morton pointed downstream they ran evans looked for his watch but one of the kids had taken it from him his wrist was bare but morton had a watch what time is it evans asked him threefifteen they had less than two hours remaining how far to the bay maybe another hour morton said if we go cross jungle and we must those boys are fearsome trackers many times theyve almost gotten me they know im here but so far ive eluded them how long have you been here nine days seems like nine years running down a streambed they crouched low beneath overhanging branches evanss thighs burned his knees ached but somehow it didnt matter to him for some reason the pain felt like an affirmation he didnt care about the heat or the bugs or the leeches that he knew were all over his ankles and legs he was just glad to be alive we turn here morton said he left the streambed dashing off to the right scrambling over big boulders and then crashing into dense waisthigh ferns any snakes in here sarah said yeah plenty morton said but i dont worry about them what do you worry about plenti pukpuk and they are crocodiles and he plunged onward vanishing into dense foliage great evans said kenner stopped in the middle of the river something was wrong until now he had seen signs of previous runners in the stream bits of mud on rocks wet finger marks or shoe prints or disturbed algae but for the last few minutes nothing the others had left the stream hed missed where morton would make sure of that he thought morton would know a good place to leave the river where their exit wouldnt be noticed probably somewhere with ferns and swampy marshy grass between boulders on riverbanksgrass that would be spongy underfoot and would spring back at once kenner had missed it he turned around and headed upstream moving slowly he knew that if he didnt find their tracks he couldnt leave the river he would be sure to get lost and if he stayed in the river too long the kids would find him and theyd kill him resolution thursday october pm there was one hour left now morton crouched among the mangroves and rocks near the center of resolution bay the others were clustered around him the water lapped softly against the sand a few feet away this is what i know he said speaking low the submarine tender is hidden under a camouflage tarp at the east end of the bay you cant see it from here they have been sending the submarine down every day for a week the sub has limited battery power so it can stay at depth for only an hour at a time but it seems pretty clear they are placing a kind of coneshaped explosive that depends on accurately timed detonation they had them in antarctica sarah said all right then you know here theyre intended to trigger an underwater avalanche judging how long the sub stays down i figure they are placing them at about the ninetymeter level which happens to be the most efficient level for tsunamicausing avalanches what about the tents up here evans said it seems theyre taking no chances either they dont have enough cone explosives or they dont trust them to do the job because they have placed something called hypersonic cavitation generators in the tents theyre big pieces of equipment about the size of a small truck diesel powered make a lot of noise when they fire them up to test them which theyve been doing for days they moved the tents several times just a foot or two each time so i assume theres some critical issue about placement maybe theyre focusing the beams or whatever it is those things generate im not entirely clear about what they do but apparently theyre important for creating the landslide sarah said and what do we do theres no way we can stop them morton said we are only fourfive if kenner makes it which he doesnt seem to be doing there are thirteen of them seven on the ship and six on shore all armed with automatic weapons but we have sanjong evans said dont forget him that nepali guy im sure the rebels got him there were gunshots about an hour ago along the ridge where they first found you i was a few yards below just before they picked you up i tried to signal you by coughing but amp he shrugged turned back to the beach anyway assuming the three cavitation generators are meant to work together to create some effect on the underwater slope i figure our best chance is to take one of the generators outor maybe two of them that would disrupt their plan or at least weaken the effect jennifer said can we cut the power supply morton shook his head theyre selfpowered diesel attached to the main units battery ignition no solar panels theyre autonomous then we have to take out the guys running the units yes and theyve been alerted to our presence as you can see theres one standing outside each tent guarding it and theyve got a sentry somewhere up on that ridge he pointed to the western slope we cant see where he is but i assume he is watching the whole bay so big deal let him watch jennifer said i say we just take out all these guys in the tents and trash the machines weve got enough weapons here to do the job and she paused she had removed the magazine from her rifle it was empty better check your loads there was a moment of fumbling they were all shaking their heads evans had four rounds sarah had two mortons rifle had none those guys had practically no ammo amp and we dont either jennifer took a long breath this is going to be a little tougher without weapons she edged forward and looked out on the beach squinting in the bright light theres ten yards between the jungle and those tents open beach no cover if we charge the tents well never make it what about a distraction i dont know what it could be theres one guy outside each tent and one guy inside they both armed morton nodded automatic weapons not good she said not good at all kenner splashed down the river looking hard left and right he had not gone more than a hundred yards when he saw the faint imprint of a wet hand on a boulder the damp print had almost dried he looked more closely he saw the grass at the edge of the stream had been trampled this was where they had left the stream he set out heading toward the bay morton obviously knew his way around this was another streambed but much smaller kenner noticed with some unease that it sloped downward fairly steeply that was a bad sign but it was a passable route through the jungle somewhere up ahead he heard the barking of a dog it sounded like the dog was hoarse or sick or something kenner hurried ahead ducking beneath the branches he had to get to the others before it was too late morton heard the barking and frowned whats the matter jennifer said the rebels chasing us with dogs no thats not a dog it didnt really sound like a dog its not theyve learned a trick in this part of the world they bark like a dog and then when the dogs come out they eat them who does crocs thats a crocodile you hear somewhere behind us out on the beach they heard the sudden rumbling of automobile engines peering forward through the mangroves they saw three jeeps coming from the east side of the bay rumbling across the sand toward them whats this evans said theyve been practicing this morton said all week watch one stops at each tent see tent one amptent two amptent three they all stop they all keep the motors running all pointed west whats west theres a dirt track goes up the hill about a hundred yards and then deadends something used to be up there no they cut the road themselves first thing they did when they got here morton looked toward the eastern curve of the bay usually by this time the ship has pulled out and moved into deep water but its not doing it yet uhoh evans said what is it i think weve forgotten something whats that weve been worried about this tsunami wave heading toward the california coast but a landslide would suck water downward right and then it would rise back up again but thats kind of like dropping this pebble into this ditch he dropped a pebble into a muddy puddle at their feet and the wave the pebble generates ampis circular it goes in all directions amp oh no sarah said oh yes all directions including back to this coast the tsunami will hit here too and fast how far offshore is the solomon trench morton shrugged i dont know maybe two miles i really dont know peter if these waves travel five hundred miles an hour evans said then that means it gets to this coast in amp twentyfour seconds sarah said right thats how much time we have to get out of here once the undersea landslide begins twentyfour seconds with a sudden chugging rumble they heard the first diesel generator come to life then the second then the third all three were running morton glanced at his watch this is it he said theyve started and now they heard an electronic whine faint at first but rapidly building to a deep electronic hum it filled the air thosere the cavitators morton said kicking in jennifer slung her rifle over her shoulder lets get ready sanjong slid silently from the branches of the overhanging tree onto the deck of the av scorpion the fortyfoot ship must have a very shallow draft because it was pulled up close to the peninsula on the eastern side so that the huge jungle trees overhung it the ship couldnt really be seen from the beach sanjong had only realized that it was there when he heard the crackle of radios coming from the jungle he crouched in the stern hiding behind the winch that raised the submarine listening he heard voices from all sides it seemed like he guessed that there were six or seven men onboard but what he wanted was to find the timing detonators he guessed that they were in the pilothouse but he couldnt be sure and between his hiding place and the pilothouse was a long expanse of open deck he looked at the minisub hanging above him it was bright blue about seven feet long with a bubble canopy now raised the sub was raised and lowered into the water by the winch and the winch amp he looked for the control panel he knew it had to be nearby because the operator would have to be able to see the submarine as it was lowered finally he saw it a closed metal box on the other side of the ship he crept over opened the box and looked at the buttons there were six marked with arrows in all directions like a big keypad he pressed the down arrow with a rumble the winch began to lower the submarine into the water an alarm began to sound he heard running feet he ducked back into a doorway and waited from the beach they faintly heard the sound of an alarm over the rumble of the generators and the cavitation hum evans looked around wheres it coming from it must be from the ship over there out on the beach the men heard it too they were standing in pairs by the entrance to the tents pointing wondering what to do and then from the jungle behind them a sudden burst of machinegun fire opened up the men on the beach were alarmed now swinging their guns looking this way and that screw it jennifer said taking evanss rifle this is it it wont get any better and firing she ran out onto the beach the crocodile had charged kenner with frightening speed he had little more than a glimpse of huge white jaws open wide and thrashing water before he fired with his machine gun the jaw smashed down just missing his leg the animal writhed twisted and attacked again jaws closing on a lowhanging branch the bullets hadnt done anything kenner turned and ran sprinting down the streambed the croc roared behind him jennifer was running across the sand heading for the nearest tent she went about ten yards before two bullets struck her left leg and knocked her down she fell onto hot sand still firing as she fell she saw the guard at the entrance to the tent drop she knew he was dead evans came up behind her and started to crouch down she shouted keep going go evans ran forward toward the tent on the ship the men halted the descent of the submarine stopping the winch now they could hear the gunshots coming from the beach they had all rushed to the starboard side of the ship and now they were looking over the railing trying to see what was going on sanjong went down the deck on the port side no one was there he came to the cabin there was a big board there dense with electronics a man in shorts and a tshirt was crouched over it making adjustments at the top of the board were three rows of lights marked with numerals the timing board for the undersea detonations sarah and morton were sprinting along the edge of the beach staying close to the jungle as they headed for the second tent the man outside the tent saw them almost at once and was firing bursts of machinegun fire at them but he must have been very nervous sarah thought because he wasnt hitting them branches and leaves snapped all around them from the bullets and with every step they were getting close enough for sarah to fire back she was carrying mortons pistol at twenty yards she stopped and leaned against the nearest tree trunk she held her arm stiffly and aimed the first shot missed the second one hit the man outside the tent in the right shoulder and he dropped his gun in the sand morton saw it and left the forest running across the sand toward the tent the man was struggling to get up sarah shot again and then morton disappeared inside the tent and she heard two quick gunshots and a scream of pain she ran evans was inside the tent he faced a wall of chugging machinery a huge complex of twisting pipes and vents ending in a flat round plate eight feet wide set about two feet above the surface of the sand the generator was about seven feet high all the metal was hot to the touch the noise was deafening he didnt see anybody there holding his rifle readypainfully aware that the magazine was emptyhe swung around the first corner then the second and then he saw him it was bolden the guy from the antarctic he was working at a control panel adjusting big knobs while he looked at a shaded lcd screen and a row of dials he was so preoccupied he didnt even notice evans at first evans felt a burst of pure rage if his gun had been loaded he would have shot him boldens gun was leaning against the wall of the tent he needed both hands to adjust the controls evans shouted bolden turned evans gestured for him to put up his hands bolden charged morton had just stepped into the tent when the first bullet struck his ear and the second hit his shoulder he screamed in pain and fell to his knees the movement saved his life because the next bullet whined past his forehead ripping through the tent cloth he was lying on the ground next to the chugging machinery when the gunman came around holding his rifle ready he was a twentyish man bearded grim all business he aimed at morton and then he fell against the machine blood hissing as it splattered on hot metal sarah was standing inside the tent firing her pistol once twice three times lowering her arm each time as the man fell she turned to morton i forgot you were a good shot he said you okay she said he nodded then how do i turn this thing off evans grunted as bolden smashed into his body the two men stumbled back against the tent fabric then forward again evans brought the butt of his gun down on boldens back but it had no effect he kept trying to hit him in the head but only connected with his back bolden for his part seemed to be trying to drive evans out of the tent the two men fell to the ground the machinery was thumping above them and now evans realized what bolden was trying to do he was trying to push evans under the plate even by being near the edge evans could feel the air vibrating intensely the air was much hotter here bolden hit evans in the head and his sunglasses went flying across the ground beneath the flat plate instantly they shattered then the frames crumpled then they pulverized vanished into nothing evans watched with horror and little by little bolden was pushing him closer to the edge closer closer amp evans struggled with the sudden strength of desperation abruptly he kicked up boldens face mashed against hot metal he howled his cheek was smoking and black evans kicked again and got out from beneath him got to his feet standing over bolden he kicked him hard in the ribs as hard as he could he tried to kill him thats for antarctica bolden grabbed evanss leg on the next kick and evans went down but he kicked once more as he fell hitting bolden in the head and with the impact bolden rolled once and rolled under the plate his body was half under half out it began to shake to vibrate bolden opened his mouth to scream but there was no sound evans kicked him a final time and the body went entirely under by the time evans had dropped to his hands and knees to look under the plate nothing was there just a haze of acrid smoke he got to his feet and went outside glancing over her shoulder jennifer ripped her blouse with her teeth and tore a strip of cloth for a tourniquet she didnt think an artery had been hit but there was a lot of blood on one leg and a lot of blood in the sand and she was feeling a little dizzy she had to keep watching because there was one more tent and if the guys from that tent showed up amp she spun raising her gun as a figure emerged from the forest it was john kenner she lowered the gun he ran toward her sanjong fired into the glass in front of the control deck but nothing happened the glass didnt even shatter bulletproof glass he thought in surprise the technician inside looked up in shock by then sanjong was moving toward the door the technician reached for the control switches sanjong fired twice once hitting the technician once aiming for the control panel but it was too late across the top of the panel red lights flashed one after another the undersea detonations were taking place automatically a loud alarm began to sound like a submarine claxon the men on the other side of the ship were shouting terror in their voices and with good reason sanjong thought the tsunami had been generated it was only a matter of seconds now before it would hit them resolution bay thursday october pm the air was filled with sound evans ran from the tent directly ahead he saw kenner lifting jennifer in his arms kenner was shouting something but evans couldnt hear he could vaguely see that jennifer was soaked in blood evans ran for the jeep jumped in and drove it over to kenner kenner put jennifer in the back she was breathing shallowly directly ahead they saw sarah helping morton into the other jeep kenner had to shout over the noise for a minute evans couldnt understand then he realized what kenner was saying sanjong where is sanjong evans shook his head morton says hes dead rebels do you know for sure no kenner looked back down the beach drive sarah was in the car trying to hold morton upright and drive at the same time but she had to let go of him to shift gears and as soon as she did hed flop over against her shoulder he was wheezing breathing with difficulty she suspected that his lung was punctured she was distracted trying to count in her head she thought it was already ten seconds since the landslide which meant they had fifteen seconds to get up the hill sanjong leapt from the ship to the trees on the shore he grabbed a handful of leaves and branches he scrambled down to the ground and began to climb the hill frantically on the ship the men saw him and they jumped too trying to follow him sanjong guessed that they all had half a minute before the first wave struck it would be the smallest wave but it would still probably be five meters high the runupthe splash on the hillsidecould be another five meters that meant he had to scramble at least thirty feet up the muddy slope in the next thirty seconds he knew he would never make it he couldnt do it he climbed anyway sarah drove up the muddy track the jeep slipping precariously on the incline beside her morton was not saying anything and his skin had turned an ugly blue gray she yelled hold on george hold on just a little the jeep fishtailed in the mud and sarah howled in panic she downshifted grinding gears got control and continued up in the rearview mirror she saw evans behind her in her mind she was counting eighteen nineteen twenty from the third tent on the beach two men with machine guns jumped into the last remaining jeep they drove up the hill after evans firing at him as they drove kenner was firing back the bullets shattered evanss windshield evans slowed keep driving kenner yelled go evans couldnt really see where the windshield wasnt shattered it was spattered with mud he kept moving his head trying to see the route ahead go kenner yelled the bullets were whizzing around them kenner was shooting at the tires of the jeep behind them he hit them and the jeep lurched over onto its side the two men fell out into the mud they scrambled to their feet limping they were only about fifteen feet above the beach not high enough kenner looked back at the ocean he saw the wave coming toward the shore it was enormous as wide as the eye could see a foaming line of surf a white arc spreading as it came toward the beach it was not a very high wave but it grew as it came ashore rising up rising higher amp the jeep lurched to a halt why did you stop kenner yelled its the end of the damn road evans shouted the wave was now about fifteen feet high with a roar of surf the wave struck the beach and raced inland toward them to evans it seemed as if everything was happening in slow motionthe big wave churning white boiling over the sand and somehow keeping its crest all the way across the beach and into the jungle completely covering the green landscape in white as the water boiled up the slope toward them he couldnt take his eyes off it because it seemed never to lose its power but just kept coming farther down the muddy track the two men were scrambling away from their fallen jeep and then they were covered in white water and gone from sight the wave rushed up the slope another four or five feet then suddenly slowed receded sweeping back it left behind no trace of the men or their jeep the jungle trees were ragged many uprooted the wave slid back into the ocean farther and farther away exposing the beach far out to sea before it finally died away and the ocean was gentle again thats the first kenner said the next ones will be bigger sarah was holding morton upright trying to keep him comfortable his lips were a terrible blue color and his skin was cold but he seemed to be alert he wasnt talking but he was watching the water hang on george she said he nodded he was mouthing something what is it what are you saying she read his lips a weak grin wouldnt miss it if it was the last thing i did the next wave came in from a distance it looked exactly like the first but as it neared the shore they could see that it was noticeably bigger half again as large as the first and the roar as it smashed into the beach was like an explosion a vast sheet of water raced up the hill toward them coming much higher than before they were almost a hundred feet away the wave had come a good sixty feet up the slope the next one will be bigger kenner said the sea was quiet for several minutes evans turned to jennifer listen he said do you want me to she wasnt there for a moment he thought she had fallen out of the jeep then he saw she had fallen on the floor where she lay curled in pain her face and shoulder were soaked in blood jennifer kenner grabbed evanss hand pushed it back gently he shook his head those guys in the jeep he said she was okay until then evans was stunned he felt dizzy he looked at her jennifer her eyes were closed she was hardly breathing turn away kenner said shell make it or she wont the next wave was coming in there was nowhere they could go they had reached the end of the track they were surrounded by jungle they just waited and watched the water rush up in a hissing terrifying wall toward them the wave had already broken this was just surge rushing up the hillside but it was still a wall of water nine or ten feet high sarah was sure it was going to take them all but the wave lost energy just a few yards away thinning and slowing and then sliding back down to the ocean kenner looked at his watch we have a few minutes he said lets do what we can what do you mean sarah said i mean climb as high as we can theres another wave at least bigger yes five minutes passed they scrambled up the hillside another twenty yards kenner was carrying jennifers bleeding body by now she had lost consciousness evans and sarah were helping morton who was moving with great difficulty finally evans picked morton up and carried him piggyback style glad you lost some weight evans said morton not speaking just patted him on the shoulder evans staggered up the hill the next wave came in when it receded their jeeps had vanished the spot where they had been parked was littered with the trunks of uprooted trees they stared very tired they argued was that the fourth wave or the fifth no one could remember they decided it must have been the fourth what do we do sarah said to kenner we climb eight minutes later the next wave came in it was smaller than the one before evans was too tired to do anything but stare at it kenner was trying to stop jennifers bleeding but her skin was an ugly pale gray and her lips were blue down at the beach there was no sign of human activity at all the tents were gone the generators were gone there was nothing but piledup debris tree branches pieces of wood seaweed foam whats that sarah said what someone is shouting they looked across to the opposite side of the bay someone was waving to them its sanjong kenner said son of a bitch he grinned i hope hes smart enough to stay where he is itll take him a couple of hours to get across the debris lets go see if our helicopter is still there or if the wave took it then well go pick him up pacific basin friday october pm eight thousand miles to the east it was the middle of the night in golden colorado when the computers of the national earthquake information center registered an atypical seismic disturbance originating from the pacific basin just north of the solomon islands and measuring richter that was a strong quake but not unusually strong the peculiar characteristics of the disturbance led the computer to categorize it as an anomalous event a fairly common designation for seismic events in that part of the world where three tectonic plates met in strange overlapping patterns the neic computers assessed the earthquake as lacking the relatively slow movement associated with tsunamis and thus did not classify it as a tsunamigenerating event however in the south pacific this designation was being reexamined following the devastating new guinea earthquake of the single most destructive tsunami of the centurywhich also did not have the classic slow tsunami profile thus as a precaution the computers flagged the earthquake to the sensors of the morn the midocean relay network operating out of hilo hawaii six hours later midocean buoys detected a nineinch rise in the ocean level consistent with a tsunami wave train because of the great depth of the midocean tsunamis often raised the sea level only a few inches on this particular evening ships in the area felt nothing at all as the big wave front passed beneath them nevertheless the buoys felt it and triggered an alarm it was the middle of the night in hawaii when the computers pinged and the screens came up the network manager joe ohiri had been dozing he got up poured himself a cup of coffee and inspected the data it was clearly a tsunami profile though one that appeared to be losing force in its ocean passage hawaii was of course in its path but this wave would strike the south shore of the islands a relative rarity ohiri made a quick waveforce calculation was unimpressed with the results and so sent a routine notification to civil defense units on all the inhabited islands it began this is an information message amp and finished with the usual boilerplate about the alert being based on preliminary information ohiri knew that nobody would pay much attention to it ohiri also notified the west coast and alaska warning centers because the wave train was due to strike the coast in early midmorning of the following day five hours later the dart buoys off the coast of california and alaska detected the passage of a tsunami train now further weakened computers calculated the velocity and wave force and recommended no action this meant that the message went out to the local stations as a tsunami information bulletin not an alert based on location and magnitude the earthquake was not sufficient to generate a tsunami damaging to californiaoregonwashingtonbritish columbia or alaska some areas oregonwashingtonbritish columbia or alaska some areas may experience small sea level changes kenner who was monitoring the messages on his computer shook his head when he saw this nick drake is not going to be a happy man today it was kenners hypothesis that they had needed the cavitation generators to extend the effect of the underwater detonations and to create the relatively longlasting landslide that would have produced a truly powerful oceancrossing tsunami that had been thwarted ninety minutes later the muchweakened tsunami train struck the beaches of california it consisted of a set of five waves averaging six feet in height that excited surfers briefly but passed unnoticed by everyone else belatedly kenner was notified that the fbi had been attempting to reach him for the past twelve hours it turned out that v allen willy had vacated his beach house at two am local time this was less than an hour after the events in resolution bay had taken place and more than ten hours prior to the tsunami notification kenner suspected that willy had gotten cold feet and had been unwilling to wait but it was an important and telling mistake kenner called the agent and started proceedings to subpoena willys phone records none of them was allowed to leave the island for the next three days there were formalities forms interrogations there were problems with emergency care for mortons collapsed lung and jennifers massive blood loss morton wanted to be taken to sydney for surgery but he was not allowed to leave because he had been reported as a missing person in america although he complained bitterly about witch doctors a very good surgeon trained in melbourne took care of his lung in gareda town but jennifer had not been able to wait for that surgeon she had needed three transfusions during five hours of surgery to remove the bullets in her upper body and then she was on a respirator near death for the next fortyeight hours but at the end of the second day she opened her eyes pulled off her oxygen mask and said to evans sitting at her bedside stop looking so gloomy im here for gods sake her voice was weak but she was smiling then there were problems about their contact with the rebels there were problems about the fact that one of their party had disappeared the famous actor ted bradley they all told the story of what had happened to bradley but there was no way to corroborate it so the police made them tell it again and suddenly abruptly unaccountably they were allowed to leave their papers were in order their passports were returned there was no difficulty they could leave whenever they wanted evans slept most of the way to honolulu after the plane refueled and took off again he sat up and talked to morton and the others morton was explaining what had happened on the night of his car crash there was obviously a problem with nick and what he was doing with his money nerf was not doing good things nick was very angrydangerously angry he threatened me and i took him at his word i had established the link between his organization and elf and he was threatened to put it mildly kenner and i thought he would try to kill me well he did try with that girl at the coffee shop that morning in beverly hills oh yes evans remembered but how did you stage that car crash it was so incredibly dangerous what do you think im crazy morton said i never crashed what do you mean i kept right on driving that night but evans fell silent shaking his head i dont get it yes you do sarah said because i let it slip to you by accident before george called me and told me to keep my mouth shut about it it came back to him then the conversation from days ago he hadnt paid much attention at the time sarah had said he told me to buy a new ferrari from a guy in monterey and have it shipped to san francisco when evans expressed surprise that george was buying another ferrari i know how many ferraris can one man use and this one doesnt seem up to his usual standard from the email pictures it looks kind of beat up and then she said the ferrari he bought is a gts daytona spyder he already has one peter its like he doesnt know amp oh i knew all right morton said what a waste of money the car was a piece of crap and then i had to fly a couple of hollywood prop guys up to sonoma to beat the hell out of it and make it look like a crash then they flatbedded it out that night set it on the road fired up the smoke pots amp and you drove right past a wreck that was already in place evans said yes morton said nodding drove right around the corner pulled off the road climbed up the hill and watched you guys you son of a bitch im sorry morton said but we needed real emotion to distract the police from the problems what problems icecold engine block for one kenner said that engine hadnt run for days one of the cops noticed it was cold while the car was being put on the truck he came back and asked you the time of the accident all of that i was concerned they would figure it out but they didnt morton said no they knew something was wrong but i dont think they ever guessed identical ferraris no one in his right mind morton said would intentionally destroy a gts even a crappy one morton was smiling but evans was angry somebody could have told me no kenner said we needed you to work drake like the cell phone what about it the cell phone was a very lowquality bug we needed drake to suspect that you were part of the investigation we needed him pressured well it worked thats why i got poisoned in my apartment isnt it evans said you guys were willing to take a lot of risks with my life it turned out all right kenner said you did this car crash to pressure drake and to get me free morton said i needed to go down to the solomons and find out what they were doing i knew nick would save the best for last although if they had been able to modify that hurricanethat was the third stunt they plannedso that it hit miami that would have been spectacular fuck you george evans said im sorry it had to be this way kenner said and fuck you too then evans got up and went to the front of the plane sarah was sitting alone he was so angry he refused to speak to her he spent the next hour staring out the window finally she began talking quietly to him and at the end of half an hour they embraced evans slept for a while restless his body sore he couldnt find a comfortable position to rest intermittently he would wake up groggy one time he thought he heard kenner talking to sarah lets remember where we live kenner was saying we live on the third planet from a mediumsize sun our planet is five billion years old and it has been changing constantly all during that time the earth is now on its third atmosphere the first atmosphere was helium and hydrogen it dissipated early on because the planet was so hot then as the planet cooled volcanic eruptions produced a second atmosphere of steam and carbon dioxide later the water vapor condensed forming the oceans that cover most of the planet then around three billion years ago some bacteria evolved to consume carbon dioxide and excrete a highly toxic gas oxygen other bacteria released nitrogen the atmospheric concentration of these gases slowly increased organisms that could not adapt died out meanwhile the planets land masses floating on huge tectonic plates eventually came together in a configuration that interfered with the circulation of ocean currents it began to get cold for the first time the first ice appeared two billion years ago and for the last seven hundred thousand years our planet has been in a geological ice age characterized by advancing and retreating glacial ice no one is entirely sure why but ice now covers the planet every hundred thousand years with smaller advances every twenty thousand or so the last advance was twenty thousand years ago so were due for the next one and even today after five billion years our planet remains amazingly active we have five hundred volcanoes and an eruption every two weeks earthquakes are continuous a million and a half a year a moderate richter quake every six hours a big earthquake every ten days tsunamis race across the pacific ocean every three months our atmosphere is as violent as the land beneath it at any moment there are one thousand five hundred electrical storms across the planet eleven lightning bolts strike the ground each second a tornado tears across the surface every six hours and every four days a giant cyclonic storm hundreds of miles in diameter spins over the ocean and wreaks havoc on the land the nasty little apes that call themselves human beings can do nothing except run and hide for these same apes to imagine they can stabilize this atmosphere is arrogant beyond belief they cant control the climate the reality is they run from the storms what do we do now ill tell you what we do morton said you work for me im starting a new environmental organization i have to think of a name i dont want one of these pretentious names with the words world and resource and defense and wildlife and fund and preservation and wilderness in them you can string those words together in any combination world wildlife preservation fund wilderness resource defense fund fund for the defense of world resources anyway those fake names are all taken i need something plain and new something honest i was thinking of study the problem and fix it except the acronym doesnt work but maybe thats a plus we will have scientists and field researchers and economists and engineersand one lawyer what would this organization do there is so much to do for example nobody knows how to manage wilderness we would set aside a wide variety of wilderness tracts and run them under different management strategies then wed ask outside teams to assess how we are doing and modify the strategies and then do it again a true iterative process externally assessed nobodys ever done that and in the end well have a body of knowledge about how to manage different terrains not preserve them you cant preserve them theyre going to change all the time no matter what but you could manage themif you knew how to do it which nobody does thats one big area management of complex environmental systems okay amp then wed do developingworld problems the biggest cause of environmental destruction is poverty starving people cant worry about pollution they worry about food half a billion people are starving in the world right now more than half a billion without clean water we need to design delivery systems that really work test them have them verified by outsiders and once we know they work replicate them it sounds difficult its difficult if you are a government agency or an ideologue but if you just want to study the problem and fix it you can and this would be entirely private private funding private land no bureaucrats administration is five percent of staff and resources everybody is out working wed run environmental research as a business and cut the crap why hasnt somebody done it are you kidding because its radical face the facts all these environmental organizations are thirty forty fifty years old they have big buildings big obligations big staffs they may trade on their youthful dreams but the truth is theyre now part of the establishment and the establishment works to preserve the status quo it just does okay what else technology assessment third world countries can leapfrog they skip telephone lines and go right to cellular but nobody is doing decent technology assessment in terms of what works and how to balance the inevitable drawbacks wind powers great unless youre a bird those things are giant bird guillotines maybe we should build them anyway but people dont know how to think about this stuff they just posture and pontificate nobody tests nobody does field research nobody dares to solve the problemsbecause the solution might contradict your philosophy and for most people clinging to beliefs is more important than succeeding in the world really trust me when youre my age youll know it is true next how about recreational land usemultipurpose land use its a rats nest nobody has figured out how to do it and its so hot so fierce that good people just give up and quit or vanish in a blizzard of lawsuits but that doesnt help the answer probably lies in a range of solutions it may be necessary to designate certain areas for one or another use but everybody lives on the same planet some people like opera some people like vegas and theres a lot of people that like vegas anything else yes we need a new mechanism to fund research right now scientists are in exactly the same position as renaissance painters commissioned to make the portrait the patron wants done and if they are smart theyll make sure their work subtly flatters the patron not overtly subtly this is not a good system for research into those areas of science that affect policy even worse the system works against problem solving because if you solve a problem your funding ends all thats got to change how i have some ideas make scientists blind to their funding make assessment of research blind we can have major policyoriented research carried out by multiple teams doing the same work why not if its really important well push to change how journals report research publish the article and the peer reviews in the same issue thatll clean up everybodys act real fast get the journals out of politics their editors openly take sides on certain issues bad dogs evans said anything else new labels if you read some authors who say we find that anthropogenic greenhouse gases and sulphates have had a detectable influence on sealevel pressure it sounds like they went into the world and measured something actually they just ran a simulation they talk as if simulations were realworld data theyre not thats a problem that has to be fixed i favor a stamp warning computer simulationmay be erroneous and unverifiable like on cigarettes put the same stamp on newspaper articles and in the corner of newscasts warning speculationmay be factfree can you see that peppered all over the front pages anything else evans was smiling now there are a few more things morton said but those are the major points its going to be very difficult its going to be uphill all the way well be opposed sabotaged denigrated well be called terrible names the establishment will not like it newspapers will sneer but eventually money will start to flow to us because well show results and then everybody will shut up and then we will get lionized which is the most dangerous time of all and by then im long dead you and sarah will have run the organization for twenty years and your final job will be to disband it before it becomes another tired old environmental organization spouting outmoded wisdom wasting resources and doing more harm than good i see evans said and when its disbanded youll find a bright young person and try to excite him or her to do what really needs to be done in the next generation evans looked at sarah she shrugged unless you have a better idea she said half an hour before they reached the california coast they saw the spreading brown haze hanging over the ocean it grew thicker and darker as they approached land soon they saw the lights of the city stretching away for miles it was blurred by the atmosphere above it looks a bit like hell doesnt it sarah said hard to think were going to land in that we have a lot of work to do morton said the plane descended smoothly toward los angeles authors message a novel such as state of fear in which so many divergent views are expressed may lead the reader to wonder where exactly the author stands on these issues i have been reading environmental texts for three years in itself a hazardous undertaking but i have had an opportunity to look at a lot of data and to consider many points of view i conclude we know astonishingly little about every aspect of the environment from its past history to its present state to how to conserve and protect it in every debate all sides overstate the extent of existing knowledge and its degree of certainty atmospheric carbon dioxide is increasing and human activity is the probable cause we are also in the midst of a natural warming trend that began about as we emerged from a fourhundredyear cold spell known as the little ice age nobody knows how much of the present warming trend might be a natural phenomenon nobody knows how much of the present warming trend might be manmade nobody knows how much warming will occur in the next century the computer models vary by percent de facto proof that nobody knows but if i had to guessthe only thing anyone is doing reallyi would guess the increase will be degrees c there is no evidence that my guess about the state of the world one hundred years from now is any better or worse than anyone elses we cant assess the future nor can we predict it these are euphemisms we can only guess an informed guess is just a guess i suspect that part of the observed surface warming will ultimately be attributable to human activity i suspect that the principal human effect will come from land use and that the atmospheric component will be minor before making expensive policy decisions on the basis of climate models i think it is reasonable to require that those models predict future temperatures accurately for a period of ten years twenty would be better i think for anyone to believe in impending resource scarcity after two hundred years of such false alarms is kind of weird i dont know whether such a belief today is best ascribed to ignorance of history sclerotic dogmatism unhealthy love of malthus or simple pigheadedness but it is evidently a hardy perennial in human calculation there are many reasons to shift away from fossil fuels and we will do so in the next century without legislation financial incentives carbonconservation programs or the interminable yammering of fearmongers so far as i know nobody had to ban horse transport in the early twentieth century i suspect the people of will be much richer than we are consume more energy have a smaller global population and enjoy more wilderness than we have today i dont think we have to worry about them the current nearhysterical preoccupation with safety is at best a waste of resources and a crimp on the human spirit and at worst an invitation to totalitarianism public education is desperately needed i conclude that most environmental principles such as sustainable development or the precautionary principle have the effect of preserving the economic advantages of the west and thus constitute modern imperialism toward the developing world it is a nice way of saying we got ours and we dont want you to get yours because youll cause too much pollution the precautionary principle properly applied forbids the precautionary principle it is selfcontradictory the precautionary principle therefore cannot be spoken of in terms that are too harsh i believe people are well intentioned but i have great respect for the corrosive influence of bias systematic distortions of thought the power of rationalization the guises of selfinterest and the inevitability of unintended consequences i have more respect for people who change their views after acquiring new information than for those who cling to views they held thirty years ago the world changes ideologues and zealots dont in the thirtyfiveodd years since the environmental movement came into existence science has undergone a major revolution this revolution has brought new understanding of nonlinear dynamics complex systems chaos theory catastrophe theory it has transformed the way we think about evolution and ecology yet these nolongernew ideas have hardly penetrated the thinking of environmental activists which seems oddly fixed in the concepts and rhetoric of the s we havent the foggiest notion how to preserve what we term wilderness and we had better study it in the field and learn how to do so i see no evidence that we are conducting such research in a humble rational and systematic way i therefore hold little hope for wilderness management in the twentyfirst century i blame environmental organizations every bit as much as developers and strip miners there is no difference in outcomes between greed and incompetence we need a new environmental movement with new goals and new organizations we need more people working in the field in the actual environment and fewer people behind computer screens we need more scientists and many fewer lawyers we cannot hope to manage a complex system such as the environment through litigation we can only change its state temporarilyusually by preventing somethingwith eventual results that we cannot predict and ultimately cannot control nothing is more inherently political than our shared physical environment and nothing is more ill served by allegiance to a single political party precisely because the environment is shared it cannot be managed by one faction according to its own economic or aesthetic preferences sooner or later the opposing faction will take power and previous policies will be reversed stable management of the environment requires recognition that all preferences have their place snowmobilers and fly fishermen dirt bikers and hikers developers and preservationists these preferences are at odds and their incompatibility cannot be avoided but resolving incompatible goals is a true function of politics we desperately need a nonpartisan blinded funding mechanism to conduct research to determine appropriate policy scientists are only too aware whom they are working for those who fund researchwhether a drug company a government agency or an environmental organizationalways have a particular outcome in mind research funding is almost never openended or openminded scientists know that continued funding depends on delivering the results the funders desire as a result environmental organization studies are every bit as biased and suspect as industry studies government studies are similarly biased according to who is running the department or administration at the time no faction should be given a free pass i am certain there is too much certainty in the world i personally experience a profound pleasure being in nature my happiest days each year are those i spend in wilderness i wish natural environments to be preserved for future generations i am not satisfied they will be preserved in sufficient quantities or with sufficient skill i conclude that the exploiters of the environment include environmental organizations government organizations and big business all have equally dismal track records everybody has an agenda except me appendix i why politicized science is dangerous imagine that there is a new scientific theory that warns of an impending crisis and points to a way out this theory quickly draws support from leading scientists politicians and celebrities around the world research is funded by distinguished philanthropies and carried out at prestigious universities the crisis is reported frequently in the media the science is taught in college and high school classrooms i dont mean global warming im talking about another theory which rose to prominence a century ago its supporters included theodore roosevelt woodrow wilson and winston churchill it was approved by supreme court justices oliver wendell holmes and louis brandeis who ruled in its favor the famous names who supported it included alexander graham bell inventor of the telephone activist margaret sanger botanist luther burbank leland stanford founder of stanford university the novelist h g wells the playwright george bernard shaw and hundreds of others nobel prize winners gave support research was backed by the carnegie and rockefeller foundations the cold springs harbor institute was built to carry out this research but important work was also done at harvard yale princeton stanford and johns hopkins legislation to address the crisis was passed in states from new york to california these efforts had the support of the national academy of sciences the american medical association and the national research council it was said that if jesus were alive he would have supported this effort all in all the research legislation and molding of public opinion surrounding the theory went on for almost half a century those who opposed the theory were shouted down and called reactionary blind to reality or just plain ignorant but in hindsight what is surprising is that so few people objected today we know that this famous theory that gained so much support was actually pseudoscience the crisis it claimed was nonexistent and the actions taken in the name of this theory were morally and criminally wrong ultimately they led to the deaths of millions of people the theory was eugenics and its history is so dreadfuland to those who were caught up in it so embarrassingthat it is now rarely discussed but it is a story that should be well known to every citizen so that its horrors are not repeated the theory of eugenics postulated a crisis of the gene pool leading to the deterioration of the human race the best human beings were not breeding as rapidly as the inferior onesthe foreigners immigrants jews degenerates the unfit and the feeble minded francis galton a respected british scientist first speculated about this area but his ideas were taken far beyond anything he intended they were adopted by scienceminded americans as well as those who had no interest in science but who were worried about the immigration of inferior races early in the twentieth centurydangerous human pests who represented the rising tide of imbeciles and who were polluting the best of the human race the eugenicists and the immigrationists joined forces to put a stop to this the plan was to identify individuals who were feeblemindedjews were agreed to be largely feebleminded but so were many foreigners as well as blacksand stop them from breeding by isolation in institutions or by sterilization as margaret sanger said fostering the goodfornothing at the expense of the good is an extreme cruelty ampthere is no greater curse to posterity than that of bequeathing them an increasing population of imbeciles she spoke of the burden of caring for this dead weight of human waste such views were widely shared h g wells spoke against illtrained swarms of inferior citizens theodore roosevelt said that society has no business to permit degenerates to reproduce their kind luther burbank stop permitting criminals and weaklings to reproduce george bernard shaw said that only eugenics could save mankind there was overt racism in this movement exemplified by texts such as the rising tide of color against white world supremacy by american author lothrop stoddard but at the time racism was considered an unremarkable aspect of the effort to attain a marvelous goalthe improvement of humankind in the future it was this avantgarde notion that attracted the most liberal and progressive minds of a generation california was one of twentynine american states to pass laws allowing sterilization but it proved the most forwardlooking and enthusiasticmore sterilizations were carried out in california than anywhere else in america eugenics research was funded by the carnegie foundation and later by the rockefeller foundation the latter was so enthusiastic that even after the center of the eugenics effort moved to germany and involved the gassing of individuals from mental institutions the rockefeller foundation continued to finance german researchers at a very high level the foundation was quiet about it but they were still funding research in only months before the onset of world war ii since the s american eugenicists had been jealous because the germans had taken leadership of the movement away from them the germans were admirably progressive they set up ordinarylooking houses where mental defectives were brought and interviewed one at a time before being led into a back room which was in fact a gas chamber there they were gassed with carbon monoxide and their bodies disposed of in a crematorium located on the property eventually this program was expanded into a vast network of concentration camps located near railroad lines enabling the efficient transport and killing of ten million undesirables after world war ii nobody was a eugenicist and nobody had ever been a eugenicist biographers of the celebrated and the powerful did not dwell on the attractions of this philosphy to their subjects and sometimes did not mention it at all eugenics ceased to be a subject for college classrooms although some argue that its ideas continue to have currency in disguised form but in retrospect three points stand out first despite the construction of cold springs harbor laboratory despite the efforts at universities and the pleadings of lawyers there was no scientific basis for eugenics in fact nobody at that time knew what a gene really was the movement was able to proceed because it employed vague terms never rigorously defined feeblemindedness could mean anything from poverty and illiteracy to epilepsy similarly there was no clear definition of degenerate or unfit second the eugenics movement was really a social program masquerading as a scientific one what drove it was concern about immigration and racism and undesirable people moving into ones neighborhood or country once again vague terminology helped conceal what was really going on third and most distressing the scientific establishment in both the united states and germany did not mount any sustained protest quite the contrary in germany scientists quickly fell into line with the program modern german researchers have gone back to review nazi documents from the s they expected to find directives telling scientists what research should be done but none were necessary in the words of ute deichman scientists including those who were not members of the nazi party helped to get funding for their work through their modified behavior and direct cooperation with the state deichman speaks of the active role of scientists themselves in regard to nazi race policy ampwhere research was aimed at confirming the racial doctrine ampno external pressure can be documented german scientists adjusted their research interests to the new policies and those few who did not adjust disappeared a second example of politicized science is quite different in character but it exemplifies the hazards of government ideology controlling the work of science and of uncritical media promoting false concepts trofim denisovich lysenko was a selfpromoting peasant who it was said solved the problem of fertilizing the fields without fertilizers and minerals in he claimed to have invented a procedure called vernalization by which seeds were moistened and chilled to enhance the later growth of crops lysenkos methods never faced a rigorous test but his claim that his treated seeds passed on their characteristics to the next generation represented a revival of lamarckian ideas at a time when the rest of the world was embracing mendelian genetics josef stalin was drawn to lamarckian ideas which implied a future unbounded by hereditary constraints he also wanted improved agricultural production lysenko promised both and became the darling of a soviet media that was on the lookout for stories about clever peasants who had developed revolutionary procedures lysenko was portrayed as a genius and he milked his celebrity for all it was worth he was especially skillful at denouncing his opponents he used questionnaires from farmers to prove that vernalization increased crop yields and thus avoided any direct tests carried on a wave of statesponsored enthusiasm his rise was rapid by he was a member of the supreme soviet by then lysenko and his theories dominated russian biology the result was famines that killed millions and purges that sent hundreds of dissenting soviet scientists to the gulags or the firing squads lysenko was aggressive in attacking genetics which was finally banned as bourgeois pseudoscience in there was never any basis for lysenkos ideas yet he controlled soviet research for thirty years lysenkoism ended in the s but russian biology still has not entirely recovered from that era now we are engaged in a great new theory that once again has drawn the support of politicians scientists and celebrities around the world once again the theory is promoted by major foundations once again the research is carried out at prestigious universities once again legislation is passed and social programs are urged in its name once again critics are few and harshly dealt with once again the measures being urged have little basis in fact or science once again groups with other agendas are hiding behind a movement that appears highminded once again claims of moral superiority are used to justify extreme actions once again the fact that some people are hurt is shrugged off because an abstract cause is said to be greater than any human consequences once again vague terms like sustainability and generational justiceterms that have no agreed definitionare employed in the service of a new crisis i am not arguing that global warming is the same as eugenics but the similarities are not superficial and i do claim that open and frank discussion of the data and of the issues is being suppressed leading scientific journals have taken strong editorial positions on the side of global warming which i argue they have no business doing under the circumstances any scientist who has doubts understands clearly that they will be wise to mute their expression one proof of this suppression is the fact that so many of the outspoken critics of global warming are retired professors these individuals are no longer seeking grants and no longer have to face colleagues whose grant applications and career advancement may be jeopardized by their criticisms in science the old men are usually wrong but in politics the old men are wise counsel caution and in the end are often right the past history of human belief is a cautionary tale we have killed thousands of our fellow human beings because we believed they had signed a contract with the devil and had become witches we still kill more than a thousand people each year for witchcraft in my view there is only one hope for humankind to emerge from what carl sagan called the demonhaunted world of our past that hope is science but as alston chase put it when the search for truth is confused with political advocacy the pursuit of knowledge is reduced to the quest for power that is the danger we now face and that is why the intermixing of science and politics is a bad combination with a bad history we must remember the history and be certain that what we present to the world as knowledge is disinterested and honest
