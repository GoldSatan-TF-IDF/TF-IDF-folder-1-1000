geoffrey jenkins a bridge of magpies p r e l u d e i n t o w a r february new york times report the japanese army led by revolutionary elements has taken over the government of japan the situation is confused and shooting is reported from the centre of tokyo and around the imperial palace violence and assassination seem to have been directed principally at members of the cabinet and holders of prominent offices of state close to the emperor among those reported to have been marked out for elimination are the lord keeper of the privy seal the grand chamberlain to the emperor the emperors closest adviser and japans most honoured elder statesman prince kinmochi saionji as well as other traditional hereditary officebearers some of whose titles date back many centuries february red army fourth bureau intelligence moscow receipt of urgent dispatch from head far east spy ring tokyo sorge to fourth bureau motivations for the incident are complex and the murder of hereditary officebearers close to the emperor requires careful study only one person was observed by agents to have passed through the army cordons surrounding the imperial palace during the first twentyfour hours of the coup he was a young naval ensign in full uniform he was seen to be carrying a small wellwrapped parcel and was admittedapparently by prior arrangement at a small secret side door of the palace because of a snowstorm identification was impossible he reemerged a short time afterwards still carrying the same parcel it is not known what his purpose was in visiting the palace and it seems unlikely that such a junior officer would be admitted to audience with the emperor the ensign successfully renegotiated the cordons probably due to his uniformand was traced to a small central tokyo hotel he came away from it dressed in civilian clothes then made his way to the docks here he boarded a cargo ship the brazilman due to sail on the next tide for cape town south africa the significance of this incident is obscure but because of its link with the imperial palace is given in some detail june signal intercepted by codebreakers at united states combat intelligence hq pearl

knife which lies on my desk as i write it is dark and discoloured it is an unusual weapon a thin pointed blade widening abruptly at the hilt which is very flat and hammered out of copper a design has been tooled into the metal a seascape about three inches long and half an inch broad showing a setting sun and ships sinking after battle on the reverse side of the blade are scribbled the last words the master wrote with the lead tip of a taisho pistol bullet using it like a pencil after he had plucked the knife from his side mei fa tzu it is fate these words underwrite not only his own fate but add a strange and awesome new dimension to two of the great decisive naval victories of the twentieth century pearl harbour and tsushima looking back on it the greek island of santorin on the mediterranean tourist cruise belt about sixty miles north of crete was an improbable curtainraiser for the desperate events half a world away on the sperrgebiet or forbidden diamond coast of south west africa which ended the masters eighthundredyearold reign of influence had i been able even to guess at them i would have dismissed them as being as unreal as a nightmare that soft late afternoon when i sailed my boat into santorins great lagoon in the sunset and headed towards the landingplace at thera the towns whitewashed houses on the clifftop were still brilliantly spotlighted by the sun although the bay nearly a thousand feet below was darkening and taking on those unbelievable sapphires blues reds and golds which drive tour ists and artists ecstatic i had really meant to tie up off the villa of oia situated at the northern tip of the thirtysevenmile crescent which constitutes the spectacular bay of santwin thera is another three miles away if i had carried out my first intention the odds are that i would never have received the summons which was waiting for me or by the time i had it would have been too out of date to be acted upon what really switched me on to sail those extra miles was the prospect of a bottle of theras subtly sweet wine because id had a blistering hot sail from athens to santorin on the meltemi or prevailing north wind there is a bar on theras jetty too within easy reach of a mooring shelf of rock compared with the mere offshore buoy at oia there is no regular steamer service to santorin only an intermittent cruise liner its berth was unoccupied on this occasion which meant id have the bar virtually to myself these were the small things which decided me in favour of thera clad in my old jeans i splashed up to the knees in the warm mediterranean water to make the orga fast while the sun projected its last theatrical effects on to the knifeedged cliffs soaring to the white town perched high above i waded ashore to the jetty the bar was built out of wine barrels the lower ones full and the top ones empty witha canvas awning for a roof and a bright blue curtain across the back the barrels creaked like a ship from the lift of the floating jetty it was a good place to rinse from ones mouth with wine the salt of a hard sail and to have the sea and your boat right there at your back a spit away if you got drunk a bottle of merovigli gigi my names annette not you look like gigi to me annette you get stoned again tonight mister this is plain honest thirst gigi it was bloody hot coming from athens she was dark pretty half greek and half alexandrian french at twenty she could have been ravishing properly made up at forty she would be a hag her untidy blouse was too tight and showed a tantalizing curve of white breast in the halfdark of the bar like me she was barefoot she placed the bottle of wine in front of me the first taste made that extra sail across the bay worthwhile does professor cacouris know you drink so much mister what the hells eating you tonight gigi i just wonder whether the professor knows thats all all those precious vases and things he gives you to take to athens in your boat the best stuff doesnt go with me i carry only the secondraters thats not what i hear mister call me struan i cant say it its a horrid name good scots itshorrid because she must have used it whos she the girl you ran away from to santorin for crying out youre letting your imagination run away with you okay then if youre going to be unfriendly stick to mister weddell she leaned over the plank bar top im not unfriendly im only concerned good then youre falling in love i would like to but theres too much going on inside you you would like me only for a little while in your bed then youd be tired of me and i would be unhappy lets stick to ancient vases and the profs excavations that way therell be no emotional spinoff you dont want to talk about yourself mister you want the wine to talk in that case youd better bring another bottle skates this time good strong rough maros your hair is much too long it is long and blonde like a womans theres no one to see it at sea you need a shave your shirt is dirty for crissake gigi put a sock in it a woman would be good for you mister when i want a woman i know where i can get one its not that sort of woman you want you want a real woman listen gigi i could have stopped off at oia if id wanted i came here for a friendly bottle of wine not a load of bitching you came because youre frightened of being alone mister you could just as well have gone on to the excavation site barbed wire pumice dust a spooky old place which blew up and killed everyone years ago no thanks she was right of course professor cacouris was busy excavating an ancient minoan city on the southern horn of santorins bay which was destroyed in one of the great natural disasters of antiquity it ranks as one of the archaeo logical finds of the century the principal treasures have been the superb frescoes which surpass any found elsewhere in the mediterranean including the famous ones from knossos there were also hundreds of pots amphorae and vases these provided me with profitable cargoes for the archaeological museum in athens the site was so valuable that it had been strongly fenced i hear you are very good now with the old vases and things one of these days professor cacouris will let you help with the frescos you hear a lot gin it is a bar people talk its pretty empty tonight dont you want to be alone with me not in your present mood i am a woman youre needling me into getting drunk you could have done that on your boat i never drink at sea you drink on land though sweet jesus cant you stop bitching and leave me to drink in peace its not peace youre afterits passing out then you can put the body aboard the orga another horrid name when i get bored by my lady tourists i call her the orgasm scares em off or lures em on depends actually its the name of the village in cyprus where she was built cyprus whos taking my homelands name in vain relieved to get away from gigis needling i swung round on my stool to greet the newcomer byron the greek a needlesharp devious sophisticated extanker officer who if you believed his stories had been washed by many waters from the persian gulf to piraeus his long coalblack hair and lush sideburns against a tanned skin also visible past swelling chestmuscles nearly to navel level through an open mauve shirt would have made him the envy of any male model and he knew it women couldnt stay away from him he knew that too and bore the burden stoically he sailed a bigger boat than mine what his cargoes were was anyones guess mine was that they were arms and anununition he had a piedaterre the uncharitable would have called it a funkholein the town of them eight hundred steps up the cliff from the bar we often drank together he was witty and entertaining the most delightful liar ive met byron come and help me get the taste of gigi out of my mouth he grinned and said something to her in greek which sent her sulking to the far end of the bar i thought gigis was the most likely place to find you he splashed himself a liberal dose of the skaros there are three people in thera looking for you tonight three myself ari and the postmaster old tsaras hed fall apart at the seams if he tried the steps youve found me but ari has the telegram he talked tsaras into letting him deliver it to you at the excavation site ad knew damn well i was away in athens ari was an urchin about ten years old who attached himself to me whenever i came ashore he was an orphan and lived in a hovel in theta perhaps the strength of the proprietary feeling about me was in direct proportion to my liberal tips knowing ari id say he was touching some sucker of a tourist for the fare to the site and then hoping to double up by what you gave him i laughed you bloody greeks are all the same at heartfrom the cradle onwards arent you interested in the telegram why should i be the typical beachcomber syndrome whered you learn that fine phrase byron it sounds like the exit line of one of your women he grinned she was american we met on an intellectual level i looked him over and you couldnt bear all that beau amp ful body going to waste the telegram is something special old tsaras was all steamed up about it gigi came over and joined us maybe its from athens about the vases you took never athens wouldnt bother about me theyd get in touch direct with the prof byron spreading his hands in the deprecating sympathetic way that only a greek can asked home no one gives a damn old tsaras said something about its being longdistance i refilled our glasses long may the home fires burn and burn and burn byron gave me a penetrating glance and said something to gigi she replied in english hes been in this mood all evening listen you two i said i dont want any sympathy and i dont want any tears i dont need em santarins my life im here by my own choice and i like it the way it is thats why youre not interested in your telegrammaybe from the cape who said the cape no one but thats where youre from know the cape byron ive sailed round it times enough fine then youll understand what im going to tell you being a tanker man yourself ever hear of the walewska what tanker man hasnt ripped herself open on a reef off south west africa carrying a full load of tons in these days of shortages then some triggerhappy sonofabitch commanding a frigate sent her to the bottom without even waiting to see i didnt send her to the bottom i blew her skyhigh a charge of plastic explosive under the seat of his pants couldnt have lifted him quicker off his stool christ you you yes me mel without being able to shift his eyes from me he said to gigi get me some of that whisky you keep stashed away for americans she gave us both a startled glance and scuttled away byron said slowly holding out his right hand i want to shake the hand that threw away a million dollars in a flash of flamepool like that cut it out i replied dont get melodramatic i had enough drama from the press at the official inquiry into the sinking from everyone in fact thats why im here you were kicked outcashiered byrons voice was full of awe and admiration gigi came back with the whisky and a light which she placed on the bar counter no i wasnt i quit of my own free will the navy was on my side all the way but there was a kingsized ruckus over the walewska the tanker company sued the government for millions the court hearing went on for months and i was target number one by the time it was finished i d had the lot of them sure i would have got another ship but i didnt intend to be strung along for the rest of my life at the end of a radio asking please sir may i do this please sir may i do that i was the captain of the frigate and i made the decision i stand by it fit for independent command murmured byron youre stuffed full of other peoples castoff phrases he shrugged if the cap fits so because you dont like other peoples querying your actions and decisions you pulled up stakes and quitto santorin an exnavy captain sailing aimlessly from nowhere to nowhere just that i was fed to the back teeth with the whole bunch of them inquiry navy lawyers the lot anyway who the hell are you to tell me what i should or shouldnt do he touched my hand wonderingly a million dollars up the spout if you go on fiddling with my hand ill begin to think im lady macbeth or youre a ladyboy not in front of gigi please struan the wineit had that fire which seems to be at the heart of all wines from volcanic soils started to give me a warm feeling about gigi and i was wondering how to get rid of byron who was concentrating on the whisky when gigi exclaimed heres ari now telegram for you boss you must hurry he was puffing and grinning as if hed run all the way down theras eight hundred steps he clutched a buff envelope only drachmas would loosen his grip howd you know you little bastard you cant read mister tsaras said hurry its from overseas he offered the envelope money in advance boss cape said byron ill bet on it he was right although i was half ready to accept that it might be i nevertheless felt an odd contraction in my stomach when i saw that the office of origin was cape town it had been sent two days previously and read your mother critically ill imperative you come at once groot schuur hospital its my mother i told them it says come at once where is she boss asked ari cape town its five thousand miles away i can get a plane direct front athens is she bad struan i caught myself staring at gigis breast and wondering when i d see her again for a beachcomber santorin hadnt been a bad bit of beach critical that was two days ago byron said first youve got to get to athena its miles itll be a hell of a beat right into the teeth of the meltemi my boats got an engine and id take you except i ve got an appointment on the turkish coast thanks all the same byron ill make out under sail pity santorin doesnt run to a steamer service does it say whats wrong with your mother gigi persisted no id guess a stroke at her age the other brothers and sisters can be with her in case you neednt go there arent any other brothers and sisters im the only son and your father killed in the war ill come and help you sail the orga boss ari chipped in free no charge i looked at the pinched pert face surprised and touched at the generous gesture hed miss mefor a day or two thanks no ari youd be left stranded in athens after id gone i cant tell how long be away byron assessed the sky youll have to make a long haul towards therasia before youll weather the entrance to the bay struan yes the sooner i get cracking the better right now theres nothing to keep me gigi turned the light away so that i couldnt read her eyes no there is nothing to keep you she went on speaking almost to herself i wish youd been drunk tonight then you couldnt have gone tomorrow when you surfaced again it would have been too late ill come back gigi the cape doesnt hold anything for me any more but she wouldnt reply just went and prepared some food for my trip to athena gigi byron and ari waded into the warm sea and pushed the orga clear of the flange of rock which made the easy mooring ari chattered excitedly while byron passed on some local sailing lore but gigi simply stood there with the water swishing round her bare legs when i brought the stern round and called goodbye she didnt wave or say anything the meltemi was ripping directly into the great bay and i set out as byron had indicated on the long pull towards therasia island in order to strike through the bays entrance to the open sea the business of getting sail on the clumsy old calque took time and when i looked back all i could see were the lights of gigis bar shining against the backdrop of the great cliff i set course for athensand the cape c h a p t e r t w o the boeing jumbo jet banked for the landing at cape town and i had a glimpse of table mountain through the overcast a fine cold rain was blowing off the ocean on a southwesterly galea typical miserable cape winters day the sight of the great mountain pitched a load of associations at me and made me depressed the long tiring air journey athens lisbon las palmas the bulge of africa angolaadded its own quota of discouragement i wondered if i should have come i would probably arrive too late to find my mother alive the rain splashed against the planes windows a reminder of days at sea on the bridge i made a derisive comparison between that cape of storms sea a cold grey wicked mass throwing a punch of three thousand miles of open water behind itand the aegean the meltemi was a womans wind compared with a cape buster and the tideless waves breaking on the picturepostcard islands had no more guts than a junkie maybe my contempt for the classic sea had showed itself by the way i had hurled my old calque into the meltemi after id left santorin i used a dozen seamans dodges to avoid the deadly tack and tackabout into the teeth of the same wind which once had blown the greek heroes from troy i had finally reached athens only a few hours before a cape flight was due to leave in the rush i hadnt managed to have my one thin tropical suit smartened up and it sat crumpled and untidy on me i hadnt a tie but had bought a black string bootlace thing off a plane steward the other passengers eyes told me i looked like a kinky beachboy after the landing i was checking through the usual formalities the sluicing rain on the way across the tarmac from the plane to the terminal building hadnt acted as the best of valet services to my suit and hair they were soaked i stood by while an immigration official examined my pass port he gave me a considering look reverted to my photograph regarded me again then went off to an inner office mother official appeared and also considered me both disappeared for some time and returned with a third man wearing a cap and plastic raincoat over his uniform war is die moeilikheid whats the trouble i asked no problem answered the desk official the raincoated man eyed me you are mr struan weddell yes its all there in the passport its hard to tell from the photograph the hair and the beard are new it was taken two years ago when i left south africa he stamped the passport and handed it to me this gentleman would like a word with you i then noticed the third mans cap under its plastic covering he was a naval officer he grinned at my surprise captain weddell yes compliments of the cinc sir weve been waiting hours for the jet shes late transport is laid on for you how did the cinc know i was coming i dont ask questions sir i was detailed to meet you and fly you to the hospital fly helicopter sir shes out on the apron hold it you mean to say the cinc actually you must ask the cinc why sir i dont know my orders were to meet the athens flight and fly you to the hospital i was touched hed no call to be generous after the way id thrown his job in his teeth as a result of the walewska business as i told byron the tanker tore out her bottom on a reef off south west africa and i sank her her skipper was trying to cut corners when making a landfall at panther head which is the main landfall for ships heading up the sperrgebiet or forbidden diamond coast the land looks like an old bone thats been gnawed and thrown away it is desert and has the worlds richest diamond fields that is why its forbidden territoryall eight hundred miles of it i d commanded a fisheries patrol frigate and part of my job was to police the sperrgebiet from the sea on land there are motorized patrols and helicopters the other part of my job was to keep an eye on the trawlers of all nations which frequent the coast the atlantic here matches the land for riches even the grand banks cant beat the fishing there is a third source of riches on this godforsaken shore a string of rocky little inshore islands coated in bird guanowhite gold they call it the walewskas oil would have killed off the bird and marine life of these islands if id allowed her to stay afloat so id blown her up with special charges so that the oil was destroyedrather than send her to the bottom and risk seepage from the wreck the danger was compounded by a strong current which flows through the guano isles id acted fast and on my own initiative i meant what i said thanks thanks for coming his grin behind the beard made him look ridiculously young lets go i said first ill go and borrow you a coat from the chopper youll get soaked it doesnt matter it was told to look after you you must be bloody cold if i may say so sir i hadnt noticednot after the navys warm reception he smiled then strode out to the helicopter and brought me back a weatherproof i felt good i hadnt been looking forward to the cheerless process of landing unmet and making my way to a deathbed we fell into step and made for the machine i broke the companionable silence is my mother still alive lieutenant a flicker passed across his face his reply was neutral i dont know sir ive told you what my orders are she must be otherwise all this wouldnt have been laid oni suppose so sir thank the cinc when you report will you ill also call later and thank him personally he didnt answer as he held open the door of the wasp here we are sir a thickset petty officer gave me a hand up and took my case the pilot nodded there were the usual clattering preliminaries and then we were airborne the international airport lies about fifteen miles out of cape town facing it the city on your right and a chain of a suburbs and resorts stretches to the left as far as the naval base at simonstown we lifted thin rain cloud drifted past the perspex i settled back and wondered whether the helicopter would land at the hospitalthey must have built a heliport there while i d been away the craft clattered and banged onwards after a while we changed direction and altitude wed dropped below the main body of the overcast but it was still very thick then through a gap i spotted a big old cape dutch style farmhouse and vineyards i couldnt recall vineyards near the hospital now i sat up with a jerk i was sure id spotted a famous pass called constantia net if so we werent within a dozen miles of the hospital but nearer the naval base it was useless trying to question my guide because of the earphone muffs we wore as protection against the machines racket i tapped him on the shoulder and gestured at the landmark but all i got back was a thumbsup signal we sank lower and there were vineyards again then trees appeared below together with a concrete landingpad a blacktop road and security gates flanking the landing place were antiaircraft batteries wetness streamed down the black barrels as they tracked the helicopter down i waited until the rotors clatter cut off what the hell gives lieutenant armed navy guards in wet oilskins opened the wasps door theres a security check this place is banned to civilians but this way if you please sir near the guns was a sort of concrete cupola which housed a liftsee here lieutenant this is no more a hospital than the lift sir the doors clashed shut and we dropped to ground level they reopened to reveal a pair of massive steel sliding doors about twice the height of a man and four times as broad set into bunkertype concrete my guide nodded to a guard who used a red telephone standing in a niche after a few words from him the big doors slid open as if operated sy some hidden agency inside if you please sir i dont see why but i was already in the doors thumped shut and we were in a bare brightly lit concrete chamber another pair of steel doors lay ahead we might have been on a mars sciencefiction set except for a navy guard sitting facing us behind a bulletproof window his telephone was yellow the doors ahead cant open before those behind are dosed said my guide conversationally and that cant be done without that blokes sayso securitys a hundred per cent those doors can also take a direct hit from a kilo bomb without a blink this space becomes an airlock in the event of a nuclear attack if you tell me this is hitlers bunker and youre eva braun ill believe you no dolls here mores the pity males rugged as they come handpicked ziplips listen before i move another bloody step youll have to now sir cant stop here the huge doors rumbled open on their runners several concrete passages radiated on the far side i was propelled into one of them and my escort fell into step with me silvermine he said its called silvermine they found the metal here in i think it was i hear your words but i dont know what the devil youre talking about silvermine nuclear attack airlock its new since your day sir its the navys operational headquarters its sunk into the side of the mountain storeys deep the hospital man my mothers dying the cinc will tell you about that sir were almost at his office we turned into a side tunnel a small pair of doors now open could seal off the passage nevertheless we faced the same elaborate security paraphernalia when finally we were admitted to an anteroom it looked less like outer space i saw an ordinary office desk a typewriter filing cabinets and walltowall carpetinghello godfrey said my escort well here he is welcome to silvermine captain weddell replied the aide the cincs expecting you inevitably he checked on the telephone before taking me in the admiral sat at an outsize deskthe same tough wiry little man with the boxers broken nose and lopsided grin his eyes were welcoming now but id seen them on occasion shuttered and opaque that was the time strong men ran he rose hand outstretched good to see you struan i half expected to find a little green man in a space suit you get used to it pretty soon it isnt a hospital though no it isnt a hospital look sir i appreciate what you did in sending a chopper to the airport for me i dont know how you knew about my mother but theres been a snarlup somewhere the lines must have got crossed ive been brought here instead of to the hospital ive got to get therequick every hour may be vital nothing got snarled up shes alive relax have a cigarette but i remained standing he eyed me through the smoke youve put on weight struan tor gods sake i didnt come here to talk about my weight my mother he nodded towards a cluster of three coloured telephones use the blue one youll find her at home theres nothing wrong with her the friendly eyes were starting to cloud up but i told myself angrily i wasnt one of his subordinates any longer the hospital sent me a cable to santorin i sent it your mother knows you sent it for crying in a bucket you mean to say you bluffed me into rushing back to south africawhat the devil for sit down listen ive a lot to say to you ill stand im going soon he was leaning back in his swing chair looking at me with a kind of amused contempt which needled me further this outfit is called silvermine ive already heard its probably the most modern naval operational headquarters in the world just behind me through there he gestured is the operations room top secret utmost top secret in fact so is this office the whole place is bugged monitored lousy with devices hidden beams and so on i didnt come here to listen to all this bull he let go the chair and it came forward with a bump against the desk you didnt come here you were brought but youre an unauthorized civilian on top secret premises for which you can be locked away for a long long time simply at my sayso he grinned and i didnt care for it you couldnt go even if you wanted to now shut up and sit down and listen to me i sat down i also took a cigarette i had you shanghaied at the airport i sent you the faked cable to bring you to cape townwith your mothers consent i might add why the devil couldnt you leave me alone see here a couple of months ago one of my officers was on holiday in santorin if id known id have given him a sail for old times sake spare the sarcasm he was a junior in your day you did meet him but you were too drunk to recognize him it has happened it did happen and pretty often im told why kidnap me to naval headquarters alcoholics anonymous is the place you want dont overdramatize snap that defence mechanism of yours out of top gear drinking may be a part of your lui lekkerlewe sweet life but youre not a drunk thanks for those few kind words my man overheard you using an afrikaans expression in some dive on a jetty that put him on to you its a bar not a dive theres no entertainment except gigi i was told there was a greek tart there gigis a bit flashy but shes not a tart the long and the short of it was that what he took to be a bum in a bar turned out to be captain struan weddell exnavy emphasis on the ex i told you not to be a bloody fool and quit because of the walewska affair but you wouldnt listen you gave me the vsign and vanished i can look after myself if this is your idea of putting me on the carpet i dont buy it the hell with it the hell with you too stop getting up youve stretched your craving for being a loner just about to the limit at santorin there arent such things in this modern world as blissful isles of escape once id located you i had a check made soft boozy aimless women just enough to live on toying with archaeology that sort of crap your dossiers spoton a purposeless layabout so what its my life he spoke into a pale pink intercom has he arrived he nodded at the answer apparently satisfied as you rightly say so what i knew id be wasting my time if i cabled asking you to come back i had to winkle you out of santorinand ive done it he eyed me through the cigarette smoke like a strategist whos pulled off a clever trick against the enemy again so what id got all set to take a dim view of another pennylecture broadside from him when he said in a completely changed voice i brought you here because i want your help with a problem struan you must be joking me you you were meant for a somebody not a bum his eyes were distant and only half friendly my retort didnt have the range the moral catoninetails again he ignored the crack i know youre screwed up still about the walewska business you dont have to be you never had to be from where i sit i havent heard your problem dont blow your nut and dont interrupt youre well acquainted with the sperrgebiet so that part of it doesnt need explaining i thought of that grim coast and its grim grey islands and the meltemi and the greek isles stuck in my craw youll find sperrgebiet names on old whalermens graves in new england a sailors boast to be remembered by i said i dont know your problem what dye know about possession island heard of it of course never been there the navigations tricky not the place for a big ship like my frigate it s the largest of the guano isles and that isnt saying much any idea how wide that channel is between it and the mainland id guess about two miles you know doodenstadt its only a name on the mainland opposite possession is doodenstadtthe town of the dead a bit fanciful for a coast which doesnt have a human let alone a town for hundreds of miles its really only a big group of rocks sticking out from the desert into the sea the rocks are big and square like houses and there are lanes resembling streets hence the name its all very realistic they tell me its half under water most of the time whats santorin like struan real houses three storeys some of them real streets fine carvings superb frescos the dry volcanic ash has preserved them even the colours would it surprise you to hear that a fresco has been found at doodenstadt there wasnt any sound except the airconditioning there were no residual noises in the flat silence after our voices stopped i said at length i can ride with santorin but not doodenstadt the place has been known for at least a century if thered been frescos someone would have discovered them long before now doodenstadt turns out to be not merely a figure of speech ifs real its a town a lost city and atlantis lies under table bay i never thought id live to see the high office of commanderinchief knocked by fantasy i almost said the same thing myself at first ive seen the way the eggheads minds go into orbit over santorin they steam themselves up into all sorts of improbable conclusionsits platos drowned paradise god knows what else ill bet its the same about doodenstadt for an answer he rummaged in a drawer and produced a volume bookmarked with newspaper cuttings ever heard of farini farini was an american traveller who chimed to have camped at a lost city in the kalahari desert in let me see the kalahari isnt the sperrgebiet moreover its halfway across the subcontinent from doodenstadt im not suggesting a connection only its interesting that farini found an ancient ruined city covered by sand says whofarini he wrote a book about it ill bet he did i value your scepticism struan farinis discovery has been kicked about by everybody the weight of the evidence is that he did finds ruins and that probably theyve since been covered over again by sand his son even took a photograph of the place scores of expeditions in modern times have searched for farinis lost city without without success i helped myself to another cigarette the navys become a fun outfit since my time we never thought much beyond ships and the sea lost cities didnt figure youve seen santorin there could be a parallel look im not an expert im the dimmest sort of amateur when it comes to this sort of thing ive seen some of santorins frescostheyre much too valuable for a duffer like me to touch my boat provided cheap transport for some second and thirdrate stuff we dont lack experts in fact youre going to meet one of them pretty soon hes sitting right outside waiting for me to ring dr hellmut koch he discovered doodenstadts fresco then why bring me here and with all that elaborate cloakanddagger think man for more than a century the sperrgebiets been the mysterious outofreach getrichquick mecca of every crook who could get himself a ship to sail in first it was for the white gold guano then diamonds now doodenstadt could be stage three sparking off a bigscale treasurehunt i couldnt give a damn whether doodenstadt is atlantis or a link in farinis chain of cities under the sand what i am concerned about is that a lot of hoodlums could invade the forbidden coast not for the sake of a fresco or two that wont be the way the treasurehounds will view doodenstadt that fresco will be an arrow pointing straight at buried treasure unlimited gold ancient jewels all the nevernever stuff soon theyll be saying captain kidds treasure is peanuts beside what lies under doodenstadt thats the way a treasure legend snowballs and there are always suckers to believe it nogood suckers when they dont find treasure theyll turn to a spot of illicit diamond running as a backstop against their costs and ships willing to do that sort of thing cost plenty this is a job for the diamond police not the navy youre wrong there are hundreds of foreign trawlers on the fishing grounds if word leaked out about a lost city at doodenstadt the navys life wouldnt be worth living and one things sure the diamond police wont play ball over this hot potato they argue rightly that the land securitys as tight as all getout but that its wide wide open from the sea and the sea is the navys responsibility station a frigate at possession that would plug the gap how long do you think doodenstadts secret would stay a secret if i did that every trawler and every island headman would start asking whats new whats a frigate up to another big diamond strike to protect the buzz would spread like a veld fire no a warship would be the surest way to advertise a lost city besides how effective would it be you know that bloody sperrgebiet weather a gale twenty days a month and the fog every day theres that damn fog every day theres half an extra smugglers night thrown in gratis you cant win you know yourself you cant operate a big ship like a frigate round possession theres no sea room and the reefs are thicker than pockmarks on a hottentots face a brace of fast patrol boats would do the trick logistically sound but economically and ecologically crap possessions one of the most important guano islands disturb the birds with highpowered boats engines and theyll push off no guano no white gold were playing verbal skittles i pot em up you knock em down youre the only skittle that cant be knocked down what the hell do you mean the lost city game must be played cards dose to the chest there must be security until koch has time to sort out what really gives but security with a difference it mustnt seem to be security whats needed is a oneman outfit you m e for reply he spoke into the intercom send in dr koch koch was a tall rangy austrian with slickedback hair and a pair of humorous grey eyes behind hornrimmed glasses he didnt look much older than me this is our man koch hotfoot from circe and her wine eh it was the first flash of a sense of fun i came to know well that and his total dedication to his work the investigation of seashore middens belonging to strandlopersseashore walkers who were a vanished stone age race of sperrgebiet nomads the way he said it turned me on gigi i corrected her name was gigi the memory of sweet days ferments inside me he sighed i remember once in athens a bottle from santorin slightly sweet but it had a fire you can swop boozy reminiscences later snapped the cinc he hasnt accepted yet koch tell him about the fresco the admirals put you in the picture about doodenstadt aye heres the setup there are these enormous blocks of rock halfin and halfout of the breakers theres the old wreck of a big liner lying on top of them i was snuffling about there for middens one exceptionally low tidea rare good chance for me you dont often see the water as low as that or so cairn also a rarity in those parts a large cave originally a fault in the rock strata had been opened up and formed by wave action i went in at its landward end the cleft led to a regularshaped rock tunnel which ran clean under the desert this tunnel was higher than the sea cave and out of reach of the water and so quite dry i went in only a little way as i was scared of being trapped by the tide returning but i spotted this with my torch and got a shot of it he tossed me a photographic colour slide i held it up to the light it might have been a duplicatewith variationsof one of the most precious finds to come out of santorini it was a small fresco showing two gemsbok or oryx cavorting tails swishing heads held high certainly the artists treatmentlight and gracefulwas uncannily similar in the two cases the santorin scene had presented the pundits with an inexplicable enigma had oryx in modem times found only in the middle east and africa once inhabited the aegean islands or had there been a land link now submerged by the ocean ill be damned i elaborated on the santorin discovery koch was afire when id finished the cinc sat back with the air of a magician who has produced rabbit quintuplets out of a hat when hed expected one kochs words tumbled over one another if struans right we may be on to something much bigger than we imagined if doodenstadts tied up in some way with the middle east or a vanished minoan civilization his use of my christian name was a tacit assumption that i was going along with the lost city idea the cinc assumed that too be a oneman assignment struan and let me warn you no bed of roses also its winter and the island may be pretty miserable theres no one else there so youll be secure with a capital s ive fixed a ship for you to use a fishing cutter shes there at possession now koch wants at least a couple of months to explore youll assist of course well give you headman status youll relieve the present zombie who has started mainlining youll go there in the usual manner of a new headman taking overin the island relief coaster youll wear a headmans uniform nothing to arouse anyones suspicions questions steady weddell steady i told myself theyre rushing fences a nasty little voice at the back of my brain whispered youre being taken for a ride a very clever shop window to hide the true nature of the goods on offer the soft sell sperrgebietstyle something of this must have been noticeable in my tone because the cinc glanced sharply at me as i asked communications how do i contact you ive got a special transceivervoice radiolaid on rca navy job enough frequencies to chat to the moon but that doesnt mean youre going to use it like a telephone minimal use means maximum security in the islands they gossip over the air like housewives in a supermarket its their main form of relaxation remember anything you say will be public property within hours play any situation by ear dont come running to me i leant forward and ground out my cigarette in his ashtray he frowned i said deliberately i hope this conversation is being bugged because if you have any doubts about what i say you can make a playback you neednt worry about that radio because i wont be using it ever i know a rehabilitation package when i see one even when its wrapped up in lovely romantic ribbons like these i indicated the colour slide next time find someone stupider if thats african then siberia is atlantis i dont intend to be tricked into being landed on some remote bloody guano island five hundred miles up the most godforsaken coast in the world with no chance of a drink or a woman because of your dogooder inclinations thanks for the ride it was nice seeing your superstar headquarters in short you can put your lost city up your admirals jersey he made a sound deep in his throat half rose and plucked away a switch and broken length of wire from his desk we arent bugged any longer what ive got to say is for your ears alone that slide is the real mccoy but the hell with that what is important is guts and when i wanted someone with guts for a special job my first thought was of one manstruan weddell why dye think i went to all this trouble if i didnt believe you have what it takes seems i was wrong dead wrong possession takes guts i saw it at work there during the war and ill never forget it convoy wv bx i was in one of the escorts a corvette the escort leader was a frigate called gousblom off possession we heard the sound of heavy guns a raider or a pocket battleship we thought that didnt stop gousblom that pipsqueak of a ship went off at full speed to fight it was straight suicide and she knew it but shed rather have thrown herself away than let the enemy get at the convoy shed been entrusted with then a uboat bagged gousbiom right in the possession channel her magazine went up the uboat had just torpedoed a big liner the city of baroda added koch his manner too was hostile now the one i was telling you about lying on top of doodenstadts rocks it wasnt the barb or the cincs taunt but the sincerity behind it which altered my decision it was the job which was his objective not me i believed him now believed koch too if i accepted the possession assignment id have a ship of sorts because they still run the guano islands as ships and id be her captain independent command i grinned to myself maybe too bloody independent with only birds for a crew and birdshit for a deck but it might turn out to be fun and deepdown i knew that a spell away from bottles and women wouldnt do me any harm weddell the happy hairshirt hermit i felt happier than id been in years we never found out what those heavy guns were that gousblom heard the cinc was rasping with his eyes stabbing me like a laser beam there was no big stuff either ours or the germans about but thats beside the point its a question of guts if you chicken out he made a pansys wristflapping handonhip gesture which would have won him a musichall encore and would have been utterly ridiculous if it hadnt been part of his anger he tugged at the bit of wire and glared at me i gave him a moment or two to run down ive changed my mind ill go if my turnabout had any effect upon him he didnt show it maybe he claimed all the credit for himself the frost didnt leave his eyes youre under my orders from now on no signals except in emergency clear koch will fly back to luderitz the day after tomorrow all the paperwork is jacked up already youll sleep here silvermine has plenty of accommodationpart of the nuclear preparedness game go and apologize to your mother from me you will not discuss doodenstadt with anyone understood understood sir any ah attachments at santorin gigi give me some credit good thats all koch took my arm in a friendly gesture as we made for the door now what in hell do you think a minoan gemsbok is doing on the sperrgebiet c h a p t e r t h r e e panther head is the gateway to the sperrgebiet crooks and cruisers gunrunners and guano dopes new bedford whalers and piratescaptain kidd includedhave homed in on this dirty grey chunk of eroded desert sticking out into the sea about sixty miles north of the orange river taken sights on the triple peaks of the buchu berge and set course for sinister destinations among the fourteen fogshrouded guanostained islands skirting the coast the name itself stirs up the mud of history panther was a wellarmed thousandtoner of the german navy that kept order on the coast in the first mad days of the diamond strikes she sailed into notoriety and history before world war i by trying to seize the moroccan port of agadir for the kaiser her action almost put forward the world cataclysm by a couple of years my pulses quickened when from the deck of the coaster buffel taking me to possession i caught sight of those triple peaks and the mirrorlike flash of a late sun reflected by the innumerable salt pans backing the landfall it is not until about twentyfive miles north of the orange river that the first break in the monotony of the shoreline occurs and one begins to sense the mystery and lure of the diamond coast this feeling grows progressively as one approaches panther head the duplicity which seems to have soaked into the sperrgebiet is also at work on the coastline captains dont trust what their eyes see here if they do it could cost them their ships and their lives the stubby coaster plugged on with a headdown shambling gait which suited her name buffel buffalo the wind was fresh and sharp the sky was full of small white clouds as if a squadron of gannet divebombing fish had left their feathers behind after peeling off for the attack i was buffers only passenger she was to bring off the islands last officials before they stopped work for several months until the laying and hatching season was over one of the men she was to ptck up was possessions headman whose place i would take i drank in the cold air eagerly it was ten days since my encounter with the cinc i had seen a lot of koch before he flew to luderitz some days before my own departure wondered what the cincs reaction would have been to the sight of the irrepressible austrian performing the sword dance in a sailors waterfront dive i had stayed on at silvermine to enjoy a crash getfit course had visited my mother a somewhat embarrassed collaborator of the cinc had been made headman of possession officially in cape town and now i was here wearing the regulation corduroy clothes and a peaked cap decorated with the badge of office panther head came closer and a view of chamois bay beyond opened up four groups of reefs bunker the place about in a rough circle of about six miles we had to negotiate the southernmost gap between them to enter the bay whitecaps creamed on the jagged fangs and threw up a drifting haze of spray however the coaster was safe enough i was tense for a different reason i was reliving my walewska nightmare it was here that the tanker had torn out her bottom and made a break for the high seas i had been about fifty miles away when id received her distress signal i reached her to find a big slick already streaming away to the northwest in the direction of the guano islands her load of tons was enough to wipe out most of the wild life population of the islandsbirds seals penguins the walewskas captain reckoned he could save the ship if he dumped her cargo i was caught in a double hammerlock quandary if i allowed him to jettison the oil where he was hed destroy the islands if i permitted him to make for the open sea and dump there hed do the same thing for the fish life which thrives so abundantly round the great benguela current the benguela flows to the sperrgebiet all the way from the antarctic it is one of the worlds major currents and transports vast quantities of plankton the fishes food there was a third reason for my decision to destroy not only the tanker but also her oil the sea was in the grip of what is known scientifically as an upwell cell once every winter a very powerful special wind is generated on the sperrgebiet it lasts only a few days it is hot and blows from the desert out to sea id seen sand columns hundreds of feet high miles offshore this wind is so strong that it pushes the surface water bodily out to sea in turn it is replaced by other water from deep down and far outicy benguela water its like some gigantic ballvalve mechanism going into operation it is called an upwell cell because the sea does just that it wells up on the coast it hits maximum strength at a spot a little north of where the tanker struck and consequently produces a strong current which flows up the sperrgebiet there was really only one solution i took the decision off my own bat fast too because of the danger i removed the walewskas crew and fixed delayedaction demolition charges in her holds so that we could get well clear before she blew up it was a good thing i did ships sixty miles away felt that explosion i looked now for the walewskas stern section which had been brought back by the current and spotted it lying on the rocks which flanked the northwestern entrance to the bay white water tooting high up the side of its rusty hulk the walewska had become something superheated inside my brain i cursed the ugly bitch of a thing with a sailors oath and felt better the long light made a savage magic out of the desert the coastal pans and lowrise sandhills experts say it hasnt changed a feature in a million years captain murray a dour scotsafrikaner anchored for the night inside the bay keeping the coasters head to the boisterous wind and strong inshore current the seas became steep and vicious as they hit the shallow water round panther head it was as comfortable as sleeping on a pogo stick the fog came down the bay was full of unidentifiable noises after an uneasy stay we set off next morning and picked our way past the walewskas hulk unnaturally large and ghostlike in the thinning fog en route for the first group of godforsaken islands as individual as their nameslittle roastbeef sparrowhawk sinclair black sophie and plumpudding it took most of the day to thump our way up the coast calling in for brief intervals to take off an odd man here and there until we reached possession in the late afternoon captain murray spat nicotine and phlegm over the side of the bridge possession which being interpreted is shit it was quite a speech for him thered been little more than grunts out of him the whole way up from the cape shut up in that hole id start to talk to the penguins maybe you will before youre through perhaps ill quit by the end of the winter i dont know depends on what i durum depends youre a bit fancy for a headman it takes all types you aint brought along any dopendum i sew no alcohol allowed headman yes the rest no well i didnt so thats it eh whats what thats what youre running away from im not running away from anything weddell somewhere i know that name cant think where i didnt enlighten him i was busy watching a boat putting off from the island buffel had come the safe way through the channels southern entrance to fetch up at the anchorage opposite a group of prefab huts ashore possession is about two miles long a half broad and seventy feet above the sea at its highest point and shaped rather like a stretchedout version of a human foetus a bit at the south resembling a head and neck submerged continuations of the islands northern extremity form the kreuz shoals lying between it and the mainland at elizabeth bay about four miles distant the shoals make the northern channel very dicey unless the weather is dead calmwhich is almost never captain murray seemed nervous i reckoned he was talking in order to hear the sound of his own voice possession was as inviting as a seal rookeryand as smelly weddell itll come back let me know when it does my next call is in three months time maybe by then youll be like that poor bugger coming off now in the boat started smoking grass grew the stuff with tender loving care in a potty in his cottage they tell me if hed tried outside the wind would have finished the plants off in a day hes on to mainline stuff now where does he get it from here where do any of them get it from look at his eyes when he arrives what made you take this job interest jesus he slipped the pipe from his mouth and gestured with the stem at the coastline the channel was about two miles wide on a westeast axis and slightly longer from south to north then about another four miles from possessions northern tip the mainland changed direction sharply and jutted westwards into the ocean abruptly terminating the channels southnorth direction a promontory called elizabeth point completed the ushaped loop of the shoreline near it was a cluster of ruins the site of an abandoned diamond ghost town the setting sun that still came over the shoulder of the island picked out the landmarks ashore through a haze of spray one dominated all the resta gigantic arch of rock opposite possession nearly two hundred feet high whose centre had been completely carried away by the sea leaving only about twenty feet remaining at either end one leg of the arch was on land the other in the breakers the rock glinting as though polished looked like a black rainbow fantastically plucked out of the sky and dumped on the coastthe bridge of magpies the shoreline round about it was composed of slabs of dark and variegated rock which had kept their surprising geometrical square shapes despite the continual scouring of the wind and waves doodenstadt the town of the dead behind doodenstadt the desert began again in a series of low light greybrown sandhills which rose steeply from the sea but nowhere reached a height of more than three hundred feet the bridge of magpies was the eyecatcher but almost rivalling it in the field of the fantastic was the object perched on top of doodenstadt like a great wounded animal a big twostack liner sat upright on the rocks outwardly apparently undamaged captain mu rays pipestem fixed on it the city of baroda torpedoed in the war and beached shes out of reach of the waves else shed have disappeared long ago he clamped his teeth back on to his pipe and exclaimed why cant that bloody boat hurry up from the island that wreck gives me the willies it shows what can happen around here arent you staying tonight nooit nie never im pulling out as soon as youre on your way ashore that dump also gives me the creeps i see theyve got the ghost light going already and the suns not even down a point of light showed in one of the panes of a prefab it resembled a chance reflection of the sunset it burns all night every night no gamat would stay otherwise gamet is an affectionate term for the fine halfcaste malay fishermen of the cape and south east africa their far eastern originthe first were brought as slaves in the seventeenth centuryendows their rites and religion with a touch of the supernatural like all other sailors they are deeply superstitious captain murray measured the distance of the approaching boat if you get a sight of it from the sea through the fog it looks like a damn ghost itself whose ghost is it supposed to be a womans she was drowned in an old windjammer called the auckland over on the islands west side a shark took her legs they say she haunts the place searching for them with two huge hounds for company they were with her in the auckland nice neighbours ill be having it sounds like a vealjapie brandy yarn to me but once youve lived on possession for a while youll believe anything if you want an example take a gander at that lot buffel ahoy the cry came from a gamat standing in the stern of the approaching island boat and using a steering oar with great skill the boats design was new to mesome whaling ancestry somewhere hes the laziest bastard in the isles breekbout breekbout i you must be joking thats not a name he got it because he split his arse in half from sitting on it too much breekbout it doesnt affect the way he handles that boat no hes good firstclass but look at that sonofabitch ruin with him he was the headman id come to relief van rensburg they threw a mooring line from the buffet it hit him but he didnt make a move to make it fast he was hipped in his own twilight world for crying out loud maybe breekbouts sense of humour will save you from going the same way its pretty way out but anythings better than nothing on possession take my tip thoughget to know that gamet over there he pointed with his pipe at a fishing cutter riding at anchor at the head of the channel close to the dangerous shoals kaptein denny damn fine sailor hes one off for a gamet keeps to himself if my ship was in trouble id like him around he broke off abruptly theyd tied up the whaleboat while hed been talking and now van rensburg came up the bridge ladder to join us he might have been one of possessions strolling ghoststhe stiff way he walked like a marionette i decided to leave quick totsiens goodbye captain thanks for the ride i tried to edge past but van rensburg blocked my way his eyes were shuttered and remote good luck captain weddell you need good luck on possession his form of address caught me off balance for a moment it had slipped my mind that i was in the ship tradition of the isles possessions new captain it flashed through my mind that thered been some leak of the cincs secret when he called me by my naval title so i didnt answer he said in a thin venomous unnatural voice a highhat and a shit eh possessionll cut you down to size damn quick i stopped with one foot on the ladder well see his laugh was as bad as his voice mainly because it left his face completely blank and his eyes too well see i possessions a prisonhouse didnt you know no escape anywhere anyhow good luck captainstuffyouweddell i i went quickly overside a couple of the crew passed down my kit which id had ready on deck the transceiver from slivermine i carried myself in a battered old leather suitcase which we had specially chosen to hide its contents captain murray began to shout sailing orders my first closeup view of possession turned me off as quick as it apparently did captain murray who was hightailing to sea by the time the whaleboat reached the islands concrete jetty he was right about the stink the wind blowing directly off the guano rocks was pissy and ammoniacal as a shebeen urinal another impression struck me forcibly i hung for a moment on the rusty iron ladder leading from the water to the top of the jetty and looked down at breekbout there arent any birds man one fly away april back in july same every year i liked his grin away from the jetty the birds breedingfiats were walled off from a group of stores barracks and the headmans cottage everything was smeared a dirty unpleasant grey by the guano as jy daar loop dan val jy in die nat op jou gatif you walk there when its wet youll fall on your backside breekbout went on ms waarom ek altyd sitthat s why i always jou skelmyou bastard his cheerfulness was a buffer against the grim depressing graveyard air of the place the first wisps of fog were drifting in from the sea and the grey coastline was becoming greyer the only manmade object in sight was the cutter which was named gaok her deck was deserted whats she doing here i asked breekbout fish fishings banned inside the twelvemile limit kaptein denny always fishes here well see about that tomorrow kaptein denny is a very good sailor so i hear but that doesnt give him the right to fish where he shouldnt any selfrespecting fisherman would be snug at home on a night like this kaptein denny has no wife no girl maybe his pricks too small gaok is his home gaok what the devil does that mean ask kaptein denny he knows everything hes quite a boy it seems very strong very tough speaks unman too how old fifty fiftyfive maybe hell live to be a hundred no women no brannewyn well pay him a visit tomorrow he couldnt be doing much out of line whatever it was is the force wind which was kicking up sharp seas in the channel and whistling down the grotesquelyshaped rocks of my new home breekbout showed me over van rensburgs cottage most of the furniture was gone and it shared an air of forsakenness with the empty barracks where the labourers slept during the guano scraping season breekbout had a corner in the barnlike place i plumped for company rather than comfort and found myself a bunk there wasnt even the scratting of a mouse to give life to the shadows where the lantern didnt reach the atmosphere was as relaxing as a blow to the adams apple i would have put two ghost lights in the window i slept badly in the morning breekbout turned out from the shiptype galley a slovenly breakfast of halfburnt mealiemeal porridge and boiled penguin eggs we ate the mess by lantern light as the island was still shrouded in impenetrable fog it dripped in outsized drops off everything a complex of gutters from the roofs channelled the precious water into big concrete storage tanks baths were out i wanted to get up and go and explore doodenstadt but the fog made it impossible so i killed time by setting up the transceiver the gleaming set had everything that opened and shut my code callsign was wv bx the cincs choice the instrument fascinated breekbout so i taught him how to operate it transmissions however were out because of the cincs ban but i rang the reception changes from longto shortwave as well as vhf there was enough island and ship gossip on the air to give us plenty of practice when i could make out the breakers on the mainland under the haze i decided to set off in the whaleboat it was about midmorning wisps of fog still clung round the islands stark topography shorewards it was lighter gaok remained bidden in the curtain to the northeast the previous days southerly blow had backed into a light northwester breekbout propelled the boat by means of an odd and seemingly unworkable rowing action with one oar in a stern row lock once clear of the jetty the murk was still thick on the water and i was lost but he seemed to know where he was all the time gaok showed up unexpectedly she was a typical sturdy bluffbowed job beautifully built by fritz nieswandts yard in luderitz she was about seventy feet long powered by both sail and diesel the enclosed deckhouse was aft and the mainsail boom swung clear above it scores of similar vessels i had seen in the fishing grounds had all bad a typical blunt stem but this one had a kind of carved whalebone figurehead added gaok ahoy the deckhouse door opened and a short stocky figure dressed in a sunfaded fishermans jersey and thick corduroy pants emerged his head was round and set close on his shoulders and there were a few grey streaks in his otherwise very black hair not short and curly as a gamats usually is but straight and rather long his face was weatherbeaten more tawny than copper and strangely smooth it had the typical high cheekbones and oriental appearance of the malay he made us fast with large strong hands i jumped aboard my first impression was of his rather dignified aloofnesssomething natural in his bearing perhapsbecause he was quite friendly kaptein denny dis mythats me weddell the new headman of possession so ive arrived i saw he inclined his head towards the longboat switching into english some of his vowels had unusual values youre out early captain weddell with a rifle too your english is pretty good i thank the sonop school in cape town i like to give it a workout when i can i dont get much chance theres not much need for that rifle around here captain its a standard headman issue van rensburg used his a lot on the seals im not van rensburg its my job to protect them and the fishinside the twelvemile limit thats a new duty for a headman i hadnt heard about it every fisherman knows its illegal to fish inside the twelve mile limit kaptein denny not all fish captain all fish its cold up here on deck come below he led me to a day cabin under the wheelhouse a second smaller one led off it both were much better fitted out than the spartan accommodation i had seen in other cutters he fiddled at a small mahogany bar something to keep out the colda dopendum brandy and water the suns not over the yardarm yet he smiled f eetingly well call it night because of the fog that makes it all right a small one then he turned to fix the drinks and i almost sat on a cushion which had been crushed down hurriedly on the locker it half concealed a womans handbag and a white silk scarf i supposed the woman was hidden away somewhere below we must have disturbed them by coming unexpectedly out of the fog it blew kaptein dennys image which breekbout had given me yet it was nothing to do with me if he brought his goodies along to enjoy in the solitude of the sperrgebiet he must have noticed the crumpled cushion when he handed me my brandy but gave no sign he drank orange juice breekbout was correct about him there i cant drink alone i said its against my religionsorry dont be sorry you a mohammedan no malay my sect forbids it gesondheid good health he sat down and stared at me with curious unreadable eyes i felt awkward drinking his liquor and pulling my authority while doing it i dont want to crack down on you about this fishing business itll be okay if you just clear out say its a friendly warning ive been coming here every winter for over thirty years it must be it gives me a sort of squatters right an unexpected remark from a fisherman but it gave me a clue to why he had taken over leadership of the luderitz gamat community in court that would be called argument by false analogy his eyes remained expressionless he just sat passively regarding me i felt uncomfortable look i dont want to play rough and start acting like a new broom but you know its against the regulation i come only in winter why its the sort of fish in the summer the currents wrong for them it could be as you say i know this coast very well captain weddell there are some very strange things strange as hell right under his keel was the strangest of all a lost city i told myself i mustnt make an overkill of the fishing issue or else he might suspect something on the other hand i didnt want him hanging around and watching once koch arrived that could be any time i downed the brandy thanks for the drink its my first day and im taking a looksee at my kingdom im on my way for a run ashore i wouldnt go captain weddell theres a big blow coming up you could be trapped we had a gale yesterday come up on deck and show you what i mean the fog bad lifted and visibility was a couple of miles on the seaward horizon however lay a thick bank of it still it was unusual because between it and the sky was a clearcut seam of the horizon that means a buster itll be here before youve had your run ashore ive also sailed this coast thats simply a hangover from the morning fog itll be gone in an hour it means trouble here close inshore a few miles out its different theres one weather on the coast and another at set he was too concerned about my welfare and it made me suspicious i must have shown my scepticism it can be blowing only a moderate breeze out to sea when a full gale tears up the channel you wont like it if youre caught ashore there isnt any water youll be stuck there until the wind drops besides its almost a full moon whats that got to do with it it always blows hardest at possession at the full and change of the moon im learning there are always things to learn on the sperrgebiet captain weddell the odd way he said it clinched my decision to ignore his advice ill take my chance thanks all the same breekbout aye aye sir doodenstadt make it snappy kaptein denny said you cant land on the rocks the best spot is to the north theres a bit of a beach i decided to ignore that too nor did i ask kaptein denny how he came to know where the best landingplace was on a shore where landing was prohibited doodenstadt when i got close enough hadnt a chance of convincing me it was a lost city no way it was little elseoutwardly at leastthan an outcrop of formidable rocks of unusual shape the streets a series of gullies possibly resulting from the erosion of a thousand storms of course kochs fresco was away out of sight but i was thoroughly disenchanted keep clear i snapped at breekbout do you want us to finish up alongside that other bloody wreck kaptein denny was right no landing here he mumbled truculently when i still hesitated about giving in he added kaptein denny always right okay blast you back to the beach i want to check the liner breekbout stayed with the boat at the little beach while i plunged through a tangle of alleys between the sandhills in the general direction of the city of baroda the going opened up farther on when i struck a wide sandy watershed leading towards it i followed this it effectively masked my approach to the bow section of the wreck then there were mens voices ahead there was plenty of cover and whoever was speaking couldnt see me coming i crawled forward making sure my rifle didnt make a giveaway clink the sound gave me a clear bearing all the time but the nearer i approached the more strident the voices became distorted almost mechanical they were mechanical the gully narrowed and kinked and ended against a platform of rock sitting on this in the lee of the wreck her back to me was a girl next to her was a taperecorder whence the voices id homed in on c h a p t e r f o u r she seemed to be having trouble with the machine which gave out a jumble of donald duck noises maybe the distortion was caused by the tape snagging in the wind whatever the cause it gave me a chance to observe without being observed she stood up and busied herself rewinding the spool with one finger doing it very carefully as if she didnt want to entrust the task to the recorders own automatic device the rock on which she stood was at my eyelevel her back remained towards me so i couldnt see much of her face indeed even when she halfturned the wind blew her hair from under her beret masking her face the hair itself was enough to stare at thoughredgold as if shed been caught in a desert sunset what little i did glimpse of her features made me certain she hadnt been out in the wind and sperrgebiet sun for long she was wearing a crumpled loose hiplength suede jacket darker than the sand and slacks also crumpled i laid the rifle silently on a ledge of rock above my head intending vaulting up after it i paused however when i caught sight of various objects the girl had spread about several very large maps weighted down with stones a small pile of notebooks and some printed books one of which bore a remarkable resemblance to the admiralty pilot for the sperrgebiet there was also a compass on top of the books which had been lined up on the wreck i could tell this because it was one of those instruments with a mirror case in which i spotted the reflection of the need e a man found on the sperrgebiet with so compromising a load would have to do a lot of fast talking to a diamond patrol as for a woman i couldnt begin to guess she turned suddenly and i ducked out of sight at the same moment the tape started up again shed been so near to spotting me that i didnt try to retrieve my rifle for fear of making a noise it looked safe enough however because the ledge it was on was out of her sight slightly below the level of her rock what the tape said killed my previous intention of getting up there and and demanding what she was up to it was german i understand it though my spoken attempts wouldnt win me any language awards come in swakop it said u to dinghy come in testing testing testing dye hear me answer over i slid down into a sitting position against the wall of the gully hunching myself up in

magpies c h a p t e r f i v e as if on cue the recording cut out i opened my eyes the girl was kneeling on the rock platform above holding my rifle she handled it as though it might bite her her hands were all in the wrong places and the muzzle pointed at the sky at least it wasnt trained on me our eyes met across the blueblack line of the barrel she eyed me with the intense fascinated compulsion you reserve for a dangerous snake emerging from its hole when you dont know whether it or the weapon in your hand is worse i took all this in as i got to my feet the iron gun in the iron hand i mocked she seemed to find it hard to speak properly because her lip muscles were out of control what do you want why are you spying on me not spying just investigating her face closed up in blankness i didnt say that i yes i spotted you in the compass mirror peering over the edge of the rock she jerked out your hair was blowing all over the place i must remember to have my barber fix it before i set out on my next spying mission im serious the barrier of tension between us was as real as an elec tric fence i felt it was time i got my gun out of those inexpert hands it was loaded but the safety catch was on i was quite sure she didnt mean to threaten me with it shed only grabbed it because it was there anywaythe time for finesse was past i vaulted up alongside her and took the weapon away she didnt resist i think she was glad to be rid of it its always better to be the shooter than the shootee i quipped who are you that can wait the question is who are you what sort of soundtrack is that youve got there radio television she stared back uncomprehending she was operating on quite another wavelength from me she blinked rapidly her right eye seemed to have some grains of sand in one corner and there were traces of facepowder stuck in her poloneck sweater after her hair her eyes were her best feature seagreen with flecks of light in them she seemed younger than i about thirty this place is off limits i said diamond territory ver boten that coven stunt recorders as well i asserted it emphatically but in my own mind that didnt quite include the maps and other things id seen she wasnt with me yet she was still living with something in the recording stunt thats when i was born she replied if thats so all i can say is that the language of maternity wards has caught up with the permissive age she made a stagey throwaway gesture at the taperecorder that underlined the first conclusion id jumped to i mean born when the liner was hit you artistes live out your scripts dont you but dont get too carried away when you come back to earth youll discover that the bit of sperrgebiet youre standing on is very expensive it could cost you a thousanddollar fine or a year in jail she remained tense and uptight my names jutta walsh i was born thirtyone years ago today in a boat which rescued the liners passengers here at the bridge of magpies no one ever found out who the rescuer was because he disappeared next day my mother died that liners a part of me nothings going to stop me going aboard het that includes you my names santa clausalias struan weddell im headman of that island over there its christmas day today the touch of colour that came into her cheeks wasnt from windburn my sarcasm however didnt break down her defiant attitude she regarded me in silence with coal hostility i know how you got here kaptein denny i went on theres no debate about this territory its sperrgebiet and on the sperrgebiet youre guilty until you can prove yourself innocent what im trying to say is that i dont have to listen to your reasons in order to clobber you being here is enough in itself but i realize showbiz is a hen of a razzmatazz and youve got to have local colour to pay off the sound effects on your tape are goodvery good listen to me clearly i tell you i way born here the city of baroda was carrying women and children to the cape my mother was pregnant babies are born that way the shock of the uboat attack brought on labour i was a month premature congratulations on your script that sort of soap opera should be a wow over the air but here youve no audience to cry over it even the birds have gone youll have to get out she remained strained and intent youve got it all wrong believe mewhat you overheard on the tape happened in real life a long time back what you call sound effects are actual battle noises radioed from inside a uboat which was in action and fighting for its life those menall of themdied later and im uboat admiral donitz in person you stupid thickheaded dot she blazed youre plain bloodyminded and stubborn cops usually are youre a cop sort of blinded by your job im new now get your things together and march back to my boat ill see you aboard gaok first im going aboard that liner says who ive come a long way and ive waited a long time im going aboard the hell you are she tried to push past but i grabbed her the force of her rush took us among her books and maps i knocked over the compass and trod on a chart the damnyou expression went from her eyes in a split second just as sperrgebiet fog changes the colour of the light in its place was genuine appeal and a touch of des peration that wasnt playacting i knew then that id misjudged her i found myself believing her story please she burst cut pleasethose are priceless she didnt put her hands above her head to signal surrender but the way she picked up one of the books and held it out to me said the same thing it was titled nuremberg trials vol xiii there were a couple of other similar ones she also handed me a paper with neat handwritten columns of figures dates and names it was headed uboats which operated in south african waters there was another uboat types class tonnage speed armament rangeand a sheaf of other papers including photocopies and officiallooking letters the map id trodden on turned out to be a naval chart of the possession channel annotated in german we became intensely conscious of one another your work yes the illusion of war you could call it that its more than that though its more than that i made a sweeping gesture which took in the collection and tape recorder in old cathedrals people listen to tape explaining the architecture and art theyre looking atbut i wouldnt have thought the sperrgebiet qualified for the same treatment she stayed silent for a few moments maybe i thought she was weighing my remark as a good letout however i discounted my suspicions about that the moment she replied her voice was warm and revealed how grateful she was id accepted her story as carat i hadnt thought of it in those terms but mines the same sort of ideaif you put the site of a naval battle in place of a cathedral the lecture was going fineuntil you showed upi wasamtrying to head you away from trouble thanks there wasnt anyone around i thought id get away with it you have what do you mean if i accompany you its okay this shorelines part of my pad possessions my ship im a sort of retread captain lets go and look at the wreck together i cant begin to thank you call me struan thatll be thanks enough struan is this a pilgrimage or a picnic jutta something of both i guess she didnt go into that nor did she explain further her sightandsound setup when we collected the documents and books and put heavy stones on top of them to keep them from blowing while we were away at the wreck they made a formidable and interesting pile of documentation youve done a lot of homework jutta yes it took years again no more she smiled though and i was pleased to see the pinched look go from her face i left the explanations for later we traversed the dome of rock which comprises doodenstadt winding and backtracking through the streets to get to our objective the strange geological formation projected into the sea on one hand and into the desert on the other at shoeleather distance the lost city impressed me still less we couldnt board the liner from the landward side you could have driven a train through the torpedo holes in her it was a miracle shed stayed afloat long enough to be beached alsoit must have been a spring tide that put her high up where she was we stood and looked at her rusty plating juttas interest took the chill off the sense of static disaster which the years hadnt softened she said unexpectedly sorry i was like that back there struan forget it were here now its just that it meant means so much i was on the point of asking for the explanation which i felt was becoming overdue but i decided to play it gently for the moment you a historian jutta sort of she didnt seem inclined to elaborate it was faith not fact which had made me trust her in the first place but patience isnt one of my strong suits she intrigued me i said the south african sun didnt give you that complexion she flushed which made it better still no london i flew here only a couple of days ago thats a very long way to come for a view of a rotting old hulk especially one thats out of bounds i told you you could almost call it my cradle a small reason for a big journey maybe dont come the cop again struan youre nicer without lets try the other side of the wreck we caught the force of the wind there because the hulk had acted as a windbreak before now the spray came in jets when the breakers burst against the rocks i found the wrecks air of desolation total and depressing the weather side was red with rust crabs scuffled up and down the rotting plates and there was a population of tidethings a mans height up from the keel some smashed remains of lifeboats hung from perished falls jut means davit in danish jutta youre ajl sea maybe too much so struan i waited for the followup to this cryptic remark but it didnt come instead she occupied herself with studying the ships side trying to find a way in finally we located one and slipped and scrambled up on to the deck it was a grim spectacle looters and strippers had picked the place clean green slime clung to a lot of the metal tweendecks and the stairways were dangerous what are you searching for junta my mothers cabin number i dont know the most i could discover was that it was among the single accommodation on the starboard side single hows that she wasnt married i see you dont but youre too polite to pry it was wartime wartime her voice took on an edge if you only knew how that fogs everything i that simple question you asked about her cabinyou cant begin to guess the involvements it took to get the simple answer jutta what do you hope to find in your mothers cabin she sidestepped my question instead she said heres a passageway it might lead to the cabins it did but it was wet and halfdark the liner had taken the torpedoes on her port side and probably all the passengers on the opposite side where we now were had got away safely if theyd left anything behind in their flight the looters had taken it every cabin was a bare steel shell coffin seemed a better description i sniffed seals whew we explored until it was impossible to go farther because the tweendecks had collapsed jutta was very withdrawn when we found nothing we retraced our steps to the bridge it had shared the fate of the cabins all the instruments even the wheel were missing we had a wonderful view of the bridge of magpies which seemed close enough to reach out and touch the pillars on which the twin legs of the arch rested were striated by the weatherlike the engine of a giant motorcycle at its highest point the structure narrowed to a mere couple of feet thick which gave the whole thing an airy lightness we shared the scene and the silence it was companionable and felt good maybe what we were sharing was something more indefinable more basic why magpies i asked not a clue the name bad the american codebreakers stumped too please teacher we laughed at and with one another do i sound as bad as that professor its all back there amongst my things everything about us mission mission you heard the tape it wasnt an operational cruise there was enough shooting nevertheless it wasnt the first buzz of it emerged when pearl harbour intercepted a japanese fleet message to uboat headquarters those codebreaker boys were hot stuff real superstars at their job but the name bridge of magpies had them beat as a result the signal got shelved it should have been passed on to the british because these waters were in the royal navys sphere of operations but it never was whats at the back of all this sleuthing of yoursjutta you could almost hear the barrier clang down between us i wasnt so far along with her as id imagined she said shortly to do withmy mother whom you never knew thats a load of filial piety jutta please dont needle me struan youve been very sweet and considerate bringing me here dont spoil it now would it spoil it to tell you ive suddenly thought of something about my mother its what you want isnt it yes no her eyesseagreen as deep water had been on my face but now she looked away tell me the moments gone anyway i put my hand on her shoulder irrelevantly i thought gigi must just be about opening the jetty bar now that careless bit of breast that ajways showed i wondered what juttas breasts were like there was almost no shape to her because of the suede jacket breekboutthats my man fridaytold me yesterday that theres an old graveyard back of the beach in the sandhills maybe your mothers buried there her reaction wasnt what id expected she certainly wasnt suffering from an overdose of motherfixation she put her hand on mine and said coolly matteroffactly lets go and look we left the wreck collected her paraphernalia and hiked away into the windcarved sandhills which followed the coasts indentation like a halfcupped hand farther inland was a plain with shifting smaller sandhills and beyond them showed the dark line of a range of frettedrocky outcrops we made brand new footsteps in the windscoured surface the dusty smell of the desert was still damped by a sprinkling of dew the sun shone but the wind was cold we stopped for a breather her gear was more cumbersome than heavy what was the sound of guns mentioned on the tape jutta i was watching her closely waiting for the shutdown in her eyes that had followed my earlier questioning and had made them seem to be looking at me from another place but it didnt happen this time i dont know what youre talking about nor did she but she was fascinated by what i had to tell her about convoy wv bx and why gousblom had broken away from it into the channel i left the cinc out of it of course when id finished she said speculatively seems im not the only one whos done homework youre pretty well informed for a headman it was possessions main event for a century the story gets passed on from mouth to mouth i wonder i kept wondering tooabout her i decided to risk my sixtyfour dollar question id like to go over all this material of yours about possession her eyes disappeared into another timetrack its copyright mine does that mean no i said its mine lets get on i snapped the anger lay between us and soured the rest of the hike her brushoff burned me up because now i reckoned shed turned on the charm to get her way with me about the wreck and play me for a sucker i swore to myself that once wed seen over the graveyard id have an ironclad reason out of her for being on the sperrgebiet or else we negotiated the corner of the last dune blocking off the graveyard i was in the lead i caught sight of a cluster of mounds and some derelict crosses also spotted something else i pulled jutta back into the angle of the dune then unslung my binoculars and brought the graves into sharp definition a man was kneeling at one of them his hands busy in the sand was your mothers name joyce i whispered she nodded then kaptein denny is either robbing her grave or caching something in it is that it the cross is pretty crudelooks like a piece of wreckage i read joyce walsh come back you little idiot shed jumped up and sprinted towards the kneeling figure i snicked back the rifle bolt made sure it was loadedand ran after her because of the wind kaptein denny didnt hear her coming until she was very close when he did he threw us a startled glance leapt up and scuffed the mound with his foot so that a scatter of thingssome of them bright seashellswent flying i was up to him in a moment i slipped the rifles safety catch he had a knife in one hand and in the other some rings and jewelleryand what appeared to be a rather timeworn passport jutta was confronting him as if she couldnt believe her eyes you bastard i exclaimed fishing balls you bloody graverobbing bastard his face was a mask he didnt retaliate just came towards me holding out the battered passport i wasnt dumb enough to fall for that one i kept the gun steady on him the knifedrop it at my feet he hesitatedunflappable and therefore dangerous but he saw id blast him if he tried any tricks he gave a slight shrug and threw it open now the passport it joined the knife hold out your hand there were a couple of rings and some trinkets in his palm i risked a glance at the things hed kicked away a tiny coloured porcelain figurine and some smashed painted shells which had been stuck together to imitate flowers now get off that grave i ordered youre under arrest whered you get that loot from he indicated the mount the wind had long ago blown the shabby cross askewby contrast most of the other graves were unmarkedand the sand had filed away the lettering which appeared to have been burned in with a hot iron it read joyce walsh died in childbirth july rip juttas thoughts were a millisecond ahead of mine she snatched up the passport flicked it open paged through it rapidly concentrating on the wording and frankingstamps before shed reached the last page her eagerness seemed to have evaporated her voice was dry and level as if shed experienced some big letdown my mothers yes said kaptein denny the ringsi took them from her fingers myself christ youre a cool one i exploded jutta said in the same levelunemotional voice if thats true you didnt do it just now that graves not been disturbed she was right it certainly hadnt been dug up and unless the body lay six inches deep he couldnt have got at it kaptein denny left me out of what he had to say next i made that cross the liner captain gave me your mothers passport so id get the name right i took the jewellery ive kept them all its a long time now you were there i was there these things belong to you now miss jutta jutta i echoed youre mighty quick off the mark for a charter skipper ive known miss jutta a long time from the moment of birth in fact rescuer jutta exclaimed it was you kaptein denny he remained unruffled i rescued a lot of people that night your mother among them you were born in my boat dont play the fool with me i snapped at him i put up the gun but kept my foot on the knife lets have your story straightand quick i was in the possession channel that night u sank the city of baroda doing what fishing it was too pat fishing nets a multitude of sins in wartime with enemy subs around i was fishing i let it go i saw the liner beached it was a wild stormy night the passengers wouldnt have stood a chance in the seas that were breaking over the rocks i took off a lot of them including miss juttas mother as i said jutta fiddled with the rings she was clearly lining up on his side maybe shed never left it maybe thats why both of them were ashore the same day you must have known all along who i was when i came to you in luderitz for a boatwhy didnt you say the time wasnt then you vanished before the survivors from the city of baroda could even say thank you no one was ever able to identify their rescuer its the way im made i said it takes a power of modesty to dodge a couple of warships out hunting a uboat yet you succeeded they concentrated on the mouth of the channel near the kreuz shoals where the oil slick was i took my boat round the other way okay i said you were supermodest its all in the past and it doesnt matter a damn to me whether you wanted modesty or a medal what concerns me is the present its miss juttas birthday he interrupted its also a deathday im a malay that was a rite for her mothers spirit you interrupted jutta gathered up the figurine and the broken seashells fine i said to denny youve done your stuff both temporally and spiritually i couldnt care less what i care about is that both of you are defying the law this is sperr gebiet get going i you cant not now jutta was incredulous nows just the time not when everythings going my way what way is that she didnt answer what had been brewing inside me ever since our breatherstop lashed back at me i went on you had a lot of showme wishes i obliged the partys over struan i there was more than disappointment and anger in that one wordit could have been hurt i bulldozed it aside this shore isnt a freeforall you both seem to have forgotten that now lets get moving to the boat and then all feeling had left her voice luderitz kaptein denny will take you back that will sounds exactly like a retread captains order retread or not its an order im also confiscating all this stuff until i can go through it im staying thats flat what have you got to saykaptein denny i agree to return to gaok theres no law against a man sitting in his boat in the channel merely sitting he was right of course essentially he was saying the same thing as jutta but more cleverly i was saved by the bell from further argument i heard kochs landrover before they did because i was expecting him it was grinding through an outcrop barrier behind the sandhills and trailing a long plume of dust i pointed it out to them and tried bluffing because i didnt want koch to come and find me unable to shift a girl and a fisherman from the beach thats probably a diamond patrol youre in a hot seat you can save yourselves trouble by coming to the boat right away ill give you my word not to come ashore said kaptein denny and you jutta no there was a tight silence then she exclaimed you dont cant understand it would take hours to explain you ve been wonderfuland beastlytoday the boat oh damn and blast you kaptein denny said thats not a police patrol their vehicles are painted bright orange so they can be spotted from their air if theyre in trouble koch broke it up by coming round the sandhills in a tearaway slide hed clearly sighted our group there wasnt much of his austrian charisma in evidence when he finally pulled up hard and covered us in dust what the devil goes on herestruan showing tourists around keep your cool we were just sorting things out a woman tool hed had a rough ride over the desert judging from his red hollow eyes and dustcovered face his cheeks were stubbleshadowed and dust made a tracery in the lines about his nose making him look angry and older a roof tar paulin covering his gear and extra jerricans of petrol had blown loose and flapped in the wind drawing attention to the load koch saw that kaptein denny was eyeing it and snapped get in i want a word with you to the boat i ordered the other two but they just went on standing there koch slammed in the gears and we drove up a duneout of earshot i got in first now i gave him a quick rundown of the situation and why jutta was there be your age man he retorted women in these days dont dare deserts simply in order to brood over sites of minor naval actions and placate ancestral spirits lady hester stanhopes dead maybe shes different they all areto start with to the birds today the male is simply a gun loaded with chauvinism and sperm get that straight and youll be a happy man her story sounded okayat least part of it wive la difference nor did i like the look of that bugger with her maybe hes at the bottom of it all i dont know yet letting her down lightly again struan you were given a job to do hereremember the sperrgebiet isnt santorinall lesbians and loveins i like your language when youre drunk its even better when youre mad what do you want me to do arrest them both throw them out kaptein dennys given his parole well sort of isnt interested in coming ashore this once was an exception and she refuses to budge youve got a lockup on possession you cant throw a woman into a place like that i can you will lets see if we cant talk some sense into her but we couldnt and she even held out her wrists and mocked me to clap handcuffs on her without a boat possession is as good as a prison anyway those two or three miles of whitecapped channel water between the island and the mainland would if a man were stuck there lengthen to two thousand the island looked like a nicked knife blade lying in the sea one of those curved things that have a thick back the craggy bits where the zombies hadnt managed to clear the guano were still white and the rest was grey where they had parts of the island were so low against the water that they looked like three or four islets loosely linked together finally under pressure and protest jutta agreed to accom pany us she remained adamant in her refusal to return to luderitz the four of us plus breekbout piled into the two boats and we crossed to the island c h a p t e r s i x welcome to the commune jutta eyed the guanosplashed prefabs and didnt answer for a moment the pissy wind came cascading over the rocks and bits of feathers and nests made unerringly for ones eyes and nostrils it was about midafternoon in an hour or two the fog would start coming in when it did the wind would fall the huts were sited under the lee of the islands northernmost high point whichinstead of giving shelter acted acted more as a booster to jack up the force of the wind breaking it up into eddies which searched out every nook and cranny and brought a continual avalanche of debris you couldnt escapewhichever way you faced we were all standing on the concrete apron near the jetty which is the jail jutta demanded the whole place is a jail koch retorted youve got an exercise yard over two miles long and half a mile broad but dont get ideas the most level bit is what youre standing mi i added careful over the rocks they get very slippery because of the guano and the fog theyre like ice every morning every morning youve only been here breekbout muttered something and he and kaptein denny grinned i translated the patois as it was obvious the crack was directed at her he says please stay the winter and youll grow webs on your feet like the birdsfrom climbing the rocks hes never seen a woman with webbed feet save it it made her angrier koch toowas becoming more irritated he pulled me away from the others to the headmans cottage where they couldnt overhear us what sort of whiteshoe captain are you he demanded dont blow your bilges what the hell do you expect me to do with her spell it out spell it out to both of them that they arent staying throw em out theyve heard that already she wont budge i cant stop kaptein denny anchoring his boat and just sitting that bastard has a racket i dont buy that yarn of his he isnt at doodenstadt for a full frontal view of the scendont get your knickers in a twist i cant touch him not legally anyway find a reason invent one if you must if he gets back to luderitz hell spread the rumour welt do something for crying in a bucket im not going to start operations with kaptein denny watching every move i make get rid of him i believe the girls story the the part of it she told me she wasnt acting for my benefit but it wasnt the whole story i m certain whatever kaptein dennys racket is hes using her as a front for it your concern for her is so touching you make me want to cry listen man theres a lost city under these rocks treasure probably if denny gets back to luderitz the whole security screen is blown skyhigh hell manufacture just the situation the cinc is trying to avoid well have a queue of bums nogoods wide boystheyll be here like flies trump up a reason to hold him for how long months get on the blower to the cinc if you feel you cant cope first day in command and i cant solve my own problems without running to the boss never heres a waystruan take the girl to luderitz in your official boat you can make it in less than a day dump her make a few discreet inquiries try to get some dirt on denny it can be done the top brass there has been ordered to featherbed you shell kick up hellish rough the scratching and kicking wont last more than a day then you can push the cat over the side and have done with it and leave kaptein denny to go scotfree while im away no ill stay right here on possession ill answer for him until you get back breekbout can stand turns on guard with i suppose its okay however he did promise he wouldnt go ashore not while we watch he wont but half the bloody day and all the night theres fog you wont ever know where he is theres a lot of craftiness there boy make no mistake kaptein denny you always give him his title i notice theres something about him something out of the ordinary dont ask me what all i know its there that makes him dangerous weve got to break up this lost city party of theirs struan youre sending flowers before the funerals maybe i like flowers better than funerals funerals i told him about the graveyard ive never known malays use sea shell ornaments before its just one more sound reason why we should lock him up it could have something to do with his racket what do you think that is hellmut my guess is that hes got a lead on the lost city and is playing the ziplip with his dumb fisherman act brace yourself lets go and tell em our verdict jutta kaptein denny and breekbout were hunkered down drinking coffee in the cheerless bunkroom in front of a small castiron stove there wasnt any proper furniture a few boxes and packing cases served as chairs and tables there was a big stove in the galley to meet the needs of scores of guano workers but it was too much trouble for breekbout i helped myself to a pintsized chipped mug and a biscuit wed missed our lunch ashore i moistened my throat with a couple of sips and told them what i intended i didnt beat about the bush jutta took it quietly eyeing me as she remained squatting cup in hand but i saw the tension in her eyes i wondered how much pressure she would stand kaptein denny remarked in a neutral kind of way gave you my parole i wouldnt go ashore bull koch laughed derisively before i cut him short will your boat be safe where she lies i wont be away more than a couple of days he shot me a glance of appreciation the holding ground is good where she is mud and shell in five fathoms just outside the line of the main channel theres a rock which i use as a sort of ansteuringstonne he used the word quite naturally but it brought me a fresh rush of suspicion regarding the seamyfaced skipper ansteuringstonne means an approach buoy but its uboat jargon jima said id like to collect my things from kaptein dennys boat i was relieved to be able to break up the tight group is there anything you want kaptein denny not immediately jutta and i used the whaleboat to cross to the cutter i was equally relieved to exchange the ammoniacal stink of posses sion for the varnished smell of gaoks mahogany cabin jutta spoke only once on the trip across shed been viewing the old liner and the shoreline as though to photograph them in her memory will i see this tomorrow before we leave maybe depends on the fog she bit her lips i had the impression id pumped the tension a littje nearer explodingpoint while she collected her things from the inner cabin i made a quick check of the anchor cables and then the bridge gaok was a honey and id have loved to have owned her i finally went below into the main cabin and opened the mahogany bar jutta came into the doorway what are you doing brandy i said the possession party may need a bit of livening up this evening do you always help yourself to whatever you want aboard somebody elses ship always its in the blood i come from a long line of wreckers she opened her mouth then bit back whatever shed meant to say i added i ajso intend to make a thorough search youve no right she flared youre abusing your position me first then himi mean his ship when he isnt here to defend himself i put down my drink and faced her both of us strained and hostile youve taken a hit over this thing jutta i tried to make it easy for you there on shore i showed you what you asked to see i believedbelieveyour story as much as you told me thousands wouldnt ive got a job to do dont get in the way she was distant and ungiving you showed me round the benevolent grandstanding gesture at the point of a rifle watching every move you didnt come clean with me so you got hurt hurt i could howl she stood for a long moment getting her face under control then came up to me at the bar i want to stay get that clear more than anything else i want to stay but im not going to throw you a load of fourletter bitchery to try and get my way i could also try a spot of instant sex it would be easy now were alone the situations tailormade suppose i took off my clothes i saw now that she was so nearthat the little spot in the corner of her eye which i thought was sand wasnt sand at all but a swollen tearduct if you tajk about it it isnt instant theres a saying that nice girls always finish last i wouldnt know in the sperrgebiet stakes youre at the short end of things because whatever youre after is too wayout likewise kaptein denny is after somethingto though i dont know what it isnot yet so youre planning a sneak search of his ship not any more ive changed my mind dont lets elbow one another aside in the rush for the boat then i poured myself another slug and ajlowed it to coast over my tongue join me no im a good listener pull out the bung get it off your chest fourletter words if it helps theres nothing more except except she picked up the cheap case containing her things youre going to dump me on the quayside at luderitz and say the hell with you jutta the quay yes the rest wasnt in my mind ive got a oneway air ticket from london theres nothing left to pay for the return get a refund from kaptein denny itll help she looked away and i knew that he hadnt charged her for the charter of his boat my suspicion that they might be working in tandem blew up afresh too bad if he wont you can always run home to daddy if id slapped her face the reaction couldnt have been greater you bastard you unspeakable bastard for saying that thats as good an exit line as any lets go if she could have moved any farther away from me in the boat she would have but we were obliged to face one another i rowing and she sitting in the stem the sunset was a napalm bunt on the clouds out to sea its flares caught juttas hair and made it more incandescent than gold shed got rid of the beret and the wind blew her long hair this way and that changing the lights in it as it blew it gave her something to do to fuss with it rather than endure the tight silence i for my part was grateful for being occupied rowing it took a long time to reach the island because the run of the sea was against us and i hadnt breekbouts skill with the heavy craft by the time we arrived at the jetty the sunset was gone and the sea was bleak and cold the fog bank loomed close which made for a shutoff feeling as if possession and the twostack wreck were the only things left in the world koch and i hosted a dismal dinner we tried to make a party of it by selecting tinned specialities from the abundant store room and he dressed them up skilfully over the stove howeverour attempt at a semifestive air helped by a couple of brandies from gaoks bottle exploded when i pitched into jutta as soon as she appeared shed changed into tawnycoloured pants and a green sweater which offset her hair and made it look lovely in the dicky light it was her first words which blew the powderkeg it was a wonderful bath even if it was cold youhada bath the term was unknown to breekbout the others gaped whats wrong with that dont you realize that every drop of water on this island is for drinking and drinking alone that it all comes by ship from cape town or from the sun condensers on the roof pulling rank again she blazed back for every petty thing you have a do this do that my dear girl im not your bloody dear girl nobody said anything about not bathing its a good thing im leaving i couldnt stomach much morel i thought of the next days journey a small boat isnt the place for two people to be at one anothers throats i smothered my retort koch also tried to be placatory during the meal which was probably the most sumptuous possession had ever seen but it didnt come off for most of the time she was irritable and silent it was kaptein denny who put the party into neutral gear whats your route to luderitz captain weddell he asked a broad sweep out to sea to the northwest first then i head back to the land and make port keep away from the deep sea use the inshore route his opinion was worth respecting after all hed used sperrgebiet waters all his life inshore never heard of it between the reefs and the shore it sounds crazy maybe but its july and the signs are there the fogs thicker the seas sulky theres heavy weather coining a big blow it flashed through my mind that a soft sell about the weather could be an easy way to liquidate me lost at sea no trace no comeback it isnt what the radio weather forecast says he pulled something from his pocket and handed it to me it was like a square bit of chamois leather it had claws dried albatross foot feel it when its soft like now it means something special is blowing up nominally its hard i showed it to koch he bypassed jutta who sat silent kaptein denny went on speaking with authority youll be caught for sure youre using a boat you dont know i dont expect van rensburg kept her up to scratch i began to believe him jutta interjected it wont help either of us if were drowned go my way and you wont be he smiled and i found myself warming to him hed been the skipper captain murray said hed like around if his ship was in trouble make a good offing to the northwest once you get clear of possession he went on its going to be squally from the northwest and west to start with you dont want to be close to the land then later head back shorewards and keep inside the shoal plateau all the way up the coast you talk as if i meant to sail ill use the engine of course in your place id sail after the squalls youll find the wind will hang in the west and then back strongly to the southwest if you stick inshore youll make most of the passage with a free wind but if it gets too badand i think it will you you can hole up in alabama cove perfect shelter but you wont make the cove if you head out to sea maybe the brandy had stoked koch up more than he showed because at the mention of the name alabama he suddenly burst into the song which is as traditional to south africans as waltzing matilda is to australians here comes the alabama the alabama comes oer the sea here comes the alabama the alabama comes oer the sea breekbout grabbed a tin dish and started to thump out the catchy rythmical beat all of us except jutta joined in the rest of the song girl girl the reedbed girlthe reedbed is made up for me on which i can sleep girl girl the reedbed girl the reedbed is made up for me on which i can sleep the alabama was a famous confederate raider which harassed yankee shipping off the cape during the american civil war she was joined by a consort the tuscaloosa the alabamas exploits won the hearts of south africans and were commemorated by the strolling malay singers for whom cape town is famous our nonsense seemed to snap jutta out of her fit of the bluesespecially when the four of us stomped out a kind of war dance perhaps that is how the ditty was born in the first place i said to kaptein denny when id sat down and got my breath backi knew the alabama had a base somewhere on the sperrgebiet but i didnt know where youll see alabama cove and tuscaloosa rock for yourselves if it turns out to be the breed of buster i thinks coming he replied youll bless them before youre through too when do you leave tomorrow as soon as the fog starts to lift itll be a hairy trip very hairy wheres this cove place about halfway to luderitz breekbout broke in unexpectedly on our conversation give me another shot of brandy skipperthe ghosts are coming in with the fog tonight kaptein denny added shes coming i explained to jutta possessions favourite apparition a lady without legs a couple of dogs too beside which the hounds of the baskervilles looks like a pup tried to keep it light but she shivered and shed the cheerfulness shed had during the song i tried to jolly her further you have the distinction of being the most tangible female ever to have set foot on possession but she didnt respond breekbout threw back his brandy at a gulp sy stinger soon pisspikkewyn she staggers like a sozzled penguin i translated for her benefit but even breekbouts unique gift of articulate speech failed to cheer her perhaps it was untranslatable anyhow i tried to shut him up but he went on with a kind of lugu brious seriocomic deadpan humour im now going to put another light in the window so that the ghost can see her way properly he talks of her as if she were real exclaimed jutta kaptein denny said on possession ghosts are as beal as i dont know what made me say it or why i didnt intend to kill the party stone dead but i did there was too much going on below the surfaceand the lost city was just below the surface as swakop or the city of baroda or u who did you say the legless ghost might have confronted kaptein denny the way he looked swakop he appeared to need both the ghost lights and the brandy i intended to string him along because of my suspicions but jutta spilt it about the tape recording before i could stop her the fact that he didnt know about it was a point in her favour the tape wasnt the sort of thing partners would have kept from one another her explanation gave him time to hang on to the ropes and get his breath back i watched him all the way so did koch is that all he asked isnt it enough i countered nothing about he let the question hang juttas voice was stony with resentment id gladly play it over to you but the strong arm of the law has taken it away from me id locked away her taperecorder and documents in a steel cupboard this was in the headmans cottage which i d allocated to her while the men shared the bunkhouse id begun to feel better disposed towards her after finding out that kaptein denny didnt know about the tape moreover yd been so struck by the evidence of the feeling which julias mention of it had aroused in him that i reckoned a full playback might bring out other interesting things as well why not i asked and jutta looted surprised were becoming involved with one bit of possessions spooky past so why not some of it that for real that tapes history wired for sound ill go and get it outside the fog was so thick it was like custard and my torch didnt penetrate just threw back a yellow blob of light if it hadnt been for the concrete path i would have strayed the smell of the sea was everywhere it was quite still and i had my doubts about kaptein dennys gale forecast i collected the tape from the grim cold cottage and returned thankfully to the bunkhouse fire but my moment had passed as far as kaptein denny was concerned he sat pokerfaced and listened with an impenetrable impassive air while jutta reran the recording even the final drama failed to send him although it had koch chainsmoking and made me forget to ask him whether the uboats two torpedoes which missed the liner had exploded against possessions cliffs even breekboutwho didnt understand most of it was infected to the extent of helping himself unasked to a few more drinks when it ended we waited for kaptein dennys reaction he said in a strained tired voice that was like a conversation with a voice from the grave i said you must have seen what happened to ui you were there my activities really began in a big way where it leaves off the liner ran ashore i went to help as you know you and the uboat must have passed smack next to each other on opposite courses in the channel maybe surely you spotted her it was foggy very thick a wild night the liner was my only concern the explosion of gousbloms magazine must have lit up the whole channel it didfor a moment yet you never spotted ui no i sighted a lot of oil later the oil was in the north you took the southern exit you said so yourself i went backward and forward all night to the city o baroda the sea was breaking right across her the passengers jumped form the stern to reach my boat she was still among the breakers and not far up on the rocks like now when i left next day i could see the oiland the warships waiting i couldnt fault him and he wouldnt be drawn so dropped questioning him further but his attitude served only to keep the finger on him as far as koch and i were concerned jutta didnt mention what id told her about the underlying reason for gousbloms sortie into the channel nor did i at least not until the early hours of them following morning shed stayed by the fire for a long time and i had finally seen her back to the cheerless cottage i didnt blame her for not wanting to be there especially alone the fog was thicker than ever i slept fitfully and so much on a hairtrigger that i was already awake at some other noise before a violent knocking at the bunkhouse door had me on my feet and racing for it kaptein denny leapt up at the same instant it was jutta she was shoeless and had been sleeping in her old shore clothes i didnt have to ask what it was when i wrenched open the door i felt the sound in my belly it wasnt the sharp retching crack of smallarms but a flight of deep decibels through the darkness which socked one below the diaphragm she might have been possessions lady ghost herself she was so white the sound of guns she whispered c h a p t e r s e v e n it wasntguns of course but what was it kaptein denny and i ran outside but jutta kept to the doorway denny stood listening and swinging his head about like a radar scanner the fog was warmer and clammier the past was unwinding and rewinding like juttas tape machine it underscored gousbloms act of blind courage i said in a murmur to jutta as if a human voice could possibly have erased the mysterious sound in the royal navy it is a captains prerogative to steer for the sound of guns nelson started it what what she began but koch yelled from his bunk struanwhat the hell gives i shut him up it was only nervesbecause you couldnt miss that deep horizonthudding sound again we waited we strained our ears it didnt come again then kaptein denny asked as softly as a hoarse whisper could be soft what did you say about guns i gave him a collapsed version of the convoy wv bx affair here i exclaimed why am i telling you this you were at possession that night if gousblom heard gunfire you must havetoo perhaps it was the distorting effect of the fog but there seemed to be a deadfish gleam in his eyes which i couldnt get past hed got control of his voice since his tensionshot whisper earlier it was dry and flat now i heard it go on man it was heavy gunfire somewhere south of the island the sound was carried on the wind it was very loudlouder than tonight and frightening did you see the gun flashes asked jutta no it was a dark stormy night i said it might have been guns in wartime but it couldnt be guns tonight it couldnt be guns tonight he echoed dont stand there repeating what i say i snapped it could have been some sidekick to the main eventthen what is it now i dont know youve been fishing here for thirty years and you dont know he remained silent under my stare breekbout and koch joined us breekbout saidits that ghost leaping up out of hell it happens when she comes bly stil pipe down ordered koch what are you talking about guns for all thats overyears ago i went closer to kaptein denny as if that way i might get at what he knew if he knew there were new dark stains under his eyes which were as unreadable as fogclouded lenses lets have it ive heard it now and i heard it then i dont know what it is any more than you do it was impossible to get anything more out of him i didnt believe him the mans duplicity underlined my belief that the decision to break up the juttadenny party the next day was a right one we all stood around near the door in uncomfortable silenceuntil it became too cold there was no repetition of the sound i told myself there must be some explanation for itbut what sonic boom not in the prejet era of thunder it never rains on the sperrgebiet manmade if so how after all you dont mock up a inch broadside on an uninhabited coast just in order to entertain the birds and seals theyd never heard of nelson finally we all went inside and had coffee at am the human brain is supposed to be at its lowest ebb and i couldnt get anything out of mine to make sense out of my suspicions about kaptein denny though i was broad awake and on edge we all were jutta decided to come to the bunkhouse for what remained of the night and i fetched her blankets and shoes from the cottage we kept a light going even indoors the condensation dripped from the lampglass and made a minisound which jarred in the silence none of us slept much it wasnt much of a way to start our passage to luderitz next day kaptein denny remained uncommunicative and dampened any breakfast sparkle koch or breekbout might have been capable of jutta and i said perfunctory goodbyes to the others breekbout ferried us out to my official boat the cutter ichabo the anchorage was blotted with fog and layers of cloud lay low down on the southwestern horizon a slight northerly breeze rippled the channel the ichabo was a sharp contrast to kaptein dennys boat she was spartan neglected and dirty the diesel hadnt been cared for and it sounded pretty rough after id battled to start it i headed for the gap between the kreuz shoals and possessions northern tip gousbloms short cut to get at u making it dangerous was broke rock an evil fang which stuck like a bone in the throat of the passage jutta was distant and uncooperative she stood on deck all the time i was busy with the preliminaries of getting under way staring at what she could make out of the liner wreck and shore with the intentness of a lovesick teenager i was working my way past the reefs before standing off the coast to avoid squalls as kaptein denny had advised when the engine died jutta my temper was shot to hellby the danger combined with her attitude forget that view lend a hand here with the wheel while j fix the engine i dont know the first thing about steering you dont have to hold it steady thats all and keep your eyes skinned straight in front of you she did as i said reluctantly i went below i tinkered with this and tinkered with that but the diesel wouldnt fire after a while i put my head out of the box which was the engine room and took a look at the sea ichabo was being carried towards broke rock by the seaward set of a fairly strong current that was pushing northwards up the channel at a couple of knots the bloody thing wont start i told jutta ira in a shocking state that means well have to go back the relief in her voice needled me j wasnt going to have my plans wrecked at the outset my irritation laid my decision slap on the line no we sail you never give up do you id begun to sound a bit tougheven to myself i softened the comeback no jutta especially not when ive got a thing like that i gestured at the brokewhich was now not more than a couple of cables lengths away to starboard almost under my keel the northerly wind was backing and becoming flukier id have to make a couple of sharp tacks to get clear the sea was changing losing its green and becoming greyer i didnt like the look of that cloudbank either but there was no turning back now i was committed steer i gave her some elementary helm orders while i made sail the big high boomthe height of a man by the mast gooseneckwas designed to swing clear of the wheelhouse roof so that the helmsman could have an unobstructed view i wanted the cutter on the port tack the wind was freshening all the time and backing northwest i was afraid that the boat would be caught in irons with someone inexperienced like jutta at the wheel but the sail took all my attention eventuallyhowever ichabo came round slowly and clawed her away past the broke and we moved out to sea by way of the narrow passage i took the wheel after that and we stood off the coast with the wind freshening still further and the squalls churning up the water in the rebound from the land as kaptein denny said they would behind elizabeth pointthe old ghost town sitethe land was a dreary waste ichabo handled well she came from the same yard as gaok and probably had much the same underwater lines but with that ugly menace of the storm on the southern horizon i could have wished for someone better than a girl for my crew still i had gone into it with my eyes open and by resorting to sail had made my commitment complete to the inshore route yet looking at the grim deadly shore and the growing line of white breakers i wondered with some trepidation what the next twentyfour hours would hold by afternoon it was blowing a fresh gale and the wind was steady in the southsouthwest kaptein dennys forecast might have been computerized for accuracy ichabo had begun to run towards the coast in the final leg of a somewhat sshaped course to pick up the entrance to the inshore route which lay well to the north of elizabeth point the scud and overcast were down to mastheight ichabo was riding well waves would come up astern and her bow would dip on the summit as if she were crouching for some stupendous leap then she would careen into the trough bucking and shredding the seas it was an exhilarating and frightening motion all at once to be caught in the gigantic crossfiow of energy between wind and sea it was an uncomplicated challenge of survival it clarified my senses and i didnt feel tired any longer alabama cove was opce the famous confederate raiders funkhole it is roughly a funnelshaped affair with the broad end of the funnel in the north and the narrow end in the south the coast forms one side of it and a discontinuous line of reefs and sandbars the other there are gaps of deep water between these hazards from end to end the place measures three or four miles there is a safe channel up the middle this can only be entered via the narrow section in the south at the other extreme is tuscaloosa islet a lowlying group of rocks which offers a safe anchorage in almost any weather the islet is named after the alabamas auxiliary and onetime prize the tuscaloosa if you could put a trapdoor across the entrancenothing could winkle out a ship inside that halfmilewide gap is a deathtrap you have to negotiate itkaptein denny had briefed me in detailby steering for a strange beacon made out of whale skeletons set up at the foot of a solitary sandhill its called new bedford point the bones were put there by american whalers that frequented the sperrgebiet before the declaration of independence the dry saltimpregnated air has preserved the bones ever since j checked the briefing in my mind as i headed for the point the suspicion also arose when i saw the holocaust ahead that it might be a death ride kaptein denny had organized to take care of me but the time for choice was almost past astern loomed a wild bleak and rainscourged sea chunks of it kept slapping in our faces like wet clothes there was a continual lash and splutter of spray past the wheelhouse and ichabo writhed and twisted in the mounting seas the sky was a solid wall of cloud there i pointed to show jutta the landmark i was homing in ona fanshaped patch of white among some curious black hummocks behind the whale bonescame into sight i felt easier they were spot on where kaptein denny said they would be once again jutta didnt share my relief she hung on to the grabhandle in the wheelhouse her oilskins streaming i had the windows open because the wipers didnt work in there i had to admit to myself it didnt look too good to myself alone spray was exploding forty or fifty feet high on the outer chain of sandspits and reefs a clear line of white water demarcated it all the way down to that savage little blinder off the southernmost point a patch of breakerless water near it was the entranceway lchabo was like a wild animal being driven by beaters into the mouth of a boma thornbush trap violent gusts and squalls bouncing back from the land stirred up the channel like a gigantic swizzle stick kaptein denny said itd be okay i couldnt think of anything else to say well never make that tiny gap we will and we must tuscaloosa islet where we intended to anchor was low and close inshore and difficult to make out that didnt help juttas fears or mine first we had to reach the channel leading to it i spotted discoloured water right ahead of the bow that i meant twelve fathoms so kaptein denny had said every warning of his was at a premium now im going to mug her right down i had to shout for jutta to hear hang on to the wheel for a moment while i fix the sail just hold her steady i wont take a minute i was a fool of course to have entrusted the steering under such conditions to a novice but it seemed simple enough and i didnt intend to be long i felt the gale cool the sweat inside my oilskins when i got outside the wheelhouse that should have been a red light telling me how hard it had been to work the wheel but i went on to the sail at that moment ichabo must have hopscotched over a shallower bit of bottom from being merely stormtriggered rollers the sea became a batteringrain ichabo caught it on the port quarter she yawed wildly the boom thwacked me in the ribcage i felt as though id been kicked by a mule i was hurled off the wheelhouse roof on to the foredeck i caught a glimpse plunging past the windows of the wheel spinning out of control juttas hands were in the air sema phoring her helplessness where i finished up i was swamped and soused immediately by torrents of water the cutters head fell off she started to swing beamon to the seathe most dangerous position for a boat under such circumstances the peril made me try to rise but i fell back hejpless then jutta was there holding me to her another icesharp hissing deluge poured over the deck ichabo bucked like a demented rockinghorse get back get back to the wheel for chrissake leave me but she wouldnt and hugged me to her i fought her and i fought for breath struan struan i ichabo lay beamon to the swell i managed to get to my knees i longed to take advantage of the full count to recover my wind but the awful motion of the boat made me throw aside all thought of it get me up i get me on my feet to the wheel i hauled myself upright by throwing all my weight on to her shoulders and i went on doing so unmercifully using her as a kind of human crutch to jack me up the ladder to the helm i battled to get air and give her orders at the same time but i only achieved a whisper because the salt water i d swallowed had dehydrated my throat finally we made it to the spinning wheel but because of my nausea i couldnt stand upright on the canting deckboards so i got behind her and clamped my hands over hers on the spokes and tried to steady them i stayed on my feet by hanging on to her like that and jamming my chest against her back i whooped the boom banged the sail tried to blow itself away with reports like rifleshots every time we fought a wave the pain ripped up my side every one of them seemed to pack maximum punch but we won out finally the out ofcontrol twisting of the boat eased and the seas stopped scouring the decks wed only bought a temporary reprieve however wed lost our critical moment there wasnt a hope now of hitting the mouth of the channel the safe bearing on which kaptein denny had redlined the passage was past we were careering straight towards the chain of hazards on the seaward side it was impossible even to try and claw away from them ichabo was carrying far too much sail anyway she crashed through the troughs like a cart through potholes she was being blown along like a paper boat on a pond dial a prayer jutta is it so bad odds are ninety to one against jutta had lost her souwester in our scramble for the bridge and her hair was tangling in my face it smelt of sea sand and ships then i became aware that she wasnt only using her body as a makeweight to steer it was clinging to mine saying its own messagein the few desperate moments we had left before lchabo struck do we swim when she strikes struan not a chance itll be over quickly then dont let me go i wont jutta struan sorry i made you come im not only that i found out too late me too ichabo bored in at the terrifying barrier of drivingrearing water which walled off alabama cove seawards it was leaping so that great chunks of it were breaking off the crests and shooting into the air like shapes birds i yelled birds millions of em back from the great migration they were beating the sky apart with their wings i saw an outside hope look jutta theyre at the fish maybe she thought id gone crazy because she just stood dazed i threw my weight and hers on the wheel spokes trying to bring ichabo round a point or two that would be enough if i could get her among the birds help me i everything youve got she did so and it helped theres a shoal of fish going through a gap there between the sandbars the birds are after it if its deep enough for them its deep enough for us ichabo came round a trifle more but the deck went clean under beneath the press of sail water spume and spray exploded as the sandspit took the seas force and we hurtled into the breakers about a bucketful of fish was thrown bodily out of the sea on to the deck there was a crash and a gannet the size of a turkey divebombed after them into the planks and broke its neck its mates pulled out of their dives in time and the boat was surrounded by white blobs until i couldnt distinguish which were birds and which were bits of spume that blind rush through the sandbars and reefs cant have lasted more than a couple of minutes but it was the longest voyage ive ever made i expected at any moment to hear the crash of her keel on to the ironhard sand a bird went slap through the sail it rent it across but this had the good effect of making ichabo ride easier then we were through safe through the breakers and into the channel beyond it didnt look safe though the shoreline was a wall of black rocks the surf leaped spectacularly against them and threw spray high over the beachfront dunes the rocks looked like teeth sticking out of frothy gums i got control of ichabo with juttas assistancemy side hurt like helland we coasted upchannel under short sail towards the anchorage at tuscaloosa the birds were everywhere following the same upchannel course as ourselves towards the islet they were there by the tens of thousands there was another tricky moment when finally we got into the lee of the islet and felt its blanketing effect on the wind i couldnt do much because of my side so decided to bring her up by the simple method of cutting sail and anchor loose at the same moment jutta took the sail and i the anchor cable the plan worked the sail came down and the anchor roared out simultaneously as if theyd been linked to some synchronizing mechanism ichabo came to rest at a spot which i reckoned would have been a natural also for the alabama behind tuscaloosa the winds roar diminuendoed the islet formed a splendid natural bulwark against the gale which was now nudging peak velocity the place appeared to have been thrown up by some mighty volcanic convulsion it was simply a confusion of great loose blocks of stone basalt and lava it was so low on its exposed side that the rollers came smashing halfway over it nevertheless it was high enough to constitute a galebreak ichabo plucked and strained at her cables and a lot of loose gear sloshed about on deck i made it fast in a haphazard sort of way because my side began to hurt as if one of tuscaloosas blocks of stone had fallen on it jutta made me leave off before i was properly finished so she could have a look at it the day was gone and the storm made it too dark topside to do much good anyway so i went down with her to the shabby oillit cabin where she had coffee and food ready my suspicions towards kaptein denny had abated hed provided us with the perfect funkhole jf hed wanted to get rid of me he could simply have kept his mouth shut about alabama cove lets have a look at your side i stripped off my oilskins and shirt you were terrific struan her fingers massaging and exploring the injury continued the telltale messages of her body at the wheel you werent so bad yourself its an awful bruise i dont think the ribs themselves are damaged though it feels as if a squadron of seals had made a racetrack of me it was my fault i let you down her fingers were soothingand charged they were betraying something exciting going on inside her no postmortems were safe in one piece and thats what matters she was very close to me concentrating on the damage concentrating more than was really necessary shed got rid of her suede jacket her breasts swelled under her sweater firm and tight ill rub you with some warm oil aboard this outfit youll find nothing better than engine oil ill dig up something theres a firstaid kit in the engineroom i didnt want to spoil the relaxed moment id never seen her like this and i didnt want it changed my ribcage felt ringed with a steel band when i filled my lungs but the injury didnt really merit the fuss she was making of it she returned with some smelly ointment horsedoctor horse we just couldnt help turning one another on we grinned at each other but i overbid my hand by bringing up ichabos narrow escape old captain semmes was a crafty one to have holed up here in the alabama it would have been impossible to flush him out i wonder how he discovered it one things certain he didnt get the help of any yankee whalerman being a southerner himself lost causes like his always bring out ones inventiveness i should have stopped short and kept to the softcore talk when j heard the note in her voice but i didnt expect a sudden deadfall after what her fingers had revealed at least semmes couldnt even have missed finding his way back herehe had seventy chronometers she stopped massaging seventy howd you know that prizes he always took his victims chronometers as personal loot he gave my greatgrandfather one for his services she sank to a squatting position on the floor i was on a locker her hair burned brighter than any light howd your greatgrandfather come into it he was the alabamas number one gunner exroyal navy hed been a gun captain aboard hms furious a couple of years before the alabama started raiding half semmess crew were british recruits he was in furious when she annexed ichabo jsland for queen victoria so the weddell roots really go deep into the sperrgebiet if you put it that way that emotive little spot was back hi the corner of her eye i do put it that way it burns me up youve got this place in your bloodbut you want to deny it to me why youre throwing me out like an empty bottle she jumped to her feet and stood over me whyd you have to bring in your blasted alabama gunner why couldnt you let us be us i also got up i pulled on my shirt that part of things was over you make me sick she exploded i wasnt trying to steal your bloody wreck or anything else ive got a claim like you i was only looking calm down its not my sperrgebiet jf it was id let you stay i was seeing her with clearer eyes than i had before her face was more fragile than it had appeared out there on doodenstadt her teeth were very fine and regular and there were several tiny skin blotches on the line of her scalp and forehead her mouth looked the sort better suited to smiling than accusing up to now there hadnt been much of the first for me youve bawled me out over every nitpicking point you could lay your mind to even having a bath ive got a job to do you think im a bastarddont you it was the sort of pointscorer one throws around in a quarrel neither her fingers nor her body had said that what s the use of going on were not getting anywhere it takes two to tango i said ill listen she said carefully i dont know what you want me to tell you i think you do she sat down her eyes met mine briefly slid away and then came back itll sound like a confession its all about myself that makes me want to hear everything she seemed surprisedand pleased my life really i was beginning to find some pieces i dont know where to begin when we met is good enough for me the tape you do believe it dont you yes here it is then struan this isnt a tale im pitching you neither am j trying to bamboozle you into taking me back to the bridge of magpies i cant anyway in this gale were here for a couple of days at least she took her time about beginning her face wearing a withdrawn expression you know about me and the city of baroda maybe i sound slightly schizo whats really at the back of all thisjutta diamonds treasure the old shakeroo of dead mans gold in a space age wrapping captain kidd was on possession once youre not chasing that sort of moonbeam i hope no the storys unfinished perhaps unfinishable lets first get the record straight its taken me years of saving and scrimping to get together enough cash to reach south west africa im not trying to sound heroicbecause you dont feel heroic bashing a typewriter all day and selling housetohouse at night and giving up your holidays in order to earn a few extra pounds six thousand miles is a long way to come i had to see the bridge of magpies everything about me for the past few years has been geared to that one objective they must have missed you around parties with your hair thats the nicest thing youve said to me youre giving me some unrelated facts plus a motivation which isnt really motivation at all her look met mine squarely back there at the wreck i told you about my mother in the single cabin i never knew who my father wasis good god jutta you dont have to be hung up on a thing like thatnot in these days her voice changed in pitch and register youre rather sweet you know noit isnt that aspect of things that worries me you see my mother was on her way to south africa to marry him they would have been married earlier in england but he was suddenly sent out to the naval base at simonstown a naval officer its one of the few things i know about him ive been searching for clues about him very hard for a long time your mothers parents she smiled ruefully they didnt know about him or about me until it was too late he never showed up afterwards never and i told you to run home to daddy you didnt know then how it could hurt i felt i might get some clue to his identity at the bridge of magpies those things of mine you confiscated are a file on my father rather clues that might lead to his identity its been a long time british admiralty german admiralty japanesefor what it was worth nuremberg trials photocopies uboat records there are all the false leads ive chased notes on all the scores of people ive interviewed and corresponded with the more i gathered the more necessary it became to see the wreck and the bridge of magpies for myself the whole thing snowballed once i became deeply involved its been the main purpose in my life for years now she was easing up all the timeas if shed had it all bottled up inside her and had been waiting for the right listener to come along it gave me a strange elated feeling to think i might be the one only a supersleuth could have dug up that uboat tape i said i didnt know that anything like it existed it was luck ive had it only a few days part of the luck ive had ever since i started out for the bridge of magpies go on my own story is tied up with the way it came into my hands you see after my mother died nobody really knew what to do with the wartime waif a woman called emma hasler in luderitz became my foster mother i lived with her until after the war when my grandparents took me away to england things didnt really work out with them they tried their besti supposebut my fathers name was a dirty word to them i had a pretty miserable childhood an odd womanhood too you think im a bit of an oddball dont you struan you said it not i her eyes were full of broken lights like a sea with the sun on it my researches have brought me into contact with only one type of man the old castingcouch principle information in return for an easy lay the tape i reminded her gently she laughed a little shakily i thought at something she was remembering i wanted to know what it was and i didnt want to know when i landed in luderitz the other day i went straight to frau hasler wed kept in touch she really loves me and its a shame my grandparents ever took me away of course j told her why id come back and that i intended getting to the city of baroda somehow to look for possible clues about my father at that she produced the tape it had been left in her husbands care by the spy swakop ajl those years ago spy the man who made the recording itself swakop his names mentioned at the beginningremember he was a nazi spy he was sent in the uboat to stir up trouble and lead a prohider movement among the german population of south west africa that tape was dynamite if hed been caught also an insurance policy what dye mean if hed been captured he could have used it as a bargaining counter with the authorities with all its topsecret information it was worth more than solid gold in a currency crisis i think that really must have been at the back of his mind because he kept the spool though he dumped the recorder after he left the bridge of magpies he had a hazardous desert crossing before reaching luderitz frau hasler said id also have dumped a bulky wartime tape recorder pretransistor model swakop was an opportunist it was pure chance that the i uboats shiptoshore radio was left transmitting and he was able to record all that happened inside the uboat herself during the final action it cost u her life thats part of my puzzle why should a nazi spy go and see frau hasler her husband was the boss of the pronazi underground movement emma hasler wasnt one of them swakop holed up with the haslers in luderitz she warned her husband he was playing with fire and backing the wrong horse she was right only a few days after theyd taken me in someone stabbed hasler to death swakop no he was in the clear he vanished only lateremma hasler said he always had an eye to the main chance shes never seen or heard of him since never knew his real name even i begin to see why you felt you had to play it back where you did what happened to the other guy the jap they came to pick up he is one of my ma blind alleys every lead on him r has run dead but he must have been important theres mention of him in german records a conversation in the early summer of when hitler offered his official condolences to the japanese ambassador oshima on the death of japans great naval hero admiral yamamoto yamamoto your man must have been a big shot the lead runs dead thereagain the japanese navy records are hopeless who or what tsushima was i cant find out the japs didnt follow the germans practice of logging all details of uboats and their movements the best i can do is to say that u sailed from the japanese base at penang for the bridge of magpies on what was called an exchange of technical information technical information here in the desert i felt as if id been coshed by the past why go into all this jutta surely the answer liesor bywith the naval officers stationed at the cape the enthusiasm shed shown up to then ran flat and dry there were british officers who served at simonstown from until the end of the war try asking men married and unmarriedyears afterwardswhether they sired an unwanted brat who is now trying to find out who her father is take a look in my letter file if you want to see what the big brushoff really means surely the naval records of course i worked that angle too but just you watch the navy clam up when along comes a girl trying to pin parenthood on one of its boys right i said youve done all this sleuthing and delving and what have you got i dont know you threw me out before i could find out jutta she hurried on im just a woman who hasnt found herself the search has turned into the main thing in my life a way of existence programmed by a couple of torpedoes which lammed into a ships side a mother who died giving me birth and a father who didnt show up thereve been men of course menand men i told you about one type the quid proquo lot thereve been a couple of the other sort you dont get to my age without being turned on then when i thought jd found something that was going to stick my heart fired blanks i couldnt so you want to find your fatherin the hope that itll put your own pieces together again that sounds a bit crude for something as deep as what i feel maybe youre partly right maybe after ive found him i ll get direction and meaning all i know is that the not knowing acts as a drag on me or perhaps im one of those people not lucky enough to know love but i do know thisstruan out there on doodenstadt i was within reach of something she made a v of her hands and thrust them hard into her groin too carried away to guess at the extent of the sexual charge the gesture threw at me and i got in your way you or your job i wish youd told me what you were after there by the wreck and the grave to a strangera policeman whats different now nothing really everything maybe i dont know shed begun to talk as though i were thinking of changing my mind about taking her on to luderitz i wasnt but shed said enough and hinted enough for me not to want to leave an image in her mind of an unfeeling bastardnot any more ive been a drifter for years i told her about the greek islands my bivouac was a boat or a bar whichever was handier on the primrose path to the alternative society i was pretty close to becoming a juicedup dropout this job is a challenge so thats why youre acting tough she was unresponsive so i went on to the story of the walewska oilspill i explained that it was the cincs faith which had backed me for the possession headmans job good old cinc i it takes courage loyalty and devotion to duty to protect a lot of birds i was losing herfast i had to choose quickly so on impulse i broke the secret of the lost city and explained why koch and i bad banished her and kaptein denny i swore her to secrecy but i wasnt fool enough not to realize that id given her a weapon to use against me if she chose her eyes kept going over my face as i spoke after id finished she came and put her hands on mine i wanted the gale to go on for ever so that i need never take her to luderitz thanks she said huskily that makes everything different you too thank heavens i was a little sandbagged by the way shed come over to my side but it wasnt the sort of takeover i particularly minded maybe youll find out for me ill wait at emma haslers i couldnt meet her eyes i knew it would be a lie if i said yes i wouldnt know where to begin my reply made us both miserable and after that she closed up there wasnt any more to say and we sat silent and uncomfortable for a long time while the gale roared overhead and plucked and boomed over tuscaloosa as if trying to ape the sound of guns later i lay broad awake for hours in my bunk listening to the tumultso similar to the one going on inside meand to the quarrelling and clucking of inyriads of birds descending out of the night and making for their old nestinggrounds on the islet the gale lasted two days you couldnt have called the lchabo a lovers hideaway during that time jutta and i were shut off from one another so found small jobs for ourselves round the boat discussing them in impersonal voices the mast and boom were badly strained and kept me occupied fiddling them and fixing the rigging and i think jutta felt relieved when i asked her to stitch the torn sail it was wet and unhandy so we brought it below into the big cabin where she worked on it i could have tinkered with the engine but didnt it was an excuse which i wouldnt have admitted to myself for delaying as long as possible at alabama cove on the second morning jutta had gone on deck while down in the cabini put some final touches to the sail i heard her call above the wind struan struan i a boat the white sail and the breakers combined to look like a split imagefar away near the channel entrance until one saw the flared bow and characteristic black strake of a nieswandt cutter the way she was being handled and the press of sail made me certain it was kaptein denny then she came a little closer and i spotted gaoks unmistakable figurehead that boats in a hurry jutta hes alone i dont see anyone else goak finally came almost alongside at the same cracking pace before kaptein denny spun her round and tossed me a securing line he jumped aboard his eyes were strained and red and his mouth was bracketed with fatigue salt had made a white fuzz on his beard stubble and round the neck of his heavy turtleneck sweater it emphasized the rough planes of his face however there was a jauntiness about his stocky figure which i put down to excitement at the storm and his triumph over the seas challenge dr koch sent me urgent youre to come at once theres a strange ship at the bridge of magpies shes up to no good c h a p t e r e i g h t what sort of ship a deepsea trawler so she says why so she says im used to seeing all sorts on the fishing grounds not one like this though whats different about her big too big for a trawler perhaps a thousand tons and too small for anything else i could sense jutta tensely wondering while i questioned kaptein denny whether i would return to possession i intended to but hadnt committed myself the summons let jutta off reprisal and me off the hook as far as she was concerned it was my big facesaver it solved one problem and created others yet i was uneasy that koch felt he couldnt cope what was she up to nothing that i could see she came in during the storm and anchored in the channel as far away out of sight of the huts as she could thats no reason for me to rush back it was curious that koch hadnt sent me a note giving the reasons for his anxiety disquieting too that hed dispatched kaptein denny posthaste and unrestrictedwhen hed been so keen to keep him incommunicado on possession no its not shes foreign built and deckedin forrd with a kind of whaleback you dont get that in a trawler shes also carrying a lot of heavy gear on deck what sort of gearman i didnt go aboard dr koch did with breekbout and then he came back to possession looking worried all he said was take your boat at once and go and find captain weddell that ship stinks you asked no questions you dont when the jail doors are suddenly thrown wide open also you knew exactly where to find me you used sail from possession that left one answer in the storm alabama cove my engine packed up j thought so but that didnt stop you jutta said we had a narrow escape getting here struan hurt his side bad i can still handle a ship good lets go then ill tow you out youll what tow the gales dying i know a way back close inshore all the way youre a devil for punishment its saferreally after a blow like weve had you have to keep a weather eye open for rogue rollers they seem to come out of nowhere jf one caught us out to sea towing wed be in big trouble by the same token why wouldnt that happen inshore too the shoals and reefs would break up a wave before it could reach us there there was a controlled zest about the man he was itching to go either i was going to put my trust possibly my life and juttas tooin his hands or i wasnt he hadnt let me down over alabama cove coffee said jutta we can talk below no time his hurry reawakened a tiny spark of suspicion in my mind why was he so anxious to move out one would have thought a couple of hours waituntil the wind finally droppedwouldnt do any harm i let it ride perhaps it had something to do with negotiating the coast right shoot l i said give me a hand with the anchors first he came forard to help me his eyes were everywhereon the sea on the land on the sky i said towing will use up a lot of your fuel wed better transfer whats in ichabos tanks before we start her old clankers had it it wont want fuel this trip no time again there didnt seem all that much need for his bustle i must have shown something of what i was thinking because he added with a grin which disarmed me if i run out of pa piss in the tanks the downchannel tow wasnt a milkrun it was a sweat even in the relatively calm water of tuscaloosas lee to fix the rope so as to avoid snarlups but kaptein denny knew his business he handled things surely and expertly i sent jutta aboard gaok to be safe in case we ran into trouble and had to cut ichabo adrift she wanted to stayon the grounds that my injury needed further attention it didntbut it was nice to hear her within half an hour of his arrival kaptein denny dragged ichabo clear of her funkhole at the end of a tough manila hawser we left the miserable little island behind with birds clustered over it like flies on a kill near new bedford point the sea showed signs that the gale was on its way out the water glistened darkly instead of breaking white and there were patches of green amidst the universalmonotonous grey kaptein denny took the hazards of the whalebone point in his stride but the way he squeezed the two cutters through until white water came churning over lchabos side almost turned my seasoned stomach ichabo cavorted at the end of the hawser like a yoyo freefalling in space with only a string to bring it up short he repeated the act a little farther down the coast at the cost of much adrenalin i never guessed there were such routes the wind decreased our speed increased by afternoon the wind had fallen to a fresh breeze denny and i had agreed on leaving tuscaloosa that when this happened he had slated seventyfour rock another halfsubmerged islet well down the coast as the place where it would happen and he was right we would drop the tow and use sail so as to make better time but the wind was veering west and with my injured side i couldnt manage the short sharp tacks that were necessary so gaok took up the hawser again and strung ichabo ajong that frightening shoreline working up to a useful speed of six knots seals appeared as the water smoothed one huge fellow a sort of cheerleader led his pack round the cutters for nearly an hour playing waterborne ringoroses when night came i didnt want to blow our luck by carry ing on but captain denny wouldnt hear of anchoring his knowledge of the way was uncanny he rigged a light in gaoks stern and i held station on itas tense and nerve racking a business as flying a plane dual control when you cant hear the pilot and dont know what his next move will be about midnight i hadnt an idea where we were kaptein denny hailed me to say we were about to anchor he cast off ichabo freewheeled on and i felt utterly helpless but i neednt have worried kaptein denny ran the smartest shop gaoks guide light did a quick flipper turn disappearedand then the boat was back alongside ichabo again made fast and sheepdogging my powerless craft to anchor we had a quick hardtack supper aboard gaok and turned in the last sound i remember hearing before dropping off was the thunder of the surf close by we started off again in the morning before the sun broke up the fine spidery structure of the fog there was no wind and an almost uncanny quiet jutta joined me in ichabo kaptein denny told us that the switchback part of the trip was over and that it wasnt far to possession but he made a minor mystery out of the ships position i thought it boosted his ego jutta stood by me at the wheelwatching the silvery splash from the hawser as it dipped and tighteneddipped and tightened in the confined space the sweet sleptin womans clothing smell of her stirred my senses the fact that my attention was on her made it all the more remarkable that my subconscious should have thrown up something about kaptein denny jutta for crying out loud he said u who kaptein denny of course he said u why shouldnt he there at the grave u after all he knew it but he didnt jutta thats what im saying he was aware that the city of baroda had been sunk by a uboat a uboat he didnt know specifically which uboat then before he has heard your tape which identifies ithe comes up with u not any old uboat but a particular one what a giveaway i dont get you struan what im saying is that if kaptein denny knew the uboats number he wasnt at the bridge of magpies that wartime oight just fishing as hed have us believe hes playing a very deep game he must have been part of that spy operation dont you see what im driving at yes i do now that he came to the bridge of magpies knowing all about u and her rendezvous to pick up one spy and land another his function may have been to ferry the jap tsushima from luderitz under cover of his fishing then take back to port the man they landedwhat was his name swakop it jells struan then everything came unstuck for him when u tangled with the liner and gousblom maybe thats why swakop had to make his way across the desert to luderitz frau hager said he was nearly all in when he arrived kaptein dennys liner rescue act could have been a blind hed have been obliged to provide a very sound reason for being around that night hed also have had tsushima on his hands after hed missed the uboat thats why he remained so unbelievably modest about the whole business jt was a gigantic bluff he even dodged the warships with reason if he had a japanese spy aboard but all that doesnt really concern us jutta what does is the fact that hes back here nowas hes been every winter for thirty years on his own admission whats the drawingcard loot from the lost city loot from u whatever it is cant be easy to get at because he keeps coming back and only at one season of the year when conditions must be favourable for his operations i wasnt going to tell youstruan but he wouldnt charge for bringing me here ah how did he react when you first approached him about chartering his boat surprised pleased he wasnt worried about operating in forbidden territory he laughed it off i was touched by his willingness to help were beginning to discover why hes kept his nose clean up to now he didnt object when you ordered him off the shore with reservations he still wasnt going to shift from his boat remember it doesnt add up struan if he wanted you out of the waywhy has he made such an effort to bring you back again why risk his neck in the storm it would have been an easy enough excuse to say he couldnt find us why be in such a hurry to get back to possession kochs nogood ship seems to have complicated the issue look there she is we broke clear of the wisps of fog and i realized immediately where we wereoff elizabeth points ghost town there were only about four miles of open water now between us and possession in the channel somewhat to the south of the usuaj anchorage as though avoiding the huts ashore was the ship sure thats no trawler the vessel was too far away for me to make out her name but my glass showed a low black hull with a whaleback focsle a straight upanddown outmoded cutwater and a single high oldfashioned stack with a white band painted round it two very tall ventilators towered almost as high as the marking she had a very square bridge and a boxlike structure in the stern which on a warship would have been a radio or radar shack but she wasnt a warship her masts were squat and sturdy with heavy booms and derricks their strength out of keeping to her size no crew was visible she looks sort of slnister struan all black ships do ill find out soon enough go aboard once weve tied up possession advertised its presence in its usual nostrilassaulting manner the two cutters plugged slowly across the sea to the anchorage they were white with saltas if theyd taken a pasting on the iceland cod run we remained visible for miles but there was no sign from the stranger that shed sighted us her decks remained empty of men where the devils breekbout i asked irritably he should be getting out the whaleboat to fetch us jutta took a look through the binoculars not a sign having breakfast in bed perhapswhile the cats away i tried to relax baths are on the house today she smiled back think of all that lovely drinking water going down the drain you tempt me to rush in on you and switch off the tap possession chivalry to ladiesinthenude i wanted more of her in that mood wed taken up where wed left off in alabama cove but the business of making the two cutters fast cut across it and kaptein denny bad us rushing backwards and forwards in the process of manoeuvring up to the mooring buoys when it was done we went aboard gaok they havent hung out the flags for our return kaptein denny breekbout i could understand dr koch puzzles me id come prepared to read anything into his words but they were neutral enough id have expected him to be chewing his nails waiting for us to heave over the horizon the way you spoke he was when i set out all the time his eyes were scanning the anchorage the channel the black ship the shoreline and the island there was no smoke from the bunkhouse chimney and a gobbledygook of bird noises floated across the water the place had a nevernever air like a stage with props but no actors they might all have been there for ever the sperrgebiet has that trick of making time scales wobble after ten minutes waiting id had enough the others were uneasy too well use your dinghy i told kaptein denny even the splash of oars sounded unnaturally loud as we rowed to the jetty so did our footsteps on the concrete path leading to the bunkhouse door i threw it open theres no one here you two scout around koch may have left a note for me ill take a looksee at the cottage the door was halfopen and breekbout was sitting at the radio transceiver his eyes were half shut and his mouth had the beginnings of a silly grin as if lied shaken loose a laugh out of hls own death his head was smashed open like a pomegranate the radio was also wrecked and bits of its innards lay around like breekbouts brains i wanted to puke but i had enough remaining sense not to leave before id taken a look at the remains of the radio the transceiver switch was on send the dial pointer stood at the silvermine frequency no one on possession besides myself knew that frequency i crashed my rifle butt into the dials face so as to make it unreadable i went back to the bunkhouse he had three ghost lights burning kaptein denny was telling jutta when i entered it didnt help him i said besides ghosts dont bash in heads with sealing clubs oh god i shed seen my face then hot and cold sweat chased one another across my face and body and reaction shakes set in jutta grabbed me by the sleeves of my jersey what i passed my rifle to kaptein denny whose face was a mask youd better take this for the moment i couldnt manage to fire it even if someone was about to kill me too struan i what happened i tried to pull myself together and tell them but i made such a poor job of it that jutta went for some brandy she found the bottle but it was empty breekbout had seen to that i could have grown to like that stupid sonafabitch i managed to say it and it helped the mindnumbing shock of that hideous object at the radio plus my wavelength discovery breekbout had been a clown pointing his laugh lines in the appealing idiom of the gamat and that seemed somehow to make his dreadful end the worse kaptein denny left jutta to do the fussing over me he took up guard just inside the door where he couldnt be seen with my rifle in his hands and an ugly commando knife in his belt when id got my composure back i said to jutta blow out those lights they give me the creeps they may have guided the killer she did so j turned to kaptein denny he cant stay like that a piece of sail or something to cover him he handed me back the gun theres no one aroundabsolutely nothing i took over his observation post but it did seem rather ridiculous there was no sign of anyone ashore and no activity aboard the black ship kaptein denny found a tarpaulin we three stick close together from now on i said you stay outside the cottage jutta while we see to him but close enough to yell if you spot anything but anything kaptein denny and i went inside and masked the bloody cameo i watched him closely but he paid no special attention to the transceiver look at the bloodstains he pointed out theyre old and dried he birds have been at him too that means hes been dead a couple of days that makes it as soon as you left he was fine then one loses track of time in a storm what did he mean by that sidestep i asked myself could he have killed his jailer and escaped no that line of argument broke down when you thought hed come after me and brought me back as a bluff though a cover no one had anything to gain by killing this poor bastard i said no who then he was the only one except yourself who could work the radio he gestured whoever it was made it clear that he didnt want you to communicate bastard i said automatically true id myself taught breekbout to transmit but neither henor anyone elseknew about my hot line to the cinc where is koch most likely on his way to luderitz to report this and very considerately sent the whaleboat back empty across the channel and let it tie itself up at the jetty then possibly hes over at that ship weve been back for over an hour the cutters were in sight long before that kochs bad plenty of time to make his number if hes around why shouldnt he be that ship not a mans visible either the crews devoted to the tweendecks or theyve been ordered to stay out of sight why well soon find out im going across to her now alone all three of us as i said we keep dose ill i checked that the rifles magazine was full and worked a shel into the breech i put the safetycatch on lets get cracking we rejoined juttawho accepted my decision without comment we used kaptein dennys dinghy instead of the heavier whaleboat since he had to do the rowing because of my side it was a long pull not much was said all kinds of random explanations and accusations wheeled through my brain some of them were so wayout as to be pure nonsense it was the carryover of shockof course i was prepared to suspect kaptein dennys silence even cut it out i told myself the mans simply saving his breath for rowing by the time we were halfway across id got control of my thoughts and dumped my overheated fears overboard my mind was empty and cool and ready for what id find aboard the ship theyre coming up on deck exclaimed jutta jf theyd been as shy as the ten virgins up to now thats where the resemblance ended they were as tough and motley a bunch as could be raised in any waterfront bordello a man in a peaked cappresumably the captain joined the population of the hitherto empty decks he took up station on a narrow catwalk surrounding the bridge and watched us approach kaptein denny read out the vessels name sang a never heard it before where she from j cant make out its some sort of eastern writing she could be with those lines and a name like that jt wasnt her lines though which caught our interest when we came closer but some big tarpaulins concealing unknown bulky objects abaft the bridge there was another big mysterious hidden hump near the foremast an armoured rubber hose snaked across the whaleback from some machinery in the bows and ended up looped in the forward rigging those men are chinese said jutta they certainly looked it but more obvious than any nationaj characteristic was the roughtough unwelcoming look on their faces they didnt offer to make us fast when we came alongside however it was not really necessary because about fifty feet of heavy chain cable hanging in scallops from the rail offered a natural securing point more of the cable was lying on the deck there was also a clutter of wire rope cables and powerful blockandtackle gear if the ship had been bigger id have thought she was a cablelayer attention the arrogance of the teutonic form of address made me dislike the man on the catwalk before even i knew his name you the captain la come here we had to skirt round to reach the ladder leading to him there was clutter everywhere and more tarpaulinmasked objects the shack aft which had puzzled me from a distance intrigued me more from close to it didnt appear to have a deck entrance and its portholes were so high you couldnt see in however it was inhabited a face looked out from one of them as i mounted the ladder emmermann sang a the captain was a chunk of a man in his middle fifties as tall as my own sixfoot one with a craggy face big nose and short irongrey hair his lips were indrawn and his very large eyes were trenched with crows feet at the corners a scar ran from the corner of his left eye to his ear his manner was one of controlled hostility i introduced the three of us since summoning us to the catwalk hed been joined from inside the bridge by another man like the rest of the crew an oriental first officer kenryo his introduction was as unwilling as the rest of our reception had been if it had been on kenryos account i could have understood it he had a flatgolliwog face with a smashed nose and the emptiest black eyes id ever seen he was short and stocky and wore jeans and a greasy flannel tartan shirt and i didnt care for the way he undressed jutta with his eyes is it all right to speak english for us but not for the crew there was a trace of american in kenryos accent theyre chinese no replied emmermann korean sang a means shark our home ports pusan were here with the korean trawler fleet offshore added kenryo a couple of the crew had gathered under the catwalk which wasnt very high above their heads and seemed to be idly listening despite kenryos statement that they should not understand our conversation he leant over the rail and said something to them a flash passed through kaptein dennys eyes but it was gone again as quickly as it had come one of the crew came back with a repartee and they all sniggered i guessed it had something to do with jutta no fishing is permitted here theres a strict twelvemile offshore limit maybe i pulled my authority too hard out of reaction over the crack about jutta so thats the law so and you carry out the law if necessary im the island headman these waters fall under my authority you come aboard my ship with a gun and threaten me eh im not threatening just getting the record straight theres no problemprovided you dont fish the record is straight then good morning if you dont know the law you should now i know it good another thing theres been a death on the island one of my men i left out the details and purposely made breekbouts end sound more like an accident i wanted to hear what they had to say before i started talking about murder kenryo cut me short none of our men has been ashore sang a isnt in a hot seat j didnt say you were im investigating i was away when it happened it could be something more than an accident their faces remained blank jm also looking for a colleague of mine who seems to have disappeared dr koch never heard of him we saw no one kenryos eyes were black and beady didnt you see the whaleboat being ferried around there was the storm you couldnt see much if he used the boat in the gale maybe he drowned the boats safe at the island then he didnt drown this sort of thing was getting me nowhere the ball was back in my courtif id ever managed to get it into theirs fair enough this becomes a police matter of course they shrugged as if they realized as i did just how much that meant on the sperrgebiet there was nothing else to do but leave we headed back to our boat the group of pluguglies who had been standing chinning between themselves fell silent id get no more change out of their sullen faces than i had out of the officers we pushed off i took the oars because i wanted to test my side it was one of possessions rare beautiful days birds trailed over the anchorage like a kingsized paperchase fishtailing down after the shoals in the water i hadnt much inclination to admire i was smarting inwardly at the way my show of authority had fallen flat on its face on sang as deck captain weddell kaptein denny was straining and peering at the land its the landrover before i could turn to look junta exclaimed theres been a fire i looked not a fire a conflagration the blackened skeleton of the vehicle stood out clearly against the champagnecoloured sand no sign of dr koch kaptein denny observed well soon check help me with the oars well take the boat in it would be a mistake mistake koch could be lying there keep your voice down theyll hear you aboard sang a well say it for pitys sake if sang a wanted to fix us by taking a crack at our cutters while were ashore wed be playing right into their hands by going there now i eyed him with a new respect the more so when i noted that sang as hoodlums were still lining the railswatching us what do you suggest well go ashore all right but well use both cutters for the trip itll look pretty silly towing each other across such a small stretch of water itll be sillier still if we should lose them without boats wed be hamstrung right jt will also be a subtle demonstration of no confidence in our new neighbours jutte never stopped looking at the burntout vehicle she was very withdrawn when we reached the cutterskaptein denny took ichabo in tow and made as wide a detour of sang a as possible the water was deep off the landing beach and we anchored close in from our position a sandhill barred further view of the landrover i took the rifle and made as much show of it as i could for the benefit of sang a i was sure every move of ours was being watched through binoculars we landed when we obtained our first clear sight of the vehicle i ordered jutta to stay right where she was it looked like a charred treetrunk behind the wheel it was koch i didnt feel the same revulsion for his remains as i had done for breekbouts maybe the earlier shock had conditioned or numbed my reactions it was only a faceless blackened outline really wed also come hajfprepared for tragedy kaptein denny and i fanned out to approach the landrover from both sides j with the rifle cocked as i walked cautiously through the sand i had a curious impressionone of those readymade pictures the mind throws up in times of stressthat id seen it all before it was coupled with the foreboding of a pattern of future tragedy into which these two deaths were inexorably grooved i reached the drivers side of the landrover at the same moment as kaptein denny got to the other all clear he straightened from the halfcrouch hed gone into when hed circled round and put away his knife look at this the steel fascia was blackened and buckled the bonnet was also starred with glass fragments from the windscreen an explosion did this he said i tried not to give way to my doubts and suspicions before testing all the everyday possibilities of course it did the tank went up its right behind the drivers seat jf it had the force of it would have thrown him forward and out some sort of freak accident it wasnt an accident come over to my side and see his left legs gone i went round and joined him someone sneaked up ajongside and threw something next to him on the floor something grenade that would account for all the buckling and glass out front bastardsl i began and then took hold of myself cursing wasnt going to help this was done days ago seker for sure the gale swept away the footprints you couldnt prove anything against anyone now except the grenade the trails already cold by the time the experts sort that one out itll be in deep freeze and sang a will be over the horizon shes not bloody well going over any horizon im going right back on board a lot of men have died in unexplained ways on the sperrgebiet captain weddell you dont want to be among them our eyes locked i felt instinctlvely hed not had anything to do with the killings thanks j said i needed that reminder now lets do something about koch ive got some spare canvas aboard gaok we went to jutta who had been waiting behind the sandhilland told her what had happened why she burst out why kill him why kill breekbout they didnt have any secrets worth murdering them for she caught my warning glance and remembered the lost city and that kaptein denny didnt know about it what did he know though hed now moved right out of my area of suspicion and was firmly aligned with us against sang a that was merely the end of the negative aspect however hed done nothing positive yet to win my confidence and he often indulged in a mannerism which from my point of view wasnt at all positive a nick of quartering the anchorage as if he expected to lee something there his quick survey always began down by the bridge of magpies and worked its way upchannel his eyesight was so phenomenal that i was sure hed spot anything long before jutta or l ill fetch that canvas kaptein denny went off in the dinghy leaving jutta and me keep out of sight of sang a i warned the fact that theyre a lot of weirdies doesnt turn them into murderers struan who else could it be who knows a very uneasy present had blown up in my face and swamped a very puzzling past until id been confronted by the two murders and the mysterious sang a id felt mentally like a castaway wandering on the dint shores of that past juttas past kaptein dennys pastdoodenstadts past now however id snapped clean into the present in doing so a new suspicion the size of possession island hit me was the cincs mission itself not a blind maybe it was a front for something much more sinister and deeprooted that he couldntor wouldntreveal at our interview that would make sense of the underhand way hed brought me from santorin and his insistence on secret singlehanded investigation on my part all this carried the implication that koch was part of his conspiracy then he would have been the one who had attempted to get off that emergency radio signal to the cinc via breekbout why not send it himself though it was confusing but possible and what the time sequence of events was in regard to the two killings id never know i wondered if the little admiral was gambling on the expectation that i would see the lost city mission for the blind it really was and get his real message when things started to hot up they had now jutta and i stood around without saying much more until kaptein denny returned he and i shrouded koch in the canvas and left the body in the landrover it was so charred that we reckoned the jackals wouldnt scent it then we rowed out to gaok i sought a topic to defuse the underlying tension whyd you call her gaok kaptein denny its short for gaokhaosib hottentot for the bridge of magpies everything always seemed to come back to the bridge of magpies that past again we went on in silence each wrapped in his own thoughts finally when we three were seated in gaoks cabin drinking coffee i saidpriority number one is for me to go aboard sang a again what purpose will it serve struan asked jutta they will deny any knowledge of kochthey have already done sojust as they did in the case of breekbout its a foregone conclusion it would look odder if i didnt inform them thered been another murder it mightnt sound too good in court one day they know already its a long way from here to court what if they did kill them both what do you intend to do about it asked kaptein denny hed been very reserved up to now you havent even a radio link now with the outside world youll scare them off if you go at it like a bull at a gate said jutta theyll upanchor and vanish that wont do anyone any good they wont there was something about dennys flat assertion that made the small bell of mistrust tinkle again at the back of my brain what makes you so sure i had a feeling hed overplayed his hand and he knew it he backpedalled on the answer and merely said ira a move which could backfire disastrously on us how look what happened to breekbout and koch they wouldnt dare jutta interrupted me excitedly look look sang a fs getting up steam we rushed to the nearest porthole there was a thin wisp coming from the tall funnel and a bow winch was taking in the slack of the anchor cable that does it i rapped out move she mustnt get away c h a p t e r n i n e i slipped gaoks cable and kaptein denny had the diesel roaring in under a minute we got under way and tore off in the direction of sang a jutta joined me on the bridge i took a long look at the black ship were in danger of making fools of ourselves that ships not upanchoring at all whats all the activity about then i shouted to kaptein denny to cut our speed and join us sang a wasnt more than a mile and a half away now they re trimming her head i pointed out look its beginning to point towards doodenstadt theres another mooring buoy astern denny could make it out but i couldnt theres a cable out to it and theyre winching her stern round what the hell are they up tor there are a couple of boats too added jutta they were light launches and they were putting off from sang as sidetrailing something between them i saw what it was as denny spoke a hawser theyre dragging for something we dont want to break up this interesting little party i said well just stooge around with the engine off while kaptein denny attended to the motor jutta and i kept watch on the launches they worked their way slowly and deliberately between sang a and a point on possession holding so straight a course that it was clear they were steering on a fixed bearing gaok lost way and lay rising and falling in the easy swell looks as if theyre dragging for something on the sea bed i said perhaps they lost an anchor in the storm suggested jutta denny paused before replyinguntil the launches had made more progress towards the island no theyre much too close inshore any skipper who anchored there would need his head read maybe he does anyway i retorted see what theyre doing with the ship itself swig as head was pointing all wrong to lie meeting the upchannel current but it was clear that was the way it was intended because theyd now secured her stern to the buoy and i could make out the tight thread of cable out of the water between the two take us close now i told kaptein denny the top of gaoks crows nest is about level with the portholes in that odd shack of sang as i mean to find out whats inside a sneak look seems the only way to do itjudging from their previous reception said jutta kaptein denny grinned whatever sang a was up to seemed to have put him in a relaxed mood theres nothing to prevent us sailing round and round sang a you could always be looking after the interests of your darling birds the way he put it could have implied anything or nothing anything being that he guessed i was no more a headman than i was a gannet lets go our runin was from astern of sang a id circled over towards possession to get into position and kaptein denny was to take the wheel while i made my eyeinthesky inspection we were chugging along at about four knots steady j glanced up to take my line ill be damned look at that sang as masts and the stumps of the city of barodas were in a line theyve deliberately trimmed sang a on the liners old course jutta was afire now that the liner had come into it denny said we too are on that courseexactly the liner had already been hit by the time she reached the position where we are now she was heading for the rocks to beach herself jutta gripped me tightly by the arm she was looking everywhere as though she hadnt already memorized every detail of the anchorage whats the sense of it struan kaptein denny neither of us replied because there wasnt a reply whats the point in mocking up an old course it doesnt help i dont see i do see somethingjutta that theres more to sang a than meets the eye youre going to cut that stern buoy mighty fine captain weddell shave it to a whisker if you like i want the best view its like treading in old footprints made by someone you knew exclaimed jutta take it easy i said hearing the excited pitch of her voice there are no footprints in the sea youve crossed and recrossed the lines course a dozen times already and its meant nothing dont start imagining things she replied with a gesture you didnt need a pelorus to see how the six masts of the three ships stood in a neat line take her in now i told kaptein denny im going up aloft sang as crew came running when they saw us boring straight down on their stem they did more than run when we seemed likely to ram they yelled and waved us off and shouted obscenities kenryo was among them i ignored them and concentrated on the shack the racket brought one man inside to a porthole hed forgotten to remove the headphones hanging loose round his neck the giveaway was complete when kaptein denny skimmed sang as quarter so close that i could almost have reached out and touched two other headphoned operators seated at big consoles the shack was jammed with electronic equipment i left the crows nest and descended to the wheelhouse give her the gun and pull well clear i told denny the place is stuffed with electric gear sang a is no more a trawler than i am captain kidd then whats she up to struan asked jutta ill reserve judgement until i know what is under those tarpaulins then youll have to go aboard her again captain weddell not today let em cool off tomorrow weve got two bodies to bury now the burials went wrong right from the start i would have preferred to have buried them at sea but there would have had to be postmortems when the law came into it so that meant land burials possession was out for the simple reason that there is no soil over the island rock in which to dig a grave so we decided on the mainland alongside the charred landrover kaptein denny and i couldnt manage to dig the graves more than a couple of feet deep because the sand kept pouring back there wasnt a bible or a prayerbook and i could only remember stray holysounding phrases like dust to dust and in the midst of life we are in death so after a couple of false starts i said the lords prayer while jutta wept and kept looking back towards her mothers grave away in the old cemetery the only other sounds were the soft chording of the breeze and the faraway clatter of swig as winches and the chug of her launches they were watching us of course i expected kaptein denny to do better in his own religion for breekbout but his contribution consisted of some rice balls and bright sticky sweets it was probably reactionbut i wanted to laugh when a group of beetles emerged from the sand and started rolling away the rice balls and became entangled in the sticky sweets while denny intoned in a language i didnt understand i thought of the bellylaugh it would have given koch then the whole thing backfired on me and all j wanted was to get my hands on the swine who had done it to him there was no decisive finaleand denny stood around looking awkward when hed stopped his halfchant we just grabbed the spades and shovelled the sand over the two canvas bundles and then i remembered i am the resurrection and the life and something about the sea giving up its dead so i said ajoud the parts i could recall and slurred the rest then kaptein denny and i wired two boards with their names and the date on to the wrecked vehicle when wed finished jutta asked me to take her over to the official litlle graveyard kaptein denny retreatedhe sensed that jutta wanted to be alone with mebut asked for the rifle and some spare shells and went and stood guard by the shoulder of the big sandhill from which wed first spotted him at the graveyard the precaution seemed strange in that emptinessuntil one thought of koch jutta had brought some smooth white stones from passes sion in her handbagind she laid them out on the mound in the form of a cross she asked me to say some of the words i had said for breekbout and koch but i tailed off becausebeing so disconnected they sounded ridiculous suddenly jutta came close and clung tightly to me then turned and walked fast and straight back across the sand to where kaptein denny stood guard i didnt follow immediately i stood and stared after hershed changed for the ceremony before we came ashore into a pale green slack suit which was her only decent outfit and which offset her hair i felt a sudden tide of emotion as crisscross as any on the sperrgebiets coastline one thing i was sure of jutta wasnt just a sudden infatuation on my part what i wasnt so sure of was kaptein denny what j was least sure about was sang a already my oneman assignment had ballooned into squad size a murder squad nor had i even got to grips with whatever lay behind the thing whose deadly sharp edges had revealed themselves in the two killings should i leave things to simmer until someone put a foot wrong and enabled me to play the right card or act decisively on the plan which was starting to take shape in my rind i walked back to jutta and kaptein denny i intend presenting emmerrnann and kenryo with an ultimatum tomorrow i told them im going to ask them to signal the fisheries frigate and report koch and breekbouts deaths and at the same time request clearance for sang a to be at possesslon that isnt an ultimatum answered jutta its simply an admission that youre without a radio and therefore cut off from outside help denny too was sceptical where will it get you if they refuse which is likely we neednt look any further for the murderers of course they did it jutta was emphatic furthermore a refusal would prove that they havent any right to be doing whatever theyre doing at this moment and then the rest of the plan was mine and they were involved it wouldnt do to reveal it yet well play it by ear i may get some clue tomorrow as to what all their hidden gear is for but in that i was mistaken because early next day when kaptein denny took gaok through the thick fog to where sang a had anchored she had disappeared it was the right spot too because her stern mooring buoy was still there kaptein denny cut gaoks engine the only sound magnified by the fog was the slap of waves against possessions cliffs and some other unidentifiable noises from the channel none of us had slept well and juttas eyes were tired she was wearing her favourite suede jacket and her shoulders and beret were beaded with moisture blast i exclaimed but ill bet sang a hasnt thrown in the towel and pushed off altogether no denny replied she hasnt he stood listening a moment and then went to the bridge door i dont see her but i smell her there he jerked his head in one direction but it didnt mean much to me id lost all sense of direction in the fog go after her captain weddell naturally wait jutta came to me isnt there some other way she indicated the loaded rifle which stood near the wheel sooner or later theres got to be a confrontation between us better soonerjutta youre not involvedso dont worry not involved and if they clout you over the head with a sealing club you think i wont get hurt i turned away from her eyes i was on an emotional seesaw and my end was high in the alr think youll locate her i was unjustifiably abrupt with kaptein denny yes well stalk her we use sail good silent sail that killed the moment with jutta of course she went and stood by herself looking out we made sail and slipped slowly and silently downchannel denny was everywhere a seachallenge always stirred him up he knew his way too and gave usme rather because jutta held herself aparta running commentary on the wrecks we were passing by or over there was the nautilus a world war i coaster stuffed full of treasurerecovery gear a sailer named the maridahl which couldnt beat a possession gale when she tried to claw her way out close by her the lovely amanda a yankee whaler and finally the black prince a mercy ship from luderitz which had finished up on the islands southern tip and had given her name to black prince cove some of the holiday air went out of kaptein denny when we left the island astern without sighting sang a he went to the side and took a sip of seawater and announced that we were over the spot where bol isletonce positioned on admiralty chartshad suddenly vanished he made several fiddling alterations of course which kept gaok in the fog curtain he seemed to be getting uptight about something sang a is around he said smell her still but i reckon shes over towards the mainland it makes no odds go after her theres a dangerous skietrots there skietrots what sort of gamat word is that shooting rock its untranslatable really its a rock on which the seas break and shoot high its called pikkewyn se draai penguins turning i hope sang a is turning too by now ready then captain weddell any time something was eating him though and he still hesitated to break clear of the fog jnstead he hung around on the wispy fringe of the bank for some time then he seemed to make up his mind and everything grew light all at onceand we were blinking in broad sunlight with a long view of the sperrgebiets desolation ahead sang a was there ajl right she was moving southwards parallel to the coast close inshore her passage ahead was blocked by an irregular chain of islets two stood out at a glance from the rest one of them was shaped like an outsize conical highway post and the sea clawed and foamed against it and gave it the name skietrots the secondbiggerwas almost a third of a mile long and half a mile offshore kaptein denny indicated the latter albatross rock jutta broke her silence sang a isnt worried at seeing us not yet i swung my glasses through a wide arc there was something very determined about the way she was plugging along on a dead straight course she might have been on rails rather than negotiating as bad a patch of foul ground as id seen on the sperrgebiet she was changing course now coming about a little short of the dangerous fang engine i requested kaptein denny well go alongside now is she aware of us at all struan look at the way shes behaving that was clear even to juttas unnautical eyes instead of sheering clear of the rocks and reefs as any normal vessel would have done sang a completed an inward uturn which would bring her still closer inshore and among them she then steadied on a new coursestill parallel to the coast but this time heading back towards the bridge of magpies and possession on rails i thought on bloody rails kaptein dennys eyes were slits shes following a plot it was clear that her new reverse upcoast course over lapped slightly on her previous downcoast one and jm going to find out what it is that engine please he went to see to it the lost city struanis that what shes after on this pitch its miles away kaptein dennys not happy either why isnt he do you think juttawhy what gives she clenched one of the bridge window catches until her knuckles showed white im scared struan of what i dont know i dont know scared about your going aboard that ship scared about my staying i want to run away but i want more to stay i took her by the shoulders and pressed my thumbs into them ill sort it out for us thats a promise promises are easy this isnt there was no time to say any more because just then denny returned from the engineroom the distance between the two vessels began to narrow this isnt going to be easy sang a wont stop denny spoke almost mechanically ever since sighting sang a he seemed to have fajlen into a mood of deep preoccupation his earlier enthusiasm for the chase had evaporated ill jump when we come alongside you hold station until i m ready to return what i have to say wont take long gaok bored in on an interception course sang a held hers rulerstraight she was doing about eight knots and could easily have got away from gaok if shed wanted to but not if she was doing what i thought she was doing emmermann and kenryo rushed out on to sang as cat walk when we drew level and the crew began giving their vocabularies a workout what dye think youre playing at roared emmermann keep clear keep clear gaok was thrashing ajong right alongside sang a and both vessels were bucking in one anothers wash only a couple of feet separated them i picked a gap between the threatening crewmen and jumped two toughies made at me the nearer aimed a roundhouse swing at my head i dodged and made a staggering lunge across the bucking deckmissed my footing and fell on my knees my man came on i was a millisecond ahead of him grabbed his foot and rode the kick aimed at my neck nevertheless it caught me under the right armpit with the force of a cars bumper i was tossed backwards and half under one of the tarpaulined objects only my peripheral vision registered what it was because my main attention was focused on the two men rushing at me the first one having disengaged his foot it wasnt a winch or a bollard i saw or any of the other things youd expect to find on the deck of a ship going about her lawful occasions it was a twinmount machine gun id slipped into a crouch to meet the attack when the men stopped like dogs called to heel angry dogs snarling dogs only then did i hear kenryo shouting at them i got up brushed past them and started to walk towards emmermann and kenryo on the catwalk that walk could have been in millimetres not feet it seemed to last for ever not because of the menacing crew but because of my racing thoughts that machinegun put the clincher on what i suspected about sang a it certainly didnt fit in with emmermanns story about trawling it also wrote the cincs brief to me in much broader and more dangerous terms ships dont go around with highpowered electronics gear and mounted guns searching for lost cities if there was a lost city at all i wondered whether thered ever been one in point of fact and what really lay behind my assignment whatever it was it began to look rough i decided to tackle emmermann and kenryo first about the electronic gear and hold back about the gun id never get off sang a alive if i mentioned it they werent to know id glimpsed it the tarpaulin cover was still in place their answer to any request for use of their radio was both a back number and a foregone conclusion now but i intended to go ahead because it provided my excuse for boarding sang a i finally reached emmermann and kenryo emmermanns face was livid the cords in his neck stood out and there were little nicks from a bad shave order that ship of yours to sheer off or ill ram her he rasped get off or ill throw you off i added kenryo i gave his stocky figure a quick onceover his threat wasnt an idle one and im a big man you murderous sod i thought it was you who killed breekbout and koch he looked as if hed come at me any moment see here i said theres been another death i want you to signal the fisheries frigate who the hell do you think youre ordering about kenryo started towards me but emmermann stopped him its no business of ours whoever it is he said it was dr koch im making it your business why dont you use your own radio kenryos eyes were hot and sly its out of order i admitted well yes or no no replied emmermann fair enough they both seemed surprised at my ready and unquestioning acceptance of their refusal but there wasnt any point in pressing the demand plus another for sang a to request clearance to operate in nonfishing waters the answer to that one lay back on deck hidden under a tarpaulin also i wanted to keep communications open between myself and sang a so that i could still come aboard under some pretext or other the whole situation had changed radically since id spotted that machinegun id have to handle things very carefully indeed i was wondering how to play my next card about the electronics business when a man walked on to the catwalk carrying an echosounder or sonar record the sort of cardboard cylinder device that revolves on a drum while a pen traces graphs on it it also proved my point why sang a couldnt speed up to escape gaok because above twelve knots the noise of a ships engines confuses the sensitive instruments i said keeping my voice as level as i couldyoure not a trawler kenryos eyes were dirty with anger but the cool way he played the situation showed me what i was up against he took the cylinder from the newcomer held it out briefly to me and then thrust it out of sight into his pocket but id seen enough it was different from and more sophisticated than the ordinary type of echosounder record id known in the navy who said sang a was a trawler not us you came aboard blowing your top about fishing inside the limits when were not fishing at all sang as job is to spot shoals for the fishing fleet youve probably seen this sort of record echosounder your fancy equipment is a waste of time where you are now j retorted and pointing seawards i indicated a patch of water over which the birds had gathered hunting for fish a little local knowledge would be much more profitable we prefer technology my attempt to lower the temperature seemed to be paying off because emmermann said less aggressively you fouled up our run by barging alongside sonar cannot i know above twelve knots you cant get a decent reading youre very well informed for a simple island headman steady i reminded myself steady not so simple as you will discover these waters are full of ships fitted with special gear the man who had brought out the echosounder cylinder came to my rescue by asking kenryo a question now that the heat was off i wanted to get back to gaok and think hard id found out what id come aboard for plus the man was a korean like the rest of them but with the air of authority which never brushes off a naval officer his question was clearly about me his presence as a neutral bystander helped ajso to defuse the explosive potential of the situation kenryo hesitated a second then said with a feeble attempt at sociability captain mild our liaison officer he asks to be introduced mild held out his hand with a puppetlike action as if hed been trained to it and to the words he now shot out glad to know you sir like kenryo he had a slight american accent i shook hands perfunctorily j couldnt work up much enthusiasm for being buddies with anyone aboard sang a all i wanted now was to be gone but captain mild just stood there in front of mei guessed hed run out of further englishwith an odd dazed expression in his eyes as though he were trapped in a mental cage either hed been kicked around a lot or else a inch gun had gone off next to him and hed never got over the shock lend me a megaphone i asked emmermann call up my boat to come alongside good your birds and seals will be starting to miss you no one can accuse us of disturbing them added kenryo with a sneer except when that machinegun of sang as opens up i told myself except when all this mysterious gear hidden from sight goes into action except with a derisive halfsmile kenryo handed me the loudhailer satisfied his remark made me surer than ever that he was unaware i d spotted the machinegun i wouldnt be leaving sang a if hed known i didnt want to spoil things at the last moment so i didnt answer merely took the megaphone and busied myself calling up kaptein denny while i did so i was noting the deck layout and the various entrances and exits gaok drew alongside so long captain mild found two more english words he seemed to know what they meant too totsiens which means no more than au revoir i meant to be back i reboarded gaok and we headed for possession i told jutta and kaptein denny about the machinegun and echosounder in my own mind id resolved to take a closer look at sang as other concealed deck gear but didnt mention that it could wait i had other things laid on for them kaptein dennys reaction to my news was to become completely silent but jutta asked what can they be after on the ocean floor struan not a clue but if its fish its illegal and if its treasure or diamonds its doubly illegal she was still on the lost city tack she wasnt to know that i now discounted it whats leftwhere they are now i dont know i replied but the whole thing has got out of hand kaptein denny i would like you to take a message from me to the police and port captain at luderitz you can make tracks at once ill write it down so there wont be any mistake he didnt answer juttas eyes were all over my face and me id like you to go along too her eyes called me traitor not again i went once kaptein denny had given the channel one of his long quartering surveys then he said ill let you know my decision in an hour when ive had time to study the weather hells teeth i burst out weather temperament mood maintenance both of you youd think we were a crowd of kids playing cops and robbers and deciding whos going to be next to hide this is murder two men are dead there may be a third struan if we leave you alone no dice the emotional seesaw id ridden previously now came up and smacked me hard under the chin the first part of my plan had worked but the second was in danger of being sabotaged by my awn side i thought id give them a coolingoff period so i switched to a neutral topicso i thought one of their own people gave away the echosounder i told them an oddlooking guy came on to the bridge carrying the cylinder id have thought he was an exnavy type kenryo introduced him as captain miki who did you say i almost felt dennys stockwave strike me captain miki hed halfturned from the wheel and now he put in a terrific effort to pretend he was concentrating on gaoks course it meant i couldnt see what was going on in his face but his bands on the wheel gave him away the knuckles were white and the fingers tight clenched mean anything nothing but it did it changed his mood from preoccupation to reserved consternation he didnt speak again all the way back to the island and when we landed went off by himself it gave me the opportunity to speak alone to jutta we went and sat on some rocks by the bunkhouse im not sidelining you jutta im frontlining you by asking you to go to luderitz dont twist my armstruan it isnt that way why i want you to go is that you must get on the blower direct to the cinc ill give you the silvermine code number tell him whats happened say sang a is fitted with a sophisticated echosounder and is searching the seabed for something with it you dont need me to do the legwork denny can do that just as well have him tell the police what he knows they can pass it on to the cinc hell then make his own deductions about the echosounding gear no i want you to describe to the cinc dennys reactions all along the line especially after i returned from sang a he seems burned up about captain miki i mean to find out about that too hes playing a lone band jutta i cant get on to his wavelength sometimes i think that weather line of his is a bluff at other times i fall for it i just dont know the key to the man jutta said nothing but wouldnt meet my look ask the admiraltoowhether he saw captain dennys boat the day after be rescued your mother what did you say he was in the corvette vggie off possession i ex plained briefly his wartime association with convoy wv bx she was all ears i added by speaking direct to him you can give your search for your fathers identity a big boost if anyone is in a position to help you it could be the cinc by doing this for me you have a unique opportunity of getting his ear that ended her objections and her eyes were very bright as if the suns reflectlon off the sea were being mirrored in them then she knelt down impulsively and found one of the smooth whitemarblesized pebbles penguins roll to each other when courtlng she squeezed it into my palm and touched my knuckles with her lips im a stupid clotill go i wont mistrust you again but she did she and denny sailed a couple of hours later after he had come to me and announced to my surprise that the weather signs were right he was as reserved as before i didnt know whether to believe him or not nevertheless i gave him a written message for the authorities in luderitz after gaok had sailed i began to feel possessions special quality of loneliness not even sang a was in sight the island seemed as ancient and companionable as a sabretoothed tiger i hung around while it was light and at sunset sang a returned she kept well away from the lost city area and made straight for her mooring when darkness came i lit breekbouts ghost lights i rationalized my action as being a kind of tribute to the dead the fog came the wind ceased the sea boomed every time condensation splashed off the roof i thought it was a footfall i loaded the rifle after id heard the noise halfadozen times listen i told myself youd better get a grip on yourself or youll be heading the same crazy way as van rensburg it didnt help my hypteracute state of ajertness though and i went to bed with the gun by my hand i slept dressed on a hair trigger it was a real footfall outside the bunkhouse which woke me around midnight i groped for the gun set my finger to the trigger and went in a low crouch to the door i eased it open and edged out the ghost lights were a yellow reflected patch against the fog there was also a blurred human outline my bare feet made no sound i went closer the figure started to move awayback to me my pulse rate doubled it was a woman automatically i looked for the ghost hounds she didnt hear me before i was right up to her and threw my arm in a stranglehold round her throat i dragged her into the light it was jutta c h a p t e r t e n i didnt know whether to hug her or hit her since in fact id already halfscared her to deathi supported her indoors she slumped on to a stool and rubbed her throat i pity the real ghost seeing her nearly on the point of passing out did something to my heart and i found my hands were shaking lucky i didnt take a knife to you thanks for the lights struan i was lost in the fog my anger thinned you little idiot you could have fallen over a cliff broken a leganything been savaged by a bull seal even she tried to smile my throat feels just like that whered you come from auckland cove has gaok run ashore whats happened wheres kaptein denny is he safe hes okay hes on his way on his way i talked him into putting me ashore we waited till dark he dropped me off on the other side of the island i walked then i spotted the ghost light shed startedwith reaction to shake like a wet dog youre cold scared too ill fix some coffee struan it can keep i blew up the embers and we sat on stools in front of the fire you must have done a lot of tajking kaptein dennys not an easy subject to persuade and what about the chance youve thrown overboard the chance to learn about your father she spoke into the coffee mug shed cupped between her hands cant you see why i came back the whole point of sending you to luderitz was for you to explain the situation personally to the admiral your shortcircuit blows the fuses on my plan she went on as if she hadnt heard me it probably sounds wet you we didnt look at each other for individual reactions we simply sat and stared into the fire for a long time finally i said if its going to be a rough party with sang a id rather not have a woman around she got up and stood behind me she pressed against me so that i could feel her breasts and belly against my back she rested her throat on my head so that when she spoke softly as if to herself i still got the words because it had the effect of a throat microphone it was as intimate too she locked a wrist round my neck a sort of caressing affectionate imitation of my stranglehold on her earlier if youd broken my neck out there id have died happy thinking youd be glad id come im glad but im mad all glad is what i want i pulled her round to kiss her but she fought me off heart firing blanks again jutta she slipped out of my grasp and went round behind me again this time she ran her fingers over my lips and nose and eyes im not at the firing stage struan im loading up i dont know with what shot or blanks could be either but you came back i came back if you dont know who does ask the bridge of magpies that was the answer of course she stroked my head and i could feel her breasts against my back i wanted to lose myself for ever in the valley be tween themdown down down after that there wasnt much more to say but there was a lot to think i lay awake through the small hours wondering whether i wasnt the biggest sucker ever sleeping almost next to a woman i was more than half in love with and doing absolutely nothing about it mystics they say keep virgins in their beds im low on mysticism myself i wished i could hear her breathing but i couldnt because of the grumbles of the gannets and penguins close to the bunkhouse the ghost lights still burned because jutta thought them beautiful i tried to sort out my feelings towards her and also to unravel the kaptein dennysang aumo tangle as well as that of the sound of guns wed heard that other night but i got nowhere in the end i gave it up and fell asleep the next day was a saturday because the pressure was offit would be at least twentyfour hours before the frigate arrived provided kaptein denny made average timethere was a purposeless air about the day it was warm windless with a few catspaws on the surface of the channel nothing could be seen of sang a before midmorning because of early fog we rose late and i fixed the trouble with ichabos engine a faulty injector then we went down to the landing and rubbernecked at the birds and at a group of cute seal pups that came sporting round the jetty neither of us knew how to handle our situation of emotional hiccoughs jutta was very serious and sweet to begin with and then gay and sweet when the seaj pups cavorted about we idled but it wasnt the same as during the storm in alabama cove when we had tried to sink ourselves in chores about the cutter we were on the way to being in loveand we both knew it there was nothing idle or purposeless about sang a when the fog lifted three or four boats were darting in and out from her side like jackals snooping at a kill there was also a lot of activity on deck through my binoculars i could make out the crew working winches and arranging heavy chains and cables those tarpaulins were still firmly in place however maybe theyve discovered an outcrop of the lost city struan i strung along with her theyre a long way from doodenstadt but its shallow where sang a isnot more than fifty feet perhaps the lost city was overwhelmed and submerged at some time in the past and most of it is now beneath the channel could be kochs cave was supposed to be halfin and halfout of the sea they must be pretty sure about it to have come here with all that expensive and elaborate equipment too elaborate and too expensive altogether i reminded myself but i couldnt tell her that relicrobbers are professionals these daysmake no mistake i replied as convincingly as i could ive seen them at work in the aegean i once got caught up in a shooting off the turkish coast where theyd looted an underwater town maybe the same things going on here and youre all that stands between them and whatever theyre after i mean to find out what that istoday struandont stick your neck out please i was sent here to do a job i shall go on doing it until the frigate takes over if meanwhile i can find proof about sang a so much the better for my sake im going to throw a firecracker right into that black elephants trunk im boarding her tonight secret recce objectives one equipment under tarpaulins two electronics shack theyll kill you if they catch you ill see that they dont im coming too not on your life i came backto be with you isnt that enough it wasnt after the night before i told herhoweverthat she could be of very real help in ferrying me to within boarding distance of sang a ill swim the last bit i added you can pick me up on the way back i could lose my way in the fog otherwise well fix a pickup signal right that pleased her and the day didnt seem too long as we sat on the rocks and watched sang as activities the launches darted about purposefully at firstand we could almost sense the crews expectancy but after a time interest appeared to flag finally the launches gave up and the ship itself came into the picture she upanchored and made several runs in different directions in the vicinity of the area in which the boats bad been working it became clear to me that she wasnt using the type of echosounder id been accustomed to because each time she all but reached the spot indicated by the launches she would sheer off to one side this manoeuvre was repeated several times and totajly mystified me the picture as i saw it was that the launches sweep had snagged on a promising oceanbed object and sang as passes were intended to plot it why then veer away just when it was reached perhaps the electronics shack would provide the answer sang as crew knew we were watching them canvas dodgers were rigged on light stanchions on her rails further to mask the tarpaulined objects several times i caught kenryo and emmermann studying us through binoculars sang a kept it up all day the weather was glorious and i was content just to sit there with jutta by the late afternoon the fog bank had started rolling in from the sea sang a used her radar to continue with her plotting runs i got up and stretched thats it ill have the wraps off her after darkboth literally and figuratively i hope what do you hope to find ampman catchascatchcan its a tossup whether i go for the shack or the tarpaulins first depends you were going to teach me to row with muffled oars i checked the channel fine sang a cant see what were doing any more come down to the jetty when it came to the point the drill wasnt necessary either sang a regarded saturday night as party night or else they had some other reason to celebrate because shortly after dark boozy sounds started to float across the water pinpointing her position was thus no problem i made do with black shorts and jersey though i would have preferred a rubber suit i made sure i had a knife for the tarpaulin lashings the rifle i would leave behind in the dinghy with jutta jutta became more and more edgy as the deadline approached when finally we were at the jetty and almost ready to board the dinghy she exclaimed youll need a torch ill get one she doubled off into the fog before i had time to protest that a torch was the last thing id require my arms were full and i offloaded my things into the boat by that time jutta was overdueit was only a short distance to the bunkhouse irritated at the delay i climbed up the iron ladder to the top of the jetty she wasnt around i went to the bunkhouse it was empty i started back towards the cottage with a feeling of uneasiness id almost reached it when there was a chatter from the birds and jutta came hurrying down the path torch in hand struan she was breathing heavily as lf shed been running where the devil have you been i lost myself in the fog i went the wrong way uphill with the bunkhouse lights to guide you i couldnt see im sorry i heard you coming it was an unconvincing performance and killed the fun approach to the sang a escapade wed had all day lets go i snapped weve wasted enough time as it is we made our way in silence to the jetty and shoved off still without speaking we could safely have whispered but i chose not to whispers are for someone very closeand she was very far away from me that night just an outline crouched in the boats stern wed only gone a little way when i thought i heard the sound of a distant engine i couldnt be sure fog plays all kinds of tricks i shipped the oars we waited a long time nothing came we went on then there was another long wait when a sound like the wash of a bowwavepossibly oarscame through the darkness the night seemed full of presences again it proved to be nothing tangible soon we were close enough to make out the loom of sang a s portholesa series of bright circles in the murkthough her decks were in darkness i shipped the oars checked my knife and got ready to go jutta sat silent an amorphous silhouette not a woman it was better that way but i couldnt just slip over the side without a word j whispered fire when you see the whites of their eyes make sure theyre not mine that was mean i meant it to be i went over the sidethe water wasnt as cold as id expected i hung on to the side for a second my face level with the gunnel she crouched down to me take care of yourself darling id already let go and had given myself a push to get clear of the boat jutta had become a dim ghost before id taken in what shed said all the way out id been spoiling for an encounter with one or more of sang as toughies to work off the roil inside me now i had to stop myself from going soft i deliberately shut out jutta and concentrated on the job ahead the sang a crowd were certainly beating it up there were whoops and shouts and laughter and the occasional thump several launches and dinghies were tied up alongside her and it was as easy as going up stairs to find my way to the deck i couldnt see overmuch because the decks were so dim so i used one of the big chains as a guide following it until j came to the big seventon anchor shackled to its end i decided to investigate the electronlcs shack first because it was less exposed than the deck and the racket below provided me with my maximum opportunity for indoor reconnaissance i headed at low crouch for the shack my bare feet silent on the planks the shack hadnt a deck door and its portholes were blacked out there was howevera gleam of light through a roof skylight i shinned up the stern mast ratlinesthey were only a few feet away from the shack and dropped down catlike on the roof it took only a moment to force the skylight with my knife and slip in the light wasnt coming from the shack itself but from a door a little ajar which led to the tweendecks below i hung by my hands from the sill and the soles of my feet touched one of the big electronics consoles i detected lettering i dropped down and readtransit sonarkelvin hughes now a transit sonar is a sophisticated instrumentbig brother to the echosounder which has nothing to do with fish but is employed almost exclusively for salvage work and kelvin hughes is a wellknown manufacturer pieces of the jigsaw fell rapidly into place sang a had made those odd directional approaches to the launch area because a transit sonar doesnt throw a straight upanddown pulsed echo wave like an echosounder but instead an inverted vshaped beam offset to one side of the ship so sang a had to make her runs to one side to obtain a trace of whatever she was after the size depth and position of an underwater object is plotted automatically on graph paperas on the cylinder captain mild had handed kenryo the other instruments were conventional asdic echo sounder radar and electronic navigational gear my discovery of the transit sonar also blew the secret of that heavy gear on deck the powerful derricks and threesheaved tackles they were for salvage peaceful salvagethough that didnt explain the mounted machinegun the armoured hose was an airlift used for clearing mud round a wreck on the seabed there was so much racket coming from beyond the door that i didnt have to move about too cautiously i decided also to have a looksee at the party the door led to an exceptionajly long cabin stretching the entire width of the ship which appeared to be used as a general mess room tables and chairs were stacked against the walls and there was a thick carpet on the deck the air was rancid with the sweatsmell of active men the whole crewabout twentyseemed as high as a moon probe it must have taken some exotic eastern drug to have sent them on a trip like thatan einstein the hippies call it way out and beyond the farthest stars they were all wearing loose things like karate gowns and were lamming into one another with long wooden staves and yelling bloody murder as they did so some leapt high into the air like dervishes then at a whistle signalthe melee sorted itself into groups like a possessed ballet chorus first of six men then four and finally two all shouting and bashing eventually all but one pair fell back against the walls sweating and stamping kenryo was one of the two remaining in the ring he and the other korean circled one another like wrestlers looking for an opening kenryos opponent lashed out suddenly at his legs but kenryo sidestepped the blow with a verticaj takeoff and from shoulder height hit the other man a vicious crack across the forehead kenryos man wasnt out but he was as near to it as anyone could be after a haymaker like that he stood dazed and swaying unfortunately for him the queensberry rules werent in operation and he couldnt make for a neutral corner the mob shouted like madmen kenryo swung his stave with both hands into the others left side near the heart that finished him he started to sag and kenryo went up and kicked him in the testicles he went down screaming with pain kenryo kicked him again then the spectators were all over both men and chaired off kenryo shoulderhigh the only two who didnt seem to be having fun were emmermann and captain mikiwho stood together on the sidelines mikis remote air was apparent to me even at that distance i took a firm grip of my knife and got out i shot through the skylight down the ratlines and on to the deck there was some faint illumination by virtue of the portholes reflection off the fog curtain i started to head towards the bow of the ship where the machinegun was but where i stood still aft was an intriguing bulky object concealed under a large tarpaulin another weapon i cut loose the lashings underneath was a long cylindrical metal object about eight feet long and three in diameterwith a large yellow painted on its conical top it was a salvage mooring buoy they are generally numbered in sixes according to the type of mooring to be laid down then i went for a bundle wrapped in black plasticnext to the buoy and ripped it open it contained a stack of fourinch metal tubes of varying lengthsome over a dozen feet and some as little as three i started to explore by touch and my fingers came upon a gnarled surface at the end of one of the tubes i froze i knew what id struck special underwater explosive charges designed to blow open wrecks i d seen navy specialists using them what i was fingering was an adjustable sensitive membrane which explodes the device by water pressure there was enough high explosive in the stack to blow sang a on to the top of the bridge of magpies i decided to go for the gun forard before leaving i selected the smallest tube j could find souvenirs have their uses the tiny burn on the nape of my neck felt like a hypodermic needle at the same instant a cold circle of steel pressed under my left ear pistol muzzles have their own special sort of caress you dont forget in a hurry the man probably the anchorwatchwas standing over me with a longrazorsharp knife that had nicked me like a cats claw ripping a captive mouse for fun i kept so still that i didnt even unclasp my hands from the bomb but my upward view took in in succession the guards bare feet dark baggy pants heavy shortarmed body black leather jacket and balaclavaencased head he brought his knife against my other ear so that the two weapons made a pincer on either side of my head any movement of mine would have telegraphed itself immediately to him he was a professional and as wary as a panther he stood far back enough to prevent my sideswiping his legs but close enough to retain full command over me he made a gesture with the pistol which i misinterpreted until he reinforced it with the knife i thought he wanted me upback to him i reckoned he was mad to let me hang on to the bomb then he gestured again he was showing me over the side i couldnt believe it but i had no intention of inviting knifethrust or bullet so i mimed my query he gestured back impatiently i was to go not crediting my lucki clambered on to the rail and paused he was standing there a dim grim masked figure with a weapon in each hand i lowered myself overboard i swam clear of sang a and orientated myself on the dinghy in reaction to the last few minutes events i found myself treading water trying to get control of my arms and legs and at the same time keep hold of that bomb with its pressuresensitive mechanism if it sank it would explode right under me according to my waterproof watch i was early for our rendezvous so after id recovered i swam slowly the pickup signal was the lowpitched sound obtained by blowing in an empty cartridge case wed decided it wouldnt carry far and was sufficiently like the prevalent birdnoises to escape attention all at once the underside of the fog curtain took on a strange silverblue colour the sea around me became as silver as a young salmon i raised an arm it dripped luminosity my fisheye view of the channel was necessarily limited but i guessed that the whole of its surface was being lighted up by a multitude of minute firebearing creatures that were being swept in by the current from the south the fog made a lowceilinged black dome above the seas silver shield it was pleasant to admire but no good for escape i struck out strongly and swiftly then i heard juttas signal ahead and to one side i gave a cautious whistle back and then spotted a beautiful luminous arc of watery fire riling from an oar as jutta began to row in a moment i was alongside juttas face didnt look vely in the weird light but dead and colourless like a materialized spirit at a seance maybe i appeared lovely coming over the side trailing phosphorescence but i was too anxious to get away to care about the personal beauty stakes pitched the bomb in the bottom of the boat without explanation or greeting grabbed the oars and begun to scull we hadnt gone far when the world went black the silver magic vanished at any other time i might have regretted it i guessed we had broken out of the lightgiving mainstream coming upchannel and must accordingly be quite close to possessions cliffs we were it wasnt long before we heard the wash of breakers we were well to the south of the jetty of course so i followed the coastline by the sound of the breakers to portand after what seemed an endless row came at last to the landingplace jutta and i hadnt exchanged one word all the times i s till couldnt be close to her with that torch business eating me in spite of her parting words the torch itself lay next to the bomb on the bottomboards we both shunned it as though it were a black mamba i led the way to the bunkhouse and after id changed joined her at the fire for food and coffee she started the ball rolling in a neutral voice she said i ve never seen anything so lovely as that sea struan i expectedany momentto be shot at her eyes seemed to find lots of places to look at in the fire they never met mine i said i had a bummer of a trip i described what i had found in the shack on the deck the sadistic scene in the mess my incredible letoff search me why he didnt make a killing id written myself off as a goner what did he say her voice was strained and apprehensive nothing i saw nothing either he had the cap pulled right down over his face thank god for him l her relief still didnt bridge the gap between us why that guntoting bruiser didnt turn me in ill never know i sat waiting in the fog for a hundred years she was givingme all the openings but i couldnt take them dont start throwing your hat in the air yet i replied brusquely i cant imagine hell go on keeping his mouth shut about me he may have to to save his own skin we might have been light years away judging by the lack of warmth between us anyway im going to beat him to the chequered flag lomorrow i said i think i know now what sang a is up to c h a p t e r e l e v e n what we saw spread oul round sang a next day underscored my discoveries of the previous night the salvage part at least it was a sixpointed pattern of cables and chains stretching out about half a mile to the main points of the compass with the black ship in the centre it resembled a gigantic spoked wheel on the seas surfacewith sang a as its hub halfadozen moorings had been made ready and numbered buoys were in positiona typical preliminary salvage layout it had all been done some time before the fog lifted the sang a crowd had certainly sweated out their hangovers echoes of the previous night hung a little drearily on the morning air between jutta and me id tried to fling away the thought of her possible duplicity but the nagging suspicion of the torch affair still stuck she stared at sang a and across the channel to where the city of baroda lay i couldnt fathom the expression in her eyes she said my search is snowballing into something far beyond what it originally was im scared for the future i repliedto reassure her not to convince myself there are too many ghosts around those salvage preparations are a complete giveaway the frigate will be along any time now and that will be that she didnt answer the sunlit anchorage seemed so peaceful even the day was unnatural in its continued calm it was hard to credit the other side of the sang a coin why go then why not wait i might have found a reply of sorts before last night now i shrugged im going aboard sang a stay if you wish never we left it at that i rowed us out in the dinghy to sang a her boats were fussing about some of the crew stood at the rails watching us approach their dull sullen fares so similar that i couldnt pick out individuals if i hadnt seen them going to town the night before i couldnt have credited what a bunch of rowdies they could be we made fast emmermann and kenryo were on the catwalk awaiting us even less than before did i like the look of sang as number one hatchet man the whites of his eyes werent white but murky yellow ive been expecting you all morning captain weddell emmermann smiled sarcastically it would be unlike a gogetting headman to stand aside from this he indicated the preparations thats what ive come about salvage is no doubt within the province of island headmen also dont beat about the bush emmermann you know damn well you cant undertake salvage operations here so now kenryo regarded me with his glum face and dirty eyes i wanted to give a medal to the guy whod smashed his nose now that i was near him i smelt the acrid odour of stale sweat and burnedout drugs i wondered how good hed be for a fight without a drag but emmermann wasnt out for trouble please to come to the chartroom j would like you to examine our legal papers they dont need vetting rasped kenryo emmermann ajmost apologized for him our informationwas that we would find a more ah accommodating headman on possession i directed my reply to kenryo there was hes gone he granduated to mainlining they usually start soft kenryos yellow skin had a sort of dulloily gloss on itand he didnt have jaundice he spat over the side so a persisted emmermann dope boozethats possession he smiled indulgently at jutta i have some of the latter inside we will use it for less serious purposes than the incumbents of possession in the chartroom he produced a bottle of schnapps and three glasses kenryo wasnt included maybe he didnt want to overburden himself with vices gesundheit i raised my glass to emmermann wondering where all this sp urious bonhomie was leading to emmermann kept it up documents you shall see we have plenty be specific i replied tell me what youre after i know most of the wrecks around here maridahl nautilus lovely amanda black princeand auckland on the other side none of thems worth a packet of matches all oldies as the jargon has it but emmermanns next words snapped jutta out of her aloof and detached mood no captain weddell were searching for a submarine that aas lost here during the war the u emmermann missed her reaction because hed risen to open a wall safe but kenryo didnt his eyes narrowed as hers came alight and bright colour rushed into her cheeks he must have used a good brand of dopeto be so alert the morning after emmermann thumped down a wad of documents in front of me if they were calculated to impress they did parchment stamped watermarked letterheaded scripted with red seals and ribbon a couple of the documents were in oriental writing which i imagined to be korean it looked good and convincing i couldnt read a word right i said youve done your homework but as far as im concerned this is so much bumff these are sperrgebiet territorial waters you cant operate here without authority i cant find that authority among these i indicated the pile of documents he pointed to a particularly impressivelooking one which sported a coatofarms and droplettered gothic capitals am authorized by the german ministry of marine to salvage any metals machinery fitments and tools from u in consideration of the sum fine fine i broke in im not a maritime court i have no discretion you can argue with the fisheries frigate shell be here at any moment how dye know if your radios out of operation de manded kenryo emmermanns temper showed through his smooth social facade enabling me to sidestep kenryos punch question it may interest you to know that at dawn today the frigate was two hundred miles away at the northern end of her patrol beat that knocked me it meant denny hadnt sent my signal or if he had the warship couldnt possibly be at possession by that day it also revealed something equally disquieting sang a was monitoring the frigates movements emmerman realized that at the drop of a hat kenryo and i would be at each others throats he said in a conciliatory way thats as may be the important matter is that u was sunk in the possession channel during the war she wasnt sunk juttas reserved mood had now completely dissipatedlike the fog she was alert and animated up to then neither emmermann nor kenryo had regarded her as being in their league they probably thought she provided me with possessions only distraction her words poured out u first sank the city of baroda she then sank the frigate which pursued her the last that was heard from her was that she was making for the open sea she was badly damaged and losing oil but she was afloat there was somethingmore imagined than reaj perhapsbehind kenryos eyes i didnt care for he spoke rapidly to emmermann all their attention switched away from me i wanted to yell at jutta to stop emmermanns restraint was obvious you are informed about u how strange for a woman no that part of it doesnt matter i know however that captain schlebusch fired a spread of four torpedoes at the city of baroda and then used the uboats two stern tubes against the warship he got her too kenryos voice had a dull flat note like a counterfeit coins dud ring u sank she is he thumped a heel on the floorboards right under us at this moment we have located her thats what the buoys are for added emmermann nor exclaimed jutta no youre wrong she got away she yes she had the sense at least not to reply to that bit of emmermanns prodding i tried again to signal her to play it cool but she was being driven along by some inner compulsion when she hesitated emmermann repeated she is here right under sang a transit sonar i jibed he looked startled but let it pass he was far too interested in jutta he found a lead weight in the safe and brought it for her to inspect sounding lead he explained look look at what came up from the wreck below mixed in with the typical sand and shell of the channel floor were some red and grey flakes paint red lead underneath with grey above it uboat grey no j said british naval grey gousblom emmermann and kenryos attention switched back to jutta when she added her magazine blew up its she youve located not u so now so now they were only four short words from emmermann but they said everything kenryo addressed jutta with the controlled menace of a panther stalking you are extremely knowledgeable about naval matters emmermann helped himself to some more schnapps would you know what u was carrying a couple of prototype torpedoes samples of new explosives the latest countermeasures to allied submarine devices a nazi agent she had them riveted if she went on theyd never let us off the ship so i brushed aside the rest of what she had say technically all of it was old hat within a year nothing thats worth salvaging in this day and age her phosphorbronze torpedo tubes are worth apiece at todays prices replied emmermann she had six six hundred quid that wouldnt even pay our way for a couple of days its ajso peanuts compared with your outlay emmermann looked across at kenryo for the goahead got it captain weddell we are men of the world if i told you hat umo was carrying something whichif you choose to cooperatecould help you to be comfortable for the rest of your life would you believe me if youre going to say she had aboard captains kidds treasure or the alabamas gold or a trunkload of diamonds you can keep it its just another sperrgebiet yarn when the lights are low and the brandy goes round you are sensible not to be gullible no u was carrying two hundred tons of liquid mercury as ballast in canisters attached to her keel so what in the early days of the war mercury was dirt cheap cheap enough to be ideal ballast germany bought a lot from mexico at bargain basement prices today he let the rest of the sentence hang kenryo compleled it at todays prices two hundred tons of mercury is worth over a million dollars taxfree he gave a tightlipped grin with your cooperation see here captain weddell emmermann punched home the offer were not asking you to do anything anything you understand all you have to do is to sit and watch us from possessionif you want to watch if you agree in principle we can discuss terms we will be generousi assure you he turned to jutta you have information about u information is also a saleable commodity for example if we knew more details of the action in the channel we could plot us firing angles we could obtain transits that in itself by narrowing down possible areas would be worth thousands of dollars of search time something had come over jutta since theyd started their talk about buying us shed been all fired up at the startunstoppable almost now shed gone cold i i need time to think kenryo spotted the change in her too all i wanted was to get away i rose to my feet well talk it over i was nearly thrown to the floor sang a shimmied under a hammerblow concussion from outside i felt as if someone had tapped me on the head with a rubber truncheon and at the same time thumped me in the diaphragm there was a white photoflash of light across the cabin my ears reeled we threw ourselves at the portholes a few hundred yards away a geyserspout of waterit had a dirtycurly black top like a giant ostrich featherstood up higher than sang as stack one of the boats that had been fussing about was tumbling sideways out of the messmen and timber falling in all directions christ i exclaimed theyve tripped one of us old mines they had indeed with that wire sweep of theirs we rushed on deck emmermann and kenryo shouting orders theyd forgotten us amid the general uproar beat it i said to jutta nows our chance we slipped over the side and sneaked away in the dinghy towards possession wed gone nearly halfway when jutta suddenly exclaimed struan u didnt have mercury ballast she was built too late she was a class ixc boat mercury ballast was confined to earlier types c h a p t e r t w e l v e i rested on my oars its the chopper jutta i dont understand youve put a short fuse under us any moment the powder keg will explode we couldnt be more vulnerable what i said back there what you said you went up like that old mine yourself i couldnt stop myself everything came bunting out when they brought up the subject of u youre the best strike theyve made since they hit the bridge of magpies dont imagine they wont be following it up j only said you showed you were loaded with enough information to make a salvage mans tongue hang out you didnt only hintyou positively shouted itthat there was a packet more where it came from i cant see how a harmless tape recording harmless i listen sound travels at five thousand feet a second in seawater all you have to do is put a stopwatch on that tape and its a piece of cake lo plot exactly where within a given radius u fired from then theres a uboat coxswains firing countdown perfect check datum point listen to captain schlebuschs orders coursespeed changes the lot plot em allow for his da during the attacks thats a firing angle layoff and mark it down our stopwatch man now has a chart full of points and intersecting linestransits join em up and voila there youll find u need i say more u got away her voice was small but emphatic maybe maybe not it flashed through my mind even as i said it that had she escaped the cinc wouldnt have sent me to investigate because the uboat seemed to be the kingpin of the whole business our immediate problemits almost superfluous to say so is that emmermann and kenryo will come after us for what you they dont know about the tape and i dont intend that they shall we could drive a bargain with the tape be your age jutta theres not only harassment in the sang a plpeline what they cant buy theyll beat out of you that tape could sign your our death warrants if they got wind of it i still think you want to get your perspectives clear once they have it we become expendable of no more use to them theyll have got all the information they need emmermann and kenryo are after something big its not a million in mercury we have your assurance for that and a millions big they know u wasnt carrying mercury you dont launch a salvage project of sang as magnitude without first checking your target theres nothing secret any longer about class ixc uboat plans what theyre after is big enough for two men to have been killed already another coupleyou and iwouldnt make any difference and mounted machineguns are capable of killing plenty more i reminded myself youve let kaptein denny off the hook i see no my guess is that hes on to u from a different angle somehow the winter weather governs his operations jf hes come fishing here for thirty years id say hes been busy netting enough lolly every time to sit for the rest of the year with his bum in butter he knows jutta there wasnt anything aboard u struan nothing i ve checked and checked nothing at all its too late now to bring that up with emmermann and kenryo the longer you say that the longer theyll try to wring out of you what you didnt really know in the first place and judging from what ive seen of their party manners it wont be a pretty operation wheres the tape aboard ichabo then were going aboard to gel rid of itnow the cutter will be a natural for them to search you cant dump it overboard struan i agree its too valuable well stash it away the best hidingplace is always under the light of course theyll search the huts once were gone clone once weve shed that tape were hightailing it out of here in ichabo provided they dont get here first well make a break for the inshore shoals beyond elizabeth point where we can still be within striking range and can spot the frigate when she arrives they cant pursue us there in a big vessel like sang a and their launches havent the range but the tape struan into a penguin rookery safe as the bank of england theyll never think to look there i took the oars and we streaked for ichabo it took jutta only a moment to bring the tape from the cabin once id got ajongside then j pulled for the island jetty i made good time because of the calm sea that sea worried me possession weather should be sour not sweet something was brewing there was a sultriness about that rasped the temper the waves slopped like bath water against the piers of the jetty activily round sang a was dying down that in itself spurred me on we sprinted up the concrete path past the bunkhouse to the high ground near the cottage over the skyline we were out of sang as range of vision when we veered off the path into the breedingflats every bird and penguin seemed to join in resisting our invasion of their territory i secreted the tape away under a big rock while jutta using the rifle barrel fended off the attackers when they tried to slash at our ankles their protests were deafening that was the reason for our not hearing sang as launches we spotted them though the moment we crossed the rimrock of the skyline i pulled jutta down beside me on the path took one launch was almost up to ichabo the other was already alongside the jetty corning along it at the double fanned out in attack order were halfadozen of sang as crew led by kenryo some had submachineguns slung at the hip others automatic rifles one way and another sang a certainly packed a lot of firepower i loosened the safety catch of the rifle with my thumband signalled jutta to crawl towards the cottage for cover i wasnt quick enough someone gave a shout i caught a glimpse of fireflashes lancing from muzzles and sunlight glancing off a cascade of spent brass hulls and heard the spatspat of automatic fire at the same time the birds uproar doubled as bursts tore into them i rolled sideways to join jutta keep your head down roll behind the cottage i loosed off a shot at random as i dived away there wasnt time to aim but i heard a ricochet and a yell of pain from one of kenryos men then we were behind the cover of a stone wall encircling the cottage i heard orders shouted probably by kenryo and a concentrated burst of fire spattered and chipped the cottages stone chimney i put my arm round juttas shoulders theyre not trying look where theyre firinghigh and wide they want usalive juttas voice was choky damn sure were no use to them dead more bullets clattered and whined off the chimney and walls but i noticed they left the windows alone maybe they thought we were inside i eased myself into a better position to see what was going on juttas fingers clamped on my arm she gave a soft gurgle and the edges of her lips twitched for a moment i thought shed been hit until i followed her terrorstricken eyes to the rocky highpoint wed crossed kenryo was standing there holding on us one of those deadly snapcollapse weapons which street snipers love it was a stubbybarrelled thing that could be stripped down to pocketsized parts and reassembled in seconds a thugs weapon for a thug it wasnt the only thought of mine to beat the speed of light j tossed my rifle from me that weapon of kenryos could cut a man in half before he got to opening the breech for his second shot up we got up kenryo shouted and we heard heavy feet thudding up the path in a moment we were surrounded by men pointing either submachineguns or automatic rifles at us they were a mixture of ppshs and aksall russian i tried making my tone incredulous and outraged what the hell are you playing at leave it alone kenryo snapped we want you weve got you rather be leered at jutla you jutta imitated my line you might have killed us not a chance we know what were doing forget it what concerns you more is the future the more you have to tell us the less youll get hurt a million in mercury i scoffed how to win friends and influence people shut up youll both tell everything before ive finished with you i found my breath coming quickly and jerkily and felt a bead of sweat run all the length of my spine from neck to coccyx i was afraid for jutta nervous compulsion made me speak weve nothing to hide ill see you answer for this when the frigate arrives he banged me lightly on the chest with the barrel of his nasty little automatic that frigate is as far away as she ever was nowwheres your kit in the bunkhouse mainly some in the cottage he gave an other and a couple of men left the group and went off to search i guessed ichabo was being ransacked too get moving we had no choice we walked down to the jetty kenryo and the others covering us he motioned us into the launch i was glad to see jutta looking more angry than scared when we came close to sang a kenryo slowed the launchthen stopped altogether a diver was being lowered over the side he stood for a moment in his heavy helmet and spacemanlike suit before giving the thumbsup signal and disappearing into the water in a stream of air bubbles kenryo indicated the air lifeline compressed air i eyed him speculatively kenryo wasnt the type to dwell on modem marine marvels know thats for him there may be some for you what dye mean he answered as conversationally as his rather stilted way of talking permitted he gave the impression of transmitting mentally before committing himself to english he might have been describing a diving technicality hes going down about fifty feet that means the water pressure on him will be aboul forty pounds to the square inch of course the compressor is designed to cope with that so what j imagine the same thing inside a man i cant youd be surprised to see how a little compression up the rectum will make a man talk id been right about him that first time a soda murder ous sod women talk sooner theyve got more inlet valves he relished juttas silent shock reaction i sized him up hed take some beating i reckoned he was stripped down to a towelling tshirt because of the warmthand his chest and arm muscles bulged i knew what he was capable of in action when a derrick swung out one of the tubelike explosive charges and started to lower it into the water kenryo went onthere goes your luck soon we will blow off a piece of plating from the wreck for identification jf its the uboat youre in the clear if not he shrugged the launch negotiated the complex of mooring cables and made fast there was no sign of emmernann we were escorted below through the long messroom and past the sonar shack door to two cells over the screws which faced each other across a narrow passageway kenryo locked the grilled doors and left an armed guard behind it wouldnt have been too bad except for the stifling heat perhaps this was the unusual weather which was part of kaptein dennys plan of operations id written him off as a twotimer whod run away to save his own skin and had no intention of getting my signal away wed been brought aboard sang a about midday and all afternoon the tweendecks grew more suffocating theyd also screwed the portholes closed we could see out of course we werent sure whether the guard understood englishso we stuck to commonplaces wed been in the cells about an hour when there was a sharp crack as if the hull had been tapped with an outsize hammer underwater bomb j reassured jutta theyre working on the wreck then it struck me what had happened to the small one i d filched from the pile on deck id left it lying in our dinghy under one of the thwarts had the very obviousness of its position caused it to be overlooked kenryo had not mentioned it theres nothing to see struan jutta from her porthole could watch what was going on but i couldnt because i faced the mainland after that the a neverending afternoon was punctuated by sharp cracks and long silences as fresh charges were lowered and manoeuvred into position then detonated best weather in the world for salvage i said to jutta it didnt make any difference whether the sentry understood or nothow long will it go on struan not long theres an upwell cell starting to build up i explained the phenomenon to her it always begins with this type of impossible hot weather it brings the east wind off the desert ive known it on occasion be a hundred degrees ten miles out to sea this place is a sweat box already itll become worse the fog gets thicker too warm air on icy water tomorrow will be a humdinger it all sounds very complex not really theres the buildup then the actual process of the upwell cell lasts a few days once the desert wind gets going however everything seems to take wingsand sea the lot struan what is it theyre bringing something up out of the sea i craned to try and see through her porthole but couldnt the guard eyed me sourly whatjutta what its a chunk of metal ragged covered in seaweed and stuff colour black rusty she was very excited now its gone theyve lifted it aboard we both knew how much depended on that undistinguished piece of decaying metal the thought killed my weather chat there were no more underwater explosions the after noon dragged on the cells became hotter towards sunset little puffs of wind started nibbling at the crests of the dunes an east wind a desert wind it also became darker earlier than usualbecause the fog was thicker the guard switched on a naked light in the corridor the glass of my porthole was opaque with heavy condensation the ship began to tug a little at her moorings upwell cell symptoms were beginning to show it became still hotter i stripped off my shirt and shoes the guards face glistened with sweatthe place was like a sauna bath food was brought in but we felt too hot to eat it the best part of the meal was some iced slightly scented tea then kenryo appeared with two more guards and they took jutta away all their armament seemed absurd for one strained wan girl i tried to help her morale before she left i said to kenryo youll know what a cells like in this heat tomorrow a warships cell save your breath he retorted in his unpleasant voice no warship is coming to rescue you i was afraid he was right he wouldnt have been so cocksure if they hadnt been keeping tabs on her movements jutta was away for over an hour i forced myself lo lie on my bunk i dont know if my nightmare of what i imagined they were doing to her would have been less if id chosen any other way to wait i couldnt stop the pictures of the torturecell the same sort of shadeless bulb blazing in juttas eyes as hung above me her sitting there naked at a table with her arms clamped and two copper claws fixed to each nipple and the electric current shooting her mouth gaping wide and screaming every time they fired the switch and kenryo was there and the compressor tube was between her legs probing like an obscene penis i was at the bars then yelling obscenities and every foulness i knew at the guard and clawing at the steel he crashed the stock of his gun over and over against my fingers to make me let go but it wasnt until he worked the lock of his automatic into a firing position that i sobered up enough to stop it then it was all over because she was at the end of the passageway between kenryo and the guards coming back to her cell and smiling a little uncertainly at me but still there alive and herself not a naked torso taped with electrodes kenryo locked her in and the guard told him about me he said nothing only scowled at me it was a good thing the man hadnt understood what id called him then all of than went leaving a new sentry jutta said you look as if youd just seen dracula a roomful of them poor love that made it right all right all the gnawing doubts over the torch business too the light was too harsh for me to read the messages in her eyes thank god v poor love i got a grip on myself was it bad not really they called it an interview in the chartroom the same routine as before drinks the iron fist in the velvet glove more iron this time all my muscles felt as though theyd been stretched and let go and were trying to find their way back to normal i sat down jutta glanced inquiringly at the guard his pal didnt react to my focsle language ill try some on him and see if he understands i gave him a volleybrief because of juttabut he simply stared owlishly at me fine now tell me what happened firstof course they pressed me about how i came to know so much about u i said id been researching on behalf of a writer who was doing a book on uboats which had disappeared without trace during the war did they fall for that to begin with emmermann was persuaded when j came up with the answer to a question of his regarding the difference between german and british operating methods a uboat captain never stood at the periscope like his british counterpart but sat on a kind of saddle affair i lost ground though when they demanded to know what i was doing alone in a place like possession howd i got hare where was my author i said hed been delayed through illness in britain but would be along shortly i made up a name and address they were even more insistent about you not the headman type too right i said you were an alcoholic whod been kicked out of the navy and were in the process of rehabilitating yourself it could have been true once that got by just not a hint about the tape no they found nothing to implicate us either at the bunkhouse or on board ichabo good our prospects grow brighter every minute make no mistakestruan emmermann is extremely clued up he fumbles on the details of us action but he has the general outline spoton what about that section of plating they recovered gousbloms hence the interview theyre pulling out from this area tomorrow and starting a fresh search in the channel emmermanns sold on the channel i asked absolutely but youre not no struan never have been i cant back up my hunch i m just not the tape would be worth its weight in gold to them every question seemed like a trap it was nerve racking but ill keep stringing them along next morning however when kenryo appeared grimfacedat the cell doors i thought shed fallen into their trap until he explained these cells are bugged of course we recorded your confidential chat last night we deliberately put a man on guard who didnt understand english in the hope that youd be lulled into feeling safe and open up you did he didnt wait for us to try and talk our way out of it the tapewhere is it neither of us replied then he tossed through the bars of my cell a garment hed been carrying it was made of leather like a pair of tyrolean pants with braces put that on over your trousers take off your shirt that was no hardship because it was warm already all night the searing wind off the land had grown progressively stronger i was mystified and didnt carry out kenryos order he barked at one of his pluguglies and snapped at me put em on or hell do it for you take your choice i felt ridiculous standing there in the peasant pants when i d done he said youll do the crew will love this he addressed jutta the men need entertainment once in a while they get bored with shipboard life youll be made to watch you can stop the proceedings any time by telling us where youve hidden the tape and everything you know about the u i gave her a reassuring glance because i thought i was being forced into one of their staves matches i rather hoped so i wanted to have kenryo on the receiving end but the purpose of the fancy pants was lost on me i found out soon enough however when we were marched out on deck it was murky with fog and desert grit the crew were gathered round the foremast theyd lowered its heavy wooden boom parallel to the deck and a couple of feet above it three of them grabbed me at a word from kenryo and frogmarched me to the spar they compelled me to sit astride it and lashed my ankles underneath with rope then they fixed the legs of my pants to the boom with big flatheaded nails my arms and hands were left free but i was immobilized from the waist downwards kenryo supervised jutta was far back under guard and in the dimness i couldnt make out her face clearly emmerm ann stood beneath the bridge overhang with captain mild mild had a pistol on his belt his immobility was so marked that it made him stand out amongst the comings and goings on the deck while i was being nailed down the crew made a ring chattering and laughing when theyd finished the three whod been doing the job broke away suddenly as if they were afraid id take a swipe at them then there was a built of cheering from the crew a tough emerged on deck and started walking towards me he was clad only in the same tyrolean pants as myself and slripped to the waist the only difference between us was that he carried a teninch knife he sat himself down on the spar facing me his eyes were dark and beady and his stare as impersonal as an abattoir hands at an ox he had a bruise on his forehead kenryos staves opponent he put his knees to louch mine and they nailed down his pants if you know how to fight with a knife itll provide better sport said kenryo otherwise youll get carved up the girl can save you remember i then saw that the crew were laying bets on me jf thered been a bookie hed have rated me as the rankest outsider that ever ran in the sang a stakes you bastard i said to kenryo do you expect me to fight with my bare hands he signalled a crewman who came up with what appeared to be two long fish gutting knives take your choice the moment you do the games on the purpose of the pants was clear winner or loser you had to fight i i flicked a glance at my opponent before i took a weapon trying to sum him up its difficult to trigger hate in a minute or two for someone youve never seen before but his knees were touching mine he was ready to kill me make it a grudge fight i told myself thats kenryo sitting there nol a nameless thug go for kenryo and that will be it right for me right for jutta he did in point of fact resemble kenryo the same toughasteak hairless barrel chest and gorilla arms his chest was dark with sweat and the brassy deadfag smell of his breath was in my face i reached out for a knife he switched his knife from his left hand to his right there was dead silence id never fought with a knife my one experience was once seeing two drunken gamats tear into one another in a street brawl if i was to achieve anything it would have to be by surprise tactics i snatched the knife and lunged at his stomach my wrist felt as if id bashed a stone wall my knife was held fast by its pommel in an iron grip its tip was an inch or two from the mans navel the crowd roared he shoved my arm clear by brute force deftly flicked his weapon clear and jabbed me in the shoulder above the heart it didnt hurt much but it brought a gush of blood in reply i sideswiped wildly at him he blocked me with out trouble the crowd catcalled and booed me above their noise i heard an order from kenryo my man acknowledged it with a slight nod and the next thing i had a gash the full width of my chest he was simply playing with me chopping me up expertly the crowd yelled at me to go for him i started a thrust with my right hand and then switched the weapon to my left in midstroke he hadnt expected that it was meant for his throat and i nearly made it there was so much impetus behind the blow that i jackknifed forward and our jaws cracked together he held off my knifehand with his elbow crooked at shoulder level j hadnt the strength to ram home the tip and we hung together with our muscles cracking while the crew screamed and stamped he pushed me clear and we were back to square one panting in each others face and pouring sweat perhaps his narrow escape or my crack on his jaw roughed up his temper whatever it was hed give up playing now the crowd sensed it i thought i heard juttas voice in the background but i couldnt be sure he took the initiative for the next movebut was fool enough to telegraph it by a downward glance at his knife which then thrust like lightning at my heart even a duffer like me could see it coming i countered by striking hard against the back of his blade my knife stuck there then he grinned hed bluffed me with his stroke into doing just what i had done because the back of his knife was overlaid with a soft bronze ridge and my weapon was snagged fast in it i was wide open to the coup de grace all at once his face went slack and he gave a soft little noise like a burp and his head fell forward against my chest a knife stuck out up to its hilt between his shoulderblades kaptein denny stood on sang as rail he had a pistol in his hand watch out i yelled there by jutta but hed already spotted the guards and their automatics and hed fired before my words reached him one of them fell dead and the other dropped his gun its clatter in the frozen silence was as loud as a grenade burst kaptein denny shouted something at the mob in a language i didnt understand they frozewith surprise and fear too judging by their faces miss jutta here quick she went to him and when she was close enough to be safe under his pistol he jumped off the rail and made for me his movements had the same sort of deadly grace as i imagine a leopard has going in for a kill he used the body of my opponent for cover keeping the pistol on the crew and jerked him off me with a swift pull at his hair he kneed the knlfe free out of his back and slashed my pants loose my ankles were still hobbled though use your knifeget free i went for the rope kaptein denny went forward a couple of paces and faced captain mild he placed his feet wide and deliberately on the planking as if he feared he would slip his gun came up in a slow stilted motion to full stretcha curious chesthigh way of aiming untll it pointed at mik is head in his other band was his knife all bloody if mild had gone for the pistol in his belt he would have been a dead man from that moment there was no one else on deck that mattered but those two an invisible beam might have been stabbing between them holding them locked together mikis earlier immobility was there still accentuated by the mortal danger he was in it reached right up into the inert face and sinister hooded eyes they were fixed on kaptein denny held in the trance of some association which lay between them kaptein denny was almost as still as he poised in that deadly triggerman stance kenryo was to one side but kaptein denny didnt seem to be worrying about him i was i slashed myself free no one paid any attention all of them were transfixed at the silent exchange going on between kaptein denny and mild any moment theyd all wake up and overwhelm us by sheer weight of numbers and firepower it couldnt last jt didnt i moved kenryo moved jutta moved i to grab the dead guards submachinegun jutta to me kenryo at denny dennys concentration on mild hadnt blunted a sixth sense of awareness of peril kenryo caught him only half off guard but the shock attack knocked his pistol spinning i went after it kaptein denny was off balance so he didnt get in his knife thrust at kenryo but although the blade missedthe hilt of the weapon crashed him against kenryos jaw and he cartwheeled over and still carried forward by his rush crashed to the planks todome yelled kaptein denny todome you didnt have to guess that the words meant the big chopfrom the poleaxed figure jerking on the deck struan screamed jutta by the ladder one of her guardsthe man who had escaped unscathedhad retrieved his automatic i had the pistol now kaptein denny shouted watch the pull i might have missed my man crouched in the fog if he hadnt warned me because id loosed off three shots before id aimed properly due to the unusual long sweet pull of the trigger which was unlike the customary onoff kick the first did miss the second screamed off the flashguard of the ppsh and the third ripped into his chest there was still mild and his gun j raced to the guard snatched up the submachinegun and trained it from the hip round the deck moving at the same time towards miki no one moves i tossed the pistol to kaptein denny and got alongside mild emmermann had moved away mikis eyes were a couple of almondshaped blurs in the fog hed already got his hand on the butt of his pistol when i jammed the stubby barrel of the ppsh into his ribs tay off dont move ill cut you in half with this if you do his underslanding of english improved remarkably under the guns tuition he let his hand fall away it was like an animated puppets movement however not a muscle in the rest of his body seemed to take part in the action nor did his head i might not have been there at all with a magazine full of instant death his marionettelike stare remained on kaptein denny all he did was to make a curious sucking noise a short intake of breath a strange reverse hiss full of sinister menace tell emquick any games from anyone and youre a dead man he didnt pass on my message because kaptein denny did so the men were all round us crouched in the fog i was alert for the slightest sound or movement jutta and kaptein denny were with me now over the side i threw an arm round mikis throat and halfbacked halfdragged him to the rail helped hlm along with the barrel of the automatic too we made the rail into the dinghy see to him kaptein denny ill hold em offdenny took over and i mounted the rail swinging the submachinegun in a slow arc from side to side struan i called jutta from the boat her voice was hoarse and unnaturalsounding i paused a moment to see if the crew would attempt a lastminute rush they didnt i dropped over the rail and into the dinghy kaptein denny already had the oars balanced over them he held his gun on mild and jutta was making her shaky and largely ineffective contribution with mikis own pistol beat it at my words denny gave a powerful tug at the oars and stroked clear there was a shot from sang a i cradled the submachinegun in my hands and knelt in the stern and walked my fire up sang as side and along her rail and upperworksgrimacing as the recoil tore at my slashed chest there were yells oaths screams and a couple more isolated shots we vanished into the murk c h a p t e r t h i r t e e n fours a crowd in a small boat and so is an armament of two pistols a knife and a submachinegunall trained on one man in the stern captain mild sat there to one sidewhere id pushed him while i cased sang a with my fire there was about him still that frightening immobility which hed displayed on sang as deck he reminded me of a puffadder which had been trodden on it rears up and then remains deadly still when it strikes it is like lightning and at short range it first hisses like a deflating tyre miki had already hissed we had to get clear of sang a quick j moved to help kaptein denny with the rowing no he said watch him so i stood behind him at the oars bracing myself by splaying my feet on either side of the bottomboards i held the submachinegun on miki jutta was in the bow behind me wed only gone a little farther when she gave a low cry struan youre dripping blood i was it was coming from the gash in my chest id not noticed jn a moment she was alongside me steadying herself on my arm and dabbing at the wound with a handkerchief oh god struan struan its not much bandages we must have some bandages for id kantein denny rested on the oars here he leant forward as he sat took mikis shirt by the collar and ripped it bodily down the front he might have been tearing it off a statue except for the shockwave of hate which his action sparked denny passed the torn material over his shoulder to jutta who started work on me keep moving i told denny were far enough for the moment he replied weve got some things to sort out first ill say we couldnt make out sang a any longer and the sounds coming from her were muted kaptein denny snapped a few words at mild who still didnt move he raised his pistol no cried jutta no should its what he deserves instead he can take his chance and swim kaptein denny gestured again miki remained where he was then he uttered the only thing hed said all along it was a harshvenomous little explosion of sound tenchu punishment of the gods echoed kaptein denny here it istenchu he struck mild in the face with his fist mild topped over backwards into the water when he came up i didnt know whether to be glad or sorry he was still alive struan here pull kaptein denny was back at the oars i took station alongside him my last sight of mild in the fog was of two malicious eyes burning just above water levellike the illustrations you see of vanished prehistoric monsters heads swimming in search of prey the dinghy sped through the water the slop of sea in the bottom of the boat made the hot barrel of the submachinegun id discarded sizzle it threw off a kind of pinky foamsteaming off the blood on kaptein dennys knife my blood wasnt contributing now that jutta had bandaged the wound the navigation was a bitch if id been alone id have fouled the spidersweb of cables and chains which enveloped sang a but kaptein denny seemed to know at every stage what he was doing he made his changes of course by pulling less or more strongly on his oar like a rider guiding his horse by his knees the cables and smaller marker buoys were virtually undetectable until the boat was upon them we evaded them ajl however and eventually broke clear of the network when one of the big buoys with its yellow number hove up on the port hand at this point denny made a radical alteration of course i knew it was to the northwest because up lo them id been facing the east wind squarely and now it was to one side the heat lay on the water like a fever and our eyes were full of driving blowing sand rowing was as cooling as doing pressups in a sauna it was a good thing though because it flushed out of our pores the throattightening fearstench of men who have been in the presence of death what it didnt flush out however were a thousand questions i had for kaptein denny and a thousand suspicions which were mutiplying as fast as onecell cultures in a testtube tenchu jutta uttered the word mechanically like someone who on waking recalls a puzzling fragment of a bad dream kaptain denny anticipated the questions which i was intending to throw at him any moment it didnt escape me that during our rowing hed hooked the submachinegun towards himself with a toe so that it now lay within easy reach under his thwart his pistol was in his belttoo a taisho japanese imperial navy model he said punishment of the gods i was the instrument instrument jutta leaned forward so that her face was close to our oars now ive heard everything you loved that fight back there oh it was pleasant as a meat tenderizing demonstration youve got a lot to account for i added he replied not at all breathlessly because he was breathing easily and economically as he rowed you listen to me both of you the sang a crowd arent paper tigers theyre a kamikaze suicide squad attached to the united red armythe rengo sekigun hijacking and terrorism the same bunch who were responsible for the lod airport massacre and a dozen other atrocities remember theres nothing to terrorize at possession i began but he cut me short there is there was lets begin with what was emmermann is in fact swakop the nazi spy who was landed from u then disappeared i heard nothing about him and thought he must have diedor gone back to germany after the war tsushima the spy exclaimed jutta incredulously a japanese fortunately for me the oriental and malay faces are very similar ive pretended to be a gamat all these years kenryo and the others are not koreans theyre japanese like me so are the others in sang a they didnt know i understood them that first day we went aboard a brace of ageing spies you and emmermann alias swakop went on jutta i dont know where miki fits in but id guess he is part of the same setup revenge for some deadandgone hatreds whlch youve kept festering all these years since the warthirty years and you try to pass it off as punishment of the gods this isnt an affair of the past but of the present he began i knew that must be so since the cinc had got wind of it youve turned the whole situation arse over tip j interrupted start at the beginning for petes sake i repeat i am japanese the man who got left behind on the mainland by u tsushima was only a codename like swakop my real names denzo its close enough to resemble dennythe gamat who never was nor was i a spy ill come to that part of it in a moment lets stick to u after shed attacked the liner and been herself attacked by gousblom my cover was in serious danger of being blown so i acted the part of the fisherman hero and rescued the liners passengers in the resulting confusion and admiration no one questioned my bona fides but i had to silence the one man who knew who i really was he was the head of the pronazi cell in south west africa i returned to luderitz and did so jutta said in a whisper hasler the husband of the woman who adopted me i cut his throat oh god j had to had to i vengeance of the gods again i suppose how many others have you killed she asked i had to risk his closing up completely when i fired my question for what why he replied deliberatelyweighing his words because u carried something more valuable than any treasure its what the kamikazes are after of count i thought almost from that first day we met that there was more to you than fishing i accused you nearly caught me out at juttas mothers grave those were japanese shintorites for the departed what did u carry my voice was harsh with tension he gulped a great breath of the sandy wind as if he were trying to free a vice round his chest his steady measured rowing said it wasnt for his muscles ill tell you ill have to explain it japan established herself as one of the great naval powers of the th century by annihilating the russian fleet at the battle of tsushima in you could call tsushima japans trafalgar we also have our nelsonadmiral togo my code name was associated with the victory tsushima i thought admiraj yamamoto was your naval hero yes admiral yamomoto japans sea darling will always be yamamoto although the glory rests with togo in its way yamamotos contribution during the second world war was no less than togos nearly forty years earlier he masterminded our other great naval victory of the century pearl harbour there was no sound but the baying of the wind tsushima and pearl harbour togo and yamamoto yet what if i were to tell you that those victories were not theirs but the brainchild of someone else the way he spoke made me wonder whether we had to do with a homicidal maniac his talk about glory would fit into the pattern of megalomania of illusions of grandeur i calculated how far it was to the submachinegun it would be an evensteven bet whod reach it first if a shootout blew up he went on the basic winning strategy at pearl harbour and tsushima didnt originate with either of the two victors although of course they were responsible for carrying out the detail no it originated in a secret japanese book of naval strategynot a supermanualas youd be inclined to think of battle moves and countermoves but a kind of semimystical collection of symbols an oracle if you like to call it that this book has been consulted and acted upon by all our great naval heroes for centuries now i knew he was crazy come off it i interrupted who won the bloody pacific war anyway where was your mystic book after the yanks thrashed yamamoto at midway where in the possession channel in u that put the skids under me juttas face went all tight like an instant facelift as expressionless too we lost because we lost the book of tsu thats what it s calledthe names a shortened form of tsushima u has it aboard i missed the slgnificance of his use of the present tense because suddenly i felt cold all through i wasnt dealing with a madmansomething else worseif he wasnt on your side he went on mild is trying to sell the seaheart of japan to a shower of thugs youre talking as if we knew who mild was i exclaimed captain mild was admiral yamamotos personal staff officer and confidante he probably knew our great admiral and his secretsbetter than anyone living he was also one of a small group of imperial navy officers who were sworn to secrecy by the emperor himself and ordered to arrange for u to collect the book of tsu at the bridge of magpies collect i echoed then she wasnt carrying it when she sailed for the cape collect he repeated from me ashore j had it the book of tsu was in my safekeeping then u went off without me as you know from the taperecording taking with her the officer whod come in her to escort me home a few minutes before id handed over the book of tsu to him and he had waded out to the uboats dinghy with it then the city of baroda burst in on the scene and in the panic i was left behind left his voice was edged with bitterness the whole plan wrecked mild as i said was one of the planning team and afterwards he went back into the front line as the americans drove closer and closer to japan he went on fighting even after the surrender he was one of those wartime holdouts who show up from time to time on remote pacific islands jn his case it was lubang in the philippines he was eventually flushed out of the jungle a couple of years back after nearly thirty years of nosurrender he was something of a hero when he returned to japan but he found it wasnt the place hed fought for in his disenchanted stale he was easy meat for the kamikaze movement so he teamed up with them i said kamikazes are suicide killers avengers nothing to do with naval officers or naval strategy youre right revenge russian revenge for their navys humiliation at tsushima the reds have long memories its eaten into them for nearly threequarters of a century it runs through all soviet naval thinking in far eastern waters ships bases tactics dispositions russia didnt have the opportunity to take her revenge against japan in world war ii because she came in right at the end when the americans had done the job she still longs to take a crack at us what better target could a kamikaze squad set for itself than to lay its bands on the almost sacred weapon which broke their fleet once and use it against japan herself when the chance offered mild gave them their opportunity and soviet money paid for all that expensive salvage gear of sang as and their hardware i said indicating the submachine gun theres a lot more of these around on sang a plus other heavier metal but how do you know all this background i was given a lead by something i overheard that first day we went aboard herthey werent to know i understood japanese of course my suspicions were confirmed when i searched her we had the pleasure of meeting that night of the party you and i captain weddell the guard in the mask aye miss jutta knew i was around you signalled him with the torch jt was a rhetorical accusation jutta had sat aside while id crossquestioned denny i considered that the whole thing had become too big for her now her voice was remote and slightly mistrustful yes i did i was afraid for you being alone wed made a plan beforehand kaptein denny never left the vicinity of possession that puts paid to expecting help from the frigate then its better this way said kaptein denny i went on rowing mechanically just as a concussed rugby player goes on playingmy mind in a daze then j jerked into the present again from downwind came the sound of a boats engine starting up if half of what kaptein denny said was correct the sooner we made tracks for the high seas the betler wheres gaok were almost there now only a couple of cables lengths to go to starboard easy as she goes we pulled alongside the cutter and streamed the dinghy astern at the end of a painter theyre practically breathing up our exhaust pipe i said start the diesel perhaps they wont hear it the way the winds blowing find your way out to sea ill start the diesel all right but i mean them to hear it i want them to think were heading seawards think were on our way inshore bridge of magpies after that albatross rock do you want to hand them gaokand uson a plate listen to me we start the enginerev it up and hope the sound does reach them then we cut it we sail after weve picked up ichabo sail two boats youre out of your mind say two boats and we sail that settled it as far as another reefgrazing ride was concerned i didnt need faith to trust him after our breakout from alabama cove his next wordsthough drove my patience to the limit wet tow ichabo gods truth what next tow halve our chances halve our speed hajve our manoeuvrability we tow the only bright spot was that he appeared to have more to lose than we did we had only our lives what the rest of his stake was i intended to find out okay i capitulated at that he became more relaxed and easy again lets go then we gunned gaoks engine as hard as we dared and then set off under a scrap of sail towards a spot where denny maintained ichabo was at anchor except for the direction of the wind i had completely lost my bearings most of the fog had gone now but the dust made a more tangible darkness which hid the sun and filled our eyes and noses and crunched between our teeth we located ichabo lashed her helm and made gaoks towing cable secure then we set offin a series of tight tacks into the teeth of the wind and across the channel towards the mainland the air was very hotand dust blew like a rasp desert debris was everywhere the wind was nudging gale force and had a dry rolling rattle to itlike shaking a giant version of one of the sperrgebiets own rattle bushes which clatter like castanets there was a steely precision about the way kaptein denny tacked and tacked again he himself had the wheel and i tended the sail but my mind was only half on the tricky operation at every turn i expected to run into a sang a search party juttatoo was on constant watch from the bridge there was no time to think about the fantastic story denny had told us i was continually on the move because at every change of course ichabo would stream away lumpishly downwind and drag round gaoks stern as an example of giving your enemy every chance to cut off your retreat dennys strategy seemed hard to beat but we went on undetected and finally made a ninety degree turnso close to doodenstadts rocks that spray from the breakers was added to the little which carded on to the deck now gaok pointed southwards hugging the shore with ichabo cavorting out to lee at the end of her cable a thought struck me and i made for the bridge radar sang a has radar shell pick us up for sure in these conditions never denny replied her radar screen will look like a bead curtain across a bar with all this stuff flying around there are enough mica particles in it to thake radar about as effective as a crosseyed drunk we drove south it wasnt more than ten miles to albatross rockbut a couple of crabs under sail would have followed a straighter course than gaok and ichabo the bridge of magpies showed up visibility was so low that its legs appeared to have been amputated when it disappeared astern i gave up trying to calculate where we werefrom the amount of forward movement sideways drift and wind thrust it is impossible for me to say therefore at what point off the fractured fissured coast i saw dead ahead on the seas surfacethe grey thing with rounded sides which looked like an igloo tent or a hangarone of those plastic structures which are inflated to give them shape only this one was dirty and shiny and wet and there were lighter patches here and there on its bulging sides gaok couldnt miss it the way she was heading what in he was kaptein denny doing i threw myself off the bridge and roof where id been attending the sail and into the wheelhouse below jutta was there staring transfixed at the object in our track tut your helm down i yelled down denny didnt seem to hear and went on gazing forward without turning his head i snatched at the wheeland i looked into the blue barrel of the taisho tack keep away the rock man youll sink us leave it to me it isnt a rock he never got any further because at that moment gaoks bowsprit pierced the grey bulk the result was like putting your head inside big bens biggest bell when the hour strikes the boom stunned the ears and kicked the diaphragm my resulting nausea wasnt only sound induced the plasticlooking bubble threw off a flatus which was as sickening as it was unique the stenchpatch gaok had to cross wasnt bigger than a cricket field and it couldnt have taken more than a couple of minutes but it seemed like hours i was shouting things which i couldnt hear because my eardrums were paralysed and i was holding jutta gagging and retching against me i lipread the explanation of the thingon kaptein dennys mouththe sound of guns the sea round about was thlck enough to have matched walewskas oil spill but once we had lurched clear of the patch and gone far enough to give our ears time to recover denny told us what the sound of gunsreally was hed heard it a score of times before of coursebut to us it made gousbloms end sound more poignant jt wasnt guns gousblom heard but the explosion of gas pockets which are caused by the upwell cell building up what you saw back there was a small section of the mud floor of the channel which the gas lifts bodily to the surface gas is quickly generated by the action of the upwell cells warm water on billions of minute decomposing sea creatures on the ocean bed pockets form and push the mud upwards into giant balloons when they reach the surface where the pressure of the air is less they explode if thered been no sound of guns thered have been no u action observed jutta thoughtfully true it was luck fate call it what you like it doesnt last for long miss jutta gousblom was unlucky enough to be around at the wrong moment once cold water starts flowing it kills the process no lost book of tsu no kaptein denny she added sometimes even i think of myself as a gamat fisherman dennydenzo that triggered off something inside him and he spoke and steered and never looked anywhere but ahead while gaok spooked her way through the sandstorm towards albatross rock the first admiral denzo lived about years ago denny began he fought for a japanese emperor named minamoto denzo won a great sea battle against the taira clan and his victory gave minamoto control over the whole of japan it is the first occasion on which there is a record of the book of tsu denzo is known to have based his successful strategy on its precepts in recognition of his victory minamoto appointed demo to be keeper of the book of tsu he also conferred a hereditary title on him its been in our family ever since then he said quietly and not at all theatrically and with no pose master of the equinoxes lord of the solstice he raised the gunhand which had gone out at such high stretch at mild i am the master i have my duty the book of tsu must never fajl into the hands of emmermann and kenryo and mild pearl harbour tsushima the storys full of gaps the hoarseness in my own voice surprised me yes it is im not telling you that the book of tsu which won demo his victory was the same as the one used at pearl harbour and tsushima it wasnt over the centuries after minamoto the book of tsu became debased until it was regarded as a lot of mumbojumbo simply a collection of incomprehensible medieval magic spells an elaborate ritual over which the master presided was built up and it became more important than the book itself its meaning was almost totally obscured by the beginning of the twentieth century then my grandfather who lived at the time of the meiji revolution which made japan into a modern state revised and rewrote the book of tsu in terms of modern naval concepts thatwas about twenty years before the battle of tsushima admiral togo based his victorious strategy on this revamped dynamic version of the book of tsu so did yamamoto at pearl harbour he and the japanese naval staff were already planning and playing war gathes five years before the pacific war broke out yamamoto himself tasted victory at tsushima he was there he lost a couple of fingers from a shellburst j feel like a spacecraft starting to come back to the everyday things on earth i said i havent got past the shock of reentry yet jutta looked it too kaptein denny went on jts probably easier for the oriental than the western mind to accept that one can receive valid guidance from extrasensory forces maybe its something to do with the ritual or the symbols of the book of tsu which amuse and project the unconscious who knows it might prove a rewarding modern study in esp all i can say is that it worked for togo and yamamoto the more you tell us the more unlikely it seems that the master of the equinoxes should find himself as tar away from his hereditary shrines and whathaveyou as the sperr gebiet i said not when you reajize that luderitz has a direct associat ion with the battle of tsushima it was at luderitz that admiral rozhdesvensky coaled the russian fleet for the last time before it sailed to destruction by togos guns at tsushima youll find his signature in an old visilors book at the port nothing of this makes it any clearer why you were at the bridge of magpies with the book of tsu that night waiting for u to pick you up and it wasnt even a japanese sub as youd expect but a german one jn there was an army coup in japan a palace revolution young turks grabbed the government they set aboul eradicating all the traditionaj thingsexcept the emperor of course hes sacred the rest went into the fire that included the hereditary officebearers the master my father was a front ranker for liquidation we lived a little way out of tokyo at the shrine where the book of tau was kept i was an ensign serving in the navy my father was tipped off by phone that a killer squad was on its way to eliminate him he vowed theyd never lay hands on the book of tsu so he swore me in as the new master after arranging with friends to smuggle meand itout of japan he also fixed with someone at the imperial pajace for me to see the emperor in order to ratify the title he shot me off with the book of tsu and calmly awaited his executioners i remember that day like yesterdaythe jmperial palace in the snow the patrols the shooting the street barricades they let me pass because i was in fulldress uniform and the navy was supposed to be sympathetic to the revolutionaries i was young and terrified during the audience with the emperor who made me promise that whenever he sent for me i would return to japan with the book of tsu then i went back through the patrols with the book wrapped in a brown paper parcel under my arm and friends smuggled me aboard a ship leaving for cape town my ultimate destination was luderitz which my father had designated a jap in prewar cape town you must have stood out like a sore thumb thats what i thought language was no problemid learned english french and german at the famous nakano school for spies it was my face but i saw my break when we actuajly reached the cape malays are orientals and there are thousands of them there id easily pass as one so i jumped ship and went to ground in cape towns gamat casbah among the cutthroats i had plenty of money and in those days thereyou could buy a mans soul for a dollar a year later i emerged a fullyfledged gamat myself complete with patois after that it was simple to ship to the guano islands after a season among the zombies i bought a boat and started fishing out of luderitz my cover was complete the master the book of tsu and no employment for them i said it looked like that after pearl harbour and the fantastic run of japanese victories which followed they were yamamotos of course do you know we conquered the whole of south east asiafrom the philippines to singapore from burma to the outskirts of australia for the loss of one destroyer the new admirals and captains believed it was due to their own fighting skillwho among them had ever heardor caredabout the book of tau except yamamoto said jutta even the greal yamamoto overreached himself he hadnt the book of tsu to rely on any more the battle of midway finished himand the japanese navy then yamamoto was shot down and killed in a plane by the americans in the solomon the writing was on the wall for japan traditionally the navythe hard inner core of top brassturned to consult the book of tsu it wasnt there it was with me at luderitz the emperor knew so in greatest secrecy the pickup was arranged but why a german uboat jutta demanded swakopthe man who was to raise a pmnazi rebellion in south west africawas in japan u was refitting at the japanese naval base at penang we let the uboats use our east indies bases after theyd been driven out of the atlantic and indian oceans and us skipper was an ace who knew the cape well hed served in two wolfpacks seehund and eisbar in these waters the whole setup provided perfect cover for us real mission no wonder my researches ran dead exclaimed jutta you know the rest added kaptein denny except why you were left behind the japanese officer in u who was to be my aide was a stickler for rank and protocol and the master was more than someone he was set on doing me all the honours he wasnt even going to allow me to wet my feet hed first taken the book of tsu out to the uboats dinghy intending to come back and piggyback me out then the liner alarm went and the dinghy raced away back to the u i was left standing on the beach thats that then juttas voice was flat and empty i added i appreciate now why you dont want sang a to know where u sank she didnt sink said kaptein denny shes due any time now at albatross rock c h a p t e r f o u r t e e n it felt as if thered been some delayed blowback into my brain from my paralysed hearing earlier it simply wouldnt function to accept what kaptein denny said the paralysis seemed to have spread to my vocal chords too juttas incredulity took the common form of demanding a repeat of a statement that youd heard perfectly well in the first place anyway what did you say then her voice wobbled and went temporarily lame denny said u didnt sink bul she didnt remain afloat either for chrissake i interjectedyou cant have it both ways you canand the uboat did i need a shot of dopendum without the dune gousbloms attack put us ballast pumps out of action and wrecked ajl her valves its there on the tape i came to the same conclusion when i saw her first saw first i felt a tide of excitement rising inside me if i could get my hands on the book of tsu the cinc would gel more than hed bargained for ive watched her surface every winter for close on thirty years that accounts for the xrayeye weather watch aye its the upwell cell of course yes and no but mainly yes you must have seen the spot where she went down and marked it and now with the upsurge of water that isnt the way it works i myself didnt witness what happened to u all i know is that there was a long oil patch next morning after the action round broke rock and a couple of mines floating about everyone said theyd got u there was no mason to doubt it until until after the war and j was on my way homesick and disillusioned and feeling not a little guilty about the whole tragedy of losing the book of tsu jn fact at one stage j seriously contemplated committing harakiri i was taking myself to cape town in gaok preliminary to shipping to japan it was winter as now and the weather was the same i didnt know about the upwell cell in those days off albatross rock i sighted what i thought was a whale on the surface when i got closer i saw it wasnt it was a waterlogged submarine and when i got closer still i made out her recognition number u i thought i had gone out of my mind i nearly did when i went aboard the conning tower and its escape hatch were smashed fast inside that floating steel coffin was a whole crew and the book of tsu there was nothing i could do to get at it the last straw came a couple of hours later when the uboat started to go down under my feet and i had to abandon her that was near the bridge of magpies where the current had carried her i followed the sinking hulk up the channel and to the open seawhen it vanished altogether i think i was a little insane that night its not possible that she should go and come back thats what i thought for the second time id lost everything that was most precious to me shed got caught in a dense salinity layer and that brought her to the surface i asked yes thats it i didnt rationalize it like that at the time though you dont when a ghost shows up and you live with it for a few hours and then it slips back again into its grave u was damaged at the critical moment when they were flooding her tanks to dive because of that she couldnt blow them and she couldnt fill them she had to go on half submerged the crew was trapped it must have been an awful death escape was so near and yet so far that is why she never signalled uboat headquarters as she promised interjected jutta there was a lurking dismay behind her eyes as if she feared she had no option now bul to live out whatever trouble was in store for us i think she also secretly mistrusted kaptein denny if she went down at the northern entrance to the channelwhat are we doing here in the south i demanded perhaps sang as location wasnt so far out after all theyre wrong his eyes looked as old and tired as if hed been watching over the book of tsu all its eight hundred years i found it all out the hard way i became possessed with possession i lived sailed sounded searched everything i knew everything i remembered about the hulks course and about tides winds and currents to try to find her again nothing salvage can be frustrating enough when you have modem gear imagine what i felt like using primitive means like sounding leads and fishing trawls and nets trying into the bargain to bluff everyone that i was a simple fisherman but you knew where she went down so i thought so i thought it was only a year later that i discovered that u didnt go down but away what are you saying the waterlogged uboat was carried away from the coast by the current the farther she went the less the density of the sea became and the deeper under the surface she went god alone knows where in the south atlantic she drifts under water all year brazil antarctica the falklands the west wind drift ive given up trying to work it out all i know is that its a regular cycle because she comes back and surfaces each year when the bridge of magpies wind blows its blowing now there was a curious tightening in my throat and shes coming she always does her landfalls always the samealbatross rock captain schlebusch himself couldnt do better then she works her way upchannel on the surface jutta said in a carefully controlled voice you need have no fear that you havent kept faith with your office keeper watcher isnt it enough thirty years its a whole life he said more gently than id ever heard him speak keeper watcher true but its not enough miss jutta i wonder if you or anyone else could know how it feels to have an inch of rusty steel plating of a dead uboats hull stand between you and everything that matters in your world and your countrys the wraps were off him now snap out of it i told myself dont buy this eastern line of a magic staff in one hand and a gun in the other hes had nearly thirty opportunities on his own admission lo take a crack at opening up ualone or with the help of others i couldnt keep the sceptlcism out of my voice from what you say u should have been a piece of cake as far as salvage goes a tug or a ship to assist and the book of tsu would have been in the bag he gestured at the coffeeandcream whitecaps streaming in from the south and the desert gale overhead sandblasting their crests to dirty foam take a look at the risk element as an ordinary salvage proposition a uboat is worth peanuts youve said so yourself just after the war you couldnt have sold one for a thousand pounds even to a film company with the exception of the book of tsu u carried nothing of value add to that the fact that you can only attempt anything with u just at a time when all the risks are at their maximum the skipper of a japanese trawler i prevailed upon to try it nearly lost his ship on penguins turning he was an exnavy man himself and i sold him a yarn about u carrying important naval documents i think hes cursing me still youre not the only one in all this time who must have seen u surface i said no think its never for more than a few hours that she shows up a nonscary accompaniment is a sandstorm theres fog by the nature of thingsshe submerges shortly after the bridge of magpies wind drops a few hours zero visibility the most dangerous shore probably in the world the guano workers forget it its the birds breeding season possessions deserted j dont have to lell you that the mainlands sperrgebietverboten theres not a soul about except sang a youre wrong except us were going in to take the book of tsu out of u when she shows up j too had to get in there with him intelligencewisethe book of tsu could be the biggest bonanza since american combat intelligence broke the jap code before midway and had the fleets plan of attack handed to them on a plate if it was ajl kaptein denny claimed it was bigger than even the cinc himself could imagine the odds against two men and a girl pulling it off were astronomical threes a crowd tens a team and you d need a damn fine team of ten experts backed by a shipload of equipment to swing the u odds in our favour when i stood turning ajl this over in my mind and did not reply immediately the pupils of kaptein dennys eyes contracted like a cats out hunting when confronted by a sudden light as sinister too jutta noticed it and said quickly come down to the cabin a moment struan ive something to say to youalone the light in the cabin was dim because of the sand cloud and the dark mahogany panelling didnt help what little sunlight penetrated it jutta stoppedturned and faced me looking as if there were something very complicated in her mind which had to be brought out into the light of day she had about her a remoteness which made her seem vulnerable and dear i looked in the deep green of her eyes but found no answer she made a little gesture which was haildeprecationhalfsomething i couldnt define my search for a father has turned into something else its still openended and likely to remain so u j wasnt meaning u me i tried to tell you before i was a woman who hadnt found herself was her tone was quite different from that night wed been alone in the bunkhouse i came to possession looking for one thing i found another bigger no biggest go on jm someone who grew up by fits and startspainfully i ve waited a long time to establish where i stand in the world where is that she came close to me and touched my lips with hers she could control that but not the tremors that rippled all down the length of her neck and breasts and thighs when i held her tight here darling darling im not firing blanks this time my love we couldnt hear the swishing of the gale past the port holes for the sound of our hearts beating together she said all these years ive felt ive been playing a part not being an insider to myself because of it now youve come along and transplanted a heart into me and everything is bright and fresh and new im scared of losing it through kaptein denny and u scared for you too my darling she held me fiercely with her hips and thighs if all this was a revelation of the sort of woman she really was she was my woman ill make it work for you maybe i love you too much or not enough yet j cant go along with this crazy u business i cant be sure in my own mind about kaptein denny its too late to go back on it now thats what im afraid of were being squeezed between kaptein denny and sang a not if we get the book of tsu what if you do kaptein denny wont let you keep it you can be certain did you see his eyes just now i had once wed salvaged u the chase might only be starting i hadnt planned that far j said i have you that makes all the difference now i want it to my very dear love just look after whats most precious to me will you we held one another so long that i was worried kaptein denny would come looking for us so we went back to the bridge whats the dell for u i asked him the contraction started to go from his pupils when he heard my acceptance he kept his voice on a neutral level for the reply the effort it took showed how keyedup hed been we cant be sure when shell show up she may be coming our way at this very moment theres no such thing as zero visibility but the bridge of magpies gale was doing its best to create it the sand being carried along doubled the normal effect on the seas surface of a gale tearing in one direction while a current drove against it from the opposite quarter it was milkycoffee churnedup short and steep and the sand had a stinging maddening quality like windfired bird shot you couldnt get away from it even inside the cutter ichabo was corkscrewing at the end of the tow and every time it went slack and took up again she jerked and lurched violently in spite of the fact we were so close we couldnt make out the scimitarlike curve of the coast as there was only a frail wash of light from the sun waves of a hundred centuries had fragmented the rock of the coastline into a loose series of offshore reefs stacks pinnacles and blinders the biggest of them is albatross rock and the worstpenguins turning they form a halfcircle of about threequarters of a mile from land extended in a southwesterly direction only like a comets tail between them apparently known to kaptein denny ran a deepwater channel scoured since the sperrgebiet was young by the action of the incoming stream of the upwell cell even the africa pi ot whose language is usually as unemotional as a judges verdict becomes charged when describing the dangers of the patch we were heading into we go in the moment we sight her denny said youll take ichabo i have gaok we make the cutters fastone on either side of the uboat we rig a couple of cables under her keep and secure them to the boats theyll act as pontoons they plus the lifting effect of the upwell cell will combine lo keep her above water while we cut open the hatch with what ive brought ajong an oxyacetylene cutting torch with special long leads to the gas cylinders that means we wont have to carry them around a lot depends on the state of the metal her hulls in fine nick still all the worse for us no all the better otherwise it might collapse underwater anywhere any time will two cutters be enough for a uboats deadweight tonnage of how much eleven hundred and twenty on the surface twelve thirty submerged trust jutta to know kaptein denny permitted himself a smile i persisted youre well heeled you could have got the services of all the gamat fishermen and their cutters from luderitz on the basis of winnertakeall from the hulk listen id been misled by that passing smilelisten very carefully to me the book of tsu is a secretone of the wor ds great secrets my countrys secret its not for spreading around a bunch of blabmouthed wreckers or among prying officials whod follow them once the story of a floating sub spread from the pubs only five people in the world besides myself know about it you two kenryo miki and emmermann we drove on the silence in the wheelhouse thick and heavy laterthe tension eased a bit when we had to exchange technicalities about the final runin to albatross rock at penguins turning we swung starboard on to a southwesterly heading the fang looked like its name a penguin who had turned its back to the land all black and shining and its chest to the sea all white with the smash of the upwell cell the manoeuvrea keelshaking jolt which had the two boats weaving like drunks while they shaved past the outliers of penguins turningbrought the wind fine on the port quarter it also put us heading deedon into the current this race created a whirlpool in the lee or landward side of penguins turning that didnt help our seakeeping problems we inched onwards a dreary yardbyyard slog visibility was no more than a couple of hundred yards but that was good for morale because though we could hear we couldnt see the crash of the seas on every hand albatross rock finally heaved in sight i said i understand now what the pigboat saying means by guess and by god u can only come this way kaptein denny was very tense so can sang a jutta voiced the doubt which had been nagging at the back of my mind all the time leave it alone snapped denny leave it alone miss jutta i say i speculated what his reaction would be if i asked what he intended to do if sang a surprised us working on u with both cutters immobilized i only hoped emmermann was an ardent reader of the africa pilot at best kaptein denny couldnt count on more than a few hours in which to slice open a hull specially toughened to withstand four hundred feet of water pressure and the explosion of enough amatol in depth charges to blow the bottom out of the attackers own hull if you didnt get clear quick enough after dropping them how deep the uboat would lie depended on the density of the water in the upwell cell only the tip of the conningtower might emerge if its density was weak that only god and u knew also once the radarblinding screen of sand fell as as if must do with the decline of the galewed be a sitting duck for sang as search scanner silence fell again we cased the ocean for u finally kaptein denny brought both cutters to anchor it was a backbreaking musclefagging business and the spot he chose could have been anywhere except that there was a triangular blur to seaward which he said was albatross rock his hardline approach was an effective questionstopper all that leadfooted afternoon the gale roared over us like a dirty snowstorm all that afternoon the desert fallout swamped the ships all that afternoon kaptein denny stoodshort and brown and frozenfaced alone with his thoughtswatching the foamlashed sea sunsets on the sperrgebiet are usually spectacular affairs because of the dust in the air but ours didnt stand a chance of penetrating the dark clouds rolling out to sea from the desert the sun went down in a faint bleary blur and the gale thundered on hot and dirtily the fog too was heavier and earlier than usual because of the hotcold clash of the air and sea it became a profitless business continuing the lookout for u we couldnt have sighted her unless and until she was right under our noses kaptein dennys silence and tension were catching and jutta and i were infected we went below and i occupied myself with stripping and cleaning the submachinegun j also greased and checked some running gear that i thought might be useful whenand if u showed up i also tested dennys blowpipe cutter which hed brought for the uboats hatch rata and i had a snack supper below i was pouring myself a brandy to anchor it when jutta said suddenly if hes mad and the uboat doesnt comewhats he going to do to us j nodded towards the submachinegun id put handy on a locker that guns living with me from now on closer than my shirt she went on speculatively it all sounds so normal when he explains it and then when youre alone and come to think about it its quite some title master of the equinoxes lord of the solstice it rings all right so do delusions of grandeur then she came to me im afraid struan afraid for us deep down im ful of doubts i kissed her but her nerves and muscles were as taut as gaoks rigging in the gaje the waitings sending me crazy j hitched up the automatic lets got up on deck i held her and blew out the lamp the cabin didnt go dark jt was lighted silverfaintly uncannilyfrom outside and juttas face was that spectral colour id seen in the channel she put her face against mine jd think it was part of the nightmare if i didnt know the real cause we went on deck the night had a parched and eerie splendour the seas shimmering fire threw up a backwash of luminosity against the overhead sand curtain and made little mobile footlights to light the cutters hulls albatross rock stood out more dearly than before as each wave that broke drenched it in liquid fire on the bridge above us kaptein dennys statuestill figure and stubby head resembled a silver totem pole i was fiddling to get the automatic comfortable and hold jutta at the same time so my eyes werent on the sea look juttas intake of breath matched the wind speed jf it had been moving i would have said it was a torpedo whose buoyant flask was leaking air a silver stream cascaded to the surface from under the water like a scuba swimmer coasting along blowing bubbles an upheaval of disturbed incandescence followed it resolved itself into the outline of a ship jesus like a ghost in the grip of some primordial time machine u rose up out of the sea c h a p t e r f i f t e e n trip that brake pawl let fly the anchor get rid of it man get rid of it i couldnt make out dennys face in the dark of the wheelhouse above but i could feel his scowl now now now wed teamed the two cutters together beforehand for a snap start but we didnt anticipate that the starting chocks would have to be whipped away like this slipping cables is tearaway tactics we had both boats anchors out from gaok in the lead and ichabo streamed astern on a light hawser you dont expect in this time and age that a uboat will surface only a few cables lengths away and bear down as if it meant business kaptein denny came racing down the bridge ladder shell foul ichabo there was no sign in his face that hed registered what i was saying cut her loose he roared cut her loose he went on past me to the engineroom i smacked the pawl free the rattle of cables going override cut through the night like a smallarms fusillade it was nothing though compared with the bark of the diesel starting up hushkits are for jets but id have given a thousand pounds at that moment for a special model for fishing cutters it sounded as if it could be heard ajl the way to possession you know the planmove manmove kaptein denny was on his way back to the wheel in a moment i felt gaoks screw bite and hold her against the current shesbeautiful in the hurry id forgotten jutta the unreal light from the luminescent fire showed the deadly lowsilhouette black shape frozen in her last agony marine growths were strung from hat jumpingwirethe thick cable designed to slice through undersea objects like mine moorings which which runs from bow to stern via the conningtower the water sparkled as it fell back into the sea there were rough lumps of barnacles everywhere the casing was barely awash somethinground like a buoyhung from the jumpingwire immediately forard of the bridge maybe she is beautiful i answered it wasnt time to gawp but what we have to give that hulk now is the kiss of lifeor whatever you do for drowned subs come on this is the time go get going kaptein denny shouted again i got into position to cast ichabo loose denny allowed gaok to fall back to meet her so that j could jump before the current carried her away whatever the sight of u had done to him it hadnt affected his seamanship jump i jumped jutta stayed behind in gaok as wed arranged previously all set there aye i called back to denny lets smack it about he broke the joint plan of action before we started though before id time to fire ichabos engine he was off alone in the direction of the uboat he threw a spotlight on her when he got close then ichabos engine started banging away where was sang a i headed for u when i came alongside gaok i saw by her spotlight what the object was that was bobbing and swinging from the jumpingwire like a jackrabbit pendulum every time a wave lifted the sub i cut ichabos engine and leapt aboard gaok denny and jutta were together in the wheelhouse staring at the uboat mine thats a mine i could almost reach out and touch it but nothing would have made me do so it hung by a whisker a uboats jumpingwire is a single thick cable for about half its length then divides into twovshaped somewhere above the level of the gun the v is secured to either side of the conningtower by sets of double shackles one leg of the v had snapped the other was carrying the mines full weight the mines own mooring cable had snarled about the jumpingwire the main obstacle which prevented its crashing to the deck was a flanged bit of rusty metalprobably in its own seabed anchor which was wedged in one of the shackles i saw it there the first time replied kaptein denny coolly she tangled with one of her own mines which shed laid in the channel but one of the wires has snapped since i saw it last time for all the concern he showed he might have been quietly discussing some rigging technicalily instead of half a ton of explosive liable lo go off at the drop of a hat of a wire rather and the others going to part at any moment especially now it hasnt the seas lift to take the strain off it come on man help me do something about it quick he made no move take a look at the way that things hangingsee i went on its upside down those spikes sticking out below are detonating horns theyre pointing downwards if that cable snaps the mine will drop slap on the deck christ id been so carried away my eyes fixed on the swinging mine that i hadnt paid any attention to the deck now i forgot even the mine if were looking for a spectacular when the next big sea shakes that mine loose weve got it i said slowly i couldnt say it fast because my mouth was too dry do you see what i see schlebusch was an ace replied kaptein denny he needed plenty of torpedoes nine j managed to say nine extra torpedoes lashed on deck shes a bloody floating hardware store the spare torpedoes which schlebusch would have reloaded through special hatches on the casing were stowed directly beneath the suspended mine with their firing heads pointing forward to give good streamlining underwater i know that nowadays amatol is considered an oldfashioned explosive i said a kilo or two of a modern type is enough to blow up a building but by god theres enough here to sink the queen elizabeth ark royal and enterprise all rolled into one a swell washed against the waterlogged hull and a ripple of phosphorescent fire spread along it put me aboard i said this is a oneman operation i ll fix it then get clear in case j fluff things no exclaimed jutta no struan no do as i say every seconds vital want some spare cable to reinforce whats left up there and then make the mine fast theres some below replied kaptein denny quickly goals staying youll want her spotlight to see what youre doing were all in this together stay if you like amatols easy it doesnt matter whether youre five or five hundred feet from the explosion centre of a load like this juttas face was a mask of misery pleaseno old hulk is worth it there wasnt time to listen to her side of the story jd set myself in motion to do a job and id narrowed down my thinking to that to the exclusion of all else perhaps tlmebomb defusers work that way my muscles hadnt got over their initial shockthough it seemed as if they were being operated by remote control i ducked below for some cablelengths of securing line and wirecutters when i got back on deck kaptein denny was easing gaok alongside the uboatmillimetre by milli metre there was a steelclad reason hanging by a thread why he should then i was climbing ova the side jutta cajled ill hold your things ill pass them to you while you work if the mine slipped i wouldnt be able to reach her in the last few seconds without her there my hands would be steadier no she didnt argue but i could feel her eyes on my back as i dropped down on to the barnacled casing there was an unmistakable musty wet deepsea smell coming off the conningtower and i found a steel ladder up to it it was clamped on the starboard side where gaok was and led first to a light antiaircraft gun platform drilled full of holes for draining abaft the bridge this was surrounded by a rusty melal pulpit rail it could well have been one of gousbloms turrets which had fallen on her because the structure was wrecked and the stanchions and rails were all crushed the rear entrance to the conningtower bridgea ushaped enclosure with the open end of the u facing asternwas blocked with twisted metal and also the remains of the peri scope housing it was just possible to edge in i did so and started in on the mine the jumpingwire to starboard was gone but the one to port was intact i got a light line round the top of the mine and stopped it swinging one of the detonating horns was arcing within eighteen inches of the bridge easy now easy does it i told myself up to now pd been working largely by reflex but with the slight change of the odds in my favour i began to react consciously you cant do anything about the main jumpingwire forard of the gun before it divides for the w because its out of reach but it doesnt look too bad keep that infernal spotlight out of my eyes id brace and lash tight my new strop on the broken section by running a loop through the nearest shackle then secure it to something firm on the bridge the steel pipe of the captains jumpstool would serve it was strong enough to take the strain i was sweating heavily and bracing myself against the bridge coaming and leaning forward to slip one end of the wire through the shackle to make the repair easy now easy i hope to god sang a doesnt come and catch us with our pants down and a fart weighing half a ton in the pipeline waiting to hit the deck not the deck at twelve feet it didnt need a computer to work out the exact spot where the mine would land on those nine torpedoes would they still explode after all this time it didnt matter reajly the mine would youre always reading about old wartime mines going up over a hundred thousand of them still unswept up around britain pull yourself together youre shaking like a soak with the ritte the whole bloody sperrgebiet will shake too if this little lot goes up i couldnt manage to complete the loop of my emergency strop i was about six inches too far away from the shackle i could do so however if i hung on the jumping wire add my two hundred pounds weight to that already dicey cable so near and yet so far shit on all of them whod put me in this spot shit on you you bastard denny denzo or whatever you cajl yourself stuff all the denzos all the long line of them in eight hundred years and tsushima and yamamoto theres jutta to think of now im damned if this iron udder is going to bang its tits on any deck full of torpedoes i grabbed the jumpingwire on sudden impulse heaved forward with my weight on it twisted the loop tight and then dropped back into the conningtower and made the cable fast id flayed the skin off my fingers and palms i descended the conningtower ladder like a man in a dream and crunched back across the shells and marine growths to gaok the world started to come slowly back into focus and i became conscious of the gaje again out there on the exposed casing it felt as if the whole world would disappear in one great blowing cloud the uboats buoyancy had a curious dead feel and walking across her deck like that made one want to grope uncertalnly with ones feet like an astronaut on a spacewalk safeconducts fixed i told denny when i got aboard gaok struan darling the rest of juttas welcome was blocked in her throat nows our time replied kaptein denny not a mention of the thing which hung theresafe now i was still suffering from a carryover of tension but i brushed it aside right i said lets get on with the job but look how shes down at the head you didnt need good night vision in the almost moonlight conditionsto make an assessment that u would never be classed al at lloyds the seas surged across the deck which was half awash most of its length and fully awash in the bows even the railings and stanchions forard of the main torpedo loading hatch were half under water if it hadnt been for what she carrled inside i would have dismissed her as a load of old iron only fit to cover with a blanketand cajl the padre the luminescence made a bright border about a foot wide amidships round the casing where it rode clear of the water but in the bowswhere the seas were shredded it was like flame rippling on a burning log kaptein denny said tonights the night its been this way too many times before this is the last attempt now lets get that rope cradled under her that had been the plan it was simpleas a plan it called for a double length of fourinch manila hawser attached to both cutters bow and stern winches and looped under us hull wed first let go enough slack to let the hawsers sink deeper than the uboatthen dose on her from both flanks astern stop when we came abreast the conningtower and then winch the cradle in tight the cutters would act as lifting pontoons while we got busy on the main hatch with the cutting torch the theory was fine the practice different it was as if we were cowpunchers riding herd and trying to rope the most bloodyminded maverick that ever cut loose on the plains of texas the ancient mariners undersea spirit couldnt have jinked yawed and shoved that sodden hull in more random chaotic and unpredictable directions than the upwell cell current did perhaps that was why shed escaped being piled up on the reefs in all the years before the operation was also continually hamstrung by dennys refusal to move more than a few hundred feet from the uboat for fear of losing her from under his spotlight this meant i was at the perimeter in ichabo dragging two heavy lopsided cables whlle gaok and u remained close to the operations centre this made it almost impossible for the cables to reach deep enough to encircle the hull once when we nearly succeeded it was spoilt by the cradle snagging on somethingpossibly a propeller or hydroplane belonging to the uboatand before we could do anything about it she gave one of her sudden yaws and we had to go hard astern to prevent the boats being crushed we lost her and started all over again this went on for about an hour and it seemed like sending out a new invitation to sang a to join the party every time we gunned our engines full ahead or full asternon average once every five minutesand swung the spotlight to every point of the compass to keep it homed on the conningtower when i heard through the murk the heavy crash of breakers coming from close at hand id had enough we were in the middle of yet another manoeuvrewhich meant i was doing the manoeuvring while gaok hugged u i didnt cast off my end of the cradle but cut my engine and set the winches going this had the effect of dragging ichabo bodily broadside across the gap separating the two boats u got in the way like an unwanted third at a feteatate but i couldnt help that this time gaok did the manoeuvring i jumped aboard her and told kaptein denny this is for the birds every one of the hundred million birds in the islands go on i hear breakers lots of breakers id say it was penguins turning it is penguins turning im glad someone knows where we are because j dont and if its the skietrots weve come less than a mile in a straight line since we began straight being the operative word so what distance isnt important what is important distance is time and time is sang a i retorted any time is sang a time and i dont fancy going on with this caper round penguins turning especially in the whirlpool behind it are you saying you intend to throw in the towel the only towel i want is one to dry myself with when i come up on the other side of u meaning asked kaptein denny from his tonei was glad for my own sake that i was still thinking positively about u i started to pull off my shirt im diving and taking a light line down under the uboats hull bring gaok round on her starboard beam but stop her screw for gods sakeas soon as you can i dont want my head cut in half by my own side as i surface if she jinks while youre diving id got down to my underpants ill take my chance weve lost an hour already its a lot of time when a gale a salinity level and a bunch of kamikazes are treading on your heels juttas face was closed and strained i couldnt find the right words to say to her i felt she would gladly have traded in u for anything else on the seven seas i returned to ichabo and awaited my moment both cutters were lying slightly astern of the uboat on her port quarter and i was accordingly awkwardly placed for a dive but we judged both denny and ithat her next swing would be in my direction so hed broken away in anticipation of it with his damned spotlight full on the connlngtower while ichabo lay dead in the water id been sweating in my clothes but now as i stood poised i noticed that the fiery breath of the gale which id got used lo wasnt fiery any more maybe it was because i was nearer the cold water maybe it was because i was down to my skin maybe the uboat veered this was the moment id been waiting for i went up on my toes and took the deepest breath i could there wasnt time to realize that there was less dust in the air than before i repeated the lungfilled exercise as the casing came sluggishly my way two three i dived the shock of the icy water nearly caused me to burp out all my nicely accumulated oxygen it was cold cold cold i went down down down how deep was a uboats keepabout sixteen feet then i knew i was under her because the phosphorescence dimmed when her black shadow came between me and the surface i turned on my back i wished i hadnt the hulk was trailing weed rust and underwater filth i was too deep so i bubbled out a little air turned right side up and stroked strongly forward either j misjudged or the uboat didnt complete the turn shed started because when i kicked myself surfacewards my back scraped painfully against the rough barnacles and at the same lime my head cracked against a projection i ducked automatically and threw out my hands to fend it off id emptied my lungs as i gave that final kick my fingers encountered something smooth and roundwith an object it felt like a small propeller sticking out of its snub nose it wasnt a deadly sting ray but i let go quicker than if it had been kicked as hard as i couldbumped my back againand shot to the surface i grabbed hold of the uboats halfawash rail and gasped in lungfuls of air they were as much from fear as from need gaok wasnt quite in position yet hut was coming up towards me searching the water with her spotlight i yanked myself up on to the streaming deck full astern i yelled back keep away dont come here theres a halffired lorpedo sticking out of a tube gaok went astern but it wasnt a panic manoeuvre in a couple of minutes kaptein denny had the cutter fast in her proper position i threw round a stanchion a hitch of the line which had been tied to my waist and stumbled and sloshed my way to her the plaling was wet and cold and slippery under my feet it wasnt only the cold which made me shake when i jumped aboard gaok what next the whole bloody subs loadedabove and under water it could be one of the old contacttype torpedoes driven by compressed air which the uboat aces liked for night attacks jutta said in a small voice as if trying to quiet her own fears its more likely to be an electric or acoustic torpedo its batteries must be stoned dead its probably harmless im not particularly sold on the idea of making a practical test to see what sort of torpedo it is i replied just keep gaok from bumping it will you kaptein denny youre going back then struan asked jutla of course theres a job to finish ill get you some brandy it tasted good and i went and stood kneedeep in the seagetting the hawsers fixed most of the time i worked by feel in the cold water several times big waves came and then i hung on waistdeep to the rail if the waves were doing this to me what were they doing against the fangs of penguins turning that thought made me finish the job about as quickly as if all the hardware lying around was primed and ready to go off i could hear the skietrots coming closer all the time what worded me too was the easier give of the sea under the uboat it meant the upwell cell was changing my aching arms were quivering so with the strain that i slopped the brandy when i got back to gaoks wheelhouse fine denny exclaimed nice work lets keep the medals in deep freeze until we get clear of penguins turning i havent a clue which way were heading were making a northing with some east in it ill take your word for it but meanwhile a couple of things wont have escaped your notice the seas easier the winds going i pointed to the towel id been rubbing my shoulders with see all this dirt its from the fog the fog brings down the dirt and the dirt brings down the fog not to put too fine a point on it its starting to clear our protective curtains disintegrating that means sang a said jutta plus radar plus twenty pairs of kamikaze eyes itching for a glimpse of two fishing cutters depends where she is replied kaptein denny maybe shes searching for us out to sea maybe not youd also have noted if youd been down under the hull that the silver fire is going fast that means the salinity will change less dense less lift less for u less uboat above water youre overstating the dangers weve got half the night still ahead of us look it was the skietrots its white chest with the breakers creaming over it was the giveaway because the main black part of it blended with the night but you could hear it all right that rope cradle okay aye i told him watch your moment well put both boats full ahead on s next swing that plus the current should take her clear if this wreck picks up her skirts and flies itll be the only time a skirt wont mean sex to me i hurried across us deck to lchabo opened her diesel to full bore and waited to throw in the clutch u was pushing the dying wind but not the current her underwater surfaceall eleven hundred tons of itwas solidly in its grip and being swept along the three vesselstied together came round in a wide lazy swinging circle when us nose pointed offcentre from the white target of penguins turning kaptein denny shouted full ahead well manage it give her everything i thought so too at first another point in our favour was that penguins turning was slightly farther away than id calculated because the visibility was lengthening all the time and id judged the distance by previous cutoff standards the cables took the strain of the thrusting boats and u began to forge ahead the way we wanted two knots three four i thought wed make it then it was like steering a lead coffin with a poltergeist inside the current took charge and dragged the uboat and the two cutters round as if there werent dieselpowered sheepdogs hanging on to both its flanks she span slowly deliberately menacinglyin her own way and in her own time j gave ichabo full starboard helm and i was sure kaptein denny was doing the same but it was impossible to apply a correction factor with an extra long aim i could have touched penguin turning let her have her head for the love of god i shouted let her go let her go u had managed it so many times on her own in the past maybe shed manage it this time without our fouling up whatever delicate underwater forces were in play u managed it just at her nearest point i wasnt sure which was the end of her bow with the white water breaking or which was penguins turning with white water breaking an eddy seemed to take over at the last moment then suddenly we were past and swirling churning spinning in the whirlpool in the lee of the skietrots among the races and overfalls and blinders and spray we left u to make her own way there wasnt anything else we could do sheand wewent on swinging and turning like that on and onround and round after the first few turns i began to get accustomed to the movement and pulled myself together enough to make an estimate whether we were making progress over the ground or staying in one place while we swung we were progressing but the drift was so imperceptible that it took fully half an hour to win clear of the merrygoround and begin to follow roughly the northward line of the coast towards possession c h a p t e r s i x t e e n it didnt need a crystaj ball to see that the upwell cell was breaking up the gale was down to a mere stiff breeze and was changing direction it wasnt hot any more because it was veering away from the desert seawards by virtue of the fogs condensation the muck was coming out of the sky like muddy rain and forming a coating over everything decksrigging railings and us conningtower which appeared rustier still because of it the silver had completely disappeared from the sea i crossed to gaok as soon as we had settled on a steadier course weve something like four hours until sunrise i said to kaptein denny and jutta were the nut in the crackers jaws one jaw is time the other is sang a if were going to achieve anything with the cutting equipment nows the time well start in right away denny replied it wasnt as simple as that in the first place a thick skin of barnacles overlay the steel plating of the hatch on us bridge at first try kaptein denny used the cutting blowpipe on them but the result was a loathsome fishfry smell which choked us in the confined space without getting at the metal so we set about smashing off the shellfish with hammers jutta also took a hand but it was a reluctant silent hand we had to use the spotlight to see what we were doing to me it had assumed the proportion of the biggest advertising sign in piccadilly circus finally we cleared a patch and kaptein denny slipped on his antiglare visor and attacked the steel itself with the torch without eyeshields jutta and i were forced to turn our backs on the brilliant bluewhite flame but we couldnt miss the showers of sparks which went everywhere if sang a was around and hadnt spotted that brocks benefit all i could think was that every man jack of them was on another trip the length of time kaptein denny went on made me wonder whether his enthusiasm had taken him right down into the uboats controlroom through yet i asked he cut the flame his eyes had a curious expression as though only part of him were there at all the incision wasnt through it hadnt begun four inches of toughened steel scarcely showed a mark i made a quick calculating survey not only was the hatch itself secure but the frame surrounding it was distorted and sealed by rust i experienced some of the frustration he himself must have known the first time when hed boarded u all those years before and realized there was nothing he could do to get inside her the situation didnt seem to have changed much i knew in my heart that it was a dockyard job but i wouldnt admit we were licked both kaptein denny and jutta were regarding me as though i had a solution ready i hadnt jutlas eyes were very big and there were dark circles under them the furrows in dennys face were deeper were wasting our time with that thing i said well use up all our gas without making a hole big enough to get your finger into what we reajly need is an explosive bolt fired through the pressure hull at the end of an air line then the hull should be pumped full of compressed air to give it buoyancy the next requirement is a couple of powerful derricks to get rid of the mine and torpedoesplus a skilled demolition squad after that relays of men with special gear to slice her open kaptein denny looked stockier and grimmer on hearing my evaluation of the situation when he looked at me some sort of change was in process behind his eyes his voice held a threat is that what you suggest give me a chance to think think then because i want you to understand one thing very plainly u is never going to fall into sang as hands with or without u we looked like being the losers i wasnt going to say that to him though my mind fumbled with the problem explosives mine torpedoes there was an embarrassment of riches in that direction embarrassing enough lo blow a hole in the seabed the word seabed sparked a solution the idea tumbled out roughcut and unformed because i hadnt had time to think it out ive got itwell blow her open well use the salvage bomb i filched from sang a to do it with excellent denny replied the strange unseeing look went from his eyes excellent thats it thats what well do wheres the bomb still in the dinghy struan listen i exclaimed jutta who had flinched at my suggestion it wont work a small bomb like that wont accomplish what a salvo of depth charges failed to do that hatch is fast if you use the bomb anywhere else on the hull shell come apart at the seams and go down like a stone juttas right said kaptein denny unexpectedly that doesnt mean to say the ideas basically unsound he indicated the mine that could go up in sympathy with the bomb if we detonated it on the conningtower the torpedoes likewise for the second time a word gave me the clue to a solution this time it was torpedo i see a way i said quickly well draw that halffired torpedo out of its tube we we can manage it in shajlower water with a dragline attached to one of the cutters all that will then stand between us and the interior of the sub will be the torpedotube door the salvage bomb will take care of that and send her to the bottom in the process objected jutta it wont work it wi l retorted denny well make it work well beach her thats what well do well put her ashore on her side at the bridge of magpies its the only place hereabouts well dump the mine in the channel we can do that once shes ashore by using gaoks mainboom as a derrick it sounded good to menot to jutta you both talk as if you expect the night is never going to end she exclaimed what about sang a while youre busy beaching her and blowing her open what about but denny went on as if he hadnt heard her weve time well tow her well use the upchannel current in our favour how far is the bridge of magpies do you reckon i asked jutta stood back resentful and mistrustful seveneight miles he replied weve come less than two in the past three hours weve got to do better than that we will we must it was a desperate lastchance throw and we both knew it we both knew too that we were discounting the signs in the sea and the wind the writing was on the wall that the salinity lift had droppedand us buoyancy with it the casing aft the conningtower which had been a good foot above the water when wed first come aboard was now occasionally awash forard it was almost continuously so our race against the sea and sang a was likely to turn out a very closerun thing id like to have julia with me in ichabo now j said right he replied well work up speed gradually we can manage six knots if we try maybe we could have done so if it hadnt been for that misfired torpedo which we couldnt draw until the water shallowed we safely crashed the twoand threeknot barrier on a northeasterly course towards the channel mouth and the bridge of magpies when suddenly umo yawed and wheeled at right angles we fought her with both cutters engines until we brought her to a halt lights engines shouts time time time where was sang a shes sinking slowly by the head i called across to kaptein denny in gaok on the opposite side of the uboat weve got to do something to stabilize her and offset the torpedos drag when i looked at the sodden hulk i began to have secret doubts the odds were mounting against us the uboat was ridingif her dead action could so be describedso low that most of the time now the deck was flooded attached to the deadweight by the hawser cradle the cutters too were beginning to wallow no time i answered denny its still too deep here try again we got going and worked up a little speedcrabbing through the water then with a sudden swirl we swung broadside on and the uboat and cutters became unmanageable again it takes twenty minutes and twoandahalf miles for a supertanker to come to a halt it didnt take us twoandahalf miles but it did take twenty minutes it also needed another ten to bring the uboal on to a rough course again towards the bridge of magpies for the next few hours we threw the book at u short and long bursts ahead and asternjointly and independently full and half rudder or simply no rudder at all nothing helped really we may have gained halfamilea distance the current would have carried us anyway the only difference in the later stages was that the acute swinging gave way to a long sweeping eddylike molion as we cavorted up the coast into the mouth of the channel at its southern entrance jutta stood with me in ichabos wheelhouse and watched the first light of dawn tarnish the eastern edge of the sky ichabo was to port the seaward side and gaok to starboard landwards sperrgebiet dawns are something all of their own theyre not grey but sandcoloured and you first see a long shape loom out of the blackness and it takes on the form of the top of a dune while night still hangs around the base the light comes quickly too the fact that we began to make out the long lines of the dunes ashore was ominous they should have been hidden in dense fog at that hour but the disintegrating upwell cell had thrown everything out of kilter jutta asked in a small thin voice how far to go still struan it depends on how much mileage is left in the sub there didnt seem to be much it was a marvel really that she was still with us the sea which had moderated to a swell swept clean across the casing now though the stack of torpedoes was still above water the deeper she sank the more the current took hold of herand of us we were in one of the relatively quiet phases when u was heading the way we wanted and the cutters were just nudging her along the wind was only a fresh breeze now but it had changed direction completely and settled in the southwest its true quarter there was a kind of basic despair about jutta when she surveyed the sceneas if she couldnt break out of a trap of inner darkness she asked suddenly struanwhat if hes mad really mad i glanced across at gaok kaptein denny stood like a statue at the wheel it was both a question and a call for reassurance she added master of the equinoxes lord of the solstice it sounds like something out of a phoney oldtime operetta he isnt a phoney nothing could have sounded more wayout before than his story of u returning yet she did i gestured you couldnt have more concrele proof were not lashed fast to a dreamjutta i knowi know but i cant go along with the rest of it struan maybe he suffers from some kind of delusion paranoia schizophrenia or whatever they call his particular brand of mania well prove his genuineness one way or another pretty soon when we blow the sub open and see whats inside her what happens then her attitude implied ifnot when after weve got the book of tsu ill take it from there she looked so cast down that i put one arm round her and drew her close to me look theres our target ahead wisps of fog clung to the bridge of magpies it appeared more brown than black in the muted light its not faronly about a mile to go fog lifting clear day empty horizon moderate sea not a thing in sight i want you to know that whatever happens in the next few hours i love you more than any words of mine can say and i you jutta but her body against mine was hard and unresponsive and tensionshot she went on her voice was higher pitchedvibrated with nerves where is sang a struan where what if shes tracking us at this very moment with her radar now that the sandstorms over just waiting to pounce when it suits herwatching us steady i said steady theres not a sign of her well win out yet its all too quiet everythings cooking up underneath i feel it struan i isnt there anything you can do the waitings sending me crazy ahoy there it was kaptein denny from the subs conningtower i was surprised to see him there j reckoned he must have left gaoks bridge unnoticed while wed been occupied come up here will you both of you and bring the bomb along too right i called ill fetch it from the dinghy to jutta i said quietly wonder what hes got in mindwe shouldnt need the bomb until we beach her she didnt answer but cast an anxious glance round the widening horizon i collected the bomb and we sloshed across the wet deck and up the rusty ladder to the uboats bridgestepping over the rubber cables which led to the cutting torch after that long effort previously wed changed cylinders and connected up to full ones in ichabo wed switched them from one boat to the other to obtain a better weight distribution kaptein denny was seated on the captains jumpstool to which id secured the emergency wire which held the mine the brass nozzle of the blowpipe cutter was hooked on to the coaming which encircled the bridge at chestlevel i was surprised to see sang as submachinegun on the floor i looked up to question denny about it i was more curious than apprehensiveand immediately i was aware of a great change in him what had previously disquieted me about his eyes when wed been deadlocked over the problem of opening up u had now become a reality they were slightly hooded with tiredness but clear and intense with a kind of exultation he had a smile of welcome for jutta he might already have found the book of tsu rather than be facing a day of peril and difficulties what do you want the bomb for at this stage i asked he replied with a question how secure is that mine if it lasted last night itll last today the sawing effect of the seas gone as you can observe for yourself what i mean isif your emergency cable broke suddenly would the original cable still hold probably it took my weight for a short while when i fixed it i noticed then that he had his taisho pistol in his beltalong with an oddshaped knife with a flat handle i hadnt seen before put the bomb down he went on i did so would you agree with me that were heading north north sure but why j didnt complete my question because something crossed his face which sent an adrenalincharge of fear and doubt racing through me good he said good in japan the dead always face north both ships and men he got to his feet and pointed ahead changing the subject rapidly before our apprehension had time to crystallize took the top of the bridge of magpies was catching the first sun the soaring arch wasnt composed of rock but of feathers hundreds of thousands of duncoloured little birds that had been blown out of the desert by the gale and had found shelter on the archs seaward side they arent real magpies of course but little desert birds they give that name to he was speaking rapidly as if time were running out on him and he had something important to say before it did it was like that the day you were born miss jutta theres an old hottentot superstition once a year they believe on the day after the great gale the girl walks across the bridge of magpies and joins the lover i glanced at jutta who stood taut and poised a mixture of pity and growing horror in her eyes outwardly she was composed but i knew she was very close to the edge shed been right about his sanity the unconnected prattle and mercurial leaps from subject to subject meant only one thing his next words to me confirmed it id like you to cut the old mine cable with the blowpipe leave the new one you used for the repair here where i can reach it he restated himself on the jumpstool and plucked al the wire i noticed that he put his foot on the submachinegum kaptein denny there was a rising note in juttas voice the dead always face north both shipsand men miss jutta were now facing north the final clincher on the fact that he was out of his mind came when he added im going to drop that mine on the stack of torpedoes and blow up u kamikaze thats a good word for whats happening j thought my eyes fixed on kaptein dennys seamed exalted face thats the way the kamikaze or divine wind spirit worked in the jap fliers who plunged their bombladen planes to selfdestruction through the yanks withering ackack fire and on to their carriers decks kamikaze sperrgebietstyle divine wind spirit gone bad the things eaten into his mind all the years and now hes at the end of the line i wonder what the cinc will say when he gets to hear of it he wont know what happenedof course because there wont be any survivors kaptein denny wasnt reacting to my scrutiny his face was remote in his last moments he was remembering things and places wed had no part of the external worldour worldmeant nothing to him you cant exclaimed jutta why i demanded peremptorily i had to get past that mental state of his why i did get past there he pointed there was no mistaking sang as whalebacked snout and low hull she was rounding the southern end of possession past the tiny horseshoeshaped curve called black prince cove and heading into the channel at yus he must have spotted her out to sea before he crossed to u from gaok jutta and i stood rooted then from behind us there was a smothered noise from kaptein denny we swung round hed pulled up his jersey and jabbed that odd knife into himself he covered up the wound right away but wed seen the rush of blood juttas face screwed up he said in the same quiet and compelling way hed had when he told us about being master of the equinoxes what i must do now i must do alone this is harakiri i must admit that the method of dropping a mine on a load of torpedoes is rather unique crude but effective the first ceremonial cut in the stomach is called seppuku the pain lunged at him and he caught his breath there wont be time for the rest of the procedure he tried to smile traditionalists even have a warriors meal of dry chestnuts and cold sake beforehand how close is sang a out of range but shes got a heavy machinegun mounted for ard i know jutta and i also knew now that he was as sane as we were only his eyes looked a little tired and his face was sallower and finerdrawn from the blood he was losingprobably i saidthe girl goes to join the lover now go we didnt take it in for a few moments that he was giving us our lives then jutta broke the spell she went towards himto kiss him i thinkbut he waved her back gently sorry you mustnt touch a dead man miss jutta after seppuku im dead she knelt on the rusty plating and he sat on the jumpstool with his right leg stretched out in front of him to ease the pain he took the taisho from his belt slipped a shell out of itscratched some words on the blade of the knife and gave it to jutta mei fa tzu it is fate he quoted what do you want me to do i asked hoarsely first cut away the old mine cable i put a match to the blowpipe it was only a matter of seconds before the section of rusty cable snapped under the flame and thumped against the conningtower the new piece i d fitted still held the mine suspended good he said he handed me his pistol now i want you to take gaok have her afterwards for yourselfand fire four shots as a signal when sang as close enough do you understand i understand kaptein denny i wont be able to get up and judge the range he went on youll be my eyes i want the signal distinct because sang a will be firing too onetwo onetwo then ill know wheres sang a now there was a burst of machinegun fire from the black ship i ducked involuntarily out of range thatll be kenryo trying his hand that machinegun of theirs cant train completely forard because of the whaleback he said sang a will have to sheer slightly to one side when she comes closer to bring it to bear shell lose ground by doing so i shot an anxious glance at the approaching ship anything more no you werent a headman of course no navy give my regrets to your chief do that jura said in a strangled whispermaster of the equinoxes he said kaptein denny was a long long act its good to be myself again now run for your seventh life jutta clung tight to me and i halfledhalfcarried ha down the ladder off the bridge there was another spatter of fire from sang a when they saw us but they were still loo far away to do us any harm i slipped the rope cradle which held gaok to u and gunned the engine gaok pulled away from the uboat sang a was pushing hard and the water was white under her bows she sheered to one side in order to brlng the heavy machinegun to bear as kaptein denny said she would have to enabling gaok to gain some valuable distance there was a staccato ratattat but the volley fell short twenty yards short extreme range sang a pulled back on to her coarse gaok was worklng up to full speed but the black ship wasnt interested in us yet then she veered again and the next burst spanged off the conningtower theyre in range now judge it i told myself judge it and dont panic because a few yards will make all the difference between life and death when the moment comes gaoks life and death ours the machinegun cut off abruptly theyd got wise to that mine then came several isloated lighter shots sniper thats kenryos gun hes trying to pick off kaptein denny hell be all right if he doesnt show himself from behind the protection of the conningtower i darent wait any longer sang as coming on like an express two or three other automatics joined in with kenryos now i stepped out on deck with jutta i raised the taisho and fired into the air onetwo onetwo i crushed jutta to me there she whispered above us conningtower the bluewhile flame of the blowtorch was brighter than the daylight and there was a little cascade of sparks where kaptein denny attacked the wire at the point where it looped over the bridge coaming sang a was close to her well within the explosion area and firing nonstop then the sparks flared up i pulled jutta to the deck with me gaoks steel rail rolled up like fencing as the blast from the explosion hit her she leapt and bottomed again with a keelshaking crash water bits of glass metal rope and planks rained on us we lay there until they had stopped then we picked ourselves upand i held her and we looked her heart was hammering away against my chest the sea was empty there was no sign through the yellow haze of the shockwave of either u or sang a the surface of the water where they had been such a short while before was llttered with steamingblackened fragments and unidentifiable pieces of ship sizzling as they sank landwards the mushroom of the explosion towered above the bridge of magpies it wasnt smoke it was a million birds we stood silent trying to comprehend the swift totality of the catastrophe the silence was as total as if our eardrums had burst the only thing that stirred was the yellow haze over the water it was because i was watching the movement of those wisps rising like a ghost from a body that i spotted another movement out at sea above the low promontory where black prince cove was situated it too was wraithlike a tall lattice mast with radar scanner and aerials swinging slightly with the roll of ship to which it belonged i stared at the disembodied thing above the point of land as if id never been a navy man and had never seen a frigates tophamper before jutta i the frigate shes here like a film image growing out of the islands extremity the bow of the frigate emerged then the low lean midships section and finally the stern with its boil of white thrown up by engines going full speed ahead jutta said kaptein denny must have got off your message after all no jutta he assured me he had not theres some other explanation the sound of engineroom bells came across the water the fairest cape went full astern when she sighted us and altered course to avoid the stained patch of debris on the seas surface she skirted it and came slowly towards gaok whiteclad figures were at her rail and on her bridge gawp ing unashamedly all you could say for gaok was thal she was still afloat the frigate lost way and stopped they threw us a line come on up said a voice from her deck have you any casualties no casualties jutta went first up the rope ladder and i followed when i got level with the warships rail there was a shrilling of bo suns pipes for one impossible moment i thought they were for me but no navy extends an excaptain an admirals honours they were for the cinc he came along the deck towards us and i found myself wanting to jump to attention at the sight of so much brassuntil i remembered my stained torn headmans rig the little admiral held out his hand to me he barely spared jutta a glance glad to see you struan what was the big bang a mine and an old sub full of torpedoes he gave me a shrewd penetrating glance and the other extreme of his vision took in the dirty patch of sea reaction began to hit me all i wanted was a drink maybe two rough pretty rough i was hanging around out of sight below the horizon i couldnt get here in time when things started to get hot the sandstorm put paid to using the ships helicopterof course in addition we didnt want to scare sang a away id also had fake radio signals sent off to bluff her into thinking that the frigate was hundreds of miles away they worked ajl right resentmentand a strange wave of feeling for kaptein dennyswept over me at the thought that almost within reach had been the help wed so desperately needed to pull off our plan the little bastard all in white and gold braid had used me as a bait while he sat at the ringside watching the final drama take place on a radar screen safe out of harms way of mines torpedoes and sang as guns i dont need a nursemaidthen or now i snapped he grinnedand i hated him the more for it it scans youve got yourself one you havent introduced me jutta walsh i said shes part of the story he shook her hand and then swung on his heels linking his arms in both of ours and leading us along the deck between the crew i wasnt sure who was more astonishedthey or us and its a long storyfrom both sides he added i think we all could use a drink id downed my second pink gin sitting with the admiral and jutta in a big private cabin by the time id given hint an outline of the events which led up to the last fatal explosion because it was nearest in time and so vivid still i started with it relating events backwards when i told him about the book of tsu and its naval significance he stirred unhappily in his chair but he let me finish then he asked when did you get wise to sang a found out she had a machinegun mounted forard ah i he exclaimed that machinegun thats what gave her away to ustoo us weeks ago when you were still enjoying the delights of santorin one of our longrange maritime reconnaissance planes located sang a about three hundred miles south of the cape we caught her with her pants down they were exercising with that gun we photographed her it confirmed our earlier suspicions earlier what dye mean sang a first came to the navys notice when she arrived at mauritius aboul two months ago an agent of ours there reported her we we keep an eye on all the red navys comings and goings now thal they use mauritius as a base for the indian ocean it was a routine report which wasnt routine sang a was at that stage sailing in company with a soviet amurclass naval repair ship the pm and a modified akademik kurchatovclass oceanographic ship at first glance she appeared to be a salvage vessel which the reds were using in conjunction with the other two what intrigued silvermine however was that such an oldfashioned type of vessel should be in use with all the modern stuff russia has nowadays that ancient funnel and whaleback at that stage sang a was no more than a tantalizing sus picion we decided to watch her she sailed from mauritiusalone we thought wed lost her until one of our planes found her again at extreme range between the cape and marion island the fact that she was so far away from normal shipping mules chalked up another black mark against her she was photographed and shadowed the pictures showed she was doing eighteen knotsnot bad for the type of old crate she pretended lo be they ajso revealed something elsepart of her underwater lines as she rolled in the rough seas of the roaring forties we decided that her hull was a modified kashinclass destroyer with all that junk on top as a bluff i refilled my glass it would have helped me if youd told me some of this by hindsight yesby foresight no what did silverman really know we have suspicious ships passing the cape all the time the other day we had an entire red squadron complete with the new kresta itclass guided missile cruiser marshal vorashilov our longrange planes shadowed them too what made sang a any different i demanded ill tell you we kept tabs on her as she approached the cape both by means of longrange flights and silvermines own topsecret electronic detecting apparatus then as j said before a plane spotted her gun in action but it was when she used her radio that she gave herself away what did she say jts not what she said bat the way she said it dont get you wed been monitoring her signals of course theyd ostensibly been directed to the basjkiriya the ocean research vessel she accompanied to mauritius which was then working in the southern indian ocean incidentally the basjkiriya was much too near the kerguelen islands where the french intend building a naval base for anyones liking sang as signals were in code naturally but we had a pretty fair idea of what they were all about he chuckled ironically at some inner amusement weather sea and so on another bluff howd you know they were since your day weve built up at silvermine an intelligence service which we modestly think is as good as the yanks used to have during the war at pearl harbour in the codebusting game you never get more than ten to fifteen per cent of any signal straight the rest is a lot of inspired deduction from isolated word groups you also learn to know the fist of your opponentevery radio operator has his own way of transmitting its an individual as fingerprints and my men recognized the fist of sang as operator hed been admiral gorshkovshead of the soviet navyown choice for a new type of supercruiser called the kara to be in kara he would have to have been lops wed spotted the kara on her maiden shakedown voyage south of the cape all this was mighty interesting but it still didnt tell us what sang a was up to or where she was bound for then by chance i myself came in on the codebusting sang a got off a long messagemost of it was lost on usbut my team picked up the words u it meant nothing to them it meant everything to me after that i was prepared to put my head on a block that her destination was the bridge of magpies jutta said in a distant voice as if she were still frozen inside by the disaster shed witnessed its history repeating itself the cinc gave her a considering glance and went on thats when i decided that you were the man for the job the lost city was a blindof course i found myself another drink and said dryly i had come to that conclusion myself you wouldnt have been the man i thought you were if you hadnt he went on brushing aside the interruption if the bridge of magpies hadnt been sang as destination no harm would have been done koch would have kept stringing you along you nearly blew us skyhigh when you recognized the picture of the fresco it was santorins of course koch louched it up a little he is quite genuinely a middenhunter although hes on silvermines intelligence muster was i corrected he stared at me and his face darkened if you take your binoculars you can see his grave next to a burntout landrover ashore i told him about it and how kenryos gang had killed him and breekbout when id finished he said very quietly id like to have been able to shake kaptein denny by the hand for what he did at the end after that he also got himsejf another drink and went to the porthole and stared out for a long time then he swung round on jutta and said in a matteroffact tone youre the only piece of the jigsaw which doesnt fit youre not a relic of a vanished civilization i rushed to her defence and he gave me an amused mantoman look id like it better in her own words my father she began and told him of her search and researches as she went along i watched his attitude change until now it had been brisk and businesslikewith a shade of apprecialionover sang a now it softened if a face hewn by war sea and command could be said to soften he went and sat on the arm of a chair next to her and swirled his drink round and roundhis eyes fixed on the spinning liquid as if it were a crystal ball which was mesmerizing him by conjuring up the past he never looked up until she had finished she added j missed my chance to speak to you about it when i didnt get to luderitz but my own business has been completely lost sight of in these other terrible things that have happened if its worth anything now my files still open the cinc stood up and looked down at her with a curious unexpected compassion she met his eyes startled and questioning he held out both his hands to her and she raised herself to her feet i think i have a final notation for your file he said he put his arm round her shoulders come this is for you alone it may be something of a shock he opened the door and led her out on to the deck and as he did so the sun came out and shone on her bright hair
