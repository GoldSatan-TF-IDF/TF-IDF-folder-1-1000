robert wilson a small death in lisbon she was lying on a crust of pine needles looking at the sun through the branches beyond the splayed cones through the nodding fronds yes yes yes she was thinking of another time another place when shed had the smell of pine in her head the sharpness of resin in her nostrils thered been sand underfoot and the sea somewhere over there not far beyond the shell shed held to her ear listening to the roar and thump of the waves she was doing something shed learned to do years ago forgetting wiping clean rewriting little paragraphs of personal history painting a different picture of the last halfhour from the moment shed turned and smiled to the question can you tell me how it wasnt easy this forgetting business no sooner had she forgotten one thing rewritten it in her own hand than along came something else that needed reworking all this leading to the one thing that she didnt like roaming loose around her head that she was forgetting who she was but this time as soon as shed thought the ugly thought she knew that it was better for her to live in the present moment to only move forward from the present in millimetre moments the pine needles are fossilizing in the backs of my thighs was as far as she got in present moments a light breeze reminded her that shed lost her pants her breast hurt where it was trapped under her bra a thought tugged at her hell come back hes seen it in my face hes seen it in my face that i know him and she did know him but she couldnt place him couldnt name him she rolled on to her side and smiled at what sounded like breakfast cereal receiving milk she knelt and gripped the rough bark of the pine tree with the blunt ends of her fingers the nails bitten to the quick one with a thin line of drying blood she brushed the pine needles out of her straight blonde hair and heard the steps the heavy steps boots on frosted grass no move yourself she couldnt get the panic to move herself shed never been able to get the panic to move herself a flash as fast as a yard of celluloid ripped through her head and she saw a little blonde girl sitting on the stairs crying and peeing her pants because hed chased her and she couldnt stand to be chased the rush the gust of terrible energy the wind up the stairs whistling under the door the forces winding up to deliver doors banging far off in the house the thud the thud of a watermelon dropped on tiles split skin pink flesh her blonde hair reddened the cranial crack opened up the bark bit a corner of her forehead her big blue eye saw into the black canyon part one chapter i friday th june paco de arcos near lisbon ladies and gentlemen said the mayor of paco de arcos may i present to you inspector jose afonso coelho it had been a hot day with a perfect blue sky and now a soft lick of a breeze was coming off the ocean to mess with the poplars and pepper trees in the public gardens the faded pink disused cinemas walls drank in the evening light a small girl squealed rocking on a happy dinosaur a big man smoked and sucked beer next to her women greeted each other with kisses their dresses rippled in the cool cars flashed past on the marginal a light aeroplane sputtered out to sea over the sand bank the air was redolent of grilled sardines and a bureaucrat had a microphone ze coelho said the mayor using my more recognized name but still not squeezing out much more interest from the festa de santo antonio crowd which included my sixteenyearold daughter olivia my sister and brotherinlaw and four of their seven children the mayor talked on elaborately explaining the event in rococo portuguese to a robustly inattentive public consisting mostly of my neighbours who were well apprised of the bare facts which were my wife died a year ago i put on weight to encourage me to take it off my daughter arranged this charity event with money pledged against each kilo lost and if i was a single gram over eighty kilos i was to have my perfect neatlyclipped beard of twenty years shaved off in front of this rabble my daughter waved at me my brotherinlaw gave me a thumbsup i weighed in that morning at seventyeight kilos my stomach hadnt been as hard and flat since i was eighteen and id been cycling kilometres a week with the police trainer i was feeling supremely confident until the mayor had started talking there was something mannered about the crowds insouciance something insincere about my brotherinlaws encouragement even my daughters wave i had a part to play i knew it at that moment a fat man balding with a heavy moustache wearing a blazer grey slacks and a wild tie arrived at my daughters table he kissed her on both cheeks and squeezed her shoulder one of my nieces made room for him and after shaking everybodys hands he sat down there was a sudden silence the mayor had arrived at the money there was respect for the money two million eight hundred and fortythree thousand nine hundred and eighty escudos the crowd went up like a flight of fantails that even i had to agree was a hell of a lot of money for seventeen kilos of lard i held up my hand and took the applause like a returning monarch the band on the stand behind me cut in on my dignity and played a jaunty little number as if i was a toureiro whod just executed a blinding move against the bull and a group of small girls in traditional costume broke out into disorganized elephantine dancing two local fishermen lifted a set of scales up on to the platform the crowd left their seats by the bar and rushed the stage the fat man sitting next to my daughter had his pen out and was writing the mayor was fighting people off who wanted a go with the microphone which hed stuffed inside his suit and the speakers were carrying the crunching explosions from his armpit calm was restored by my doctor mounting the podium he balanced a pincenez on his nose and explained the rules like an oncologist whod been asked to give a terrible prognosis without holding back on the details he introduced my barber whod crept up behind me with a cloak and scissors i stepped out of my shoes and on to the scales the doctor adjusted the top scale to eighty and counted down from eightynine the crowd joined in i held my head up gave them the full force of my brandnew bridgework closed my eyes and thoughtsouffle heliumfilled souffle at eightythree i heard the crowd wavering i was levitating like a brahmin at eightytwo my eyes snapped open the scales middled out and the doctor gravely announced major surgery i was outraged the crowd roared the two fishermen pressed me into a chair i lashed out the girls in national costume fled did i overdo that i remonstrated and allowed myself to be pinioned my barber stropped his razor and looked at me out of the halfclosed lids of a casual killer the mayor shouted his eyes clean out of his head until he remembered the microphone ze ze ze he said bringing forward the fat bald moustachioed man whod been sitting with my family this is senhor miguel da costa rodrigues director of the banco de oceano e rocha he has something to tell you the mans skin texture clearly indicated he was earning five times my monthly salary per hour even when he was eating lobster on the beach it gives me great pleasure on behalf of the banco de oceano e rocha to make the following offer if inspector coelho will accept the doctors ruling and allow his beard to be shaved this cheque made out for a total of three million escudos will join the sum already pledged for charity making a total fund of nearly six million escudos youd have thought sporting had lifted the european cup by the noise the crowd made there was nothing to be done grace was imperative fifteen minutes later i looked like that rare thinga portuguese badger i was pretty well passed overhead to the bar a bandeira vermelha which was run by an old friend antonio borrego who billed himself as the last communist in portugal the bank director was pressed in there with me along with my daughter and the rest of my family and even the mayor found his way to my side with the microphone still in his top pocket antonio assembled the beers in glassfrosted ranks he was a man who needed a meal a lifetime of meals the sort who couldnt put on weight if you sat a pig in his lap he had a concave white hairy chest eyes sunken deep into his head and untrained eyebrows off the leash his forearms were as wiry and covered in hair as a monkeys and he had a past i didnt know the half of olivia the fat man and myself took a beer each antonio had his polaroid out to record the event for his wall of bacchanalia i wouldnt know you any more he said to me i need a reference i raised my glass tears rolled down the side the emotional beer with my first drink for days i said i propose a toast to the health and generosity of senhor miguel da costa rodrigues of the banco de oceano e rocha olivia told me how she knew the banker she was at school with his daughter and cut clothes for her mother he was wearing one of her ties hed even offered to set her up in the fashion business i told him i wanted her to finish her education an expensive international school in carcavelos paid for by her english grandparents who didnt want a granddaughter who couldnt speak their language the banker sighed at a missed opportunity olivia sulked for show we all had parts to play a toast said senhor rodrigues getting into the spirit to olivia coelho for making all this possible we drank again and olivia planted a red o on my new white cheek one more thing i said to the packed bar buzzing with beer who fixed the scales there were two seconds of frostbritde silence until i smiled a glass smashed and the barber came in with a plastic bag which he presented to me your clippings he said weighing it with a kiss a twokilo bed for your cat dont tell me that now it must have been what you had living in there that weighed said the mayor we all looked at him he fingered his microphone antonio put three more beers on the counter olivia and i turned into each other me i said to her quietly i think it was the past all tangled up in it she licked a finger and wiped the lipstick off my cheek her eyes brimfull for a moment youre right said antonio suddenly between us historys a weight a dead weight too isnt that right senhor rodrigues senhor rodrigues belched politely into his hand not used to proletarian drink history repeats itself he said and even antonio laughedthe communist who can smell the pork meat of a capitalist when theyre roasting him as far away as the alentejo youre right said antonio historys only a weight to those that lived it for the next generation its no heavier than a few school books and forgotten with a glass of beer and the latest cd eh antonio i said have a beer yourself its friday night tomorrows your saints day the poor people of paco de arcos are nearly six million better off and im back on the drink the new history antonio smiled and said to the future we all went out to eat that night even senhor rodrigues who might not have been used to the metal tables and chairs but appreciated the food it was the meal my stomach had growled over for six months ameijoas a bulhao pato clams in white wine garlic and fresh coriander robalo grelhado grilled sea bass caught off the cliffs at cabo da roca that morning borrego assado alentejo lamb cooked until its falling apart red wine from borba coffee as strong as a mulattos kiss and to finish aguardente amarela the yellow fiery one senhor rodrigues left for his house in cascais at the aguardente stage olivia went to a club in cascais with a bunch of her friends soon after i gave her the taxi fare home i drank two more amarelinhas and went to bed with a litre of water inside me and two aspirins the pillow soft and cool against my naked burning cheeks i woke in the night for ten seconds confused in the darkness and feeling as big and as solid as the central pillar in a motorway bridge id dreamt luridly but one image stucka clifftop walk in the dark of an evening a sheer drop close by somewhere the sea roar out there its saltine prickle bursting up from the rocks below fear apprehension and excitement rose up and i fell into more sleep it was at about that time that a girl started to make her dent in the sand no more than a few hundred metres away from where i was sleeping her eyes wide open she moonbathed to a night full of stars her blood slack her skin cold and hard as fresh tuna chapter ii saturday th june paco de areas near lisbon plates were crashing on to a marble floor plates were crashing and smashing and endlessly shattering on the marble floor i surfaced into the brutal noise the harshest reality there is of a phone going off in a hangover at am i wrenched the handset to my ear the blissful silence the faint sea hiss of a distant mobile my boss eng jaime leal narciso gave me a good morning and i tried to find some moisture in my beak to reply ze he asked yes its me i said which came out in a whisper as if i had his wife next to me youre all right then he said but didnt wait for the reply look the body of a young girls been found on the beach at paco de arcos and i want those words trampolined me off the bed the phone jack yanked the handset from my grip and i cannoned off the door frame into the hall i thundered down the distressed strip of carpet and wrenched the door open her clothes lay in a track from the door to the bedclumpy bigheeled shoes black silk top lilac shirt black bra black flares olivia was twisted into her sheet face down her bare arms and shoulders spread her black hair as soft and shiny as sable splashed across the pillow i drank heavily in the bathroom until my belly was taut with water i snatched the phone to my ear and lay down on the bed again bom dia senhor engenheiro i said addressing him by his degree in science as was usual if youd given me two seconds id have told you she was blonde i should have checked last night but i paused synapses clashed painfully why are you calling me at six in the morning to tell me about a body on the beach throw your mind back to the weekend roster and youll find im off duty well the point is youre two hundred metres from the situation and abilio who is on duty lives in seixal which as you know it would be im in no condition to i said my brain still blundering around ah yes i forgot how was it how are you cooler about the face good more fragile in the head they say it could get up to forty degrees today he said not listening where are you sir on my mobile a good answer theres some good news ze he said quickly im sending someone to help you whos that a young guy very keen good for leg work whose son is he i didnt catch that you know i dont like to tread on anybodys toes this lines breaking up he shouted look hes very capable but he could use some experience i cant think of anybody better does that mean nobody else would have him his name is carlos pinto he said ignoring my question i want him to see your approach your very particular approach you know you have this ability with people they talk to you i want him to see how you operate does he know where hes going ive told him to meet you in that communists bar you like so much hes bringing the latest missing persons printout will he recognize me ive told him to look for someone whos just had his beard shaved off after twentyodd years an interesting test dont you think the signal finally broke up he knew narciso knew they all knew even if id been a stick insect those scales would still have come out at eightytwo kilos you cant trust anybody these days not your own daughter not your own family not even the policia judiciaria i showered and dried off in front of the mirror old eyes new face looked back at me having just levered myself over forty maybe i was too old for this kind of change and yet just as my wife had said i would i looked five years younger without the beard sunlight was beginning to colour the blue into the ocean just visible from the bathroom window a fishing smack pushed through it and for the first time in a year i had that same surge of hope a feeling that today could be the first day of a different life i dressed in a white longsleeved shirt short sleeves lack gravitas a light grey suit and a pair of black brogues i selected one of the thirty ties olivia had made for me a quiet one not one that a pathologist would like to trap in a petri dish i went to the top of the shabby wooden stairs and had a momentary feeling of a man whos just been told to take a grand piano down on his own i left the house my crumbling mansion which i inherited from my parents at a peppercorn rent and headed for the cafe the plaster was flaking off the garden wall which was reckless with unpruned bougainvillea i made a mental note to let the riot continue from the public gardens i looked back at the faded pink house whose long windows had lost all their white paint and thought that if i didnt have to go and inspect bludgeoned brutalized bodies i could persuade myself that i was a retired count whose annuity was in a vice i was nervous part of me willing this day not to proceed to my first meeting with a new person and my face nakedall that sizing up all that accommodation all that and no mask too a corner of pepper trees in the gardens whispered to each other like parents who didnt want to wake the kids beyond them antonio who never slept who hadnt slept he once told me since was winding down his red canvas awning which sported only the name of his bar and no advertising for beer or coffee i didnt expect to see you before midday he said nor did i i said but at least you recognized me i followed him in and he started the coffee grinder which was like a wirewool scrub on my eyeballs yesterdays polaroid was already up on his memorial wall i didnt recognize myself at first the younglooking one between the fat man and the pretty girl except that olivia wasnt looking very girlish either more more of a i thought you were off today said antonio i was but a bodys been found on the beach anyone been in yet no he said looking out vaguely in the direction of the beach washed up the body i dont know standing in the doorway wearing a dark suit which had been cut in salazars time and had knucklebrushing sleeves was a young guy he approached the bar stiffly as if it was his first time on tv and asked for a bica the oneinch shot of caffeine which adrenalizes a few million portuguese hearts every morning he watched the black and tan mixture trickle into the cups antonio turned the grinder off and the golfball cleaner effect on my eyeballs eased the young guy put two sugar sachets into his coffee and asked for a third i flicked him one of mine he stirred it lengthily to a syrup you must be inspector senhor doutor jose afonso coelho he said not looking at me but glancing up at the hammer and sickle antonio kept behind the bar his relics engenheiro narciso will be pleased i said glancing around the empty bar how did you guess his head flicked round he must have been midtwenties but he looked no different than he had done at sixteen his dark brown eyes connected with mine he was irritated you look vulnerable he said and nodded that into me for effect antonios eyebrows changed places an interesting observation agente pinto i said grimly most people would have commented on the whiteness of my cheeks and theres no need to call me doutor it doesnt apply i thought you had a degree in modern languages but from london university and there you dont get called a doctor until you have a phd just call me ze or inspector we shook hands i liked him i didnt know why i liked him narciso thought i liked everybody but he had that confused in his mind with getting on with people which he couldnt do himself because he was colder and rougherskinned than a shark with blood on its radar the fact was id only ever loved one woman and the people id call close were in single figures and now carlos what was it about him that suit oldfashioned too big and wool in summer said no vanity and no money his hair black durable disobedient short as a troopers said to me anyway serious and dependable his irritated look said defiant touchy his first words direct candid perceptive said uncompromising a difficult combination for a policeman i could see why nobody else would have him i didnt know about london he said my father was over there i said so what do you know about your father was an army officer you spent a lot of time in africa in guinea youve been seventeen years on the force eight of them as a homicide detective have you accessed my file no i asked engenheiro narciso he didnt tell me everything he said sucking in his thick coffee he didnt say what rank your father was for instance antonios eyebrows switched back again and a glint of partisan interest came from deep in his eye sockets a political question was my father one of the younger officers who started the revolution or old guard both men waited my father was a colonel i said how did he end up in london ask him i said nodding to antonio no appetite for this how long have you got he asked gripping the edge of the bar no time at all i said theres a dead body waiting for us on the beach we crossed the gardens to the marginal and went through the underpass to a small car park in front of the clube desportivo de paco de arcos there was a driedfish and diesel smell amongst the old boats lying on their sides or propped up on tyres amongst rusted trailers and rubbish bins a halved oil drum was smoking with two planks of wood burning to heat a pan of oil a couple of fishermen i knew were ignoring the scene and sorting through the marker buoys and crab and lobster pots in front of their corrugated iron work shacks i nodded and they looked across to the crowd that had already formed even at this early hour the line of people that had gathered at the low stone balustrade on the edge of the beach and along the harbour wall were looking down on to the sand some broadbacked working women had taken time out to distress themselves over the tragedy muttering through their fingers ai mae coitadinha o mother poor little thing there were four or five policia de seguranza publica boys ignoring the total contamination of the crime scene and talking to two members of the policia maritima another two hours and thered be girls on the beach to chat up and then not even the policia maritima would have had a look in i introduced myself and asked them whod found the body they pointed to a fisherman sitting further along the harbour wall the position of the body above the flattened sand of the highest tide mark told me that the victim hadnt been washed up but dumped thrown from just about where i was standing off the harbour wall it was a threemetre drop the policia maritima were satisfied that the body hadnt been washed up but wanted it confirmed from the pathologist that there was no water in the lungs they gave me authority to start my investigation i sent the psp men along the harbour wall to move the onlookers back to the road the police photographer made himself known and i told him to take shots from above as well as down on the beach the girls naked body was twisted at the waist her left shoulder buried in the sand her face with just a single graze on the forehead was turned upwards eyes wide open she was young her breasts still high and rounded not far below her clavicles the muscle of her torso was visible below the rib cage and she carried a little puppy fat on her belly her hips lay flat her left leg straight the right turned out at the knee its heel close to her buttock and right hand which was thrown behind her id put her at under sixteen and i could see why the fisherman hadnt bothered to go down to look for life her face was pale apart from the cut the lips purple and her intensely blue eyes vacant there were no footprints around the body i let the photographer down there to take his closeups the fisherman told me hed been on his way to his repair shack at am when he saw the body he knew she was dead from the look of her and he didnt go down on to the beach but straight along the marginal beyond the boatyard of the clube desportivo to the direccao de farois to ask them to phone the policia maritima i squeezed my chin and found flesh instead of beard i looked dumbly at my palm as if my hand was in some way responsible i needed new tics for my new face i needed a new job for my new life dead girl on the beach the seagulls screeched perhaps being exposed was making me more sensitive to the minutiae of everyday life the pathologist arrived a small dark woman called fernanda ramalho who ran marathons when she wasnt examining dead bodies i was right she said her eyes coming back to me after id introduced carlos pinto who was writing everything down in his notebook the best kind of pathologists always are fernanda youre handsome there were those who thought you were hiding a weak chin under there is that what people think these days i said running for cover that men grow beards to hide something when i was a kid everybody had a beard why do men grow beards she asked genuinely perplexed the same reason dogs lick their balls said carlos pen poised our heads snapped round because they can he finished fernanda enquired with an eyebrow its his first day i said which annoyed him again twice in less than an hour this boy had shingles of the mind fernanda took a step back as if he might start lapping why didnt narciso tell me the kid wasnt housetrained the photographer finished his closeups and i nodded to fernanda who was standing by with her bag open wearing a pair of surgical gloves check your list i said to carlos whod disassociated himself from me see if theres a fifteensixteenyearold girl blonde hair blue eyes metres fiftyfive kilos any distinguishing marks fernanda she held up her hand muttering into her dictaphone she inspected the abrasion on the girls forehead carlos flicked through the missingpersons sheets plenty of names in the black hole more cars flashed by on the marginal fernanda minutely inspected the girls pubic hair and vagina start with the ones whove gone in the last twentyfour hours i said carlos sighed fernanda unrolled a plastic sheet in front of her she removed a thermometer from the girls armpit and eased her over on to her front some rigor mortis had already started with a pair of tweezers she picked her way through a mash of hair blood and sand at the back of the girls head she reached for a plastic evidence sachet and fed something into it and marked it up she sheafed the girls hair and kissed the dictaphone again she looked down the length of the girls body parted the buttocks with finger and thumb speaking all the time she clicked off the dictaphone mole at the back of the neck in the hairline central coffeecoloured birthmark inside left thigh fifteen centimetres above the knee she shouted if it was her parents who reported it that should be enough i said catarina sousa oliveira said carlos handing me the sheet an ambulance arrived two paramedics walked to the back one pulled out a stretcher the other carried the bodybag fernanda stood back from the body and brushed herself off i walked down the harbour wall to the sea it was barely am and the sun already had some needle in it to my left looking east was the mouth of the tagus and the massive pillars of the th april suspension bridge which floated footless in a heavy mist with the sun higher the sea wasnt so much blue any more as a panelbeaten silver sheet small fishing boats moored off the beach rocked on the dazzling surface in the mornings breeze a passenger jet came in low above the river and banked over the cement works and beaches of caparica south of the tagus to make its approach into the airport north of the citytourists arriving for golf and days in the sun further west and out to sea a tugboat pulled a dredger alongside the bugio lighthouse lisbons scaleddown antique alcatraz at the end of the wall a fisherman reached back with his rod took two steps and sent his hook out into the ocean with a violent whip of his shoulders and flick of his wrists she was hit hard on the back of the head said fernanda behind me i cant say what it was yet but something like a wrench a hammer or a piece of pipe the blow propelled her forward and her forehead connected with a solid object which im ninety percent certain was a tree but ill do some more picking around back at the institute the blow must have knocked her unconscious and would have killed her in time but the guy made sure with his thumbs on her windpipe the guy sorry my assumption it didnt happen here did it no her left clavicle was broken she was dropped from the harbour wall and i found this in her hair in the wound the sachet contained a single pine needle i called a psp officer over sexual assault theres been sexual activity but no evidence of assault or violent entry but ill be able to tell you more later can you give me a time of death about thirteen to fourteen hours ago how do you work that out asked carlos his aggression got the full reply i checked with the meteorological office before i came out they told me the temperature didnt get much below c last night the body would have cooled at around to ic per hour i recorded her body temperature at c and found rigor mortis in the smaller muscles and just beginning in the bigger ones therefore my deduction based on experience is that youre looking for someone who murdered her between five and six yesterday afternoon but its not an exact science as inspector coelho knows anything else i asked nothing under her nails she was a nervy type hardly anything left of them the nail on the index finger of the right hand was torn by that i mean bloody if thats any help fernanda left followed by the ambulance men who were staggering across the beach and up the steps of the harbour wall the body zipped up in its bag i asked the psp men to search the car park and then take a squad up the marginal towards cascais to the nearest pine trees i wanted clothing i wanted a heavy metal object or tool give me your ideas agente pinto i said knocked unconscious in some pine woods stripped raped strangled thrown in a car driven down the marginal ultimately from cascais direction which is the only way in to this small car park and dumped off the harbour wall ok but fernanda said no violent entry she was unconscious unless her murderer had the foresight to bring his own lubricant and condom there would be evidence abrasions bruising that kind of thing wouldnt a rapist think of that he hits the girl from behind smacks her head against a tree with a blow hard enough to kill her but he strangles her for good measure my gut tells me that he was intending to kill rather than rape but i may be wrong lets see what fernanda says in her lab report murdered or raped they took some risks they interesting i dont know why i said that fiftyfive kilos isnt that much youre right though why dump her here in full view of the marginal cars going up and down all night not that this part is particularly well lit somebody local asked carlos shes not a local girl the contact addresses for catarina oliveira are lisbon and cascais and anyway whats local theres quarter of a million people living within a kilometre of where were standing but if she did come here and meet a creep why kill her in the pine trees and dump her on the beach why kill her in any pine woods in the lisbon area and bring her here to this spot is it relevant that you live near here i suppose you dont know why you said that either possibly because you were thinking it and you can read my thoughts all on your first day maybe youre revealing more than you think now your beards gone thats a lot to read off any mans cheeks agente pinto chapter iii th february ss barracks unter den eichen berlinlichterfelde even for this time of year night had come prematurely the snow clouds low and heavy as zeppelins had brought the orderlies into the mess early to put up the blackout not that it was needed just procedure no bombers would come out in this weather nobody had been out since last christmas an ss mess waiter in a white monkey jacket and black trousers put a tea tray down in front of the civilian who didnt look up from the newspaper he wasnt reading the waiter hung for a moment and then left with the orderlies outside the snowfall muffled the suburb to silence its accumulating weight filled craters mortared ruins rendered roofs smoothed muddied ruts and chalked in the black streets to a routine uniform whiteness the civilian poured himself a cup of tea took a silver case out of his pocket and removed a white cigarette with black turkish tobacco he tapped the unfiltered end on the lid of the case gothically engraved with the letters ke and stuck the dry paper to his lower lip he lit it with a silver lighter engraved eb a small and temporary theft he raised the cup tea he thought what had happened to strong black coffee the tightpacked cigarette crackled as he drew on it needing to feel the blood prickling in his veins he brushed two white specks of ash off his new black suit the weight of the material and the precision of the jewish tailoring reminded him just why he wasnt enjoying himself so much any more at thirtytwo years old he was a successful businessman making more money than hed ever imagined now something had come along to ensure that he would stop making money the ss these were people he could not brush off these people were the reason he was busy the reason his factoryneukolln kupplungs unternehmen manufacturer of railcar couplingswas working to full capacity and the reason why hed had an architect draw up expansion plans he was a forderndes mitglied a sponsoring member of the ss which meant he had the pleasure of taking men in dark uniforms for nights out on the town and they made sure he got work none of this was in the same league as being a freunde der reichsfuhrerss but it had its business advantages and as he was now seeing its responsibilities as well hed been living with the institutional smells of boiled cabbage and polish in the lichterfelde barracks for two days snarled up in their military world of oberfuhrers brigadefuhrers and gruppenfuhrers who were all these people in their deaths head uniforms with their endless questions what did they do all day when they werent scrutinizing his grandparents and greatgrandparents were at war with the whole world and all they need is your family tree he wasnt the only candidate there were other businessmen one he recognized they all worked with metal he had hoped they were being sized up for a tender but the questions had been strictly nontechnical all character assessment which meant they wanted him for a job an assistant or adjutant or whatever these people called themselves came in the man closed the door behind him with librarian care the precise click and satisfied nod started the irritation winding up inside him herr felsen said the adjutant sitting down in front of the wide hunched shoulders of the darkhaired civilian klaus felsen shook his stiff foot and raised his hefty swabian head and gave the man a slow blink of his bluegrey eyes from under the ridged bluff of his forehead its snowing said felsen the adjutant who found it difficult to believe that the ss had been reduced to considering this this some ruthless peasant with an unaccountable flair for languages as a serious candidate for the job ignored him its going well for you herr felsen he said cleaning his glasses oh youve had some news from my factory not exactly of course youre concerned everythings going well for you you mean fm losing money a nervous look from the adjutant fluttered over felsens head like a virgins petticoat do you play cards herr felsen he asked my answers the same as the last timeeverything except bridge therell be a card game here in the mess tonight with some highranking ss officers i get to play poker with himmler interesting ssgruppenfuhrer lehrer in fact felsen shrugged he didnt know the name is that it lehrer and me and ssbrigadefuhrers hanke fischer and wolff who youve already met and another candidate its just an opportunity for you for them to get to know you in a more relaxed way pokers not considered degenerate yet ssgruppenfuhrer lehrer is an accomplished player i think it i dont want to hear this i think it would be advisable for you to ah lose ah more money youll get it back im on expenses not quite but you will get it back in another way poker said felsen wondering how relaxed this game would be its a very international game said the adjutant getting up from the table seven oclock then here black tie for you i think eva brucke sat in the small study of her secondfloor apartment on kurfurstenstrasse in central berlin she was at her desk wearing just a slip under a heavy black silk dressing gown with gold dragon motifs and a woollen blanket over her knees she was smoking playing with a box of matches and thinking of the new poster that had appeared on the billboard of her apartment building it said german women your leader and your country trust you she was thinking how nervous and unconfident that soundedthe nazis or maybe just goebbels subconsciously revealing a deep fear of the unquantifiable mystery of the fairer sex her brain slid away from propaganda and on to the nightclub she owned on the kurfurstendamm die rote katze her business had boomed in the last two years for no other reason than she knew what men liked she could look at a girl and see the little triggers that would set men off they werent always beautiful her girls but theyd have some quality like big blue innocent eyes or a narrow long vulnerable back or a shy little mouth which would combine perversely with their total availability their readiness to do anything that these men might think up evas shoulders tightened and she pulled the blanket off the back of the chair around her shed begun to feel dizzy because shed been smoking too fast so fast that the end of her cigarette was a long thin sharp cone this only happened when she was irritated and thinking about men irritated her men always presented her with problems and never relieved her of any their job it appeared was to complicate take her own lover why couldnt he do what he was supposed to do and just love her why did he have to own her intrude on her occupy her territory why did he have to take things she chucked the matches across the desk he was a businessman and that she supposed was what businessmen did for a livingaccumulated things she tried to get her mind off men especially her clients and their visits to her office at the back of the club where theyd sit and smoke and drink and charm until theyd get to what they really wanted which was something special something really special she should have been a doctor one of those newfangled brain doctors who talked you out of your madness because as the war had worn on shed noticed the tastes of her clients had changed normally these days as shed found out to her cost to include painboth inflicting it and perhaps to redress the balance receiving it and then there was one man whod come and asked of her something that even she didnt know whether shed be able to supply he was such a quiet insignificant enclosed man you wouldnt have thought there was a knock at the door she crushed her cigarette threw off the blankets and tried to plump some life into her blonde hair but lost heart when she caught sight of herself in the mirror with no makeup she refolded the dressing gown across herself pulled the belt tight and went to open the door klaus she said producing a smile i wasnt expecting you felsen pulled her over the threshold and kissed her hard on the mouth desperate after two days in the barracks his hand slid down to her lower back her fists came up and she pushed herself away from his chest youre wet she said and ive only just woken up so she went back inside and hung up his hat and coat and led him back to her study he followed with his slight limp she never used the living room she preferred small rooms coffee she asked drifting over to the kitchen i was thinking the real thing and brandy he shrugged and went into the study he sat on the client side of the desk lit a cigarette and picked the flakes of tobacco off his tongue eva came in with the coffee two cups a bottle and glasses she stole one of his cigarettes which he lit for her i was wondering where that was she said tugging the lighter out of his grip annoyed she was wearing lipstick now and had brushed her hair she pulled the telephone plug out of the wall so that they could talk privately whereve you been she asked busy trouble at the works id have preferred that she poured the coffee and tipped some brandy into hers felsen stopped her doing the same to his after he said i want to enjoy the coffee theyve been making me drink tea for two days whos they the ss theyre so brutal those boys she said irony on automatic unsmiling what do the ss want from a sweet little swabian peasant like you the smoke curled under the art deco lamp felsen tilted the shade downwards theyre not saying but it feels like a job lots of questions about your pedigree i told them my father ploughed the strong german soil with his bare hands they liked it did you tell diem about your foot i said my father dropped a plough on it did they laugh its not a very humorous atmosphere down there he finished his coffee and poured brandy over the dregs do you know someone called gruppenfuhrer lehrer asked felsen ssgruppenfuhrer oswald lehrer she said becoming very still why im playing cards with him tonight ive heard hes in charge of running the ss or rather the kzs as a business making them pay for themselves something like that you know everybody dont you thats my business she said im surprised you havent heard of him hes been in the club this one and the old one i have of course i have he said but he hadnt felsens mind raced kzs kzs what did that mean were they going to assign him some cheap concentration camp labour switch his factory over to munitions production no job it was for a job he felt the cold in his bones suddenly they werent going to make him run a kz were they drink some brandy said eva sitting on his lap stop guessing youve got no idea she ran her fingers over his bristly head and thumbed one of his cheekbones as if he was a child with a mark she tilted his head and planted some fresh lipstick on his mouth stop thinking she said he slipped a large hand up under her armpit and cupped one of her firm braless breasts he eased another hand under the hemline of the slip she felt him hardening under her she stood wrapped herself in the gown again and knotted the belt she leaned in the doorway am i seeing you tonight if they let me go he said shifting in his seat his erection troubling him didnt they ask how come a swabian farmboy speaks so many languages yes they did as a matter of fact and you had to give them a guided tour of all your lovers something like that french from michelle that was french was it portuguese from that brazilian girl what was her name susana susana lopes he said what happened to her she had friends they got her out to portugal she wouldnt have lasted long in berlin with that dark skin said eva and sally parker sally taught you english didnt she and poker and how to swing who was the russian asked eva i dont speak russian olga we only got as far as da yes said eva niet wasnt in her vocabulary they laughed eva leaned over him and tilted the lampshade back up ive been too successful said felsen failing to look sorry for himself trickling more brandy into his cup with women no no drawing attention to myself all this entertaining i do weve had some good times said eva felsen stared into the carpet what did you say he asked suddenly looking up at her surprised nothing she said leaning over him to stub her cigarette out he breathed her in she stepped back what are you playing tonight sally parkers game poker where are you taking me with your winnings ive been advised to lose to show your gratitude for a job i dont want outside a car drifted through the slush down kurfurstenstrasse there is one possibility she said felsen looked up sun perhaps breaking through the cloud you could clean them out ive thought of it he said laughing it could be dangerous but she shrugged they wouldnt stick me in a kz not with what im doing for them they stick anybody in a kz these days believe me she said these are the people who cut down the lime trees on unter den linden so that when we go to the cafe kranzler all we have are those eagles on pillars looking down on us unter den augen they should call it if they can do that they can stick klaus felsen eva brucke and prince otto von bismarck in a kz if he was still alive what do they care he stood and faced her only a few inches taller but nearly three times wider she put a slim white arm the wrist a terminus of blue veins across the door take the advice youve been given she said i was only joking he grabbed at her his fingers slipping into the crack of her bottom which she did not like he went to kiss her she twisted and yanked his hand away from behind her they manoeuvred around each other so that he could get himself out of the door ill be back he said without meaning it to sound a threat ill come to your apartment when ive closed the club itll be late you know what pokers like wake me if im sleeping he opened the door to the apartment and looked back down the corridor at her her dressing gown had been rucked open her knees below the hem of her slip looked tired she seemed older than her thirtyfive years he closed the door trotted down the stairs at the bottom he rested his hand on the curl of the bannister and in the weak light of the stairwell had the sense of moorings being loosed at a little after six oclock felsen was standing in his darkened flat looking out into the matt black of the nurnbergerstrasse smoking a cigarette behind his hand listening to the wind and the sleet rattling the windowpane a sliteyed car came down the road churning slush from its wheelarches but it wasnt a staff car and it continued past him into the hohenzollerndamm he smoked intensely thinking about eva how awkward that had been how shed needled him bringing up all his old girlfriends the ones before the war whod taught him how not to be a farmboy eva had introduced him to all of them and then after the british declared war moved in herself he couldnt remember how that had happened all he could think of was how eva had taught him nothing tried to teach him the mystery of nothing the intricacies of space between words and lines she was a great withholder he pieced their affair back to a moment where in a fit of frustration at her remoteness hed accused her of acting the mysterious woman when all she did was front a brothel as a nightclub shed iced over and said she didnt play at being anything theyd split for a week and hed gone whoring with nameless girls from the friedrichstrasse knowing shed hear about it she ignored his reappearance at the club and then wouldnt have him back in her bed until she was sure that he was clean but she had let him back another car came down nurnbergerstrasse the sleet diagonal through the cracks of light felsen checked the two blocks of reichsmarks in his inside pockets left the window and went down to join it ssbrigadefuhrers hanke fischer and wolff and one of the other candidates hans koch were sitting in the mess taking drinks served by a waiter with a steel tray felsen ordered a brandy and sat amongst them they were all commenting on the quality of the mess cognac since theyd occupied france and dutch cigars said felsen handing round a handful to all the players you realize how they used to keep the best for themselves a very jewish trait said brigadefuhrer hanke dont you think koch still as pinkfaced as he had been at fourteen nodded keenly through the smoke of his cigar which hanke was lighting for him i didnt know the jews were involved in the dutch tobacco industry said felsen the jews are everywhere said koch you dont smoke your own cigars asked brigadefuhrer fischer after dinner said felsen only cigarettes before turkish would you like to try one i dont smoke cigarettes koch looked at his lit cigar and felt foolish he saw felsens cigarette case on the table may i he said picking it up and opening it the shops name was stamped on the inside samuel stern you see the jews are everywhere the jews have been with us for centuries said felsen so was samuel stern until kristallnacht said koch sitting back satisfied synchronizing a nod with hanke they weaken us every hour they remain in the reich weaken us said felsen thinking this sounded like something verbatim from julius streichers rag der sturmer they dont weaken me what are you implying herr felsen said koch cheeks reddening im not implying anything herr koch i was merely saying that i have not experienced any weakening of my position my business or my social life as a result of the jews it is quite possible you have been and as for the reich we have overrun most of europe lately which hardly possible you have been unaware finished koch shouting him down the double doors to the mess thumped open and a tall heavy man took three strides into the room koch shot off his chair the brigadefuhrers all stood up ssgruppenfuhrer lehrer flicked his wrist at waist height heil hitler he said bring me a brandy vintage the brigadefuhrers and koch responded with full salutes felsen eased himself slowly out of his chair the mess waiter whispered something to the dark lowered head of the gruppenfuhrer well bring me a brandy in the dining room then he shouted they went straight into dinner lehrer fuming because hed wanted to stand in front of the fire warming his arse with a brandy or two koch and felsen sat on either side of lehrer at the dinner over a nasty green soup hanke asked felsen about his father the question felsen had been waiting for he was killed by a pig in said felsen lehrer slurped his soup loudly sometimes he used a pig other times a ram what he didnt do was tell the truth which was that as a fifteenyearold klaus felsen had found his father hanging from a beam in the barn a pig asked hanke a wild boar no no a domestic pig he slipped over in the pen and was trampled to death by a sow and you took over the farm perhaps you know this already herr brigadefuhrer i worked that farm for eight years until my mother died then i sold it and joined the fiuhrers economic miracle and ive never looked back its not something i enjoy doing hanke sat back after that shoulder to shoulder with his protege who smiled pinkly lehrer slurped on he knew it all anyway except for the pig of course that had been interesting not true but interesting the soup bowls were removed and replaced by plates of overcooked pork with boiled potatoes and a sludge of red cabbage lehrer only ate it for something to do while koch gave him the party line he shovelled food faster and faster into his face in a momentary lull he leaned over to felsen and said not married herr felsen no herr gruppenfuhrer ive heard he said nibbling at a hangnail that you have a reputation with women do i how does a man whos never been south of the pyrenees speak portuguese asked lehrer valuing his earlobe with thumb and finger and dont tell me that thats what theyre teaching you down in swabia these days lehrer arched his eyebrows in a parody of innocence felsen realized that susana lopes had moved in higher circles than even hed known about i used to go riding with a brazilian around the havel he lied and lehrers stomach grunted horses he asked after dinner they moved into an adjoining room they each bought a hundred rm of chips and sat at a green baize table the waiters moved a wooden trolley with drinks and glasses alongside served brandies and left lehrer loosened off his tunic and drew on the cigar felsen had given him blowing the smoke on to the ember the light above the table stratified by smoke lit only the players faces koch even pinker now with the wine and brandy hanke with hooded unreadable eyes the shadow of his dark beard already showing through fischer with pouches under his eyes and his skin taut and scraped raw as if hed been half the night in a blizzard wolff blonde and blueeyed impossibly young for a brigadefuhrer in need of a duelling scar to lend experience to the face and lehrer the big man with jowls fully formed hair grey on the wings dark eyes wet and glistening with the anticipation of joy and further corruption if eva had been there thought felsen shed have told him that this was a man who liked to spank they played felsen lost consistently he dumped hands which had any excitement in them and bluffed with no will to back it up koch lost flamboyantly they both bought more chips and transferred them to the ss officers who showed no inclination for the process to stop then felsen started to win there were comments about the cards turning hanke and fischer were quickly burned out koch was stripped clean going down for rm felsen concentrated on wolff and began to lose to the man consistently on bluffs felsen was down to rm when lehrer cleaned wolff out with four of a kind to a full house wolff looked as if hed been speared to his chair lehrer was enormous behind his stacks of chips you might wish to replenish your stocks if you want to take me on said lehrer felsen poured himself a brandy and sucked on his cigar lehrer beamed felsen reached into his pocket and took out rm will that be enough he asked and lehrer licked his lips they played for an hour with lehrer now stripped to his shirt losing lightly wolff out of the light watched the game with the intensity of a falcon hanke and koch colluded on the sofa while fischer slept noisily just after am lehrer declined to draw on a hand felsen thought for a full three minutes and drew two which he looked at and laid facedown on the table he moved rm into the centre of the table lehrer matched him and raised him rm felsen likewise matched and raised they stopped and checked each other lehrer was trying to find the light the narrow crack the hairline fissure that was all he needed felsen knew then that his strongest card wasnt facedown on the table in front of him and allowed himself a tiny smile in the pit of his stomach it was enough for lehrer who matched felsen and raised him rm felsen moved his remaining rm into the centre and drew a block of rm out of his pocket and threw it on top wolff was up to his chest at the table burning holes in the green baize hanke and koch shut up fischer stopped snoring lehrer smiled and drummed the table with his fingers he asked for a pen and paper he pushed his remaining rm into the centre and wrote a note for rm i think we should see each other now he said you first said felsen whod have been happy to go on lehrer shrugged he turned over four aces and a king koch was gritting his teeth with fury at how felsen had bought the job from under him well felsen said wolff felsen turned over his draw cards first the seven and ten of diamonds wolff sneered but lehrer leaned forward the next two cards were the eight and nine of diamonds i hope that last ones not a jack said lehrer it was the six lehrer tore his tunic off the back of his chair and left the room perhaps thought felsen looking at the deflated men leaving around him that had been a step too far beating four of a kind with a low straight flushthat could be seen as humiliation the sleet had turned back to snow then it became too cold for snow and the air froze still the black ruts in the white roads iced over and the staff car taking felsen back to berlin fishtailed its way up nurnbergerstrasse felsen tried to tip the driver who refused he limped slowly up the stairs to his apartment he let himself in threw off his coat and hat and slapped his money on the table he poured himself a brandy lit a cigarette and despite the cold stripped off his jacket and hung it off the back of a chair eva was asleep in a wool coat a blanket over her legs on the chaise longue he sat in front of her and watched her eyes fluttering under their lids he put his hand out to touch her she woke up with a small cry that sounded as if it came from the night rather than her throat he took his hand back and gave her a cigarette she smoked and stared at the ceiling and stroked his knee without thinking about it i was dreaming badly youd left berlin i was on my own at a ubahn station and where the tracks should have been there were crowds of people looking up as if they were expecting something of me whered i gone i dont know i doubt ill be going anywhere after tonight what did you do she asked mother to small boy i cleaned them out eva sat up that was stupid she said you know lehrer hes not so nice you remember those two jewish girls the ones who got washed up in the havel yes i do but that wasnt him was it no but he was there he was the one whod ordered the girls he knew about me too said felsen sipping the brandy he knew about me and susana lopes how do you think he knew that its the nature of the regime isnt it it was years ago it was a totalitarian state before the war too she said swinging her knees round to between his legs and taking the brandy glass from him is that why you beat him at cards what do you mean he asked annoyed to have sounded defensive you were jealous werent you i can tell she said of him and susana her hands found the front of his trousers and rubbed the thick material i beat him because i didnt want to leave berlin berlin she asked toying with him now she undid the front of his trousers and unbuttoned his fly he slipped out of his braces and she tugged his trousers down to his thighs and yanked his undershorts out and over his erection not just berlin he said and gasped as her hands enclosed the stem of his penis sorry she said without meaning it he swallowed his penis felt extremely hot in her small cold white hands she moved her fists up and down painfully slowly without taking her eyes off his face his neck juddered and he pulled her forward on to his lap pushing the coat open and drawing her dress up over her stocking tops he tugged the gusset of her knickers aside and she had to grab at the arms of the chair to save herself from falling she found him and lowered herself down on to him feeling the slow burn creeping into her at dawn the heavy black curtains were crushing the irongrey light back outside the white linen bedclothes were stiff with cold felsens head came off the pillow at the second crash which came with the noise of a length of wood splintering boots thundered over wooden floors something fell and rolled felsen turned his shoulders hardened by the frost his brain grinding through the gears drink and tiredness confusing the double declutch required the two huge panes of mirrored glass in the double doors of the bedroom shattered two men in calflength black leather coats stepped through the door frames felsens single thoughtwhy didnt they just open the doors eva came out of sleep as if shed been stabbed felsen slid out of the bed and crouched naked a leather heel from a black boot hit him on the side of his clothfilled head and he went down felsen roared a voice felsen murmured something to himself things slopping in his head the room frill of eva shouting hobnail german you shut up he heard a dull smack something delivered with a closed fist and then quiet felsen sat with his back against the bed his genitals shrinking back from the cold polished wooden floor get dressed he stumbled into clothes blood trickled warm behind his ear the men took a shoulder each they crunched over the broken glass opening the doors this time polite on the way out a green padlocked van was the only colour in a crevasse of snowcovered gunmetal buildings whose street was frozen into arctic maps of white fringed grey and black the door of the van opened they heaved felsen into the darkness and pant of fear chapter iv th february prinz albrechtstrasse rhsa headquarters the van doors opened to an inarticulate shriek from an armed soldier felsen took a sideswipe from a rifle butt on the shoulder he lowered himself into the ankledeep black slush and staggered up the steps out of the courtyard into the grim stone gestapo building he was one of four prisoners they were led straight down into the cellars into a long narrow corridor with cells on either side most of the light came from an open door from which came the moaning of a man postcoitus the two men ahead of felsen looked into the light and switched their heads away fast a man in shirt sleeves wearing a stiff grossly stained brown apron was attending to a man strapped into a chair shut the door kruger he said in a tired longsuffering voice a man with a full days work ahead of him and none of it easy the corridor darkened with a bang to a sodiumlit gloom felsen was put in a stinking unlit cell with a pallet and full bucket for company he put his hands up against the damp wall and tried to breathe away the cold clamminess he felt on the inside of his rib cage he had gone too far he knew that now they came for him after several hours took him past the shut door of the horror room up to the first floor and into an office with tall windows in which a man in a dark suit sat at a desk cleaning his glasses for an absurdly long time felsen waited the man told him to sit do you know why youre here no the man fitted his face into the glasses and opened a file which he tilted away from felsen who stared at the precision of the mans parting communism youre joking the man looked up but didnt comment you are projewish dont be ridiculous you also knew a woman called michelle duchamp that is true my colleagues have been talking to her for a week in lyons shes been remembering things about the time she spent in berlin back in the thirties before the war when i knew her you mean but not before politics as you know shes been working for the french resistance movement for over a year im not political and no i didnt know that we are all political party member number forderndes mitglied to ss unit you know as well as i do that there is no life outside the party is that why you joined herr felsen to grow your business improve your prospects just hitching a ride on us are you while the goings good felsen sat back from the desk and looked out of the window at the bleak berlin sky realizing that this could happen to anybody and did every day thats a nice jacket said the man made by your tailor isaac weinstock said felsen thats a jewish name in case you know its forbidden for jews to buy yarn i bought the cloth for him it was snowing again he could just make out the grey flakes against the grey sky through the grey glass over the grey filing cabinet olga kasarov said the man what about her you know her i went to bed with an olga once shes a bolshevik shes a russian i do know that said felsen and anyway i didnt know you could catch communism from fucking that seemed to snap something inside the man who stood up and tucked the file under his arm i dont think you understand your situation very well herr felsen youre right i dont perhaps you would be good enough some rehabilitation is perhaps in order felsen suddenly felt the runaway vehicle he was on lurch down a steeper slope your investigation he started but the man was moving towards the door herr herr wait the man opened the door two soldiers came in and heaved felsen to his feet and took him out were sending you back to school herr felsen said the darksuited man they took him back down to his cell where they kept him for three days nobody spoke to him they gave him a bowl of soup once a day his bucket wasnt emptied he sat on his pallet surrounded by his piss and faeces screams would occasionally penetrate his darkness sometimes faint other times horrifically close and loud terrible beatings took place in the corridor outside his cell more than one man called for his mother under the crack of his door he spent the hours and days preparing himself he tutored his brain into a state of excessive politeness and his demeanour into one of submissive timidity on the fourth day they came for him again he was stinking and feeble with fear they didnt take him to the horror room and they didnt take him upstairs for another meeting with the man in the dark suit they handcuffed him and took him straight out into the courtyard the snow falling in soft large flakes but packed hard underfoot by boots and tyres they loaded him into an empty van with a large and still tacky stain on the floor the doors shut wheres this going he asked the darkness sachsenhausen said the guard outside what about the law said felsen what about the process of law the guard hammered on the side of the van the driver slammed it into gear and sent felsen cannoning against the doors eva brucke sat in her office in die rote katze smoking cigarette after cigarette and trickling more brandy into her coffee cup until it was all brandy no coffee the swelling on her face had gone down with the daily application of a little snow and she was left with a blue and yellow mark which disappeared under foundation and the white powder she used the door to her office was open and she had a clear view of the empty kitchens she heard a light tapping on the back door and stood to answer it at that moment the telephone went off louder than a stack of china hitting the floor she jumped and steadied herself she didnt want to pick it up but the noise was shattering and she snatched it to her ear eva asked the voice yes she said recognizing it this is die rote katze you sound tired its a job with long hours and not much opportunity for rest you should take some time off some strength through joy perhaps she said and the caller laughed do you have anybody else with a sense of humour it does depend on whos telling the jokes no well i mean someone who appreciates fun unusual fun i know people who can still laugh out loud like me he said laughing out loud to prove it perhaps she said not laughing with him could they come and see me for an evening of amusement and wonder how many oh i think three is a merry number would three be all right could you drop by and give me a better idea of what its rather inconvenient at the moment you know i worry after oh no no no dont be concerned the theme is food what could be more joyous than food in this day and age ill see what i can do thank you eva your service is appreciated she hung up and went to the back door the small enclosed man shed been expecting was there in the snowpacked alley she let him in he shook the snow off his hat and stamped his boots clean they went to the office she pulled the telephone plug out of the wall do you drink herr kaufman only tea i have some coffee nothing thank you what can i do for you i was wondering if youd have room for two visitors i told you i know but its an emergency not here no how long three days i might be going away she said off the top of her head inspired by the telephone call they can manage on their own i told you before that this would be it would have to be i know he said folding his hands into his lap but the circumstances are unusual wont they always be unusual perhaps youre right she lit a cigarette and sighed the smoke out when are they coming sachsenhausen was an old barracks turned concentration camp thirty kilometres northwest of berlin in oranienberg felsen knew of the place only because hed taken on a political and two jews to sweep the factory floors theyd been released from there in just before the olympics they didnt have to say anything about the conditions in the kz the two tendons at the backs of their necks stood out sharply from under their shaved headsthey were fifteen kilos underweight minimum it was an unnerving drive on snowcovered roads from berlin the van skidded and slewed across the road at sachsenhausen he heard the gates opening and a thunderous pummelling on the panels of the van the van seemed to run a gauntlet for a hundred metres until felsens nerve was completely shattered then silence and only the creak of tyres on snow the van stopped the wind moaned the driver coughed in his cab the doors opened felsen got to his feet felt the stickiness on the edges of his hands which were stained russet from the drying blood on the floor he stumbled to the back of the van outside was a vast white expanse with just two lines across it from the wheels of the van far off perhaps two hundred metres away it was difficult to judge over the snows squinting glare were trees and buildings the van took off throwing him out on to the ankledeep snow the doors flapped and banged shut and he put his hands up over his head confused by the sudden noise at the edge of the enormous flat expanse of snowcovered ground a figure stood at ease felsen nosed forward eyes creased shut the figure grey and indiscernible didnt move felsen flinched at a noise behind him the sound of sharp metal slicing through snow he whipped round there were three men in black ss greatcoats and helmets the hems of their coats rested on the surface of the snow one carried a wooden club the next a spade which he swung in an arc the blade singing against the crystalline snow the third held a metre length of steel cable frayed at the end felsen looked back to the figure as if he might help the figure had gone he got to his feet the men were eyeless beneath their helmets felsens legs were shaking sachsengruss said the guard with the club felsen put his hands on his head and began doing kneebends the saxon greeting they kept him at it for an hour then they told him to stand to attention for an hour until his body was shaking with cold and his ears full of the swish from the cable the slicing of the spade the tamping of the wooden club the guards trod a circle around him they removed his handcuffs the spade flew through the air at him he caught it in fingers which he expected to shatter like porcelain dig a path to the building they walked behind him over the vast area as he dug hundreds of metres of paths tears streamed down his face the snot ran in freezing rivulets from his nose the steam poured off him thick as bulls breath it began to snow they told him to reclear the paths hed already made they worked him for six hours until it was completely dark no light coming from the blackedout buildings they faced him out into the darkness and gave him another hours sachsengruss while they told him how he was going to have to clear it all again tomorrow in the last ten minutes he dropped to the floor twice and they kicked him back up on to his feet he was glad to be kicked he knew something from the kicking he knew they werent going to beat him to death with the club cable and spade they stood him to attention after that until a thin reed of music came floating through the pitch black they told him to march into the building he fell over they dragged him backwards inside his feet trailed damp lines over the polished floors the warmth of the building seemed to unfreeze his mind and tears poured out of his head water leaked out of his nose and ears the music grew louder he knew it mozart it had to be all those notes voices and laughter came over the music a familiar smell the guards boots rolled over the polished floors felsens feet came back to a life of pain but he was grinning he was grinning because he knew now what hed suspected before out in the snowhe wasnt in sachsenhausen they arrived in a room with chairs and carpets newspapers and ashtraysunimaginable civilization after prinz albrechtstrasse they stopped the guards got him standing one of them knocked and they took him backwards into the room a girl giggled the talking subsided only the music remained does the prisoner like this music asked a voice felsen swallowed hard his legs trembled his humiliation stiffened his neck i dont know whether i should like it sir you have no opinion no sir this is mozart don giovanni this has been banned by the party do you know why no sir the libretto was written by a jew the music was cut now what did you think of the music i didnt like it sir why are you here ive been sent back to school sir felsens feet throbbed in his ruined shoes the blood thumping through them why are you here asked a different voice he thought for a long minute because im lucky at cards sir he said which screwed the tension down in the room so that the girl tittered sorry sir because i cheat at cards sir prisoner turn around and stand at ease he didnt see who was sitting at the table at first his watering eyes took in the gross quantities of food before anything then he saw wolff hanke fischer and lehrer two other men he didnt know and a young woman who was smoking through lipstick already smudged lehrer was smiling the brigadefuhrers were all amused fischer broke first and roared and drummed the floor with his boots they all laughed banging the table even the girl who didnt know why she was laughing is the prisoner permitted to laugh asked hanke they roared again prisoner felsen laugh shouted fischer felsen smiled and started to blink conjuring mirth from relief his shoulders began to shake his stomach pumped and he laughed he laughed himself helpless he laughed himself to a retching standstill he laughed the ss officers silent the prisoner will stop laughing now said lehrer felsens mouth clamped shut he returned to at ease there are some clothes for you in there change he went into the kitchens stripped and got into a dark suit which hung off him he rejoined the table eat said lehrer he laid waste to the table in his immediate vicinity more thoroughly than a retreating army the officers talked amongst themselves except lehrer dont think im a bad loser he said i dont think that sir what do you think i think you are what your name implies a teacher sir and what have you learned obedience sir were giving you this job you dont want for a number of reasons you can organize things you are ruthless and aggressive but you must not be insubordinate felsen in your business you might lose an hours production because somebody didnt follow your orders in the business of war it could be a thousand lives or more theres no place for the maverick control is the key and i am in control he said swilling the brandy in his glass so why dont you want this job i dont want to leave berlin sir i have a factory to run at least its not a girl ive produced quality goods and ive shown my appreciation dont start on a different question whats in berlin for a swabian like you apart from your factory were not talking about paris or rome its not a city you can fall in love with not like nuremberg my city and berlinersmy god they think the world owes them a living maybe i like their sense of humour yes well youve always been a bit dry down in swabia i dont follow you sir said felsen touchy trampled to death by a pig what was that felsen didnt respond do you think i dont know about your father said lehrer yes well there you have two examples of swabian humour it gave me a problem hanke thought you were psychologically unsuitable i should have tried harder with him lehrer leaned across the table his face flushed with wine his breath sour and cigarstreaked this job is a big opportunity for you a big opportunity you will thank me for it i know you will thank me then why dont you tell me about it sir not yet tomorrow youll come to lichterfelde ill have you sworn in first into the ss of course said lehrer until he saw felsens frozen face dont worry youre going west not east they drove slowly north through the fresh snow back to berlin that familiar smell had been the lichterfelde barracks on the few occasions a car passed in the other direction felsen could see the shadows of the officers in the car in front passing the girl between them lehrer didnt speak it stopped snowing they cruised into berlin and the first car peeled off to the tiergarten and moabit lehrer ordered the driver to do a small circuit of the city felsen stared out into the dark the black parks the flak towers the lightless houses the silent anhalter station its the nature of war said lehrer that things happen more things happen than could possibly happen in peacetime in that respect its the most exciting time of a mans life one moment youre running a factory making more money than you could ever dream of as a farmer in swabia you dance with girls in the golden horseshoe watch the shows in the frasquita walk the kufu with all the other monied bastards and the next moment im in prinz albrechtstrasse a new and radical regime must protect itself strength through fear and the next moment go on think international germany is not just germany any more germany is the whole of europe a world power political and economic dont be smallminded its my peasant mentality its how i get things done for the money thats good but see the big picture too the reichsfuhrer himmler wants the ss to be an economic power in its own right within the new germanic reich think about that the car finally turned into nurnbergerstrasse and pulled up outside felsens apartment he got out and went up the two flights of stairs and found his front door repaired he let himself in and lit one of his own cigarettes he looked from behind the blackout and found the car gone he put on a coat and hat and went out into the night it was a short walk to kurfurstenstrasse he walked in the street where it was easier there was nobody out the temperature had dropped sharply felsen went down the small lane at the side of evas apartment building and in dirough the gate the mounds of earth and rubble taken out of the cellar were covered in thick snow the door was locked he hammered on it and stepped back and up on to one of the mounds to see if there were any cracks of light around the windows he roared her name after a few moments someone opened a window and told him to shut his drunken talk he went back home soaked in a bath and got into bed it was am hed call her in the morning he thought as he drifted into his first hours sleep he came awake four times each time with a rush and a crack in his head as if hed been hit with a brick there was the smell of shit in his nostrils and the last frames of his dream stayed with him the white of the widening parade ground lengthening out for ever he had to put the light on after that chapter v th february ss barracks unter den eichen berlinlichterfelde felsen sat in the polished corridor outside lehrers office watching two soldiers in vests and fatigues cleaning the corners with brushes too small for the job twice in the last fifteen minutes a sergeant had dropped by to kick their arses and salute felsen who was sitting uncomfortably in the uniform of an sshauptsturmfuhrer an adjutant came out of lehrers office and waved him in felsen saluted the gruppenfuhrer lehrer nodded him into in a highbacked chair on the other side of a desk with black leather inlay felsen took out his cigarettes screwed one in his mouth and lehrer reminded him that permission was required to smoke in front of a superior officer youll get used to it said lehrer youll even grow to like it im not sure how the greatest burden he said fixing him with the glare of his full authority the true burden which is responsibility is the castiron yoke across my shoulders your actions are an added weight you on the other hand have the lightness of being of a man unencumbered in the field following orders youll find yourself with more of a free hand than most now that im a fully paid up member of the ss its only a mark a month off your salary and it all goes into the spargemeinschaftss so you can draw interestfree loans and a mark a month isnt my problem what am i being paid to do am i allowed to know yet i wasnt trying to bore you hauptsturmfuhrer felsen i was merely trying to give you a practical instance of what ive been talking about what i mentioned in the car last night the ss as an economic power in the new germanic reich spreading from the north cape of scandinavia to the pyrenees and the tip of the brest peninsula to lublin dont leave out great britain the iberian peninsula the ukraine the black sea states and on and on and on said lehrer the big picture remember ill settle for a thumbnail sketch for the moment its the peasant brain sir you probably know the ss runs various businesses ive only supplied couplings to the railways which are heavily used by the ss but i dont know much about their other business interests we have brickworks quarries potteries cement factories building material plants soft drinks factories meat processing plants bakeries and of course military armaments and munitions factories there are a lot of other enterprises but that gives you the idea i dont see where my expertise fits in sir lets talk about munitions whats the difference between this war and the last one its an aerial war an aerial bombardment war all berliners think about is air raids lehrer sighed im talking about the war the offensive there are no static fronts its a mobile war blitzkrieg exactly its a mobile war it requires machinery machine tools artillery its also a tank war tanks have armour to stop a tank you have to penetrate the hardened steel of its armour and that requires what is known as solidcore ammunition the shell heads are hardened with an alloytungsten i believe so are the machine tools the gun barrels and tank armour otherwise known as wolfram or wolframite said lehrer do you know where that comes from china most of it and russia sweden has some not much even though they invented the word tungsten and felsen slowed as the cogs clicked the iberian peninsula you know your stuff i learnt a lot from wencdt wencdt my general manager hes a metallurgist said felsen you mentioned the ukraine and the black sea states earlier ah said lehrer leaning back steepling his fingers savouring his own lips the bigger picture i was under the impression that we had signed a nonaggression pact with stalin in im not expecting you to confirm that that pact will be broken but it hasnt escaped the berliners attention that factories are churning out massive amounts of material and its all heading in one direction lets hope stalins not as perspicacious as the berliners all hed have to do is hang around the bierstuben and kneipen of kreuzberg and neukolln and offer to buy a few beers and hed get all the military intelligence he needs a worrying thought said lehrer totally unconcerned keep talking herr hauptsturmfuhrer youre doing very well the wolfram were getting from china does it come via russia correct and when we break the nonaggression pact well be cutting ourselves off from the biggest wolfram suppliers in the world now you understand why i wanted you in uniform before i told you about the job susana lopes said felsen nodding at lehrer you want me to use my lovers portuguese to buy wolfram portugal has the largest reserves in europe and you didnt get the job just because you speak portuguese what was wrong with koch lehrer fanned the name away like a nasty fart not subtle enough he said this job requires finesse an understanding of people a sort of gamesplaying skill you know a genius for bluff a talent for dissimulation that kind of thing skills of yours we have already seen in action and anyway he wasnt what susana would call simpatico was he am i buying this wolfram for the ss no no youre buying it for germany but the supply department is headed by dr walter scheiber who apart from being a great chemist is an old party member and a true ss man in this way the reichsfuhrer himmler wants to make sure that the ss gets the credit for the campaign and in return well take more of the munitions production that is nothing to do with you your task is to get your hands on every kilo of uncontracted wolfram there is uncontracted wolfram whats already under contract the biggest mine is british beraltproduction tons per annum the french own the borralha mineproduction tons the united kingdom commercial corporation signed a contract with borralha last year but we are being successful through the vichy government in preventing it from working we control a small mine called silvicola maximum production a few hundred tons the rest is on the open market and how much do we need three thousand tons for this year a clock ticked behind felsens head snow shifted on the roof overhead and dropped in a flurry past the window may i smoke now sir asked felsen lehrer nodded didnt you just say that the biggest mine produced two thousand tons a year i did and thats not the least of your problems the ukcc will institute preemptive buying offensives you will have to manage vast quantities of free labour as well as your own men and any associated portuguese agents you will have to secure stockpiles arrange shipments you will have to be how shall i put it unconventional in your methods smuggling lehrer stretched his fattening neck out of his collar you will need information about your competitors movements you will need to stiffen your labour forces resolve keep foreign agents in line and the portuguese fuhrerdr salazarhow does he he has a tightrope to walk he is ideologically sound but theres a long history of cooperation with the british which they are keen to invoke he will find himself torn but we will prevail and when do i leave for portugal you dont not yet switzerland first this afternoon this afternoon and what about the factory i havent organized a damn thing thats totally impossible out of the question these are orders herr hauptsturmfuhrer said lehrer icily no order is impossible a car will pick you up at one oclock this afternoon you will not be late felsen stood outside his apartment building at exactly pm he was in uniform but with one of his own coats over the top and watching grimly as an overalled worker pasted a huge black and red poster on to the wall by the pharmacy opposite it said fuhrer we thank you hed phoned eva all morning and got no reply finally after hed packed and finished talking things over with wencdt hed run round to her apartment and banged and shouted outside her windows until the same man whod told him to shut up the night before stuck his head out to do so again he stopped short on seeing the uniform under the coat and became excessively polite he told him in sticky sweet german that eva brucke had gone away that hed seen her getting into a taxi with suitcases yesterday morning herr hauptsturmfuhrer an old woman whod been working her way up the frozen pavements of nurnbergerstrasse drew level with the huddled felsen and saw the poster and the sick look on his face she gave the berliner blick up and down the street and pointed her cane across to the pharmacy what have we got to thank him for she said emphasizing her clouds of breath with her spare furcuffed gloved hand the national socialist coffee bean how to bake cakes with no eggs the only thing weve got to thank him for is that the volkischer beobachter its softer than the national socialist toilet paper she stopped as if shed been knifed in the throat felsens coat had fallen open and shed seen the black uniform she ran her feet suddenly as sure as a speed skaters on the sheet ice of the pavement lehrer arrived in a chauffeurdriven mercedes the driver loaded the cases into the boot they drove past the skittering old lady who still hadnt made it to the hohenzollerndamm and felsen mentioned her shes lucky she didnt meet someone more severe said lehrer whacking his gloved hands together perhaps you should have been more severe youll need to be not with old ladies in the street herr gruppenfuhrer selective severity weakens the whole he replied and wiped the window with the back of his fat black finger they headed southwest out of berlin to leipzig and then across the whitened countryside to weimar eisenach and frankfurt lehrer worked out of a briefcase all the way reading documents and drafting memos in a spidery unreadable hand felsen was left to think about eva but couldnt find any discernible change in the pattern of thingslong nights drinking and laughing and listening to jazzbouts of lovemaking in which she couldnt seem to wrap her arms around enough of his bodyterrible arguments which started because he wanted to have more of her but she wouldnt give it and which only stopped when she threw things at him normally her shoes never the china unless she was in his apartment and there was some meissen available there was nothing except for the incident with the jewish girls for days after shed found out about them shed been like the sole survivor from a direct hitpale vacant and fluttery but it had passed and anyway it didnt have anything to do with him with them he looked across at lehrer who was humming to himself now and staring out of the window they arrived at a gasthaus on the other side of karlsruhe just as the light was failing felsen lay down in his room while lehrer borrowed the managers office and made telephone calls at dinner they were alone but lehrer was distracted until he was called to the telephone he came back in an expansive mood and demanded brandy in front of the fire and coffee he roared the real stuff none of this nigger sweat he rubbed his thighs and warmed his arse he took in his surroundings as if it had been far too long since hed been in a simple roadside inn ive never seen you in the rote katze before said felsen testing some untrodden ground ive seen you said lehrer have you known eva long why do you ask i just wondered how you knew about my old girlfriends she introduced me to all of them including the poker player who was that sally parker she didnt mention her if she had you wouldnt have proposed the game yes well ive known eva for some time since she had that first club where was it now der blaue affe ive never heard of it back in the twenties when she first started out felsen shook his head anyway your name came up i recognized you i asked eva who spoke very highly of you which she knew very well was not what i wanted then of course she was as discreet as she could be but im an ssgruppenfuhrer and and thats it he said taking the brandy off the tray you werent what fraulein brucke wasnt one of the reasons you didnt want to leave berlin was she no no said felsen annoyed at himself for snatching at it i was going to say the wood hissed in the fire lehrer moved his hands over his buttocks to warm them what were you going to say sir asked felsen unable to stop himself well you know berlin clubs the women its not she wasnt a hostess said felsen tamping his anger no no i know that but its the culture its not conducive to he waited to see if felsen would fill in the word for him and reveal some more of himself but he didnt stability very artistic very free very easy permanent attachments are rare in a nighttime culture wasnt the most famous party rally of all time held at night touche roared lehrer throwing himself into an armchair but that was just so the camera wouldnt pick up the fat sods in the amtswalter and make the party look like a bunch of bavarian pigs and may i remind you herr hauptsturmfuhrer that glibness is not an approved national socialist attitude they went to bed shortly after that felsen feeling outmanoeuvred and sick he lay on his cot and stared at the ceiling smoking through his cigarettes turning over evas dismissal of him the slickness with which shed set him up and pulled it off ah well he said out loud crushing his last cigarette into the ashtray on his chest just another in a long line it took him two hours to go to sleep he couldnt get rid of a picture in his brain and a thought the sight of his fathers bare feet and ankles swaying minutely at eye height and why did he take his shoes and socks off th february they wore suits to breakfast lehrers was singlebreasted thick wool dark blue and heavy felsen felt flashy in his parisian cut doublebreasted bitter chocolate suit and a regrettable red tie expensive asked lehrer his mouth full of black bread and ham not cheap bankers dont believe you unless you wear dark blue bankers the bankers of basel who did you think we were going to see in switzerland you cant buy wolfram with chips or reichsmarks apparently said felsen quite but swiss francs dollars dr salazar was a professor of economics and that entitles him to be paid differently to everybody else no it just entitles him to the opinion that in wartime its best to have strong gold reserves youre sending me down to portugal with a consignment of gold a problem is developing the americans are being difficult about letting us have our dollars so weve started paying for what we want in swiss francs our suppliers in portugal exchange those swiss francs for escudos eventually through the local banks the swiss francs find their way to the banco de portugal and once theyve accumulated enough they use them to buy gold from switzerland i dont see the problem the swiss dont like it theyre worried about losing control of their gold reserves said lehrer so we are experimenting how do we move this gold trucks what sort of trucks swiss trucks therell be armed soldiers with you all the way its taken some organization i can tell you you dont think i enjoy having my head in my briefcase all day do you i didnt realize gold was physically moved i thought it was accounted for on paper by national banks perhaps dr salazar likes physically to sit on his gold said lehrer thinking some more but he left it at that whose gold is this i dont follow your question wouldnt german gold be held in the reichsbank now youre asking me questions which i cant which i dont have the knowledge to reply to or the authority i am merely an ssgruppenfuhrer after all by am they had drawn up outside an unmarked building in basels business district there was nothing inside or out to indicate what happened in this building there was a handsome woman in her thirties sitting behind a desk with a single telephone on it a large marble staircase spiralled behind her lehrer talked to the woman quietly felsen only heard a single wordpuhl the woman picked up the telephone dialled a number and spoke briefly she stood and set off on strong legs up the stairs lehrer indicated that felsen should wait while he followed the legs felsen sat in a densely packed leather armchair the woman returned and sat at her desk without looking at him she folded her hands and waited for the next high point in her day it took felsen half an hour and several cubic feet of charm to find out that he was in the lobby of the bank of international settlements the name meant nothing to him at one oclock felsen and lehrer were sitting at a table in a restaurant called bruderholz only other men in dark suits ate in this place and at tables wellspaced from each other there were four petits poussins between the two men and a flat plate of boulangere potatoes lehrer was holding a glass of gewurztraminer and rolling the stem between his thumb and forefinger its so good to have alsace back in the german fold dont you think what magnificent country magnificent wine the meat of the poussin will be a little delicate for this we should have ordered goose or pork hearty alsatian fare but i cant have too much fat you know still the fruits of summer in the dead of winter your health was that a particularly successful meeting herr gruppenfuhrer tell me what you think of the gewurztraminer spicy im sure you can do better than that i was always told that you were very appreciative of the good things in life boldly fruity but clean and dry the spice holding from the top to the bottom as long as an atlantic cruise where did you get that from lehrer laughed its not true its true but not as boring or as dangerous as an atlantic cruise said lehrer i think a heavenly brioche is called for after this they ate the poussins and drank two bottles of the gewurztraminer the restaurant emptied they ate the brioche with a halfbottle of sauternes they ordered coffee and cognac and sat in the fading light of the darkening afternoon with cigars growing inches of concertinaed ash the staff left them and the bottle and retired the two men were well loosened up lehrers cigar arm swung off the back of his chair and felsens legs were spread wide a foot on either side of the table legs a man said lehrer heading for some pontification pointing felsen up with his cigar ash still intact must always do his important thinking alone whats a mans important thinking asked felsen licking his lips where he wants to be of course in the future he sifted through the air for some more words i mean on your way you must gather your intelligence you may ask opinion but when you are determining your own place in the world this is your private your secret thinking and if you are to be a man a man of difference then this thinking must be done alone is this the start of an essay entitled how to become an ssgruppenfuhrer lehrer waggled his cigar in the negative that is my position only a badge of the success of my thinking but it is not the ultimate purpose a small example you won the poker game the other night because your ultimate purpose was greater than mine the adjutant told you to lose because i like to win you wanted to stay in berlin ergo you win my intelligence as you indicated to me last night was not good enough to have played that game with you but you did win im here you lost a little money thats all lehrer smiled broadly his eyes glistening with drink amusement and triumph perhaps youre thinking now why youre so important to me he said dont my ultimate purpose should be no concern of yours except that it involves me thought felsen but he said perhaps i should have one of my own my point entirely said lehrer shrugging massively this russian campaign felsen started and lehrer held up his hand you will get your intelligence by degrees he said let me ask you something first what happened in the skies over england last summer im not sure we can read the precise truth in the beobachter or the uhr blatt well the precise truth said lehrer leaning over and whispering into his brandy is that we lost a great air battle goering will tell you otherwise goering has told me otherwise but we all know how he keeps his distance from reality excuse me sir nothing said lehrer straightening himself with a belch the loss of a great air battle what does that mean to you but we havent been bombed in berlin for nearly two months berliners said lehrer despairing even new berliners my god man believe me we lost it now come on tell me what that means if its true then we are exposed in the west and in the air so if we open up on an eastern thats enough i think youve understood something what is england with the channel in between said felsen theyre no threat im not being defeatist said lehrer no no no but listen we let them get away at dunkirk if wed smashed them on the beaches then wed be having this meal in london and wed have nothing to worry about but the english are determined they have a friend across the atlantic the biggest economic force in the world the fuhrer doesnt believe that but its true perhaps well all join forces and smash the bolsheviks thats a hopeful reading of the situation heres another said lehrer putting down his glass and screwing his cigar in between his teeth he chopped down his left hand on the table and said the united states and england he removed his cigar chopped down his right hand and mouthed the word russia he pressed them together and all thats left is a thin scraping of liverwurst in the middle totally and utterly fantastic said felsen youre forgetting lehrer guffawed thats the thing about intelligence its not always what you want to hear but do you believe that of course i dont its just a thought dont trouble yourself with it we will win the war and you will be in a perfect position to become one of the most powerful businessmen in the iberian peninsula unless of course ive misjudged you and youre a complete fool and if we lose as youve suggested we possibly might if youre in berlin and you listen to the berliners youll be jam in the bottom of a bomb crater but out there on the edge of the continent you will be far away from the disaster then i have every reason to thank you for forcing this job on me herr gruppenfuhrer lehrer raised his glass and said prosperity theyd drunk the best part of half a bottle of cognac and when the fresh evening air hit the older man he breathed it in deeply backed himself into the rear of the mercedes and collapsed with his head thrown forward on to his chest felsen tried to think his way through their conversation while listening to the air whistling in and out of the other mans nose it was like piecing together a jigsaw with too much sky and it wasnt long before his cheek was picking up the indent of the piping round the leather upholstery they woke up in the bundesplatz in central bern lehrer was groggy and on the verge of ill temper they passed the parliament building and the swiss national bank before leaving the square and pulling up outside the schweizerhof a doorman and two bellboys rushed the car their rooms were on different floors and as they went up in the lift lehrer told felsen he had business to attend to that night and he could have the evening to himself youll need it to read these he said giving him a folder from his briefcase what are they your orders i go back to berlin first thing in the morning you may have some questions prepare them goodnight felsen ran a bath and flicked through his orders which started at the swiss national bank at am he soaked in the bath but still felt dull from the lunch he dried off redressed and went out into the subzero temperature to walk off his head in a few short minutes he was freezing a bar next to the railway station looked warm and he saw it contained lehrers driver he bought two beers and joined the driver i envy you said felsen chinking glasses youll be back in berlin by tomorrow night not quite youve got the whole day once you get on the autobahn we go down to gstaad first for a few days he likes the mountain air and other things oh yes when theyre away they always like to play even himmler and you wouldnt think anyone would want to play with him power said the driver staring into his beer it does it for the ladies i can tell you felsen finished his drink and headed back to the schweizerhof lehrer was still in his room felsen sat in the bar until he saw him coming through the reception and going out into the night he decided to gather his own intelligence rather than let lehrer serve it to him in portions and fell in behind him they walked through the streets of the old city there were few people about but it was easy to follow him down the dark pavements overhung by the green sandstone houses finally lehrer turned down a street and when felsen arrived at the corner there was nothing but a single lit sign which said ruthli in red he felt foolish it meant nothing that lehrer had a girlfriend in bern but curiosity drew him on he went into the club handed over his hat and coat and took a table in the dark a fat man with black brilliantined hair was playing the piano while a girl with a long red wig stood in a spotlight and sang something sad in swiss german he ordered a cognac he couldnt see lehrer the cognac arrived and a few minutes later a girl sat down next to him they spoke in french his eyes got used to the dark and he found lehrer sitting at a table close to the stage with a woman who was blocked out by the big mans shoulders the club filled up the girl asked him to buy her a drink it arrived in a bucket of ice she was very young and too thin for his taste she moved closer with her drink and stole one of his cigarettes the redwigged girl slipped off the stage with her sad song and fat pianist there followed a drum roll and spotlights flashed around the club catching people unawares one spot hit lehrers companion fall in the face she closed her eyes to it and turned her head but not quick enough it brought felsen out of his seat and tipped the girls glass across the table cymbals clashed the audience faded to black the spotlights stilled on a red curtain which split and revealed a man in a top hat and tails but there was no mistaking what felsen had seen the white face in the spotlight had been eva bruckes chapter vi saturday th june paco de arcos near lisbon we worked the boatyard next to the harbour and came up with nothing we crossed the marginal using the underpass and talked to the people who were clearing up last nights mess in the bombeiros voluntarios tent but none of them had been working the night shift the restaurantcafe in the gardens was closed we walked up to the pine woods to see how the psp men were getting on they had the usual array of used condoms syringes and bleached and tattered pornography no such thing as an innocent pine wood in this area i told them to bag the lot and send it up to fernanda at the institute of forensic medicine in lisbon carlos and i went back to antonio and had some toast and more coffee at i put a call in to dr aquilino dias oliveira who i assumed was the girls father and given his two addresses in lisbon and cascais was not engaged in the great financial struggle that the rest of us were it was a saturday so i tried the cascais number first and thought i was wrong until he picked it up at the twelfth ring and groggily agreed to see us in half an hours time we got into my black alfa romeo which was not as many thought a classic car just an old car and it started without having to draw on any reserves of bravery we headed west on the marginal with carlos pinned to his seat by the belt that was stuck at one length and for a girl olivias size there were big fans of cascais but i wasnt one of them it used to be a small fishing village with houses falling down steep cataracts of cobbled streets to the harbour and port now it was a townplanners nightmare unless you were one of the townplanners whod passed the numerous development projects in which case youd be living in a dream elsewhere it was a tourist town with an indigenous population of women who dressed to shop and men who shouldnt be allowed out of a nightclub real life had been stripped out and replaced with an international cosmopolitanism which appealed to a lot of people who had money and about as many again who wanted to ease it away from them we rolled in past the supermarket the railway station and an electronic signboard which told us that it was c at and we should get some insurance the fish market was wrapping up for the morning the lobster and crab pots were piled high in front of the hotel bahia the fort square and ugly out on the point dominated i drove up a cobbled street at the back of the town hall and turned into a treelined heavily shaded square cool and sombre with wealth in the old part of town dr oliveiras traditional villa on two floors was large and silent in the breathless morning carlos pinto sniffed like a dog thats picked up the whiff of the first possible scrap of the day pine he said the pine needle angle could be a lot of work in this area agente pinto theres a pine tree in the back garden he said looking down the side of the house we let ourselves in by the front gate and went past a pillar of red bougainvillea to the back of the house the pine tree was huge and shut out the light to the garden the floor beneath it was a perfect brown carpet of dried needles put your foot on that i said carlos foot crunched through a couple of inches of needles i dont think you could kill someone on that and leave it bom dia senhores said a voice behind us and you are we were admiring your pine tree said carlos electing to be the idiot im going to cut it down said the thin tall erect man with white brilliantined hair combed in rails off a high forehead and curling at the collar it kills the light in the back of the house and makes the maid feel gloomy you are the policia judiciaria i take it we introduced ourselves and followed him into the house he wore a lightweight english chequered shirt grey slacks with turnups and brown loafers he walked with his hands behind his back and stooped a little like a thoughtful priest the parquetfloored corridor was lined with portraits of ancestors depressed at being cooped up in the dark his study had more parquet flooring and arraiolos carpets of some quality and antiquity his desk was large and made out of walnut and had a brown leather chair behind it which was shiny where hed buffed it with his back four lamps supported by polished women carved from jet provided light the red bougainvillea outside had eclipsed the sunshine he sat us down at a threepiece suite in a booklined corner of the room only a lawyer would have so many books in the same bindings an ormolu clock ticked as if each tick was going to be its last dr oliveira was in no hurry to talk as we sat down he fitted his darkskinned face into a pair of bifocals and searched his desk for something he didnt find the maid came in and laid out coffee without looking at us there was a photograph of the dead girl on a shelf squeezed in between some old paperbacks thrillers written in english catarina oliveira was smiling at the camera her blue eyes were wide open but they didnt match what her mouth was doing something tightened in my chest id seen the same look in olivias eyes after id told her that her mother was dead thats her said dr oliveira his white eyebrows jumping over the frames of his bifocals he was old for the father of a fifteenyearold girllate sixties in his body and more than that in the lines and creases of his face and neck he should have been trying to remember the names of his grandchildren he leaned forward and picked out a small cigar from a jade box on the desk top he licked his lips which became the colour of pigs liver and screwed the cigar between them he lit it the maid rattled a coffee cup down in front of him and reversed out of the room when did you last see her i asked putting the photograph back thursday night i left my lisbon house early on friday morning i had to get to my office to prepare for a day in court what sort of law do you practise corporate law tax ive never done criminal work if you think thats relevant did your wife see catarina on friday morning she dropped her off at school and came down here its what she does in the summer at the weekends and catarina makes her own way here after school on the train from cais do sodre shes usually here by six or seven oclock she was reported missing at nine i got back here at about halfpasteight my wife had been here about an hour worrying we phoned everybody we could think of and then i reported her missing at does she have any particular friends a boyfriend she sings in a band she spends most of her spare time with them he said leaning back with his coffee boyfriends none that i know of is that a school band theyre all at the university two boysvalentim and brunoand a girl the girl is called teresa yes teresa thats it all of them a lot older than catarina they must be twenty twentyone the boys the girl i dont know probably the same but she wears black and uses purple lipstick so its difficult to tell well need all their details i said and dr oliveira reached for a pad and began leafing through his address book he scribbled down names and addresses is she your only child from this marriage yes i have four grownup children teresa he let the name drift with his cigar smoke his eyes glanced at a photograph on his desk is that your current wife i asked and looked at the same photograph which was of the four children from his previous marriage my second wife he replied annoyed with himself catarinas her only child is your wife here senhor doutor i asked shes upstairs shes not well shes sleeping she takes shes taken something to help her sleep i dont think it would be a good idea is she a nervous woman ordinarily when it comes to catarina when it comes to her only daughter missing the whole night when it comes to a phone call from the policia judiciaria first thing in the morning then yes she becomes how would you describe their present relationship catarina and your wife what he said looking across to carlos as if he might be able to clarify this sort of question its not always a simple relationshipmother and daughter i dont know what youre driving at he said coughing a halflaugh the chinese character for strife is represented by two women under the same roof dr aquilino oliveira supported himself with the heels of his palms on the edge of the desk and looked out at me over the rims of his glasses his dark brown eyes reached in shes never run off without a word before he said quietly does that mean they have been known to disagree strife he said ruminating over the word catarina has been practising at being a woman yes i see what you mean thats very interesting by practising senhor doutor you mean sexual experimentation i asked easing myself down on to some of my own eggshells it has been a concern of mine do you think she might have got out of her depth the lawyer sucked himself in and then sagged to one side of his chair was it acting or real it was surprising the number of people who resorted to soap in times of stress but a lawyer of this calibre last summer teresa my wife doing the usual friday routine forgot something in the lisbon house she drove back around lunchtime and found catarina in bed with a man there was a big fight catarina would have been fourteen then senhor doutor what did you make of it i think thats what kids do given half the chance less than half the chance but for me its different ive had four children already ive been through all that ive made mistakes ive tried to learn its made me more understanding more liberal i didnt get angry we talked she was very straight very candid even brazen as they are kids these days showing off that theyre adult too carlos had been sitting with his coffee cup ten centimetres from his mouth for the last two minutes transfixed by the exchange i shot him a look and he ducked into his coffee when you said man your wife found catarina in bed with a man that sounds as if her companion was older than than one of the boys in the band for instance was that the case youre a careful listener inspector coelho how old was he dr oliveira i asked volleying his flattery straight back at him thirtytwo thats very precise did catarina tell you that she didnt have to i knew the man he was my wifes younger brother the ormolu clock nearly missed a tick didnt that make you very angry dr oliveira i said you dont have to be a lawyer to know that your brotherinlaw broke the lawthats child abuse im hardly going to run him in am i i didnt mean that im a mixture inspector coelho i was an accountant before i became a lawyer im sixtyseven years old now and my wife is thirtyseven i married her when i was fiftyone and she was twentyone when she was fourteen but she wasnt senhor doutor when you knew her you werent taking advantage of a minor thats correct perhaps after this incident catarina in your talk with her gave you some reason to be tolerant with your brotherinlaw i said struggling with the sentence as if it was a giant octopus if by that you mean she wasnt a virgin inspector coelho you would be right you might also be shocked to know that she admitted to seducing my brotherinlaw he replied copying my syntax do you think she was telling the truth dont imagine that theyre thinking like we were when we were fourteen did druguse come up in this conversation she admitted to smoking hashish its very common as you know nothing more she wouldnt i know he faltered im beginning to see from your expression inspector coelho that after a conversation like that you think i should have locked her in a tower until she was twenty i wasnt thinking that i was thinking a whole turmoil of things but not that ive got to get this face under control perhaps youre a more advanced ethical thinker than most portuguese senhor doutor were nearly a generation beyond the dictatorial age and prohibition makes for a criminal society i dont call that advanced just observant you said she wouldnt have admitted to using anything more than hashish my sons a heroin addict was a heroin addict catarina knew him she still knows him he lives in porto hes off it it wasnt easy i remembered his stooped clerical walk with these burdens he should have been bent double youre still a practising lawyer not so much now some corporate clients keep me on a consultative basis and i represent a few friends on tax points in these calls on friday night did you speak to any of her teachers the one i wanted to speak to who i consider to be a concerned woman and the one who taught her on friday afternoon wasnt available you know it was santo antonio he wrote down her name address and number without my asking id like some shots of your daughter and i think we should speak to your wife now if possible it would be better if you came back later he said and tore off the sheet of paper and handed it to me my mobile numbers on there too if you hear anything you gave your daughter a lot of freedom would she have gone to the santo antonio celebrations without telling you friday night we always have dinner together and she likes to go down to the bars in cascais afterwards we left the house he didnt see us out the maid watched us from the end of the corridor it was hotter outside after the chill of the house we sat in the car with the windows down i stared into the square beyond the line of trees seeing nothing shouldnt you have told him asked carlos i think you should have told him a complex individual the lawyer dont you think his daughter is dead i just had a feeling that by not telling him we might learn more i said giving carlos the paper my decision fifteen minutes later a flamered morgan convertible containing the lawyer in dark glasses eased into the street we followed him around the square past the fort through the centre of cascais and back on to the marginal heading for lisbon the day seemed to be taking shape see if he looks at the beach when we pass paco de arcos i said carlos braced as an astronaut for liftoff didnt blink but the lawyers head didnt turn it didnt turn until we cruised into belem past the bunker or the new cultural centre as it is sometimes known and the gothic intricacies of the jeronimos monastery then it suddenly snapped to the right to catch the ships prow monument to the discoverieshenry and his men looking out across the tagus at a gigantic container ship nosing out into the wellknown or maybe it was the blonde in the bmw overtaking him in the inside lane well asked carlos i didnt answer the mist had cleared from around the bridge the cranes being used to sling the new rail link underneath it saluted cristo rei the massive christ statue on the south bank whose outspread arms reminded us that it could all be possible i didnt need reminding i knew it lisbon had changed more in the last ten years than in the two and a half centuries since the earthquake it had been like a mouth that hadnt seen a dentist for too long rotten buildings had been yanked out old streets torn up squares ripped out centuries of plaque scraped off facades drilled out and filled with a pristine amalgam of concrete and tile gaps plugged with offices and shopping centres and apartment blocks moles had tunnelled new stretches of metro and a brandnew intestine of cabling had been fed into the root canals of the city wed wired in new roads built a new bridge extended the airport were the new gnashers in europes iberian jaw we can smile now and nobody faints we thundered over the patchy tarmac at alcantara an old tram dinged past the santos station to the right the steel hulls of freighters flashed between the stacks of containers and advertisements for super bock beer on the left office blocks and apartment buildings climbed up the hills of lisbon we ran the light at cais do sodre as a new tram a mobile hoarding for kit kat hissed behind us i lit my first cigarette of the daysg ultralightshardly smoking at all maybe hes just going to his office said carlos do a bit of work on a saturday morning why speculate when you can call him on his mobile youre kidding im kidding the yellow facade and the massive triumphal arch of the terreiro do paco sucked us away from the river towards the grid of the baixa valley between the hills of the fort of sao jorge and the bairro alto the temperature hit thirty degrees fat ugly bronzes loafed in the square the lawyers morgan cut right down the rua da alfandega and left into rua da madalena which climbed steeply before dropping away into the newlook largo de martim moniz with its glass and steel box kiosks and disinterested fountains we skirted the square and accelerated up the slope of the rua desao lazaro past the hospital desao jose and into the square dominated by the pedimented pillared facade of the institute of medicine we parked close to the statue of dr sousa martins his plinth heaped with stone tablets of thanks wax limbs and candles dr oliveira was already parked and walking down the hill to the institute of legal medicine carlos took his jacket off and revealed a long dark stripe of sweatsoaked shirt by the time we arrived in the institute the lawyer was using all his training to get what he wantedthe staff however were more difficult to impress than a judge i left him with carlos and arranged for the body to be displayed an orderly brought in dr oliveira who had removed his dark glasses and now wore the bifocals the assistant drew the sheet back the lawyer blinked twice and nodded he took the sheet from the assistant and pulled it back to see the whole body which he inspected closely he drew the sheet back over her face and left the room we found him standing outside in the cobbled street he was cleaning his sunglasses endlessly and wearing an expression of extreme determination i am sorry for your loss senhor doutor i said i apologize for not telling you earlier you have every right to be angry he didnt look angry the initial determination had flagged and the confusion of emotions that had followed had left his face strangely flaccid he looked as if he was concentrating on his breathing lets walk up here and sit in the gardens in the shade i said we walked on either side of him through the cars past the good doctors statue which rather than being imbued with the success of the cured was in its pigeonshitspattered state infused with the sadness of those whod been lost the three of us sat on a bench in surprising cool some distance from the pigeonfeeders and the coffeedrinkers idling in plastic chairs around the cafe you may be surprised to know that i am glad that you are investigating the murder of my daughter said the lawyer i know you have a difficult job and i also realize that i am a suspect i always start with those closest to the victim its a sad fact ask your questions then i must go back to my wife of course i said when did you finish in court yesterday about halfpastfour where did you go to my office i keep a small office in the chiado on calcada nova des fransisco i went by the metro from campo pequeno changed at rotunda and got off at restauradores i walked to the elevador took that up to the chiado and continued on foot to my office it took me maybe half an hour and i spent half an hour there did you speak to anybody i took one call from who the minister of internal administration asking me up to the jockey club for a drink i left my office just after halfpastfive and as you may know its only a twominute walk to rua garrett from there i nodded it was castiron i asked him to write down the names of the people who were with him at the jockey club carlos gave him his notebook for the purpose can i talk to your wife before you tell her whats happened if you follow me back there yes if not i wont wait well be right behind you he gave me the paper and we walked back towards the cars how did you know to come here senhor doutor i asked as he threaded his way back to his morgan i spoke to a friend of mine a criminal lawyer he told me that this is where they bring the bodies of those who have died in suspicious circumstances why did you think shed died like that because id already asked him about you and he told me you were a homicide detective he turned and walked across the cobbles to his car i lit a cigarette got into the alfa waited for the morgan to pull away and followed what did you make of that i asked carlos if it had been my daughter in there you were expecting more distress werent you what about numbness trauma leaves people numb he didnt seem numb the look he had on his face when we came out he was galvanized concerned about himself i couldnt say you know i only saw him from the side so you can only tell me what im thinking about when you look at me headon that was just a bit of luck senhor inspector was it i said and the boy smiled what did you think of dr oliveiras accountancy the mathematics between him and his wife i thought he was a bloodless son of a bitch strong feelings agente pinto i said what does your father do he was a fitter with lisnave he installed pumps in ships was they lost some contracts to the koreans your politics might be to the left of centre perhaps he shrugged dr aquilino oliveira is a serious man i said hes high calibre ordnance mm cannon no less was he a colonel in the artillery your father the cavalry but listen the lawyer has used his brain all his life its his job to use his intelligence thats true so far hes one step ahead of us all the way you saw him his instinct was to check the body his brain always operates in front of his emotions until perhaps he remembers hes supposed to have feelings and then he leaves the room to go and collect them interesting agente pinto im beginning to see why narciso put you on to me youre an odd one am i most people think im very normal they mean boring its true you havent said a word about football cars or girls i like the way you see the order of things senhor inspector maybe youre a man of ideals i havent seen one of those since nineteenseventyfour a little after that in the mess that followed our glorious revolution there were lots of ideas ideals visions they petered out and ten years later we joined europe and now we dont have to struggle on our own any more we dont have to sweat at night thinking where the next escudo is coming from brussels tells us what to do were on the payroll if we and thats a bad thing whats changed the rich get richer the ones in the know go higher of course its trickled down but thats the point its a trickle we think were better off because we can drive around in an opel corsa which costs us our entire living wage to run while our parents house us feed us and clothe us is that progress no its called credit and who benefits from credit i havent heard anger like that since since fc porto came down here and put three past benfica im not angry he said cooling his hand out of the window im not as angry as you are what makes you think im angry youre angry with him you think he killed his daughter and hes given you the best possible alibi a man can have and youre angry about it now youre reading my face in profile next itll be the back of my head you know what annoys me said carlos he makes out hes some kind of liberal thinker but you think about this hes nearly seventy years old he must have worked the best part of his life under the salazar regime and you know as well as i do that you didnt work in those days unless you were politically sound whats happening here agente pinto ive spent the last twenty years of my life not thinking about the revolution other than the fact we get a holiday on th april ive been with you less than half a day and weve talked about it three or four times i dont think its any way to start a murder investigation by going back twentyfive years and looking it was only talk he was projecting himself as a liberal i dont believe him and thats one of the reasons why guys like that are too intelligent to believe in anything they change i dont think they do not this late on my fathers fortyeight he cant change and now hes scrap in the breakers yard along with all his old pumps dont get fixed ideas about people agente pinto itll cloud your vision you dont want to ram somebody into a life sentence just because theyre politically disagreeable do you no said carlos innocent as his hair that wouldnt be fair chapter vii saturday th june dr aquilino oliveiras house cascais we were shown into the sitting room which judging by the furnishings was not dr oliveiras side of the house there was natural light in the room fancy ceramics and no dark corners of books the art on the walls was the sort that demanded comment unless you happened to be a police inspector from lisbon in which case your opinion didnt matter i took a seat on one of the two caramel leather sofas above the fireplace was a portrait of a skeletal figure in an armchair as seen through lashes of paint it was disturbing you had to be disturbed to live with it under the thick plate glass of the coffee table was senhora oliveiras more human side magazines like caras casa maxima and the spanishhola there were plants in the room and an arrangement of lilies but just as the eye relaxed it came across a dark metal figure scrabbling out of the primordial slime or a terracotta head openmouthed screaming at the ceiling the safest place to look was the floor which was parquet with persian rugs dr oliveira showed his wife in she was probably the same height as her daughter but her hair gave her another ten centimetres it was big pumpedup and blonde her tanned face looked tight still puffy from barbiturate sleep and shed tried to mask it with heavy eye makeup her lips were pink and shed added an extra dark line to the rim of her mouth she wore a cream blouse and a bra that created cleavage where none naturally existed her short silk skirt was five shades off matching her blouse and she was chained with gold about the waist we shook hands the jewellery felt crusty wed like to talk to your wife alone senhor doutor he was going to make a stand a man in his own home but the side of his wifes face said something to him which i missed and he left the room we sat carlos took out his notebook when did you last see your daughter dona oliveira yesterday morning i took her to school what was she wearing a white tshirt a miniskirt light blue with a yellow check those big clumpy shoes they all wear these days studded with rhinestones she also had a thin leather lace choker with a cheap stone strung on it no tights in this weather no just bra and pants any particular make she didnt answer but squeezed her bottom lip between her thumb and forefinger and then rubbed them together to disperse the grease did you hear the question dona oliveira i just carlos leaned forward and the sofa creaked underneath so he stopped halfway senhora oliveira blinked her slightly enclosed brown eyes sloggi she said did something else occur to you then dona oliveira a horrible thought when you asked about the underwear your husbands already told us that catarina has been sexually active for some years carlos sat back she dabbed at her smudged lower lip with a finger dona oliveira was there a question inspector coelho i wondered if youd tell us whats on your mind it might help its every mothers fear that their daughter might get raped and killed she said automatically as if that hadnt been what she was thinking how have you been getting on with your daughter over the past couple of years hes told you she started and held herself back what exactly i asked she darted a look at carlos who didnt help how we havent been getting on mothers and daughters dont always compete she finished for me compete i asked and she picked up on my surprise i dont think this will help you find catarina id like to know more about her psychological state if she was likely to get herself into a difficult situation shes a confident girl that could have been the start of the why do you say shes confident she fronts a band that needs something it wasnt a very successful band she said and switched yes its true she can appear older than she is is that what you meant by competing our eyes connected but she couldnt hold mine for more than a few seconds she seemed to steady herself against the coffee table rapping it with her ringed fingers i didnt im wondering what hes told you now she said glancing at the door just tell me what happened did he tell you i found catarina in bed with my brother why would you see that as competitive hes thirtytwo years old but hes your brother i dont see any reason to be discussing middleage female paranoia with someone investigating my daughters disappearance the fact is if she can get him she can your husband said that too this is hopeless maybe your brothers the one to help us with i dont know why he has to do this now of all times he i didnt find catarina in bed with my brother she was with my lover she said coolly now that shed given up the pretence do you still see this man are you insane inspector and your daughter silence i dont know she said after a while ill need to speak to him i said carlos handed her the notebook she scribbled fiercely and finished with a piledriving dot that must have gone through to the cardboard how did your husband find out she pushed up her chin like a boxer who could take anything now truth part truth and lies passed behind her eyes you can imagine the atmosphere in this house between me and catarina my husband talked to her hes good with words he wrung it out of her did she seduce your lover paulo branco the delicacy of young flesh is difficult to resist so im told she said it in a way that particularly pained her she was a druguser your husband knows about hashish were you aware of her taking anything stronger i wouldnt know the difference ive never taken drugs but you know how you feel when youve taken a sleeping pill senhora oliveira i go to sleep in the morning i mean she blinked doesnt it give you an insulated feeling the real world kept at a distance did you ever notice catarina in that state or perhaps the opposite nervous hyperactive wired i think they call it i really dont know she said does that mean you didnt notice or it means that of late i havent cared it was a long silence in which the unheard air conditioning made its presence felt how did she get her money i asked i gave her five thousand escudos a week what about clothes i used to buy her clothes until until last year she said did you buy the clothes she was wearing not the skirt i wouldnt have bought her anything that short it barely covered her knickers but then thats the fashion so was she doing all right at school i didnt hear anything to the contrary no attendance problems we would have been told im sure whenever i dropped her off she walked in there like a lamb one minute i said and left the room i found dr oliveira in his study smoking a cigar and reading the diario de notiocias i told him i wanted to break the news to his wife and asked him if hed prefer to do it he said hed leave it to me we went back into the room senhora oliveira was talking animatedly to carlos she was sitting sideways on the sofa and her skirt had crawled up her legs carlos was as stiff as his hair she saw us and froze her husband sat next to her at a quartertosix this morning dona oliveira i started and her eyes looked into me avid and horrified the body of your daughter catarina oliveira was found on the beach in paco de arcos she was dead i am very sorry she said nothing she stared into me hard enough to see the texture of my organs her husband took her hand and she absentmindedly removed it from his grip agente carlos pinto and myself are conducting the investigation into your daughters death her death she said astonished and coughed out an appalled laugh we are very sorry for your loss i apologize for not telling you earlier but there were certain questions i had to ask which needed a clarity of mind her husband made another attempt on the hand she left it there this time she was speared rigid by what id said we believe that she had been murdered elsewhere and her body taken to the beach in paco de arcos and left there catarina has been murdered she said incredulous as if this was what happened to riffraff on television only she slumped back into the sofa stunned she tried to swallow but couldnt couldnt gulp down the dreadful news i realized we werent going to get any further today we shook hands and left at the garden gate we heard a long unrestrained wail from the house im not sure i understood all of that said carlos it was very disappointing i thought it was it was very disappointing for someone of your youth and optimism to have to look at that sort of behaviour why did we have to know anything about this affair with the brother or the lover what was dr oliveiras game with all that that was what was so disappointing i said he was using us he was using our investigation into his daughters murder to punish his wifes infidelity what we saw in there was a master class in humiliation now youve observed the intelligence of the lawyer but the wife said carlos agitated the wife when you left the room she didnt ask one question about her daughters disappearance not one she chatted she asked me things about the stupid paintings how long id been in the policia judiciaria did i live in cascais yes well there were a couple of things about those two in there first dr oliveira kept a photograph of his previous family on his desk while catarina was up on a bookshelf with some dogeared paperbacks the second was that both of them had brown eyes i didnt notice he said writing it down in his notebook and brown eyes plus brown eyes dont often make blue and catarina oliveira had blue eyes chapter viii nd march southwest france it was a perfect morning the first perfect morning for days the sky was pristine cloudless and of such a blue that only pain could come from looking at it to the south the mountains the snowcapped pyrenees were just catching the first rays of the rising sun and the thin spiky cold air up there sharpened the white peaks and deepened the blue of the sky close to them felsens two swiss drivers couldnt stop talking about it they were from the south and spoke italian and they knew mountains but only the alps they didnt talk to felsen unless he spoke to them first which was infrequently they found him cold aloof abrupt and on one occasion brutal in the few moments he fell asleep in the cab they heard him grinding his teeth and saw the muscles of his jaw bunching under the skin of his cheek they called him bonecrusher when he was visible and at some distance that was the only risk they were prepared to take after witnessing the excessive kicking hed given a driver whod accidentally reversed into a gatepost in the barracks outside lyons they were italianswiss after all felsen hadnt noticed he didnt care he was treading a welltrodden circle going over and over the same ground so that if hed walked his thoughts hed have been in a circular trench up to his shoulders hed smoked hours of cigarettes metres of them kilos of tobacco while he dissected his every living moment with eva searching for the moment and when he couldnt find the moment he came at eva from a different angle sizing all the sentences all the phrases weighing every word shed ever said to him and all the ones she hadnt as well which was a bigger task because eva was a betweenthelines talker she left the sayable unsaid and said what she meant without saying it he played over the scene of the first time she ended up in his bed after four years of knowing each other after four years of being friends shed sat astride him in her black silk stockings and suspenders running her hands over and over his chest why hed asked why what after all these years why are you here shed pursed her lips and looked at him out of the corner of her face measuring the question for its longterm prospects then shed suddenly gripped his penis with both hands and said because of your big swabian cock theyd laughed it hadnt been it but it would do now as he came to that point for the hundredth time where eva had diminished him he all but writhed in his seat with the torment of his sexual jealousy he saw the heavywaisted pinkskinned uncontouredbuttocked gruppenfuhrer squeezing and pumping between her slim white thighs her heels encouraging him her breath coming out in jolts his trembling grunts into the corner of her neck her clawing fingers on his flabby back his greedy hands her rising knees his deeper thrusts felsen would shake his head no and he would go back to eva again sitting astride him in her black why power does it for the ladies lehrers chauffeur had said even himmler thats what felsen had thought as he watched lehrer eat his breakfast the morning after hed seen him in the club with eva thats what hed thought as he strolled through the dark morning to the swiss national bank as hed signed the release documents as hed supervised the loading of the gold as hed shaken hands with lehrer and watched him walk back to the schweizerhof to his three days in gstaad with eva he could barely remember crossing the border he couldnt think of any moment in france apart from the stupid driver hed lived inside his head until the cloud had lifted off the pyrenees that morning and the swiss wouldnt stop talking about it he got drunk that night with a standartenfuhrer of a panzer division in bayonne whod told him his tanks would be in lisbon before the end of the month we got to the pyrenees in four weeks well reach gibraltar in two lisbon in one were just waiting for the crack of the fuhrers starting pistol they drank claret a grand cru classe from chateau batailley bottle after bottle of it as if it was beer he slept in his clothes that night and woke up in the morning with his face hurting and his throat sore from snoring like a hog they crossed the border into spain and picked up an army escort sent with a personal instruction for their safety from general francisco franco himself by nightfall they were still grinding up the hairpins of the vascongadas as if they were dragging felsens hangover behind them now that there was no threat of allied air attack they drove through the night and they were glad to be able to keep the engines running because once they came out of the mountains and on to the meseta there was nothing to stop the wind which drove a bleak mixture of freezing rain and ice into the sides of the trucks the drivers stamped their feet on the metal floors to keep them from going numb felsen hunched behind the collar of his wool coat stared into the darkness the swerving road the headlights arcing across the trees he didnt move this had become his kind of temperature they refuelled in burgos a bleak and frozen place with disgusting food laced no swimming in the acrid urine of the poorest quality olive oil which burnt through the bowels of the drivers so that they shat all the way to salamanca they shat so frequently that felsen refused them permission to stop and they just hung their bare arses out of the doors and let the icy wind take it wherever refugees appeared on the road most of them on foot some with a cart between them and occasionally an emaciated mule they were dark people with faces hollowed out by fear and hunger they walked automatically the adults grim the children blank these people silenced the drivers who stopped complaining about the food and the cold as the trucks ground past them not a head turned not a single homburg altered its course the jews of europe tramped through the empty wilderness of spain with their cardboard suitcases and knotted sheets seeing no further than the next windblasted oak on the skyline felsen looked down on them from the cab hed expected to find some pity for them as he had for the two men from sachsenhausen whod swept his factory floor after their release at the time of the berlin olympics he found nothing he found he didnt have room for anything else they drove through salamanca the golden stone of the cathedral walls and the university buildings was dull under the white dome of the frozen sky there was no fuel the drivers managed to buy some chorizo and weevilriddled bread the convoy moved on to ciudad rodrigo and the border town of fuentes de onoro the spanish army escort harassed the columns of refugees who shifted off the road on to the barren rockstrewn plain without even a raised gesture the twenty whitewashed hovels on the rocky treeless site that made up fuentes de onoro were frozen in a piercing wind that kept the inhabitants indoors and the refugees huddled behind boulders and upturned carts the drivers blundered amongst them looking for food and found everyone in a worse state than themselves a woman in the only shop offered them lumps of pork fat in what looked like the same rancid oil theyd had in burgos they named the dish gordura alla moda della guerra and didnt touch it the customs formalities on the spanish side were brief the officials left their less lucrative work of minutely inspecting the jittery refugees papers and their reductions of a lifetimes possessions and came to get their bonuses felsen who knew that this was the border post that would see most of his business had prepared himself for the crossing with french brandy and jambon de bayonne his drivers were furious the deal was sealed with shots of cheap aguardente and the convoy moved across to the portuguese side at vilar formoso the portuguese army escort had not arrived there was a member of the german legation whod already dispatched a messenger to guarda they arranged for the drivers to park the trucks in the square outside the ornately tiled railway station which showed framed scenes of all the major towns in portugal the square was packed with more wildeyed people the drivers went looking for food again they found a soup kitchen which had been set up by firms from porto but it was for british passportholders only they tried talking to the refugees the women collapsed under coloured shawls wouldnt look at them and with the men in long mudrimmed coats with furry hats jammed down over thick black matted hair and faces blanked out and ragged with beards they could find no common language there were poles and czechs yugoslavs and hungarians turks and iraqis they tried the less picturesquemen in creased threepiece business suits who stood above exhausted women and howling children but they were dutch or flemish rumanians or bulgarians and in no mood for sign language especially of the sort which involved pointing a finger into the mouth even the young were uncommunicativethe boys shifty the girls cringing and babies either wailing or mute and vacant when the engine of one of the approaching portuguese army motorcycles backfired this massed driftwood of war ducked and flinched as one felsen worked on the customs officials using charm and some supplies that the member of the german legation had brought with him the portuguese responded with cheese chorico and wine and were very helpful with the reams of bureaucracy that needed to be filled out to allow the trucks to move freely in the country when the convoy moved off the chefe of the alfandega the customs came out to wave and wish him a speedy return because he could see that this was the auspicious start of what could be years of graft they crossed the river coa and spent a night at an army post in guarda where they ate an enormous meal whose four courses all tasted the same and drank a lot of wine from fivelitre flagons felsen had already begun to feel himself coming round he knew because he was interested in seeing the women in the kitchens since moving to berlin hed barely gone fortyeight hours without sex and now it had been more than a week when finally he saw the women he hoped theyd been especially selected to keep the soldiers ardour at bay they were all tiny with no more than an inch of forehead between their dark eyebrows and the scarves around their heads their noses were sharp their cheeks sunken and their teeth gone or rotten he went to bed and slept badly on a flearidden mattress in the morning they began driving through some of the places theyd seen depicted on the blue and white azulejos in the station at vilar formoso the drivers realized what had been missing from the designs or perhaps bad roads poverty and filth looked different in their own colours they rounded the pineforested rockstrewn mountains of the serra da estrela on the northern boundary of the beira baixa which as felsen already knew was going to be his home for the next years of his life where schist and granite meet was where the black shiny crystalline wolfram occurred and felsen could see from the greybrown block stone houses and slate roofs that this was the right country they crossed the mondego and dao rivers to viseu and headed south to coimbra and leiria the air changed the dry cool of the mountains disappeared and a warm humidity took over the sun was hot even in early march and they stripped off their coats the drivers rolled up their shirt sleeves and looked as if they might sing there were no refugees on the road the representative from the german legation told them that salazar was making sure that no more came into lisbonthe city was already full they spent a last night on the road at vila franca de xira and got up early the next morning to deliver the gold to the banco de portugal before normal office hours it was first light as they turned away from the tagus into the terreiro do paco and the trucks made their way behind the arcaded eighteenthcentury facade into the grid system of the baixa purposebuilt by the marques de pombal after the lisbon earthquake in they drove along rua do comercio behind the massive triumphal arch at the head of the rua da augusta to the conglomeration of buildings including the church of sao julilo that made up the banco de portugal they waited for the gates to open in the largo desao juliao and one by one the trucks reversed in to unload in the bank felsen was met by the director of finance and another more senior and taller member of the german legation who greeted his offered hand with a springloaded salute and an incongruous heil hitler this did not appear to disturb the banks finance director who he found out later was a member of the portuguese legion it had confused felsen who only managed a halfwave in return like a bad attempt at getting a waiters attention and the words ja ja he also missed the tall prussianlooking mans name it wasnt until the gold had been unloaded and accounted for that felsen saw the man signing the endless documentation with his left hand in the name of fritz poser he noticed that the right hand was a gloved prosthesis by am the business was completed the junior member of the legation had taken the drivers to an army barracks on the outskirts of the city and poser and felsen were sitting in the back of a flagged mercedes driving down rua do ouro towards the river the pavements were packed with people mostly men in dark suits white shirts dark ties and hats a size too small for their heads who swerved past barefooted boys selling newspapers the few women were smart and dressed in tweed suits with hats and furs even though it wasnt cold the faces flashed by as the car picked up speed in the empty street one woman hatless and blonde stared at the car the small swastika flapping on the bonnet mesmerized then her head flicked away and she buried herself in the crowd felsen turned in his seat a boy was running alongside the car waving the diario de noticias in his face lisbon is full said poser its as if the whole world is here i saw them at the border the jews felsen nodded tired now after the anxiety of the journey theres a more eclectic mix down here lisbon can cater for all tastes its one long party for some so theres no rationing not yet and not for us anyway it will come though the british are mounting their economic blockade and the portuguese are beginning to suffer fuel could start to be a problem they dont have any of their own tankers and the americans are being difficult of course you can eat well if you like seafood and drink their wine if your palates not too french theres still sugar at the moment and the coffee is good they turned right out of the praca do comercio and followed the tagus past the docks at santos there was a huge brawling mass of people men women and children fighting outside the offices of the shipping lines this is the more distasteful end of lisbon said poser you see that ship the nyassa in the docks there they all want to get on the nyassa but its full its been full for weeks in fact its been filled twice over but these morons think that because its there they can get on it most of them dont have any money which means they dont even have american visas ah well the guarda national republicana will be along in a moment and break them up last week it was the same with the serpa pinto next week it will be the guine always the same we seem to be leaving lisbon said felsen as the driver accelerated away towards the green outskirts of the city not yet this evening perhaps were going to the palacio do conde dos olivais in lapa where weve installed the german legation youll see we have the best location in lisbon they came into lapa from madragoa and drove up the ruasao domingos a lapa halfway up the union jack hung limply off a long pink building with tall white windows and a central pediment which made up about fifty metres of the streets facade the mercedes thundered past on the cobbled street our friends the british said poser waving his prosthetic hand the driver turned first left into rua do sacramento a lapa and after a hundred metres a cuboid palace in its own grounds appeared on the left bougainvillea spilled over the iron railings the leaves of the phoenix palms rattled in the light breeze and the three red white and black swastika flags snapped gently the gates were opened the car swung away from a sea view and up a short gravel drive and stopped in front of the steps a doorman opened the car early lunch asked poser they sat in the dining room with the sun throwing short rectangles of light across the empty tables they waited for soup felsen tried to remember a time when hed felt such calm it was before the war before the olympics in his old apartment on he couldnt remember where his old apartment was the windows open in summer lying on the bed with susana lopes the brazilian girl you like it asked poser erect as if his spine was in a brace excuse me our legation our palacio magnificent the baixa said poser wrinkling his nose all the refugees you know its very enervating lapa is so much more civilized you can breathe and the war seems such a long way away said felsen stonily quite so berlin i believe has not been so much fun said poser trying to hit a more businesslike tone well be having a small reception for you this evening and a dinner so that you can meet some of the people youll be working with it will be formal do you yes i do afterwards i thought perhaps youd like to go out of town to estoril theres a room for you at the hotel parque the casinos out there and therell be some dancing i think youll find it very agreeable id like to have some sleep at some stage i havent had much on the road this last week of course i didnt mean to be presumptuous i just wanted you to be sure of some comfort and entertaining company after the more serious occasion no no id be happy to a few hours this afternoon will be fine i have a cot in a room next to my office you can use that if you wish the soup arrived and the two men worked their way through it this hotel parque started felsen yes we have the hotel parque and the british have the hotel palacio were next to each other the palacio is bigger but the parque has the waters if you like that sort of thing i was going to ask its a very international crowd as i said one long party from the conversations you hear up there youd think they were still having court balls in the palace of versailles and the women out there so im told are a lot more progressive in their attitude than the natives the soup plates were removed and replaced by a split grilled lobster did i answer your question asked poser perfectly your reputation precedes you hauptsturmfuhrer felsen i didnt know i had one that could be of much interest youll find the foreign women in estoril very accommodating although i should youre wellinformed herr poser are you with the abwehr although i should warn you that there are two currencies in this city the escudo and information which is why youre here everybodys a spy in lisbon herr hauptsturmfuhrer from the lowest refugee to the highest members of the legations and that includes maids doormen waiters bar staff shop owners businessmen company executives all women whores or not and royalty real or fake anybody with ears to overhear can make a living then there must be a lot of rumour as well youve said yourself that the city is full probably with a lot of people with nothing better to do than talk it passes the time after all that is true who does the winnowing ah yes your agricultural background coming out felsen stripped the white flesh out of the shell of his lobster so where do the real spies pass their time asked felsen the ones who give us advance information on dr salazars thinking about wolfram exports you mean does he do any thinking about that hes beginning to we think hes beginning to perceive an opportunity were working on it now felsen waited for poser to continue but instead the prussian began dismantling his lobster claws with some difficulty given the stiffness of his gloved right hand how many people know what im doing here those you will meet this evening no more than ten people in all your work is very important and as youve probably realized somewhat complicated by a very delicate political situation which at the moment we are winning it is our people here who will make your work on the ground easier or more difficult if you start losing we have good relations with dr salazar he understands us the british are relying on the strength of their old alliance i think it was you wonder which century theyre living in we on the other hand are frightening him i was going to say that we are providing him with what he needs but hes aware of the panzer divisions in bayonne im sure and the uboats in the atlantic said poser but if you want to play the harlot and bed both sides you might expect to get slapped about sweet excuse me the lobster very sweet portuguese lobster small but perfectly sweet the best in the world i thought id go for a walk after my nap the jardim da estrela isnt far and its very pleasant it was pm and the chave d ouro cafe in the rossio square at the top end of the baixa grid in the heart of the city was full to capacity it was still warm and the windows were all open laura van lennep sat by one of these open windows and looked into the square repeatedly she fingered the single coffee shed ordered in the hour and a half shed been sitting there but the waiters didnt bother her they were used to it she was halflistening to a table of refugees speaking french with thick accents the two men had seen army trucks in the baixa first thing that morning and were expounding some fantastic invasion theory it did nothing to calm laura van lennep down she couldnt bear the inertia of these people who she knew came from a pensao three houses down from her own in the rua de sao paulo behind cais do sodre shed heard them in the street correcting each other about aristocrats theyd met at parties as if it had been only last week when it had been in a different country in a different decade she was desperate with no cigarettes and the man who was going to change her life whod promised that he could change her life wouldnt arrive a man appeared at the top of the stairs and looked around he walked slowly around the room and finished up at her table he wasnt short but his width and bulk made him look shorter than he was he had short dark hair cut en brosse and bluegrey eyes he made her tremble inside she looked away into the rossio again to the same groups of darksuited men standing about on the black and white calcada to the same lines of taxis to the same kiosk where the cabbies drank coffee and talked about football sporting were going to be champions this year she knew that by now she turned back and he was still there she felt those eyes on her she gripped her handbag which contained her papers was he the police shed been told about the plainclothed ones he didnt look portuguese but he had something of authority about him she rearranged her claret dress which did not need rearranging but should have been thrown away last year could i join you asked the man in french im waiting for someone she said also in french letting her blonde head slip around to the window again theres nowhere else to sit and i only want a coffee youre a single person sitting at a table for four theres someone coming im sorry he said i didnt mean to no no please she said suddenly her nerves setting her hands off like the pigeons in the square he sat opposite her and offered her a cigarette she refused but had to hold on to her hand to do it he lit one for himself and seemed to enjoy more than the smell of his own smouldering tobacco the waiter came to his side your coffee looks cold may i im fine thank you he ordered one for himself she looked out into the square again hed spoken in portuguese but not lisbon portuguese more open like slow spanish he wont come any quicker you know said the man she smiled a sort of relief that shed begun to feel that he wasnt going to ask to see her papers i cant bear waiting she said have a cigarette some warmer coffee itll pass the time she took a cigarette he looked at her empty ring finger and the tense shake in her hand she puffed on it and left a red mark on the white end she blew out the strange strong smoke from turkey he said you can get anything here if you can pay she said i wouldnt know i brought these with me my first day in lisbon where have you come from from germany thats why hed made her tremble where are you going im staying here for a while and then who knows and you from holland i want to go to america her blue eyes flickered out over the balcony again and then searched the room behind where the man was sitting his coffee arrived he ordered one for her the waiter took her old stained cup away her eyes settled back on to him hell come he said with a reassuring wink the four refugees on the table behind had started running down the portuguese how uncivilized they were how uncouth how all the food tasted the same and have you tried to eat that bacalhau lisbon oh lisbon was so boring shed heard it all before and she leaned away from them she knew it could be dangerous to speak to the man but after three months in the lisbon refugee world she thought shed developed some instinct i cant bear not knowing she said like the waiting yes if i know if i knew she drifted off you dont know what its like yet youve only just arrived where are you staying in the pensao amsterdao on rua de sao paulo and you ill find somewhere everywheres full so it seems perhaps ill go out to estoril its more expensive out there she said shaking her head he didnt seem bothered by that she let her head fall over her shoulder again to look out of the window this time she leapt to her feet and started waving she dropped back into her seat and closed her eyes her table companion twisted around to view the top of the stairs a man in his early twenties with blonde reddish hair came striding through the tables he faltered when he saw the older man but pulled a chair out and pushed it close to the girl her eyes snapped open her face fell he took her hands she stared into the tablecloth as if her own blood was growing a stain in the middle of it he leaned into her ear and whispered in english i did everything i could its just not possible without the woman in the visa office he stopped as the waiter put a coffee down in front of her he looked across at the man at their table who was looking out of the window it takes money a lot of money i havent got any money edward do you know how much the tickets are now you used to be able to get one for now its i was there today at the ticket office a man paid to get on the nyassa the longer i stay here i got as far as the guichet but then she comes to the window she doesnt recognize me she doesnt know me she wont even take the application unless unless you can come up with the money or the right invitations or the german called for the waiter and paid for the two coffees he stood and looked down at the young couple the englishman was suspicious the woman had a different look than beforea hungry intensity in her face the german put on his hat and tipped it at her thank you for the coffee she said you didnt tell me your name you didnt say yours i dont think we got that far laura van lennep she said and this is edward burton felsen he said klaus felsen he put out his hand the englishman didnt shake it chapter ix th march the german legation lapa lisbon the ambassador didnt make the reception or the dinner that night felsen sat between two wolfram exporters a portuguese with three concessions in the trancoso area in the beira alta and a belgian aristocrat who wouldnt tell him anything other than that it was his group who was providing a shell company through which felsen was going to export his wolfram the members of the legation who were without their ambassador to remind them of their own insignificance spent too much of their time extending their own importance into areas which were none of their business felsen was left with the impression that all the real work would be done in the corridors of power and hotel lounges of lisbon rather than in the bleak mountain ranges of the north he didnt improve his popularity by asking how their oblique bargaining was going to translate into tons in trucks crossing the border they patronized him back they hinted at intricate negotiations but offered no substance they said that he would feel the results felsen reinterpreted all this to himself the abwehr and supply department resented the intrusion of the ss into their territory he was on his own after dinner as they gathered on the steps waiting for the cars to take them out to estoril felsen still couldnt help being unnerved by the unembarrassed flagrance of light everywhere all the windows of the palacio each one or two metres high glowed from reckless chandeliers of glittering incandescence as hed left the baixa by taxi in the evening the nyassa was still at anchor unconcerned in the heart of the docks blazing with light as the loading continued berlin had been widowed for two years you could end up in a concentration camp for lighting a cigarette in the street after dark cars moved around at night with slit eyes blind as moles the rest of europe was like a coal hole and lisbon its furnace mouth a crack and crump of smallarms fire started up around the city one of the younger legation members with a glass too much of wine inside him shouted the invasion and roared the portuguese was stonefaced as they got in the cars felsen sat with poser again in the back of the leading mercedes they dropped down the steep hill to alcantara and headed west out of town what was the invasion asked felsen a nightly reminder of whos in charge said poser looking out of the window as if he was expecting crowds salazar only allows the lisboans to beat their carpets after nine at night they drove through belem past lit buildings and monuments not used to the light yet herr hauptsturmfuhrer said poser still jittery after berlin the flak towers and the air raid warnings this is last years expo site while london burned and france fell lisbon showed off its eight hundred years of sovereignty to the world im not sure what youre getting at herr poser you went walking today you told me to go the gardens in estrela and i just kept going over the top of the bairro alto down to the chiado and then into the baixa ah the bairro alto said poser and did you see the market in praca da figueirait doesnt smell too bad at this time of the year and that rat holethe mouraria or the stinking crumbling alfama i walked up to the castle of sao jorge and took a taxi back so youve seen some of lisbon he said now when you see salazars capital after dark perhaps you understand my point about the harlot lisbons a whore a peasant arab whore who wears a tiara at night perhaps youve been here too long poser ach salazar he says one thing he does another he leans one way and sticks a foot out the other he takes our swiss francs and gold bars and then extends unlimited credit to the british he rails at them for blocking his imports from the colonies and ach the mans a moor and hes making the beast with two backs with anyone he pleases poser finished bitterly now youre thinking that because you pay the whore she should be faithful next youll be wanting her to fall in love with you quite so felsen said poser coolly i forgot your expertise in these matters they hit the new coast road the marginal the lights of the dormitory villages of caxias paco de arcos oeiras carcavelos and parede glittered by the black heave of the unseen atlantic poser was still sulking as they pulled up outside the lit facades of the hotels parque and palacio the high heads of the washingtonian palms in the gardens in front were just out of the light poser pointed out the casino at the top of the long square which sloped several hundred metres down to the sea front music came from the low modern building queues of cars stretched down the side of the gardens the bellboy fetched the bags from the boot and felsen and poser went through the high roman arch which made up the front of the hotel parque theres somebody you should meet said poser heading for the concierges position this is felsen he said to the sharpfaced man behind the counter the concierge flicked through his register he rattled something off to the bellboy without taking his eyes off the book you dont need to tell him anything said poser of the concierge he knows it before you do isnt that right the concierge didnt say anything but felsen could tell from his attentive stillness that he was a man of some hotel experience install yourself in your rooms felsen and ill show you around said poser and laughed looking at the concierge dont talk to the flowers or use the phone isnt that right the concierge blinked once slowly felsen rejoined poser in the bar they left the boorish company of the other members of the legation and walked up the gardens in the balmy night to the casino the concierge knows when we talk like that its what we want everybody to hear is that why the bars empty youll see itll fill up as the night wears on maybe they should make themselves more interestinginvite some women across they all seem to be going in here they entered the lobby of the casino at the same time as a small darkhaired highlymanicured woman who slid out of a fur coat and an expensive hat before being escorted to the bar by two men younger and firmer than herself she wore nylons and more than half the room turned as she came in is she the queen of somewhere asked felsen thats the queen of lisbon said poser the daughter of the arab whore asked felsen and poser roared her name is madame branescu she runs the guichet of the visa office at the american consulate you saw all those people who wanted to get on the nyassa this evening she took a percentage off every one of them you wouldnt have recognized her eighteen months ago she was half the size and you could read a newspaper through her clothes but she speaks fourteen languages and i dont know whether you walked past the american consulate but she needs those fourteen languages and a few more besides they went into the bar the waiter was already standing at her table as the woman and her blonde escorts sat down despite the clothes the coiffure and the makeup she was not an attractive woman felsen saw her in a previous life in the office of an important lawyer a short plain woman in grey clothes ignored by all but like the hotel parques concierge she missed nothing and had learned everythingthe languages the control the art of power and here she was an improbable little person conferring life or despair on the thousands atticked in lisbons pensions men and women approached her and spoke small obsequious words bowing from the waist some were allowed to brush their lips across the dimpled knuckles of her puffy hand others scuttled back to their seats blanched and quivering felsen excused himself from poser and presented himself at her table the escorts eyes bored into him he asked her in perfect english if she wanted to dance her eyes roved over his face trying to work out if she knew him then glanced down at his clothes and footwear expert on quality ive heard madame branescu is an excellent dancer i am too i think we should lead the way she tried to give him her steely look but he seemed like a man who had access to one himself she smiled and gave him her hand youre not english are you she said as they made their way to the dance floor everybody watching and you limp you wont be disappointed are you swiss or maybe an austrian i can hear something in your accent im german i dont like germans she said switching to his language we havent arrived in bucharest yet if what the germans do to countries is arrive then you must be the arrivistes of the century perhaps that is why youre here because the germans who arent murderers are brutes thats why im here i dont know what calibre of german youve been meeting austrian germans i used to live in vienna but you are rumanian arent you asked felsen yes i am allow me to show you our less brutal side she looked at the swabian ploughboy with some doubt in her mind but he whisked her into a swing number that left her breathless and amazed felsen had been a little worried when hed heard the swing he didnt know whether madame branescus hips could cope but the woman knew how to move her pork they danced three numbers and left the floor to some light applause i didnt think hitler approved of swing said madame branescu hes afraid it will unhinge our goose step you should be careful talking like that she said you wouldnt be the first german to be taken off the streets did you know that the pvde are gestapotrained the pvde policia de vigilancia e de defesa do estado salazars security police she said and their jails are not so nice unless you can afford a good one i dont think theres anything that anybody can tell the germans about jails she excused herself to the powder room felsen calculated an extra inch of swing in her hips poser drew alongside most surprising felsen said poser in his ear an american taught me before the war i meant your taste your choice of partner thats my agricultural background poser said felsen it comes from chasing piglets round the yard poser smiled and moved off madame branescu reappeared having brought the flush down in her cheeks he walked her back to her table the escorts stood she flapped them back into their seats youre new in lisbon arent you herr felsen klaus felsen and yes im fresh in today you dont talk like somebody who needs to get to america because i dont need to go her eyes narrowed perhaps youre here to work on the contrary im here to dance which i hope we can do again he bowed and she let him brush her dimples with his lips before returning to her seat felsen found poser with his nose navigating the inside of a brandy glass you seem to have the measure of this place already said poser leaning back from the fumes i dont think so poser its just that you and i see things differently youre a diplomat who wants to know what everybodys thinking im an opportunist who wants to know what everybodys doing madame branescus another we recognized each other thats all but what could you possibly do for each other youll see youll see he said and moved off more people drifted into the casinoa mixed crowd some happy and smiling in spectacular evening dress others hunched and furtive in borrowed clothes felsen shouldered his way through to the cashier and made straight for the roulette table only fools played roulette he came across the usual sights and smells of the inside of a casino but this time their distinction was sharper and more poignant the tables were lit by the normal harsh glare of avaricean unblinking hardswallowing need but the air in between was layered with cigarette smoke and a fear so pungent it cut the back of felsens throat like steaming vinegar occasionally carefree elation broke out of the canopy like tropical birds from the forest but all the time crouching lower and lower a grim desperation sweated will into cheap shirts and shoredup evening dresses the hopes riding on the clicking chattering hopping ivory ball were either nothing or everything the backing for each milled chip on the green baize was either a banknote from the top of the next block or the last family jewel in the case the faces closest to the table the most avid were ones that would either pale to translucence at a jaunty jump of the ball or like the costive patient would momentarily flood with relief at a perfect movement felsen stood back from the crowd on the roulette table only his starched shirtfront picking up the edgy light an american talked loudly over his shoulder at anyone whod listen while slapping down the maximum bet on a number he didnt have to think about he stopped only to glance at the ball and to cheer when he won and shrug when he lost next to him seated and humped with age bathing in the sunny warmth of his stacked chips was an elderly spectral threadbare aristocrat probably russian who gripped her minimumstake chips with a tight whiteknuckled sinewy hand an englishman impeccable in his stiff wing collar looked down his nose at the turning wheel and disdained all winning numbers until his collar was all the stiffness left in him his mouth had already taken on the sneer of someone whod have to face bread and horse mackerel for lunch until the next remittance in front of felsen a minute portuguese woman who wore the rosette of the legion of honour was smoking cigarettes through a sixinch holder and wore gloves to her armpits she played for amusement and gave cigarettes to a young woman sitting at her side who smoked them too quickly with her chest pressed against the wood of the table as if she might influence the turn of the wheel the young woman had a single minimumstake chip which had scored red marks on to the palm of her hand it was a confused chip that could look confident on its own square right up until the call for last bets when it would have to join other chips on nearby squares before suffering the indignity of being taken back it survived five turns of the wheel like that until it found a home on number five which had come up twice in ten minutes the wheel turned the ivory ball span and clicked the white hand came out madame said the croupier severely and the hand shot back the ball settled in twentyfour and the hot chip was raked in the young womans head dropped the portuguese ladys hand found her back and patted it she gave her another cigarette the woman stood and turned and she found felsens eyes on her she smiled mr felsen isnt it thats right miss van lennep he said giving her a stack of chips would you put these on red for me the transfusion had an instant effect the anaemia was gone blood thumped again red came up she turned put them all on even said felsen even came up he split the chips and gave her half those are for you if you have to play play fiftyfifty but remember theres a zero on the wheel which always tips the odds away from you so shed already turned back to the table before she realized that the last piece of advice was the most important so what she said so dont play when it matters only for fun the portuguese woman who was the same size standing as the young woman was sitting nodded agreement laura van lennep put the chips in her handbag felsen offered her his arm they went to the wonderbar and drank whisky which she diluted with soda they danced on the lighted dance floor until felsen collided with one of madame branescus escorts who was hauling her around as if she was a castiron stove they nodded and felsen left the floor with his partner they sat at a front table and ordered more whisky you didnt say why you were in lisbon mr felsen what happened to your friend edward i think edward burton he had to go up north hes one of these angloportuguese from up there around porto the allies use them a lot for buying things you know they understand the people he told me it was all very important but i think he might be a bit silly she said diminishing him for her nearer purpose why did you ask him to help you hes young and goodlooking and wellconnected but not with the lady in the american consulate visa office he tried she likes them young and goodlooking but with money she nodded dismally and looked back at the gaming rooms the band released madame branescu from the next number and she walked past felsen and gave him a little roll of her eyes who was that asked laura van lennep madame branescu said felsen she runs the visa office in the american consulate something like love came into her face an hour later felsen was removing the pearled stud from his throat and stripping away the collar from his shirt he unthreaded his monogrammed gold cufflinks and put them on the dressing table next to a letter hed written on hotel parque stationery for the attention of madame branescu he undid a shirt button let me do that said the girl her borrowed evening dress lay on the chaise longue where shed thrown it with her small tight purse she knelt up on the bed in her black slip and stockings he stood in front of her with the first tingle of adrenalin shivering up his legs in his voluminous black trousers she undid his shirt drew the braces down off his shoulders and tugged the tails out of the waistband of his trousers he eased her towards him and felt her stiffen against his front she undid his trousers which dropped straight to the floor her head trembled on her neck at the jib of his undershorts she drew them out and over and put her fingers to her lips she was flushed crimson and not with whisky and soda in the bathroom she found something among the bottles of perfumes and unguents provided by the hotel parque that would suit her purpose jasmine oil back in the room felsen stood in his opened shirt her careful and thorough lubrication of him brought out the desperation of a chased man he frightened her as he pulled her round on the bed rucked up her slip and tore at the already flimsy laceedged knickers careful she said nervously and stretched back a hand to try and slow him down he stood between her bald heels showing out of the holes of her overused silk stockings she shouted out as he entered her and her elbows collapsed felsen grabbed at her haunches and pulled her back on to him her hand flailed behind her face was screwed up with pain her throat contorted by the way her head bent under her as he drove in felsen was shocked to find himself thrilled by her every wince at her fingers stretching out to push him back at the white knuckles of the other hand which gripped the rucked counterpane on the bed he didnt last long they lay on the bed in the light and cold air from the open windows she was under the covers huddled and shivering and trying not to cry this part always made her cry the shame of it how many times had this been in three months felsen smoked hed offered her one but she hadnt answered he was irritated because hed expected satisfaction but in emptying himself hed done just that and found his head full of eva he slept badly and woke early alone in the room which was now freezing and damp from the sea air he closed the window the letter hed written for the girl addressed to madame branescu had gone and the pair of gold kf cufflinks eva had given him on his last birthday werent on the dressing table later in the day he caught a lift into lisbon and went to the pensao amsterdao in rua de sao paulo at the front desk theyd never heard of laura van lennep and no one answered to the description he gave of her he worked the other pensions in the street and drew a blank he went to the american consulate and walked the line of faces but there were no single women finally he went down to the shipping offices but they were closed and the docks were empty the nyassa had gone chapter x th march guar da beira baixa portugal it had been raining in guarda all night it rained throughout breakfast and it rained during the strategy meeting felsen had convened with his fellowagents to decide on the necessary tactics if they were to buy and ship in the region of three hundred tons of wolfram per month for the rest of the year the size of his task had only just crystallized in his head on seeing the british beralt mine in panasqueira near fundao in the south of the beira the mine and buildings were extensive the colossal slag already part of the landscape to have created that quantity of slag there had to be a small city of hundredmetredeep shafts and kilometres of galleries under his feet there was nothing remotely comparable in the rest of the beira this feat of engineering was ripping two thousand tons of thick horizontal wolfram veins from the earth each year all the other mines in the area were nothing but scratches and nicks on the earths crust by comparison his only hope was total motivation of the people the galvanizing of thousands to the task of gleaning the surface and of course theft the strategy meeting had started off badly these men were already working at full stretch and had never achieved anything close to three hundred tons in a month they started off by complaining that the portuguese concessionholders had sensed which way the market was going and were stockpiling then they railed against the british who had instituted some preemptive buying operations which had forced the price up and encouraged the portuguese to sit tight price is no longer an issue said felsen which quietened the meeting our job now is to get our hands on the product by any means we can my intelligence briefing in lisbon indicates that the ukcc has a slow decisionmaking process that they are active in the market only for short periods that they are frightened of high prices because their managers are cautious and are buying with borrowed money they have shot themselves in the foot theyve driven the prices up and now theyve started to lose labour from their own mines their miners have begun to see that they can earn more fossicking than by taking wages to go underground we dont have any of these problems we have money we can be aggressive we can be consistent what do you mean by consistent it means we never fail to buy the british cant do that they work in fits and starts they disappoint we will never disappoint well develop close relationships with people on the ground people who control the local communities and well make them loyal to the german buying cause and how do we make them loyal roared one of the agents the british give them tea and cakes and kiss their children do we have time for that chasing three hundred tons a month theyre only loyal to one thing in the beira said another agent grimly thats not true said the first agent there are concessionowners who will only sell to the british some of them have british blood they will never come over to us youre both right said felsen firstive seen the people here the ordinary men they are living like we did in the middle ages they have nothing they walk twenty miles with fifty kilos of charcoal on their back to sell in town they make enough money to fill their stomachs so they can make it back to their villages these are very poor people they cant read or write they have a hard life ahead of them and it is these people who will scour the beira for us and bring in every rock of wolfram they can find in time people will see how easy the money is up here and more will come up from the south the alentejo is full of the same victims of poverty and theyll work for us too and what about the mines who sell to the british whatever the price my second pointthe people who work in those concessions live in villages we will move into the villages and encourage them to do some night shifts we will buy from them at market rates you mean stealing i mean distributing wealth i mean taking from the enemy i mean waging war in the beira theyre difficult people in the beira theyre mountain people mountain people are always difficult they have hard cold lives your job is to understand them to like them to befriend them and to buy their wolfram felsen divided the region up putting a group of agents in viseu mangualde and nelas another group in celorico and trancoso one further south in idanhaanova and he took for himself the area south of guarda to the serra da malcata from the foot of the serra da estrela in the west to the spanish border most of the product would travel on the guardavilar formoso road and cross the border at that point he needed the guarda nacional republicana in one pocket so that the trucks would get there and the alfandega in the other so that it would cross the border into spain without any trouble the town of guarda was the central point of the wolfram area it was the obvious headquarters the rain had stopped by the time hed finished the conference his driver came in to say that hed delivered the two bottles of brandy to the chefe of the gnr and that he should go to the gnr post now preferably before lunch for a meeting the chefe of the gnr had recently been transferred to this post from torres vedras he was a big man with a small face encased by a fat head his moustache was thick black and luxuriant as mink with ends tweaked to points making him look as if he was permanently delighted which most of the time he was his hand felt small and soft in felsens peasant grip and not one that was in the habit of coming down with the full force of the law felsen sat on the other side of the mans desk which looked as if it had seen heavy skirmishing during the peninsular wars the chefe thanked him for his gift and offered him a glass of absinthe he poured the green liquor into two small glasses felsens mouth crinkled at the bitterness of the wormwood as he laid a piece of newspaper down in front of the chefe he tapped an article near the bottom of the page the chefe read it sipping his absinthe and thinking about lunch he took one of felsens cigarettes youre making the front page in lisbon said felsen murder said the chefe looking out of the window at the clearing sky is very common now in this area this is the third murder in two weeks the bodies were all found in the same area and they were all stripped bound and bludgeoned to death its the wolfram said the chefe as if it was nothing to do with him of course its the wolfram theyve all gone crazy even the wild rabbits are collecting wolfram how is your investigation coming along the chefe shifted in his seat and drew on the strange turkish tobacco the fire hissed in the chimney theres since been a fourth death he said one of your officers he nodded his head and refilled the glasses the absinthe was smoothing the creases out in his fat face so that the schoolboy was beginning to come back into it are you pursuing the matter a state of lawlessness exists in the land he said dramatically sweeping his hand over his desk we have found the body in the same area the nod was slower this time where did the officer start his enquiries in a village called amendoa perhaps you will be going up there with a larger force the area i have to cover is large the present circumstancesdifficult so youd like this lawlessness to stop without using up your manpower this is unlikely he said sadly theres a lot of money at stake here these people have been living on five tostoes here five there for them a single escudo is a fortune when a small rock of wolfram is worth seventyfive eighty a hundred escudos its like a fever in their brains you cant imagine they go mad if i could ensure that your law is upheld that therell be no more violence perhaps youd be able to help me with some of my difficulties no more violence he said repeating this back to his glass of absinthe as if it had put the idea to him none none said felsen repeating the lie what would be the nature of your difficulties as you know therell be a lot of my trucks moving product around the mining areas and out to the border at vilar formoso customs is a separate organization i understand that where you can help is with the papers the guias that we have to present when were moving the product around but the guias are very important for the government they have to know whats going where that is true and ordinarily there would be no problem but the bureaucracy ah yes the bureaucracy said the chefe suddenly feeling trussed in his uniform youre a businessman i understand businessmen like to do what they want when they want they lapsed into silence from the chefes facial expressions it appeared that there was some internal struggle going on as if there was something indigestible going down or a painful wind ballooning in his bowel wanting to get out ill find out what happened to your officer too said felsen but that wasnt it the chefe was not wildly overconcerned at that the guias are a very important government mechanism this would be a serious breach of there will of course be a commission for you on every ton we move said felsen and he realized hed hit the point the creases unfurled the belly quietened the chefe took another of felsens cigarettes and skewered him with a look at the same time but without the guias said the chefe how will i know how many tons you have moved how will my commission be calculated you and i will have a meeting with customs once a month the chefe s smile was extended another foot by the joy of his moustache they shook hands and finished their drinks the chefe opened the door for him and clapped him on the shoulder if you go up to amendoa he said you should talk to joaquim abrantes hes a very influential man in that area the door closed behind felsen leaving him in the gloom of an unlit corridor he walked slowly out of the building contemplating his first lesson in underestimating the portuguese he got into his car and instructed the driver to take him up to amendoa in the foothills of the serra da estrela there was no road up to amendoa it was a rough track of beaten earth with slabs of granite showing through lined on either side by broom and heather and then later and higher pine forest the rain had stopped but the cloud was still hanging and drifting lower down the mountains to the treetops until it sucked in the car itself the driver rarely got out of second gear men appeared on the track cowled like monks they wore split sacks over their heads grey and silent they moved to the side without turning felsen sat in the middle of the back seat feeling every metre between himself and the rough civilization of guarda lengthening behind him hed mentioned the middle ages in the conference but this was more like the iron age or earlier he wouldnt have been surprised to see people hoeing with bone he hadnt seen a mule or a donkey yet all the carrying was done on the shoulders by men and on the head by women the car came up on to the flat there was no sign announcing amendoa granite block houses appeared out of the mist a woman in black shuffled across the road the driver pulled over at the only house on two levels in the village they got out there was an open door at street level an old woman was working amongst sacks of grain boxes for salting hams cured cheeses racks of potatoes bunches of herbs buckets and tools the driver asked for joaquim abrantes the woman left her work locked the door with knobbed and crooked fingers and took the two men up the granite steps on the outside of the house to a porch supported by two granite pillars she left them there and went into the house a few minutes later she reopened the door and felsen ducked into the dark house the driver went back to the car a fire was smoking heavily in a large fireplace emitting no heat as his eyes got used to the lack of light he began to pick out an old man sitting in the fireplace there were chouricos hanging along a pole above his head the woman had taken a rag out of her pocket and was wiping the old mans eyes he moaned quietly as if disturbed from sleep and coming into a world of pain she left the room a throat somewhere in the house coughed and spat the woman returned with two small clay lamps burning olive oil she put one on the table and pointed felsen into a chair some of the slate tiles were visible through the laths between the rafters of the roof she left the other lamp in a wall niche wiped the old mans eyes again and left the two windows in the room were permanently closed up to the weather by heavy wooden shutters after some minutes the double doors behind felsen shuddered open and a short and very wide man engineered himself through the gap sideways he roared something to the back of the house and then offered his hand which gripped felsens with a mechanical hardness he sat resting his forearms across the table the rough hands with split nails hung off square wrists the body under the heavy jacket was thickboned and powerful felsen recognized something in him and knew from that first moment that this was the man who was going to help him control the beira a girl in a headscarf brought in a bottle of aguardente and two glasses the portugueses face was still in the glow from the oil lamp and as big as a landscape opencastmined his hair was swept back in a thick black and grey lava flow his brow and nose like an escarpment with an exposed ridge of granite his eye sockets and cheekbones like craters the whole geography of the face was hardened to bleakness by years of cold dry wind it was impossible to tell his ageanything from thirtyfive to fiftyfive but whatever the minerals he had in the bones of his face they were not extended to his teeth which were blackened and worn sheered off and yellowing or just missing joaquim abrantes poured the pale alcohol into the glasses they drank the girl returned with bread cured ham cheese and chourico she laid a knife in front of abrantes the girls face was very young her eyes lightcoloured blue or green it was difficult to say in the yellow oily light a strand of blonde hair hung down from her headscarf she was prettier than anything felsen had seen since leaving lisbon but young no older than fifteen but strangely with the body the full form of a grown woman abrantes watched the german looking at the girl he moved the ham in front of him and handed him the bread and knife he ate the ham was perfectly sweet bolotas said abrantes acorns they make the meat sweet dont you think i havent seen many oak trees around here its all broom and pine they have them away from the mountains i bring them up here i have the sweetest pigs in the beira they ate and drank more the chourico was lumpy with chunks of fat the cheese soft sharp and salty i heard you were coming to see me said abrantes i dont know how news gets through to us up here weve even heard about your war so you know why im here to investigate murder said abrantes his shoulders shaking metal chinking in his jacket the man laughing murder interests me thats true i dont know why you should be interested in the death of a few portuguese peasants and the gnr officer that was an accident he fell off his horse these things happen on difficult terrain said abrantes and anyway whats interesting isnt there enough killing in your war to keep you occupied without having to come to the beira its interesting because it means that someone is controlling the situation and this is a situation you would perhaps like to control yourself this is your country senhor abrantes they are your people the glasses were refilled felsen offered a cigarette abrantes refused not ready to accept anything yet felsen admired the psychology senhor abrantes said felsen im going to make you a very rich man joaquim abrantes turned his glass on the wooden table as if he was screwing it in he didnt respond maybe hed heard it before you and i senhor abrantes are going to corner the market in every scrap of uncontracted wolfram in this area why should i work with you when i do very well myself and if you can make me rich cant the british do the same perhaps id prefer to play the market it has only one direction as far as i can see the british will never be in the market for as much tonnage as us they still buy they buy to close you out what do you think of the wolfram price now asked felsen it is high are you buying abrantes rearranged himself in his seat i have stocks he said the price is going up if as you say the wolfram price has one direction then youre going to sell high to buy higher that is if you want to stay in the market abrantes darker eye the one away from the light looked over the granite ridge of his nose what are you proposing senhor felsen im proposing to increase your capacity to trade wolfram for my account you have the money i have no doubt but do you have any idea how you can do it perhaps you know the country better than i do abrantes thumbed a lump of bread and cheese into his mouth and swilled it back with the aguardente a lot of the wolfram thats brought to me is not pure he said theres always quartz and pyrites in it if we set up companies to clean the wolfram we will attract more of the mineral and guarantee the quality felsen nodded id want financial control said abrantes i dont want to have to ask permission for every rock i buy and id want a share of the profits and if there are no profits a guaranteed percentage of the turnover how much fifteen percent felsen stood and went towards the door you might be able to make that on your own account with small volume but i cant offer anywhere near that for the volumes im talking about what are these volumes thousands rather than hundreds of kilos the portuguese balanced that in his head if i go with you im out of the market im not stopping you from trading for your own account how long will you be in the market i have no guarantee that youll senhor abrantes this war this war that we need all this wolfram for will change everything do you know whats happening in europe germany controls everything from scandinavia to north africa from france to russia the british are finished germany will control the economy of europe and if you work with me you will be a friend of germany so to answer your question senhor abrantes we will be in the market for your lifetime the lifetime of your children and theirs and more ten percent thats not a percentage that the business can bear said felsen and reached for the door seven i dont think you understand where this business is going senhor abrantes if you did youd know that a single percent would make you the richest man in the beira come sit down he said we can discuss this we must eat you must know how important it is for us to eat by now i know it said felsen and sat down the girl brought in a thick stew of pork liver and black pudding she put more bread on the table and a jug of red wine the two men ate alone abrantes told felsen the dish was called sarrabulho and that it was the best thing the girl had learnt from her mother joaquim abrantes might have been a peasant once but he wasnt one any more this didnt mean as felsen found out during their discussion towards an agreement on volumes and percentages that he could read or write it meant that his father had farmed land and between them theyd acquired more he had the house which was joined to two others at the back and to the side they had livestock he appreciated good food and drink he had his young wife he was a strange brute on the few occasions that their eyes met felsen had the same feeling as he did looking into a bulls head there was something big private and planetary going on inside the mans brain he understood surprising things about business and numbers but had no concept of maps or distances unless hed travelled them he had an instinct for power he didnt like anybody except his old halfblind father women did not speak to him after lunch he excused himself felsen stood and stretched through the double doors he saw into a parlour where the mother was crocheting and beyond that into the kitchen abrantes was standing behind the girl who was leaning with both hands on the table he had his hand up her skirt he straightened the front of his trousers and looked down as if he might mount her there and then he thought better of it and went outside and down the back stairs chapter xi rd july guarda beira baixa portugal felsen was sweating at his small table by the shuttered window in the airless restaurant which had fans but not working ones the shutters kept out the devastating heat which blasted off the cobbles and stone facades of the buildings but did not improve the stuffiness in the room the restaurant contained fifteen men split between two tables near the door and him alone at the other end the men were loud volframistas with too much money from their mineral finds and too much brandy in their guts they all had chapeus ricos which were the same as poor mans hats but more expensive and they all had pens in their jacket breast pockets even though they were illiterate to a man the restaurant had been quiet enough until theyd run out of the best wine in the house and the volframistas had taken to drinking brandy in the same quantity as wine their rivals on the next table matched them bottle for bottle the insults were piling high like washingup in the sink and they were threatening to soak blood into the bare rough wooden floors joaquim abrantes came in and shouted at the table of fat sweating men nearest the door they calmed the other volframistas continued a oneway trade in insults abrantes turned his head slowly on them and gave them a smile with some brandnew dentures they were more sinister than the wrecking rocks hed had before and the men shut up abrantes sat down opposite felsen in his new suit he was learning the value of a smile in business with northern europeans but he hadnt quite mastered the new dentures hed had fitted in lisbon at felsens expense the month before felsen had just flown back from berlin having had a meeting with the uglier side of gruppenfuhrer lehrer on the th june lehrer had been to see fritz todt the armaments minister who had been sick and grey with worry at the consequences for his production line of the invasion of russia which was due to start on nd june lehrer had told felsen that the wolfram stocks were pitiful and gave him a vivid description of another meeting hed had with the ssreichsfuhrer himmler whod trampled his balls into the carpet felsen doubted this hed seen himmler at a rally in munich before the war the man was more of a beancounter than a balltrampler there was a net result of this bad lunch meeting wolfram was required at any price he was to look at tin as well and there were other marketssardines olive oil cork hides blankets for instance does that mean were going to take on the russians in their own winter felsen had asked russia is a large place lehrer had replied slowly and quietly our little delay was not timely it takes time to conquer yugoslavia greece rumania bulgaria the champagne has been flowing in the hotel parque no doubt said lehrer cutting him off savagely i wouldnt know herr gruppenfuhrer the riesling had gone down like acid felsen had flown back to lisbon and looked to the abwehr for some intelligence help that would give him an edge against the british who had matched his new prices and taken a fiftyton contract from under his nose they were not helpful felsen was now back in the beira looking to do some kicking himself abrantes sucked the soup between his new dentures felsen two courses ahead toyed with a large lump of pork but had no appetite theres going to be a car said abrantes on a small road between melos and seixo tomorrow afternoon between two and four oclock with a british agent abrantes nodded do we know anything else no except the road is in pine forest who told you the driver is he reliable he cost a thousand and he wants a job well have to look after him reliabilitys getting expensive abrantes nodded over his shoulder at the volframistas they wont eat bread any more its too cheap they have wristwatches but cant tell the time they cap their rotten teeth with gold but still sleep over their sheep the beiras a place for madmen now a whole village came to see me yesterday a whole village four hundred people from somewhere outside castelo branco theyve heard the prices two hundred escudos for a little rock and they earn fifty times their daily wage theyre calling it black gold it cant go on theyll buy cars next then youll see well all be dead men i mean dr salazar wont allow this to carry on the government wont let people leave their homes stop tending their crops they wont let wages and prices get out of control salazar knows about inflation inflation its a plague of the pocket tell me its a disease that kills money money is paper senhor felsen said abrantes flatly do you know what cancer is abrantes nodded and stopped working on his bacalhau well theres cancer of the blood too it looks the same its still red but theres something growing inside it you look at your tenescudo note one day and the next day its a hundred escudos and the day after that a thousand escudos and this is not good the money still looks the same but it has no value the government is printing money just to keep up with price and wage rises your thousandescudo note buys you nothing we know about inflation in germany joaquim abrantes knife and fork still hovered over his bacalhau it was the only time felsen ever saw him scared th july serra da estrela beira baixa portugal it was hot unbearably hot and still even up in the foothills of the serra where there should have been some breeze there was only this bleaching drying heat so dense that felsen could feel it searing his throat and lungs he sweated in the back seat of the citroen with the window open and the furnace air bellowing over him he drank warm water from a metal flask abrantes sat next to him with his jacket on not a drop of sweat on him theyd driven up from belmonte where thered been crowds of people out in the baking wilderness so many people that felsen had thought that there must have been some miracle another vision such as the one outside fatima in and people were hurrying to catch their sight of the blessed virgin but it was wolfram that had brought them out black shiny crystallized magma blasted up from the centre of the earth a million years ago hed been the start of this new cult and it fascinated and horrified him people had left their lives on one side smalltown mayors bureaucrats lawyers cobblers stonemasons charcoalmakers tailors theyd all left their work to go scratching at the hills tearing at the heather gouging up the earth their minds teeming with the virus of wolfram if youd wanted to die there was nobody to organize your funeral for you no one to make a coffin for you the blond englishman felt sick he lay sprawled in the back seat of his wreck of a car trying to get some coolness on his fair skin on his red arms and pink face it had been a long brutal drive from viseu with nothing going right hed stopped thinking about wolfram after the first puncture and drifted off into a mild delirium where he was married to a blueeyed dutch girl having children and making wine the road jolted him out of his fantasy the driver finding the deepest potholes with instinctive genius snatches of reality riddled through his brain why did she want to go to america there was no talking to the woman should he feel guilty maybe he should maybe he should have at least gone to the us consulate at least tried to talk to the woman in the visa office but why cut off your own nose to spite your face god this heat this strange light dust from the desert the driver had said the man was a bloody idiot and insolent too these beira people hed never get the hang of them why had they brought him down from the minho it never got that hot up there and the people were easier wolfram and hed never even kissed her felsens car dropped down the hillside into the pine forest through the hairpins to the valley floor and then back up the other side a small truck followed with four men and a driver they reached the bend in the road theyd found the day before and got out the car and the truck moved off further up the hill and stopped two men dragged the pine tree which theyd dug out and pushed over yesterday across the road another with an axe set off round the hairpin and up the hill felsen abrantes and the rest went into the susurrating heat of the pine forest abrantes gave each of the men a wooden cudgel they all sat on a crust of dried pine needles abrantes straightened a leg and eased out a walther p from his waistband felsen lit a cigarette and hung his head between his knees hed drunk too much the night before and this heat was getting closer and the light was reddening at the edges as if something terrible was going to happen something unnatural like an earthquake the men whispered behind him their heels dug into the hillside shut up he said to the ground the men fell silent felsen tried to rearrange his undershorts around his genitals which were sore from last nights whoring he shuddered at the memory of the womans vast dimpled buttocks her thick black bush and her garlic sewery breath the disgust stuck in his throat and he couldnt swallow flies settled on his sweaty shirt and needled him so that he lashed out over his shoulder he was hitting another low he tried to let his mind drift off but it came aground again on the same rocks eva lehrer and the gold kf cufflinks the girl had stolen the men were whispering again it maddened him and he leapt to his feet tearing his own gun from his pocket he pointed it at each of them in turn shut up shut up shut up abrantes held up his hand they all heard the car on the valley floor at the same time it changed gear and started up the gradient the men were still as owls on a branch felsen sat down and looked through the trees to the man with the axe who was waiting above them on the side of the road fifty metres up from the fallen tree he held up his hand the car worked its way up through the hairpins the driver disdaining the clutch and crunching through the gears the sharp stink of resin began to tickle the back of felsens dry throat youre going to shred that gearbox if you dont use the clutch shouted the englishman from the back seat the driver didnt turn a hair he stirred the pudding with his gearstick and screeched the shift through the gate as if he enjoyed the sound of grating metal the englishman slumped back as the car shuddered round the next hairpin what would it be like to kiss her lips hed felt the corner of it just on the edge of his lip once and the newness of it had shot through him months ago would she still be there he took out his wallet and eased her photograph out with his thumb he felt the car slow down what is it fallen tree said the driver revving the engine desperate not to stall is it fallen or cut asked the englishman looking around him through the pine forest slipping his wallet back its fallen you can see the roots how does a pine tree fall at this time of the year the driver shrugged no expert no expert on anything not even driving get out and take a look said the englishman the driver blasted the accelerator again no wait he said nervous now suspicious nobody got out of the car for a full two minutes the driver gunned the engine until it died abruptly they all sat in the cicadabroken resinated silence of the forest the driver got out and gave the tree the benefit of his indolence he went to the back of the car opened the boot and rummaged about without looking he shut it and leaned into the rear window the english agent got out he was tall dressed in khaki trousers and a white shirt sleeves rolled up a revolver hung from his right hand he looked over the roof into the trees he checked the base of the pine tree he went back to the car laid the gun on the roof stripped off his shirt and tossed it through the rear window he was in a white vest now his arms red to his elbows and white above felsen dropped his arm and the man with the axe over the crook of his elbow set off down the road to the tree boa tarde he said to the two men in the road the agent tore his gun off the roof and pointed it at the peasant whose hands shot into the air the axe clattered to the floor the agent beckoned him over the tree the peasant looked at his axe the englishman shook his head nao nao anda ca anda ca he said the peasant told him in a thick accent that he didnt want to leave his axe there on the floor the driver repeated it for the agents benefit the agent told him to pick it up and hand it over the peasant held out the smooth wooden handle the agent gave it to the driver and told him to get on with it let him do the work said the driver i want you to do it we dont know him the driver shook his head and walked away the englishman was angry but in a situation now he shoved the revolver in his waistband and set to work on the tree the driver sat on the front bumper and wiped the sweat off his forehead the peasant looked at the agent with the mildness of expression that a working mans face takes on when he sees someone who doesnt know how to use a tool the agent was in a lather in seconds at first he stopped to wipe the sweat then he just flicked his head to keep it out of his eyes the peasants hands itched leave him be said felsen under his breath easing himself down the hillside to the edge of the road let him do it felsen and abrantes walked on either side of the car past the driver on the bumper felsen nodded to the peasant posso the peasant asked the englishman may i the agent handed him the axe and felt felsens warm walther p in the hollow behind his right ear abrantes removed the englishmans revolver the agents legs were trembling in his trousers he turned slowly and couldnt stop the flicker of recognition across his eyes as he saw the german this one thought felsen whose eyes were hot in his head laura van lenneps friend the one who wouldnt shake his hand what was this ones name edward burton abrantes told the englishmans driver to help the men move the tree off the road the driver had different ideas he wasnt a labourer any more this wasnt his type of work and where was his thousand escudos abrantes tightened his hat down on his head felsen already on the brink snapped he ripped one of the mens wooden cudgels out of his hands and ran at the driver the driver went on to his back foot his mind changing fast but it was too late felsen fell on him like a pile of logs swiping and slashing and chopping the driver went down in the first mad chaos of blows from the cudgel felsen with his heart blasting in his chest dropped to his knees and hammered and hammered and hammered until he didnt know what he was hammering any more the other men stopped their work and watched him through their sweat felsen wiped his forehead on his shoulder and stained it dark he rubbed his eyes but couldnt get the dimmed edges of his vision to brighten he was panting still down on his knees his head thumping and his vision pulsing with it he looked down at the piece of meat in front of him and felt his guts rise he got to his feet on shaky legs the bloody club hanging loosely from his hand the englishman was vomiting the light sickened further the high red dust scarfing the sun the men hadnt gone back to work and felsen thought he might join the englishman until he saw their faces they were confused and afraid of the power of a man who could do such a thing for nothing at all felsen had seen them like this before but only around abrantes now you see he said pointing at them with the cudgel still breathing heavily now you understand the importance of obedience isnt that right senhor burton the use of his name jerked the agent up straight from his retching but he couldnt get any words out his lips had gone white in his pale face he sweated fatly from the forehead as if hed been touched by cholera bury him said felsen and threw the cudgel at the feet of the men abrantes led burton to the back seat of his car while felsen got behind the wheel they stopped at abrantes house and picked up a chair some rope and a bottle of cool bagaco from the back of the cellar they drove to a disused mine in the hills near amendoa one where the wolfram vein had run out after about thirty metres in the boot of the car was a brazier and some charcoal and a few chouricos abrantes sprinkled the raw alcohol of the bagaco over the coals and started a fire in burtons briefcase felsen found bundles of notes amounting to escudos and an unsigned contract for eighty tons of wolfram with a mining concession down in penamacor his throat still felt dry but there was no water so he chugged the cold bagaco and wiped his mouth on his sleeve did you ever see laura again asked felsen in english flicking through the contract the chave douro said burton on automatic did she get her precious visa burton stared into his past as if it was his own country disappearing over the horizon felsen took another blast of alcohol trying to stop the needle from scoring the inside of his cranium the cool alcohol burnt all the way down did she he asked again and burton looked up wildeyed but didnt answer felsen frisked the englishmans pockets and came up with the wallet he fingered through the currency and came across the photograph he held it up to the terracotta light of the afternoon did you get what you wanted asked felsen at least tell me that i didnt want her to get a visa in that case you probably didnt get what you wanted what did i want you mean felsen stopped to fuck her mr burton didnt you want to fuck her laura he said ah said felsen a misunderstanding i dont follow lauras deal you didnt know lauras deal you get me a visa no you look as if you can get me a visa and you can fuck me just the word visa brought love into her eyes it was there for everyone to see mr burton i was not the first i can assure you not by a long way felsen turned the photograph over to edward with love he read and for some reason it made felsen crueller come on edward dont tell me i mean she was doing things youd be hard pressed to get a friedrichstrasse whore to do burton was off his chair and on him his scrawny arm around the germans bull neck he drove his boys fist into the mans kidney felsens thick elbow kicked back like a steam piston the boy went down abrantes fanned the charcoal white felsen secured burton to the chair he took another shot of the bagaco his head felt better clearer smoother he shook the contract at the englishman youre on my territory edward this is my wolfram youre taking who else are you talking to down there burton shut down his brain he didnt listen to the german he didnt smell the acrid charcoal he didnt feel the hot pant of abrantes fan he didnt see the red clouds boiling in the strange sky felsen found a length of wire in the boot of the car abrantes began roasting the chouricos turning them with fingers suddenly dainty felsen pushed more questions at the english agent his tongue thick in his mouth the alcohol telling now the alcohol reminding him of laura the stolen cufflinks eva lehrer the whore in guarda last night burton was silent forcing the gross smell of the spitting pork fat out of his mind that fat rumanian sow in the visa office told me salazars police were gestapotrained said felsen my colleagues told me it was kramer hes a kz commandant now they know how to treat you in a kz we all hear about it edward we all know but theres nothing like learning from actual experience ive never been in one which means ive only learnt at secondhand so you might find my methods a little unrefined felsen tucked the wire into the coals he removed the agents belt and using abrantes knife cut away the mans trousers and undershorts he found a leather glove fitted his hand into it and removed the hot wire he stopped feeling a rush of wind at his back he looked out of the mine at the chemical sky then stepped towards the englishman the peasants whod been burying the body of the driver in the pine forest arrived back in amendoa a little after five in the afternoon the day was at its hottest their eyeballs stung in their sockets and their mouths were full of thick rancid saliva they went to the spring drank heavily and dipped rags from their pockets into the water and cooled their necks and faces they stopped only when they heard the animal for the first time a strange animal of a type theyd never heard before and in terrible pain they walked to the edge of the village a scream came from a hole out in the hills and suddenly they recognized it they put their hats on and straightened them they went back to the cool of their granite houses and lay down on their wooden cots heads on elbows the balls of their palms in their ears the weather broke the thunder roused felsen from his drunken sleep he didnt know where he was his head ached so that he thought he must have fallen and his mouth tasted sour as cheese he rolled over to see the englishman slumped in his chair and it shocked him he was going to check him but he saw the gun on the floor and the blood over the mans chest and how had that happened rain began falling darkly felsen went out into it to wash his hands he leapt back and fell staggering into the mine crashing over abrantes supine body his hands and shirt stained red his arms flecked with more red he kicked at the rocks on the floor to get away from the crude opening of the mine it was raining blood out there he roared at abrantes whod come awake and put his hand out into the rain and squeezed it in his fist this happened before he said and wiped his hand clean on his trousers my father told me that it rained like this forty years ago it comes through the red desert dust its nothing they folded the agents body into the boot of the car and backed up the track to abrantes house they unloaded burton into the yard felsen drove the car back and as deep into the old mine as it would go the storm had brought night on early when he dimmed the headlights in the mine there wasnt a scrap of ambient light he gripped the steering wheel and pressed his forehead to it the sound of shattering glass came to him the bagaco bottle on the wall of the mine the neck of it now forming the handle of a primitive tool how could that have happened abrantes was waistdeep in a hole in the yard the girl watching him she was big pregnant halfway through her term she poured felsen a glass of cool white wine and went into the house congratulations said felsen reconnected now with the world abrantes wondered what he meant felsen nodded to the house it had better be a boy said abrantes isnt she young for children more likely to produce boys i didnt know that its what the senhora dos santos says our local wise woman abrantes shovelled earth a cigarette in the corner of his mouth how old is the girl i dont know the girl came into the yard with olives cheese and meats she laid them on the table next to the wine how old are you asked abrantes i dont know she said they buried the body and went to bed felsen dreamt vividly he woke up his bladder swollen tight he mistakenly stumbled into the main house to relieve himself and heard the sound of abrantes animal grunting and the girl making a kind of hissing sound as if shed cut herself with a knife he went back out into the yard and then to the edge of the village where the air was now fresh and the earth smelling rich after the rain he pissed a twentymetre length of barbed wire tears coursed down his face that whore in guarda the pain was excruciating chapter xii th december ss barracks unter den eichen berlinlichterfelde so said gruppenfuhrer lehrer summarizing the wolfram campaign to brigadefuhrers hanke fischer and wolff we have received tons here in germany theres tons in transit and there are tons of stocks in portugal by my mathematics that makes a total of tons which is tons below the ton target for the year silence from the four men felsen sat smoking in a chair about three metres adrift from lehrers desk our intelligence in lisbon inform us that the british exported tons you probably havent seen the beralt mine sir said felsen its a colossal operation intelligence goes on to say that tons of that was free wolfram uncontracted wolfram as i see it thats tons that should have come to germany my god said lehrer rifling through the papers on his desk the money were paying for this escudos per ton said felsen that doesnt mean anything to me six thousand pounds per ton said wolff exactly said lehrer huge money its over seven thousand pounds a ton in spain and product is moving across the border to take advantage of that said felsen in a market like this its not always easy to persuade people to sell the british moved out of the market in october and you saw the price fell by a quarter now theyre back in that shouldnt stop you from buying we have to accept that when the british are in the market they will always have their contacts these are people who cannot be persuaded to sell to us not with money and not with fear fear we are conducting our own war in the beira its just not as well covered as the russian campaign blankets said hanke in a kneejerk reaction to the word russia not now hanke said lehrer it might make you happier to know that the british are paying more for their wolfram said felsen salazar introduced a pounds per ton export tax in october all the british product goes out by sea so they have to declare every kilo in the ports ive shipped more than tons without paying any tax smuggling asked fischer its a long and difficult border we understand that salazar wants to reduce the wolfram production all this money were pouring into his country is worrying him inflation that sort of thing thats why he brought in the export tax said felsen now hes put a special department of the metals corporation in position which is designed to buy all wolfram and tin yes yes yes we know all this said hanke our legation in lisbon will now have to persuade salazar that germany deserves the lions share of the free wolfram ahead of the british i will carry on buying and smuggling said felsen but from now on the big tonnage will be settled in the government offices in lisbon and not out in the fields of the beira it will take time though why ask poser he thinks salazars the trickiest bastard since napoleon whats salazar after asked wolff gold raw materials no trouble we have gold we can probably lay our hands on some good steel and if he doesnt like that we can hurt him said lehrer how asked fischer we sank the ss corte real back in october fischer dont you remember anything theres no reason why we shouldnt torpedo another one oh i see what you mean said fischer whod had something more personal in mind now blankets hanke said lehrer the meeting and dinner afterwards went on until pm lehrer had accompanied him to his waiting car jolly drunk and dangerous the americans are in now felsen how about that hed said and run his finger back and forth over his palm as if he was spreading something then hed clapped his hands dont forget the liverwurst felsen didnt react lehrer shook with laughter the car started its slow molecrawl back to his apartment in berlin felsen hadnt said anything in the meeting but those figures had bothered him he knew his campaign hadnt made the ton target but he also knew he was a lot closer than tons adrift there must have been something wrong with the way the stocks had been calculated in portugal he smoked a cigarette in about three drags thinking about it the car dropped him off just before midnight he waited for it to leave and then he set out for evas club on the kurfurstendamm he took a small table on his own in an alcove with a view of evas office door a girl with short jetblack hair and bare white arms was singing badly up on the stage but getting away with it because her legs were long slim and perfect in nylon he ordered a brandy and looked at all the women in the house no eva a girl came to his table and asked if he wanted company she was boyish with no hips and a starved bottom he shook his head without speaking the girl shrugged her bony shoulders felsen took out his cigarettes the silver case slipped out of his hand he fished around under the table there was another hand there he surfaced eva was putting one of his cigarettes in her mouth she lit it then felsens and polished the case on her dress i thought it was you she said i still dont recognize you in uniform i mean i cant distinguish men in uniform shall i join you for a bit she swung her legs under the table and her knee touched his there was a spark of recognition a pulse that travelled and brought back a time and two people whod known something of each other what happened to you she asked giving him back his case touching his hand the familiar hair tough hair strong as pig bristle youve lost your berlin pallor you were always the pale one he said recently ive become translucent she said its the diet and the fear you dont look scared the only reason i have a full house tonight is because of the cloud cover some nights its just me and the girls and our friends from across the water dropping christmas turkeys the girls are looking scrawnier said felsen not seeing evas stickthin arm me too she said showing him an arm stringy with muscle he played with his glass and made a perfect cone of the ember of his cigarette how to get started nine months out of berlin and hed lost the veneer the harddried varnish of cynicism and wit that got the berliners through their days i saw you in bern he said to the ashtray she frowned and her cheeks sank as she drew on her cigarette ive never been to bern she said you must have i saw you in a nightclub in bern back in february but klaus ive never even been to switzerland i saw you there with him he was completely still and looking at her with the intensity of a hungry wolf down from the mountain she returned the look backlit the smoke curling around her head no backing down from the lie youve changed she said and took a sip from his brandy glass i spend a lot of time outdoors weve all changed she said and her knee disconnected from his theres been a human hardening we all end up doing things we dont necessarily want to do he said but its not as if theres no opportunity just that theres not always the choice yes he said and had a hot stink of memory from a july afternoon in a disused mine when there had been a choice and something had gone wrong what happened to you klaus she asked the different emphasis jolting him as if hed been wearing something on his face he shouldnt have some things cant easily be explained that is very true she replied the girl whod come by earlier drew up next to eva nobody wants me to sit with them she said sit with klaus said eva he wants you to sit with him they looked at him he nodded to the empty space the girl wriggled in happy now eva leaned over and put her cheek next to his its been nice she said to have a little talk she left no scent only the feeling of her warm breath my name is traudl said the girl we met before he said and turned the brandy glass around on its coaster he put it to his lips where evas had been she still wore the same lipstick he took traudl back to his apartment she talked for the two of them he hung his coat up poured himself a drink and found that shed gone he was relieved until she called him from the bedroom he told her to come back into the living room its cold she said she was naked walking on tiptoe across the polished floor the tendons and sinews in her thin legs visible the unfilled flaps of her breasts with shrivelled nipples hung off the racked ribs of her chest she hugged them to herself he took off his tunic and loosened the braces off his shoulders she shivered with her fists under her chin he saw her back view reflected in the glass doors of the bedroomthe sad bottom with hip bones protruding he nearly lost all enthusiasm for the project he sat down and asked her to massage the front of his trousers her teeth chattered his penis wouldnt stir youre cold go back to bed he said no she said i want to go back to bed he said with a little blade in his voice and she didnt argue he sat in the dark and drank aguardente that hed brought back with him for christmas it tasted like hell he circled over his meeting with eva looking for scraps there were none in the early hours he decided there was nothing left for him in berlin and hed take the next flight back to lisbon he flew back the next day via rome and spent only enough time in lisbon for poser to tell him that something had happened he didnt know what it was he had men working on it but salazar was not happy hes frothing at the mouth said poser relishing it completely rabid with fury magnificent rage and the allies are catching it just in time for our negotiations with the metals commission felsen drove up to the beira and spent the afternoon of the th december with the accountant in guarda he made a small circuit of his territory and three days before christmas appeared in amendoa on a windwhipped frozen morning there was no sign of abrantes the old woman was there with her husband abrantes father sitting in his customary winter position in the fireplace crying from the smoke the girl was there too with her son pedro who was four months old felsen asked her where her husband was and she looked embarrassed which she was only rarely in his company now that she was used to him her fingers were ringless she wasnt married felsen stroked the babys downy head which fitted neatly into his palm the girl offered him food and drink and flipped the baby on to her hip let me take him said felsen she hesitated and searched the germans face with her limegreen eyes foreigners she gave him the baby and went to the kitchen shed never regained her girlish form her bosom had stayed full and her hips swung in her calflength skirts when she turned she found felsen looking at her in that way and she nearly smiled he tickled the baby pedro grinned and felsen had a cameo of joaquim abrantes with his dentures out she brought him some wine and chourico he gave her the baby who reached for her breasts is he out on his land asked felsen thinking abrantes might be fossicking his twenty hectares now that the wolfram price had peaked he left this morning he didnt say she said do you expect him back she shruggedabrantes didnt talk to any of the women in his house felsen drank two glasses of the rough wine and ate a couple of chunks of chourico and went out into the cold morning he drove into the next valley and found someone to take him to abrantes piece of land he was right they were working it but no abrantes there was a small granite and slate house on the property half its roof was fallen in the unbroken slates stacked in rows on the floor the shattered ones in a pile of grey shards a woman was cooking in there out of the wind stirring a pot on a rusted brazier she was filthy and haggard her face sunken with toothlessness the door was rotten on the other side of the house people were living in there there was a ragcovered pallet and some chipped clay jars the place smelled of damp earth and urine something small was shivering under the rags one of abrantes peasants from amendoa came around the side of the house and stopped surprised to see felsen he removed his hat and came forward bowing felsen asked after abrantes hes not here said the peasant looking at the ground and the others where are they why arent they here no answer and who are these people living out here on the land of senhor abrantes like this the woman left her pot and began talking to the peasant in toothless portuguese and at some length using her wooden spoon for emphasis what is she saying it is nothing said the peasant the woman railed at him the peasant looked away felsen directed his question at the woman she gave him a very long answer during which the peasant cut in with the short words she is the wife of senhor abrantes and this child in here the peasant beckoned felsen away from the old crone around to the back of the house where there were three mounds of grass unmarked the children of senhor abrantes said the peasant a sickness of the lungs and the one inside the peasant nodded all girls he nodded again where is senhor abrantes spain he said without taking his eyes from the mounds the peasants name was alvaro fortes felsen put him in the front seat next to the driver and they went to the border at vilar formoso felsen drank aguardente from the same metal bottle he used for water in the summer and ran his thumb over the calculations hed made tons from penamacor tons from casteleiro tons brought over from barco tons up from idanhaanova all missingwhich was why the portuguese stocks were tons lower than they should have been at the border he drank with the chefe of the alfandega who was pleased to give him the information that the british had been tracking german shipments through the border all last month and thered been rumours that lisbon were going to issue orders to hold up his consignments of wolfram felsen gave the man a bottle of brandy and asked after abrantes the chefe hadnt seen him in a week it started to rain as they drove south along the border to aldeia da ponte and then on to aldeia do bispo and foios at the foot of the serra da malcata whose vast low lynxpatrolled hills crossed the border here there was a contrabandista who was going to run a pack mule operation through the serra for him if dr salazar decided to make life difficult have you ever made the journey across to spain he asked the back of alvaro fortes head no answer did you hear me yes senhor felsen have you done it before again no answer when was the first time alvaro fortes answered by not answering felsen began to feel the heat of his missing tonnage as the wind strafed the car from the north they drove through the village to the house and stables of the man who kept the mules the serra was invisible under low cloud at the muleowners house felsen went to the boot and unlocked a small metal trunk he removed his walther p and loaded it he told alvaro fortes to get out of the car they went to the back of the granite house into the stableyard which had a warehouse at one end chained and padlocked there were no mules alvaro fortes jiggled about like a man with a full bladder felsen banged on the door at the back of the house with the heel of his hand no response he made alvaro fortes hammer continuously and they heard the old mans voice from inside calma calma ja you he said im coming the rain was slanting across the yard as he opened the door on the german standing in a thick leather coat with his hands clasped behind his back he knew he was in trouble well before a hand came out and put a gun in his face no mules said felsen theyre out working whos with them my son anybody else the old mans eyes flicked across to alvaro fortes who was no help have you got the key to that warehouse its empty felsen put the barrel of the gun right up to the mans eye so that he could smell the oil see the narrow dark escape route from life the old man produced the key they walked across the puddled yard he opened the padlock and ripped the chain out alvaro fortes opened the doors the warehouse was empty felsen went down on his haunches and pressed his finger on to the dry floor and came back up with fine black chips embedded in his skin he stood up kneel both of you he said he fitted the gun barrel under the occipital bulge at the back of the old mans head who is with your son and the mules senhor abrantes what are they doing running wolfram to spain where do they take the wolfram a warehouse in navasfrias he pressed the gun into alvaro fortes head what happens to the wolfram he sells it to who to the highest bidder has he sold to the british silence the rain lashed the yard and the roof overhead has he sold to the british i dont know who he sells to senhor abrantes doesnt talk of such things felsen went back to the old man when will he return the day after tomorrow will you tell him i have been here no senhor i will not if you dont wish it i dont wish it said felsen if you do tell him i will come back here and kill you myself i will shoot you in the head to show a level of seriousness he let off a round past the old mans ear that would leave him deaf for a week the bullet ricocheted around the slate and granite warehouse alvaro fortes threw his hands over his head and fell to one side felsen grabbed him by the scruff and threw him into the yard they went back to the car felsen sipped liquor from his bottle while alvaro fortes shivered with his hair plastered to his white forehead he ordered the driver to take them back to amendoa and as the wind drove the rain over the hills and through the chestnut trees and oaks and on to the granite walls rather than wolfram or abrantes he found himself thinking of eva a few nights ago hed been a civilized man sitting with a woman in a berlin club shed lied to him thered been a betrayal before the lie but he hadnt been able to drag up any anger out here in this rockshambled windblasted place where the houses were carved out of the ground he could only find a singleminded brutality to drive him through to the next day he was a primitive a man stripped down to the essentials and now he was going to have to kill joaquim abrantes it was dark when they arrived back in amendoa the girl and abrantes parents were eating he joined them the rain had stopped and only the wind was left shifting the tiles on the roof the old man wouldnt eat his wife brought the food to his mouth but he wouldnt take it she ate her own food wiped her husbands eyes and took him to bed the girl waited on felsen she wouldnt sit with him he asked after the baby the baby was sleeping she offered him apples but he hadnt finished the stew he listened to her skirts as she moved around him he thought about abrantes grunting over her and that hissing sound she made she looked at him while he was eating every chance she had even when she was behind him he knew she was looking he was different to look at he asked for coffee which theyd never had in the house before the german came he drank it and poured aguardente on to the grounds and sank that he said goodnight she brought him a flat metal pan of hot coals to take the edge off the cold in his bare room across the courtyard where they used to keep the hay for the animals he lay on his bed and smoked cigarettes by the light of the hurricane lamp after an hour he got up and crossed the courtyard he went to the girls room which had just a curtain across the door she was sleeping he put the lamp on the floor she woke up with a gasp he clamped his hand over her mouth and pulled back the covers the baby was sleeping at her back he eased the child to one side he rolled her on to her back trapping her arms underneath he pushed his hand up her woollenstockinged legs her thighs were clamped shut he jammed his hand between them and prised them open by making a fist her eyes darted left and right over his hand he tugged her drawers down to her knees and undid his trousers he was surprised to slide into her easily and their eyes connected in the leopard light from the lamp on the floor he was slow and gentle with the baby in the bed after some minutes she closed her eyes and he felt her heel on his left buttock he took his hand away from her mouth she began to tense and shudder against him and the other heel began to kick at his right buttock he quickened her eyes sprang open and he emptied himself into her and stayed there rammed to the hilt and quivering the next day she gave him breakfast it was no different to any other day except that she looked at him straight with no shyness he stayed out all day overseeing the loading of a cargo of wolfram into rail cars he went back to abrantes house at nightfall after dinner the old couple went to bed the girl remained sitting at the table with felsen they didnt talk he got up to go to bed she gave him the pan of coals he asked her name and she told him maria an hour later she joined him this time without the baby in the bed he could be more robust with her but he was aware that she never hissed in the way that she did when abrantes was covering her in the morning he dressed and checked the walther p which he tucked into his waistband her muddy footprints had dried on the floor at breakfast he asked her to clean his room then he sat in the darkness of the main house listening to the rain and waited for abrantes chapter xiii saturday th june cascais portugal carlos and i stood outside the apartment block of the lawyers wifes exlover it was brandnew finished in nasty yellow with a sea view over the railway line over the marginal over the car park of the supermarket not perfect but good enough to be way beyond what a policeman could ever afford there was a chain across a forecourt of calcada on which was parked a brandnew jeep called something like a wrangler with chrome and black roll bars and a high polish finish it was a lot of jeep to go pavementhopping in cascais under the apartment building there was a small garage with a silver series bmw and a jetblack kawasaki motorbike these all belonged to paulo branco the exlover and only occupier of any of the apartments in the block a salesmans foot wedged open the door to the building while he fitted in his last two metres of bullshit to a young couple leaving we walked past them and up to the penthouse we got paulo branco out of bed he came to the door in shorts and smelled of a recent sexual encounter although we didnt see much of hera tanned arm over a sheet a brown foot dangling he was goodlooking in a way that hundreds of guys areblack hair swept back dark brown eyes square jaw with regular cleft and a gymworked physique bland but confident until he saw our identification we went into the openplan living room with a floortoceiling arched window and the view we sat around a table scattered with photographs and four coloured mobile phones you know senhora teresa oliveira i asked he frowned shes the wife of dr aquilino dias oliveira a lawyer they have a house here in cascais i reminded him yes i know them how i sold him a computer last year is that your business it was then now im at expo i installed most of the equipment there the stuff that didnt work asked carlos getting his needle in early we had some teething problems made some money though the photographs on the table showed a farmhouse in the alentejo by the look of the landthe cork trees and olive groves another fashion accessory this yours too asked carlos he nodded so did we we understand you became intimate with the lawyers wife when did that happen he looked over his shoulder at the bedroom door open a crack may he said i think it was may last year id like some coffee would you like some we wont keep you long i said why did you become intimate with teresa oliveira what sort of a question is that one of the easier ones said carlos he leaned across the table to take us into his confidence she wanted sex she said the old guy wasnt up to it any more where asked carlos in the usual place he said pulling some cockiness together now that he knew this wasnt a fiscal investigation geographically he gave carlos his best false smile in her lisbon house not here once or twice when i was home early on a friday evening shed come over but it was mainly in lisbon id go out on a sales call and drop by her house that was it and the daughter i said catarina he looked like a man whose parachute had just failed to open the daughter he said her name was catarina was thats what i said now look i havent seen catarina for for go on for how long he swallowed hard and put his hand through his styled hair we heard you went to bed with her i said when was the last time he slapped his thighs stood up shouted something inarticulate and strode across the room gesticulating suddenly we were in soap opera sit down please senhor branco i said getting out of my seat and pointing at his he was stunned the door to the bedroom clicked shutthe girl probably looking for her underwear by now paulo branco sat down and viced his head between his hands not wanting to hear any more i want a lawyer he said youve got the number of one here in cascais said carlos enjoying himself too much were not going to charge you with having sex with an underage girl or child abuse as its more commonly known senhor branco i said but if you murdered her thats a different thing maybe you should get a lawyer me he said his sunny day suddenly gone very black i didnt kill her i havent seen her for for when was that last time months ago how did you meet her in the house in lisbon how senhor branco not where i came out of the bedroom whose bedroom her mothers teresas bedroom she was standing in the corridor when it was a lunchtime june july last year what happened i dont she had her shoes in her hand she walked down the stairs i was leaving i looked back at her mother and followed her we met again in the street she was putting her shoes on did she say anything she told me to be there the next friday lunchtime you took that from a fourteenyearold girl fourteen no no thats not possible she said dont waste our time paulo i said lets have the rest of it i turned up the next friday teresa wasnt there she went to cascais on fridays we know i had sex with her he said and shrugged in the mothers bed he scratched the side of his head and nodded anything else she took five thousand escudos off me you allowed that i didnt know what to make of it i wasnt sure what she could do dont give me this shit i said youre a grown man compared to her you didnt even have to turn up said carlos he sized us up for the big schoolboy admission we can take it i said i got a kick out of it he said having sex with the mother and the daughter in big deal i said now how many times did this happen before teresa found out three she came in on the fourth anything unusual about that day his face weakened to a sixyearolds he giggled with nerves shit he said and squeezed the bridge of his nose there was something different that was the first time catarina seemed to be enjoying it she didnt put it on all the time asked carlos paulo stared into the table determined not to rise to it she was shouting and kind of smiling but not up at me over my shoulder i looked round and teresa was standing by the door what did teresa do i got off the bed catarina sat up didnt even close her legs just looked at her mother and smiled teresa ran at her and smacked her across the face shit it was like a rifle shot did catarina say anything in a babygirl voice she said sorry mummy and you i was out of there and down the stairs you never saw teresa again no and catarina he glanced back at the bedroom door again and spoke quietly she came round a few times the last time was march yes march a couple of days after my birthday the seventeenth she came round for sex it wasnt conversation you didnt talk she walked straight in there and took her clothes off do you think she was on drugs maybe he ducked his head did she take money from you yes until i hid my wallet did that annoy her she didnt comment how many times did she come here ten twelve times and why didnt she come back after the nineteenth of march she did i just didnt let her in he nodded back at the bedroom door and we looked over there too we left a little after that and sat in the car outside the girlfriend came out a few minutes after us taking strides far too long for her legs her stacked heels wobbling on the calcada carlos nodded satisfied that the girl had seen what he had that guy he said novo rico we drove back to the lawyers house i had a couple of questions for teresa but dr oliveira wouldnt allow it until she came into the corridor and beckoned us in she was moving like an old woman and her speech was slow and drifting at the edges the day you found catarina in bed with paulo branco why did you go back to the house i dont remember werent you already here i was it must have been something important to go all the way back into lisbon she didnt say anything i apologized and stood to leave her face had sagged pouches that hadnt been there before appeared below her eyes i went back she said so tired she could hardly get it out because catarina called me she said shed hurt herself at school the three of us exchanged looks she held her hands open to show us how life could be that was the end of me and catarina she said we drove back to the circular around lisbon in silence i liked carlos for this no need to ask questions for which neither of us had any answers he was contemplative a different man to the edgy one hed revealed on the beach and in paulo brancos flat i doubted he had many friends i was feeling sick at how a family like the oliveiras could go so wrong the family the strongest unit of portuguese currency our gold our greatest asset the pure element that keeps our streets mostly clean nobody in europe understands the value of family better than us and its not just leftover salazarist propaganda was this where societys cracks started to appear we were heading for a massive development on the north edge of lisbon called odivelas we skirted one of our present gloriescolombo the biggest shopping centre in europeopposite one of the older onesbenfica stadium toying with bankruptcy we curved off and back under the circular and headed uphill at the top we had the best view there was of odivelastwenty square kilometres of distressed tower blocks covered in a frazzled hair of clustered television aerials it was a hellish vision a construction companys elysium they built these things in weeksconcrete skeleton bones skin walls with no fatthey were baking in the summer and freezing in the winter ive never been able to breathe in them the airs been reused too much we walked up the stairs to the fourth floor of a block which was part of a development within another development this block was one of the originals the rest clones the lift didnt work tiles were broken and missing underfoot and the concrete walls had encrustations from dried damp televisions squabbled between floors music and the smell of lunches piped down the stairwell a couple of kids bounced off the walls and squeezed past us we knocked on a cardboard door where we were hoping to find the lead guitarist from catarinas band the man who opened the door was thin with what looked like a badly applied moustache of the same lank texture as the dark hair on his head he wore a purple shortsleeved shirt open all the way down his hand was on his chest where he stroked the hair around his nipples with the two fingers he used for smoking he knew we were police is valentim mateus almeida in i asked he turned without speaking we followed him down the narrow corridor he tapped on a door as he was passing valentim he said police he carried on into the kitchen where an overweight woman with bleached hair whod squeezed herself into a turquoise skirt was clearing away lunch she asked him whod been at the door he told her and she sucked in her stomach we knocked on valentims door again the place smelled of fried fish valentim invited us in but didnt look up from where he was sitting on the bed playing an electric guitar unplugged he had a huge thick swag of long dark brown ringlets sheafed down the length of his back he wore a tshirt and jeans he was thin oliveskinned with big dark eyes and hollow underfed cheeks carlos closed the door of the narrow room which had a bed a desk but no bookcase the books were piled on the floor some of them were in english and french your fathers not too concerned about the quality of your visitors thats because hes not my father not even my stepfather hes just the resident asshole who keeps my mother from getting lonely and dont worry ive told her what asked carlos that its better to be lonely than live with a tick but then shed scratch him off and get another one in its place thats the nature of ticks and those they feed on are you reading zoology psychology he said zoologys something i live with it creeps under my door you know a girl called catarina sousa oliveira i know her he said going back to his fingerwork on the guitar shes dead murdered his fingers stopped he took the guitar by the neck and leaned it against a chair at the end of the bed he was thinking composing himself but shocked too i didnt know were reconstructing her last twentyfour hours i havent seen her he said quickly not for twentyfour hours no did you speak to her no when did you last see her wednesday evening what happened the band met to talk about the weekend gig and rehearsals for friday and saturday yesterday was friday said carlos thanks for reminding me one days like the next in odivelas he said the band also bust up on wednesday there was no rehearsal there will be no gig why did you bust up musical differences he said teresa shes the keyboard player shes fucking some guy who plays the saxophone so she thinks we suddenly need a saxophonist she thinks we need to do more instrumental stuff i said less emphasis on the lead singer said carlos valentim turned to me for an opinion i cant help you there i said nothings happened in my life since pink floyd how musical were these differences asked carlos thats your first decent question and you go and answer it yourself what about bruno what does he play bass were either you or bruno going out with catarina i asked going out were you fucking her said carlos picking up words as we went along we had a no relationships agreement in the band the saxophonist didnt have a chance i dont suppose he did the meeting where did it take place in a bar called toca its in the bairro alto and you didnt see her after thatnot on thursday nor friday no do you know what she was doing yesterday she went to school didnt she where were you in the biblioteca nacional all day until seven seventhirty i gave him a card and told him to call me if he remembered anything valentims mother was looking down the corridor from the kitchen when we came out i gave her a good afternoon which brought the tick to her shoulder where was valentim yesterday i asked he was out all day and most of the night said the tick didnt get in until three in the morning the woman looked despondent behind the makeup shed just put on the tick wanted us to take the kid away right now we left and got back in the car which was too hot to touch i lit a cigarette and put it out after two drags hes lying said carlos he saw her lets go and talk to the keyboards i said starting the car dont we get lunch on this job english lunch i dont like the sound of that you wouldnt youre portuguese they said he pulled up what did they say they said you were married to an englishwoman was that supposed to explain something to you i think i was surprised when you said pink floyd back there i was in england in the seventies he nodded what else did they say i asked surprised that people bothered to talk about me when i wasnt there they said you werent normal why do you think they put you to work with me i asked get all the weirdos off in one corner im not weird just boring you still havent talked about girls cars or football youre twentyseven years old youre a policeman youre portuguese what do you think they make of that sporting he said to satisfy requirements theyre a good team i cant afford a car not the point i worked in a garage i only know about old cars that dont work like alfa romeos girls i dont have a girlfriend still not the point are you gay youd have thought id slipped a sharpened screwdriver between his ribs no he said mortally wounded would you have told me if you were im not do you think any of our colleagues talk to each other like this he looked out of the window thats why they put us together i said were the outsiders were weird chapter xiv saturday th june telheiras lisbon portugal we lunched on bifanas a sandwich but with a hot slice of pork as a fillingan angloportuguese solution to lunch i teased carlos back round to me cooled his temper we ordered coffee i handed over my sugar without a word he asked me about my wifesomething nobody ever did he asked me what it was like being married to an englishwoman what was the difference you mean i asked and he shrugged not that sure what he meant the only differences we had were on how to bring up olivia our daughter we had fights about that she had fights about that with my parents it was a cultural thing you know how it is in portugal were pampered every inch of the way and adored maybe we have a romantic vision of childhood that it should be a golden time with no responsibilities no pressure i said remembering all the old arguments we cosset our kids we let them know theyre a gift to us we encourage them to think theyre special and for the most part they come out confident happy people the english dont think like that theyre more pragmatic and they dont indulge well my wife didnt anyway so whats she like olivia he asked getting used to the name as it turned out the english upbringing was the best thing shes a sixteenyearold girl going on twentyone she can take care of herself she can take care of me she has taken care of methat was how she managed her grief shes socially adept too she can handle situations on her own she does things shes a brilliant seamstress it was my wifes hobby the two of them spent all day running up clothes talking to each other all the time but i still dont know whether it was what i would call a childhood it drove me crazy sometimes when olivia was a little girl my wife wouldnt listen to her unless she talked sense if she wanted to talk little kids rubbish she had to come to me and you know sometimes that comes out she has a need to prove herself all the time to be good at things to always be interesting she cant always live up to her own high standards look youve started me off now ill shut up or youll get this for the rest of the day how did your wife like the portuguese she liked us i said most of the time did you tell her that were not so nice to each other she knew and anyway the english hate each other even more but at least she said thisthe portuguese like foreigners which the english dont she also said i had a jaded view of my countrymen from talking to liars and murderers all the time she couldnt have liked everybody she didnt like bureaucrats but then i told her they were specially trained its all thats left of the inquisition what did she really hate about the portuguese there must have been something she really hated the television programmes never came on time come on she could do better than that she hated portuguese men in their cars especially the ones who accelerated when they saw they were being overtaken by a woman she said it was the only time she saw us macho she always knew she was going to die on the roads and she did silence he wasnt satisfied though there must have been something else something worse than that she used to say the quickest way to get trampled to death is to come between the portuguese and their lunch not the lunch weve just had and anyway that just means were hungry come on what else said carlos that inferiority complex of his trying to push me to further extremes she thought that we didnt believe in ourselves ah any more questions none teresa carvalho the keyboards player lived with her parents in an apartment building in telheiras which is not far from odivelas on the map but a steep climb on the money ladder this is where you come when your first cream has risen to the top of your milk insulated buildings pastel shades security systems garage parking satellite dishes tennis clubs ten minutes from the airport five minutes from either football stadium and colombo its wired up but dead out here like pacing through a cemetery of perfect mausoleums the carvalhos had the penthouse the lift worked an angolan maid kept us outside while she took our ids in to senhor carvalho she showed us into his study he sat behind his desk with his elbows and hairy forearms braced he wore a red ysl polo shirt with more hair pouring up out of the neck his head was nutbrown with not a strand of hair across it his moustache was strong enough that he must have trimmed it with bolt cutters he tilted his head forward so that he looked at us from under where the boss of his horns should have been he was less friendly than a bull with six bandarilhas in its back the maid closed the door with the faintest click as if the slightest thing could draw the big bad bulls attention what do you want to talk to my daughter about he asked this wouldnt be your first visit from the policia judiciaria i said has your daughter been in trouble before shes never been in any trouble but that doesnt stop the police from trying to push her into some were homicide not narcotics but you knew a guess i said what are they talking to her about manufacture and supply of what ecstasy he said her chemistry lecturer at the university is being held for questioning he gives out names to make his life easier one of them was my daughters i explained our business and he slowly released himself from the harness of his anger he went to get his daughter i called fernanda ramalho on my mobile the pathologist might have been a marathon runner but she gave her information out in onehundredmetre sprints things you might be interested in she said time of death near enough six or sixthirty pm on friday cause of death asphyxiation by strangulation pressure applied by gloved thumbs to the windpipe no nail marks on her neck the blow to the back of the head she was only hit once by something very hard and heavy not an iron barthe shattered cranium and the area of contusion suggest something like a sledgehammer she was definitely unconscious when asphyxiated i cant find any evidence of a serious struggle no abrasions apart from the one on her forehead which was caused by contact with a pine tree there was bark in the wound she had nothing under her fingernails sexual activity youre not going to like this she had been penetrated both vaginally and anally condoms were used no semen deposits there were traces of a waterbased lubicrant in her rectum and the damage to her sphincteral muscle would suggest that she had not practised anal sex before blood her blood group is unusual ab negative and there were traces of three four methylenedioxymethamphetamine also known as e or ecstasy she had also smoked cannabis and there were traces of caffeine anything in her stomach she hadnt eaten anything for lunch is that it something even this quick is never enough for you guys fernanda i said you know its appreciated she hung up teresa carvalho had long purple hair dark purple eye makeup lipstick and nail varnish she wore a black vest a black short skirt black tights and purple calflength doc martens she sat in an armchair in the corner of her fathers study and crossed her legs senhor carvalho left the room and we sat in the silence left over from teresas gumchewing senhor carvalhos shoes did not move off teresa didnt look at either of us but focused on a point above carlos head i opened the door and told senhor carvalho that id like to talk to him again later he moved off like a bear back into its cave there was a micron of trust in teresas eyes when i sat down again nothing said here has to go further than this room i said dad says youre homicide i havent killed anyone so im cool she said cracking her gum at us have you spoken to any members of your band since it broke up on wednesday night i asked that opener made it look as if there was plenty more ammunition in the magazine and i could see the implications fidgeting behind her eyes no i havent there wasnt much point was that the last time you saw catarina yes it was she said has something happened to her why do you ask anything could have happened to her any reason asked carlos she looks innocent enough doesnt she the blonde hair and blue eyes you mean she cracked her gum again and brought one of her doc martens up on to the edge of the chair go on teresa i said tell us what you thought of catarina she was badly fuckedup in the head what does that mean crazy neurotic druggedout i dont think shes even sixteen is she thats right you might find some thirtyyearold putas with her experience but i i hope this isnt cat talk teresa its guys talk go out on the campus and ask you didnt like her no did you envy her envy her voice for instance she snorted the fact that guys went for her i told you she was no better than a puta what about bruno and valentim what about them just answer the question said carlos where is it the band i said trying to steady carlos who didnt seem to like this one either how did the band break up i didnt like the music any more i meant how did you all have a row and split in different directions did some of you side with others i dont know what they did i met up with a friend in the bairro alto that wasnt the saxophonist was it i asked and she went still no it wasnt she said it so quietly we had to lean in what else does he do apart from play the saxophone she didnt answer her hand was up by her mouth and a thumbnail between her teeth this saxophonist is he your lecturer at the university she nodded fat tears formed in her purple eye makeup she studied her knee you werent with him the night the band bust up she shook her purple head did you see him i asked her eyes closed and purple tears eased down her face maybe you saw him with catarina oliveira later that night she stole him she blurted along with some snot she stole him from me is that why narcotics got a phone call about a university lecturer manufacturing and supplying ecstasy she sprang out of the chair and grabbed some tissues from her fathers desk and smeared her face around so she looked as if shed taken a heavy beating where were you last night in the alfama at the festa when i was here most of the afternoon working in my room friends picked me up about seven oclock i told her to write down the names and phone numbers of her friends you still havent told me whats happened to catarina she said she was murdered last night i didnt do anything to her she said quickly the pen hovering do you think either valentim or bruno were involved with her sexually im sure valentim was he found her not bruno he was scared of valentim found her heard her voice brought her into the band so why do you think they were having sex that was catarinas way but you never saw anything that confirmed it she looked up to see how the truth would go down no she said i didnt see anything we got up to leave youre not going to tell the drug squad about my phone call she said if your lecturers innocent i am i said is he she shook her head are you theyre trying to say i labassisted for him but i didnt what about supplying no she said her mouth clamped shut catarina had traces of e in her blood the day she died not from me i didnt give her anything what about valentim or bruno no she said a terse hard rocksure lie i gave her a long look which she couldnt hold she was thinking how she could salvage something from the situation how she could make me like her the unpopular girl the fraud the conservative playing in purple and black if you wanted to understand catarina she said you had to hear her sing she had a direct line to pain we drove through an empty lisbon on the first hot saturday afternoon of the summer we went straight down the normally clogged arterial avenues through campo grande to saldanha to the huge roundabout at marques de pombal and on to largo do rato which baked silently in the heat carlos was talking like a man with a mouthful of nails who couldnt spit enough of them out the world can do without chatas like teresa carvalho he said little senhorinha rica with no personality playing at being a grunge artist but all the time nurturing and cultivating those pissweak middleclass salazarist values shes the kind whos always had what shes wanted and when she cant get it because shes too much of a chata she makes sure nobody else can have it she rats on people to save her own ass shes a liar she checks you all the time to make sure shes telling you what you want to hear she dumps on her lecturer trashes catarina and then she gives us he put on a whiny voice if you wanted to understand catarina you had to hear her sing she had a direct line to pain and you can bet that she didnt think that up herself gah theyre all the same who middleclass girls nothing to them chickens without giblets was catarina a chicken without giblets she must have had more to her than the rest put together which is why theyre all queueing up to shit on her and tell us what a little puta she was but so far we havent met anybody associated with her whos worth more than five tostoes so you do want to find her killer yes i do anything wrong with that just checking but if she was a chata like teresa carvalho as a matter of interest do you like black people i asked he checked to see which side of the field i was coming from im not racially prejudiced if thats what you mean he said slowly but if you had a daughter and she wanted to marry a black guy maybe that should be my question to you i wouldnt like it i said there you found me out the good old racist portuguese policeman that doesnt mean i think that black people are all criminals i said i lived in africa i know africans and a lot of them i liked what it means is that there are plenty of people out there who are racially prejudiced and i wouldnt want my daughter to have to face any of that if she didnt have to the dark gardens of the jardim da estrela slipped by looking cool and soporific i cut up by the side of the basilica and climbed the hill up to lapa this is embassy land an old money haven overlooking the docks of alcantara probably so the rich could see their money coming in we parked in a central square outside an old apartment block with a view over an old and decrepit palacio which had scaffolding around it and a building licence from the town hall on the front gate we rang the bell no answer a gardener hacked away at some undergrowth on the other side of the railings thats the palacio do conde dos olivais i said to carlos its been locked up and in ruins since i can remember looks like theyre doing it up i shouted over to the gardener an old darkskinned guy with a face like a mule he stopped work and leaned against the railing and removed the cigarette from his mouth that had gone out some time ago its going to be a bordello he said is that right you know what you need for a good bordello nice girls perhaps plenty of rooms this place is perfect he said and set off on an asthmatic laugh he wiped his face off with a soiled rag no its going to be one of those exclusive clubs for rich people with too few ideas on how to spend all that money theyve got under their mattresses carlos grunted a laugh and rang the bell again no answer the gardener relit his cigarette this is where the nazis lived in the war he said then the americans took it over when they lost its a big place for a club theyre serious people the rich thats what they tell me anyway we got an answer a very faint one a spindly female voice too frail to comprehend she let us in on the fifth explanation we walked up the stairs to the second floor a woman in a thick green cardigan and a tweed skirt answered the door shed forgotten who we were already and when we reexplained she said she hadnt called the police that nothing had happened she began to close the door with a shaky parkinsons hand its ok mum said a voice behind her theyre here to talk to me its nothing to worry about i sent the maid out for something and they always come when shes out and i have to get up and answer the bell and i can never hear anything from that its ok mum shell be back soon we followed the woman who shuffled into the living room on her sons arm the walls were floortoceiling with books and the air space was mostly taken up with racks of drawings paintings sketches and watercolours the boy sat the woman down at a table which had a large diameter glass on it and a decanter of what might have been tawny port the boy in regulation tshirt and jeans took us into another room he had long straight dark hair parted in the middle and a sad face with a limited range of expression his mouth barely opened when he spoke the walls of this room were covered in more drawings and sketches none of them framed whos the artist asked carlos my mother was a gallerist this is whats left of her stock she looks sick she is have you spoken to valentim he called when did you last have sex with catarina i asked and carlos flinched as if hed have to answer the question bruno stepped back and brushed his hair over his shoulders with his two hands flapping like a startled bird what he said his mouth opening two millimetres more than a clams which was a munchs scream for him you heard i wasnt teresa carvalho says you were you valentim and half the university he looked broken already as if he was a spider wearing his skeleton on the outside valentim might have prepared him for something but not this he swallowed we dont want to hear valentims script either i said this is a murder investigation so if i think for two seconds that youre lying and obstructing the course of justice ill take you down to the tacos for the weekend have you ever been there before no do you know what they are no answer pimps prostitutes druggies drunks pushers pickpockets and other assorted punks too violent to be allowed home no daylight no fresh air pig slop for food ill do it to you bruno the maid will look after your mother so i wont feel bad about that so forget valentim and lets have it he stood by the window and his head slid round to look over the palacio to the patch of the river tagus visible through the trees it didnt look as if he was going to have to do too much thinking friday lunchtime he said to the windowpane where the pensao nuno its near the praca da alegria somewhere what time between one and two were drugs involved bruno came away from the window and sat on the bed he leaned forward with his elbows on his knees and spoke to the floor we took a tab of e each and smoked a joint who supplied he didnt answer were not doing anybody for possession or supply of drugs i said i just want to have the picture straight in my head i want to see every minute of that day clearly as if it were my own was it teresa carvalho valentim he said valentim was there as well asked carlos the boy nodded to the floor the two of you were there together having sex with the girl bruno gripped his forehead trying to squeeze the memory out how did this happen valentim said she was into it was that true he opened his hands and shrugged so which of you sodomized her i asked he coughed a half sob half retch he wrapped his hands over his head and leaned over in the planecrash position as if expecting some terrible impact chapter xv saturday th june odivelas lisbon portugal i dropped carlos and bruno off at the pj building in rua gomes freire so that carlos could take down his statement and went back to odivelas to pick up valentim there were a few things different about valentims apartment block life had moved on a centimetre there were different tv programmes raging techno music ricocheted down the stairwell heat came off the walls as if the building was running a fever the tick answered the door and turned without a word he delivered the same passing knock on valentims door and went into the kitchen where he picked up an open bottle of sagres police he shouted over the bottletop and began chugging beer valentims mother appeared in the door frame i hammered on the cardboard door until valentim tore it open were leaving i said you wont need anything where are you taking him said the mother screechy now lisbon whats he done she asked bouncing off the door frame coming down the corridor at me the tick stayed in the kitchen sipping beer spreading his weak moustache with a forefinger and thumb looking wellpleased hes going to help us with our enquiries into the murder of a young girl murder she said moving to embrace him as if hed been condemned already lets go he said turning away from her we got in the car valentim rested an elbow on the window ledge and played drum solos on the roof with his fingers as we drove back into town in the highest heat of the day wheres your father i asked he pulled out years ago i dont remember him how old were you too small to remember you did all right to get to university not if you look at the chatos in my class how do you like your mother shes my mother thats it how old is she what do you think i dont know its difficult to say with all the makeup the guy shes with looks young shes thirtyseven ok but do you like her he stopped tapping on the roof where did they find you he asked winged on the motorway im one of the few people youll meet in my world with an interest in other human beings but that doesnt mean im sweet all the time now tell me what you think of your mother this is shit he said enunciating each word with precision youre the one reading psychology at university he sighed bored to his hair roots i think my mothers a beautiful person with a strong moral and ethical purpose profoundly concerned with youve answered the question i said now do you have a girlfriend at the moment no youve had girlfriends occasionally temporarily what attracted you to these girls do you write for cosmopolitan in your spare time its either this or the elbow in the face the girls always came to me all that highlycharged magnetism of yours i was stating a fact i did not pursue them they came to me what sort of girls middleclass girls from welloff families who wanted to be different who wanted to be cool who wanted to have a go with someone who wasnt a trussedup jerk with a mobile phone that never rang but you were too strong for them too rich no wrong word too gamey theyre not real people inspector theyre just kids dressing up and catarina was she like that he nodded and smirked as if hed seen my thread youre forgetting something he said catarina was never my girlfriend but it was interesting wasnt it i said because you found her found her discovered her voice brought her into the band you pursued her she didnt come to you that doesnt mean she was but it was different wasnt it he drummed on the roof again i had a small fight to get into the pj building with the policeman on the door who knew me well but didnt believe who i was until i showed him some id with my bearded self on it was this the start of a good oldfashioned identity crisis i left valentim at the front desk and went upstairs to find carlos and bruno sitting in my office both silent i read the statement and told bruno to sign it did valentim have an arrangement to see catarina after school on friday she always went back to cascais on fridays did you see valentim on friday night yes we met up in alcantara around ten oclock what was he doing between two and ten oclock i dont know was he agitated when you saw him no teresa said catarina had been promiscuous around the university is that true not if teresa said it that would not be reliable she says she saw catarina with her chemistry lecturer in the bairro alto later on wednesday night after the band bust up i wouldnt know where did you go after the band meeting home i worked late on a paper i had to deliver on thursday morning and valentim and catarina i left them in that bar toca in the bairro alto we went to the stairs and i told him to wait five minutes before he went home carlos and i took valentim to the pensao nuno which was on rua da gloria a narrow road that ran between the praca da alegria and the funicular from restauradores up to the bairro alto there werent many hookers around in the street at this time of day a few older and sadder ones looked out of the bar windows sitting over coffee valentims face in the rear view was straight out of the mould solid the reception was on the second floor of a fourstorey nineteenthcentury building with a tiled facade up to the firstfloor balcony the staircase was wide wooden and musty with a strip of blue lino up the middle a guy in his sixties was standing behind the reception bar a newspaper in front of him his finger on his tongue a strip of neon lighting on the wall above his grey head lit cobwebs and other high grime he was unshaven and smoked a cigarette unconsciously he looked as if he had been fat and then lost it and been left with useless folds of skin that sagged in his shirt he glanced up at us and i saw it in his eyes that he knew he was looking at two policemen and a suspect he stood up straight and put a hand under his armpit he ran a thumbnail through the brisdes below his bottom lip the smoke made him close an eye his skin looked grey as if ingrained by dust from some previous work such as mining are you nuno i asked hes dead who are you jorge you run this place he smoked and nodded i know who you are he said so you dont need to see any id you can still show it to me we laid our cards out he inspected them closely without touching you look better without he said to me you know this kid i asked jorges eyes went sleepy in his head as if he was a python whod eaten a horse and was finding the hooves difficult to digest he smoked some more stubbed out the cigarette with a grimace and showed us a set of yellow teeth that hadnt met floss youre going to tell me hes been here before and im going to have to believe you but he trailed off took out his reservations book and flicked through empty pages maybe you should get the rooms by the hour edition out if they occupy we want to take a look at a room on the top floor are they all free if theyre locked theyre occupied are you busy i asked and jorge made some calculations im going into every room locked or not he hitched his trousers and slid out from behind the bar he was wearing flipflops and his yellow toenails thick as tile matched his teeth i followed the dead skin on his crusty heels up to the top floor how many rooms up here four he said economical now that the stairs were taking his puff at the top he coughed himself to a tremulous silence and spat into a handkerchief well he said waving a finger at valentim dont ask me said valentim i dont know what im doing here you remember what i said about the elbow in the face i asked you heard that he said to jorge that was a threat i dont see you i dont hear him said jorge all my senses got worn down years ago valentim looked at one of the doors and jorge opened it up with a flourish from his hand like a nineteenthcentury doorman inside valentim took up a position on the other side of the bed from me carlos sat on a sciatic chair by the door which hed just closed i washed my hands in the sink looked at valentim in the mirror and dabbed my face cool with wet palms i shook my hands dry straightened my tie and took my jacket off it was hot in the room even with the shutters closed lets have it valentim you know what happened so now suddenly you know why yoyre here i said but i want to hear it from you you set it up you told bruno that catarina liked this sort of thing you tell it your way she said she wanted to try it but only with someone she knew she said that she made the proposal to you a fifteenyearold to a twentyoneyearold twentytwo he said and waited two beats thats made you think hasnt it inspector that your mother was fifteen when she had you so what thats not three in a bed thats a young girls mistake the hate came across the room in slivers from the boy whod started life as a mistake he dropped his head and when it came back up again his eyes were smiling maybe girls are older these days he said you wouldnt know inspector i have a daughter not much older than catarina and you know what runs through her perfect virginal head its not three in a bed you must have talked about it to be that certain shut up i said feeling my lid boiling at least you must know that girls arent so confused these days about what they want what did they used to think they wanted asked carlos rescuing me romance and now now they know that sex can happen without love and theyre interested in it said valentim im not a prerevolutionary kid like the inspector i wasnt spoonfed catholicism salazarist family values no women in the workplace no tits and bums on the street if this is a justification said carlos get to it its not a justification just an opinion as to why girls these days a girl like catarina who was not by any means a virgin could make the proposal she did and also why the inspector should doubt it why is it that the next generation always believe they invented sex not invented it just revolutionized it i had a trickle of sweat at the back of my neck inching under the collar ready to careen down my spine valentim like the best mango fly in guinea was getting under my skin so what was it that you heard in catarinas voice that made you run after her talent there must have been something else for the great valentim whos always pursued by girls to go running after she had blonde hair and blue eyes thats not a common portuguese look i was interested in something different silence for some time valentim raised his eyebrows i want you to think about that question a little more while you tell us what happened in this room youre clever enough to do that arent you where do you want me to start when did you take the drugs as soon as we got in here bruno had a joint we smoked it i had some pills we took a tab each e to save you from asking where did you get the e off the street not teresa i said well im sure teresa has been helpful to you in your enquiries already so ill give her to you yes teresa supplied what effect did the e have asked carlos it makes you uninhibited in love with the ones you love so you end up fucking yourself said carlos happy with that resolution maybe you would agente said valentim does the room look the same now as it did yesterday that chair was ten centimetres to the right he said silence while i rolled up my sleeve to bare a brownskinned pointed elbow ok ok he said holding up his hands we moved the bed show us he manoeuvred the bed in front of the mirror your idea she said she wanted to see herself did she see herself did she say that that was what she wanted i just told you im having trouble believing you he shrugged carry on we took our clothes off how did that happen we took our shoes off first like good little boys that got carlos off his chair thinlipped with rage eh pa said valentim calma did you strip her i asked she was naked by the time wed moved the bed now shes running the show i told you it was her idea he said she knelt in the middle of the bed she told bruno to kneel in front and me behind she told me to use a condom she had to work on bruno he was nervous i put on the condom and that was it you forgot something i dont think so the lubricant she didnt need any i believe its normally used to sodomize someone and the pathologist said there were traces of it in her rectum i did not sodomize her no way that is not my kind of thing at all thats not what bruno said what did he say said valentim tell me what he said i nodded at carlos who leafed through his copy of brunos statement he read she masturbated me and sucked my penis while valentim had sex with her from behind i did not penetrate her vaginally nor anally and i did not ejaculate that doesnt mean i sodomized her and i didnt what bruno says is true he was nervous and i did have sex with her and i was behind her but i penetrated her vagina you can use your famous elbow on me all you like inspector but i wont say anything different so how do you explain the pathologists report silence while valentim shifted the swag of his heavy hair and passed a finger across his forehead he flicked a hank of sweat on to the floor there must have been somebody else he said when did you leave here around two oclock bruno says he went home and you walked off towards the funicular with catarina thats true where did you go we walked down to avenida da liberdade and took a bus she got off at saldanha to go back to school i stayed on until campo grande and went to the biblioteca nacional how long did you spend there i was there until well after seven plenty of people saw me have you got a car youre joking inspector have you got access to one my mothers boyfriend has one do you think hed lend it to me lets go back to my first question about why you took catarina into the band i told you what was special about her valentim what did she have that particularly interested you he licked his lips which had dried on him he didnt seem to have any spit she wasnt a happy girl was she valentim happy he asked sneering as if this was a questionable state did you like that valentim did you like a bit of vulnerability to work with some real suffering to get your teeth into next youll be telling me i hate my mother he said on the end of a highpitched laugh do they teach freud at police college now ask agente pinto i havent been in police college for some time i said i wouldnt be needing freud anyway after eighteen years talking to people like you he looked at carlos sniffing for a softer target have you got any bullshit for me agente youre not a nice guy said carlos quietly on the end of a direct look if you were a nice guy i said and a fifteenyearold girl proposed three in a bed with some sodomy thrown in i did not sodomize her he shouted you wouldnt go ahead with it would you youd think there was something wrong with the girl youre a psychology student youd know that it wasnt normal behaviour if you were a nice guy youd help the girl talk to her parents get her some therapy but youre not are you valentim youre a piece of shit you look at someone like that and think i can use that i can abuse that and itll make me feel better and all because i didnt say i loved my mother youre a radical inspector youre a fucking radical but thats why you arranged this little rendezvous yesterday wasnt it valentim to bring catarina down to your own level suck her into your own swamp now all ive got to find out is whether you wanted to take it one step further and kill the girl then youve got a lot of work ahead of you in the meantime you can spend the weekend in the tacos see if that refreshes your memory and ill get a search warrant for your room valentim ran a thumb and forefinger down his nose and flicked the sweat on the floor he shook his head and i saw that he was worried and not about spending a few nights in the tacos chapter xvi saturday th june pensao nuno rua da gloria lisbon portugal a police car arrived to take valentim i sent carlos with it to start work on the search warrant jorge stripped off the cellophane to what must have been his third pack of the day i took out the photograph of catarina youre still not finished he said lighting up a cigarette you lost a lot of weight recently jorge i was sick they thought i had lung cancer what was it just some pleurisy good to get the weight off though you dont have to be nice to me nobody else is you know about people dont you jorge the whole worlds been past this front desk have you always done this work probably ever been inside if i was it was before i can remember whether ive been doing this job all my life that memory of yours must be famous ive got a room full of industrial awards for it he said you should drop by some time when im not so busy and ill show them to you do you remember this girl i asked snapping the photograph down on the bar she was in here with that kid and another one friday lunch time if anything jorges eyes got rheumier he barely looked at the shot look inspector ive got a reputation to keep up if it gets out that my particular brain disease cleared up and i got on a quiz show with the policia judiciaria ill have an empty place emptier than this i said the floors arent exactly shaking you take my point maybe this place is due an inspection whys it so important that i remember her five hours after she left this place she was dead murdered jorges eyebrows left his head for a moment when this is ridiculous i just told you friday six sixthirty in the afternoon here in lisbon maybe she was found dumped on a beach in paco de arcos he nodded wiping his cheeks with the back of his hand feeling the rasp of the brisdes she was in here friday lunchtime you must know that by now after talking to the kid she was with another one as well a student how do you know this is the gateway to heaven inspector the whole world comes before me even police officers can i use your telephone i called the home number of catarinas teacher she answered as if shed been sitting there waiting for the phone to ring i made an appointment for an hours time she said she wasnt going anywhere i refitted the telephone an old heavy bakelite piece of work that took me back to my fathers army headquarters in africa i headed for the stairs jorges eyes on me all the way i stopped two steps down and heard him sigh the girl i said had she been in here before jorge turned the page of his newspaper kissed his cigarette again did you hear me jorge i heard you he said i heard that phone call too shes a schoolgirl not even sixteen jorge he shook his head not that amazed at what the world had come to shes been coming in here pretty regularly friday lunchtimes since march april something like that she was a hooker she wasnt going up there on her own for a nap if thats what you mean he said lighting another cigarette from the butt of the last girls these days theyre different clean nicely dressed polite they come in here to make spending money for the weekend because they dont want to have to explain to daddy why they need escudos for a decent saturday night the regular girls know it too you go out there and watch if they see a girl in a short skirt hanging around too long theyll kick her half to death if you ask me and not many people do these days inspector its the heroin did you know any of her clients jorge gave me a sad sorry look and tapped the side of his head how many times have you been closed down never unless it was before thats enough jorge youre boring me now look inspector i cooperate as much as i can in the end how about doing some cooperating now he thought about it wanting to get me off his back ill tell you something its not much but if itll get you down the stairs i wont promise you youre not the first guy to ask me about the girl i mean in an investigative way what are we talking about another cop could be get it out jorge one go like pulling a tooth he looked like a cop but he wouldnt show me any id and i wouldnt tell him anything what did he ask you he made out he was a punter and interested in the girl i didnt believe him he told me he was policia judiciaria i asked for id he wouldnt show i told him to stop wasting my time and he left when are we talking about not long after she became a friday lunch time regular april may i asked and he nodded tell me what he looked like short stocky and the bit of hair i saw was grey he wore a small brimmed hat black which he never took off a grey tweed jacket white shirt tie grey trousers no moustache no beard brown eyes thats it im going down the stairs now jorge dont rush he said i wouldnt want you to fall i went out into the dark narrow street it had been cool in jorges windowless reception and i stripped off my jacket and slung it over my shoulder there were more girls outside now and i walked down the street towards the funicular asking the odd one here and there whether theyd seen catarina a couple of mulatto brazilian girls remembered her but not from yesterday a bleachblonde girl standing on one leg while she repaired the heel of her shoe tapped the photograph and nodded but couldnt remember when shed seen her i asked the funicular driver who i reckoned must take an interest in life around him rather than looking endlessly at the same old two hundred metres of rail up and down his hill but he shrugged me off i walked back down rua da gloria got into my car and drove back to the bus stop at saldanha it was mostly newly developed office buildings around here and they were all shut but i found a few little places open to ask my question boa tarde did you see this girl yesterday around two twofifteen no thank you adeus its a stomach thing for me police work for a lot of my colleagues its brain work they have the suspects the clues the statements the witnesses the motives and they reason them all together i do that too but i have something in my stomach as well something that tells me if im right antonio borrego once asked me what it was like and the only thing i could think of was love and he told me to be careful because as anybody knows love is blind good point its not like love but thats the strength of it boa tarde did you see this girl yesterday around two twofifteen no thank you adeus people ask me why i do this job as if i have some choice in the matter as if i could finish with it now and run off and be an avantgarde poet in guatemala i got into this thing because back in when my father and i crept back into the country that was the only job i could find and in those days money was as scarce as a job when i came out of the rossio station after five years in london i knew what id been missing the poverty bustle i call it theres a lot of it in africa which is why i recognized it its a nervous fireneticism brought about by insufficient economic activity to ensure that everybody gets fed its the agitation of hunger and its gone now the streets are calm like any other european city now theres only the stress left but thats not the same as hunger thats just neuroticism boa tarde did you see this girl yesterday around two twofifteen no thank you adeus so i do this job because over the years ive come to believe in it the hunt for the truth or the teasing out of the truth anyway i like the talk i marvel at the natural genius humans have for deception if you think footballers are pretty good at cheating and diving and deceiving you should see murderers perform mind you they get a lot of practice lying to themselves every minute of the day our prisons are full of innocent people but thats the nature of the murderer its the ultimate human weakness the most radical solution to the inability to resolve and the shame of that weakness is the inadmissible guilt but the lies the lies keep the job alive im like a couturier appreciating cloth enjoying the texture the finery of a brilliant tapestry a fabulous goldthreaded brocade a silky smooth damask a dark rich impenetrable velvet but i never underestimate the value of a light strong denim a hardwearing drill a tough fineribbed poplin that doesnt mean i dont get the motheaten taffeta or the wellworn flannel or wispy tissues of voile its just that i have the developed taste of a connoisseur boa tarde did you see this girl yesterday around two twofifteen no thank you adeus weve seen some liars today the lawyer the wife her lover the psychology student the little nouvelle riche girl the old money kid but take the pensao landlord jorge the one youd expect to be a liar the one who looked like a liar but he wasnt he was an elider an omitter an excluder an editor but he wasnt guarding his own secrets that was the difference now valentim hes got potential plenty of practice hes been at it since his father left probably he doesnt trust anybody not even his mother hes got the makings of the finest brocade that one then theres the one i missed out the victim she must have done some lying in her time but what interests me about her is the game she played on her mother what was that phoning her up getting her to come over so that what so that she could show her that she knew so that she could show her that she was better so that she could punish her boa tarde did you see this girl yesterday around two twofifteen no thank you adeus my stomachs told me something watch the lawyer so far thats all i dont know about valentim thats a hard thing to admit that you sodomized a young girl still shaming even for him maybe there was someone else another creep who did that to her shamed himself and killed her for the feeling shed given him but its a job this one jorge said shed been coming in there for months doing tricks for pocket money the lover said she took money off him after sex teresa carvalho said shes been sleeping around the university even with her lecturer bruno said that wasnt reliable none of them know her they know bits of her only valentim has got inside but then he knew what he was looking for boa tarde did you see this girl yesterday around two twofifteen yes you did i was in a cafe now on avenida duque de avila a few buildings down from catarinas school the liceu d dinis she came in here sometime after two oclock said the barman ive seen her before shes at the school she buys a coffee drinks it leaves just like everybody else was there any particular reason you remembered her i came on at two she came in a few minutes later she was the only person in the place was she with anybody no she stood at the counter like i said blonde hair blue eyes white top short skirt nice legs big shoes with shiny stones in the heels you took a good look at her why not any reason he leaned on the stainlesssteel counter drummed his fingers on the edge of it looked up into his head went through a long list of pros and cons and balanced it all out i didnt take my eyes off his face he stopped fooling around youre joking he said im not because he said flipping his thumbs up on the counter i wouldnt have minded fucking her she had a very nice ass ok now who are you police i said have you got a phone down the end of the bar i called carlos who still hadnt got the search warrant i told him to wait for me in the office when he got it that i was going to talk to the schoolteacher for no more than an hour and then wed search valentims room together i hung up slapped some coins on the bar and left catarinas teacher lived at the top of a smart renovated fourstorey apartment building in rua actor taborda which was just on the other side of saldanha from the school and not far from the policia judiciaria building it was after seven oclock and still light with a little way io go but the heat was backing off now first thing she didnt look like any schoolteacher id ever had or met she had short dark shiny hair fashionably cut she wore earrings which looked like two bent coffee spoons and lipstick even for the police she had green penetrating eyes that never left my face and perfect white hardlooking teeth she was wearing a lightweight very short blue shift with the four inches of sleeve rolled over her shiny shoulders to keep herself cool she was my height with long slim legs and long slim arms her name was ana luisa madrugada but i use luisa she said ice tea homemade i nodded take a seat she went into a galley kitchen and opened the fridge i sat in the dark room the shutters partly closed to the light and heat outside shed been working there was a table lamp on over piles of books and papers some typed some in longhand a computer with text on the screen flickered in the corner she handed me the ice tea and slumped into a chair opposite she stretched out a long tubular arm not muscular but taut she placed her glass elegantly on a side table where there was an ashtray with two cigarette butts which had been smoked right down to the filter as if they were an allowance she was hardly sitting almost lying with her back on the seat of the chair and her legs so far out in front that her knees were almost touching mine she was careless with her limbs which was why i looked at them so much i mentioned her work she told me she was working on a doctoral thesis on a subject that did not snag in my brain i found myself too concerned by the shift which was working its way up her thigh at her every movement so that i thought i was going to see something that was none of my business but i wanted it to be a few seconds later i realized they were culottes and she could afford to be negligent i could relax my eyes drifted back up to her shiny shoulders and the bent spoons i wished id brought carlos along with me now there would have been someone else to ask and answer questions while i did some idle watching without the pressure of having to pay attention i wanted to know how old she was i tried to look at the back of her hands but she wouldnt keep still she looked anywhere between twentyfive and thirtyfive she kicked me on the leg and put her hand on my knee to say sorry i felt plugged in the blood zipping around me like quicksilver how did it go what were the words to use where were the words inspector yes i said seeing her head on one side waiting for an answer its been a long day senhora doutora luisa she said ive been talking too much when i work all day and it gets to nighttime i just need to talk having you here is a luxury normally i have to go down to the cafe and try to engage the barman but theyre surly down there and hard work i give it to them anyway my whole days worth of nonsense im doing it again im talking too much its your turn i wouldnt mind some more nonsense myself i said i dont get enough nonsense too much senselessness not enough nonsense i got up at eight by nine i was working it was perfect everything was coming out just right then i heard some kids playing in the street but theres no traffic and i remember its saturday and thats why im working and not teaching then i think what are kids doing in the city on the first hot day of summer what am i doing in the city why arent i having lunch with somebody out on the beach why isnt someone taking me out to lunch on the beach why am i sitting indoors writing learned rubbish that only five people will ever read i can feel the pointlessness beginning to break like a tidal wave so before it does i go back to work i work all afternoon and nobody calls me theyre all out at the beach mines the only call you get my saviour the police she laughed that is your job isnt it i ducked out of that one i havent been in the saving business for years ive been in the pickingupthepieces business i was lucky you were in i said one other phone call and youd have been gone i was always going to be in she said a little melancholy creeping into the room not just work no she said and took a careful look at me then shrugged i split up with a boyfriend recently and fell off the edge of the earth but anyway thats not nonsense thats deadly seriously boring a longterm relationship too long so long we didnt get married she said and then caught me on the hop what about you what about me i said defensive only used to dealing the questions nobody ever asking me anything personal are you married i was for eighteen years police work probably isnt that good for marriage she died im sorry about a year ago i said and then thought of something which i said out loud which means in fact that i was married for seventeen years i suppose i just still it had grown darker in the room we were sitting out of the restricted light from the table lamp and were now upright on the edges of our chairs trying to see each others faces in the warm dusk ive been coming to the surface i said stirred by the intimacy present in the room and then disturbed by it i pulled out but that too is probably deadly seriously boring and this is what happens to us what the deadly seriously boring people end up working on saturday afternoons its the only thing that makes us feel worth something i have a daughter that helps and im working only because a faceless man on the end of a mobile phone assigns things to me and i obey what sort of an assignment could bring you to my door is one of my kids in trouble youve had no calls today dont rub it in which of your kids do you think would be in trouble boy or girl girl catarina sousa oliveira first time i thought somebody would be coming to talk to me about her in the end what about drugs probably im with homicide she put her hands up to her face the word had chilled her she went over to the window and opened a shutter to let more light in and some of the days residual warmth whats happened she asked she was murdered yesterday late afternoon i said im surprised nobodys called you dr oliveira said he tried last night i was out with my sister in the alfama you were expecting trouble with drugs i said i see it as part of my job to look for signs needle rash dilated pupils poor concentration loneliness how many of those did catarina have everything except the needle rash did you talk to her about it of course i talk to all the suspect kids why was she lonely that doesnt mean she wasnt popular you know how it is she had talent it attracted a lot of attention she had a great voice and the blonde hair and blue eyes a lot of the kids liked her and wanted to be like her but she didnt have any friends amongst them too far ahead for that you heard her sing it wasnt a beautiful voice nothing clear or sweet about it but it could raise the hairs on the back of your neck she could do fado but what she really liked was black music the blues numbers billie holiday she loved doing billie holiday and she had plenty to cry about i said what about mood swings she hasnt been so bad this term she went through a patch of incredible anger shed go puce and look as if she was going to toss her desk out of the window then shed calm down just as quickly and go morose i talked to her mother and things got better almost instantly she didnt have any medication in her blood maybe she stopped taking whatever was causing the trouble she was sexually active in an extreme way for a girl her age were you aware of any relationships within the school nothing happens in that place without the whole world knowing about it but sometimes rumour is more exciting than the truth and its not so easy to distinguish so i dont talk about what i hear im only interested in what youve seen she came back from the window and sat on the edge of her chair again ill put it another way i said ive retraced her steps from a pensao in rua da gloria to the cafe down the street from the school la bella italia at around twofifteen she went to school i presume she wouldnt have come all this way not to she was in my class until close to fourthirty then what she wrung her hands and looked into the floor i saw her leave the building she was with this guy a young guy whos teaching english language hes scottish jamie gallacher he was talking to her on the corner of the street and she wasnt talking back then she walked off up duque de avila and he followed thats all i saw was that unusual if you listened to the rumour there was something going on there i heard that catarina would go back to his apartment after school sometimes but that is not reliable and shouldnt appear in any of your reports its girl talk what do you make of jamie gallacher hes ok but hes like a lot of these english people he likes to drink and he drinks heavily and then hes not such a nice guy chapter xvii th december serra da malcata beira baixa portugal the mule train had split up abrantes had sent the younger man on ahead he was cursing himself for overloading the mules but there was no sense in leaving just a few hundred kilos behind for another trip two of the mules had broken down one lame the other with a snapped girth theyd tried to spread their loads out over the other mules but it was impossible they risked losing more thered been no letup in the weather which had turned colder bringing ice in the rain on the back of a fierce northeasterly while black clouds crowded the hills abrantes and one of his men salgado unloaded the mules while abrantes worked on one mules hoof salgado did his best to repair the torn leather strap of the other they were down by the river when they heard them men on horseback the guarda one of the regular border patrols the two men looked at the wolfram over two hundred kilos of it nearly one hundred and fifty thousand escudos worth they pinched their cigarettes out and calmed the animals abrantes jerked his head at salgado and they picked up a sixtykilo sack of wolfram each and staggered to the edge of the freezing river salgado wanted to drop his in at the edge but abrantes urged him out into the faster flowing water in the middle they went back salgado couldnt manage the second one so they picked up the next two sacks between them and waded out they went back to the mules and coaxed them into the water and back out again they could still hear the horses of the guarda closer now but not making progress assessing the situation they didnt see them at first the acoustics of the river valley playing games with the sound of the hooves on the rocks the guarda appeared directly above them their peaked caps silhouetted against the lighter distant sky one of the men pointed down to their position two of the guardas unholstered their sidearms the third took out a rifle from the back of his saddle they shouted down to them the rifleman levelled his weapon and aimed abrantes and his man put up their hands the two guardas with pistols galloped along the ridge and came down into the gully their horses trod carefully over the rocks towards the two mules the guardas dismounted the man on the ridge lowered his weapon stuck it back in his saddle and reined his horse round to join the party down by the river the chefe da brigada approached the two men still with their hands up he adjusted the grip on his gun in his gloved hand he looked over the mules what are you doing out here weve had trouble with the mules said abrantes this ones lame and the others girth has broken wheres your cargo we dont have one where have you come from penamacor where are you going foios said abrantes were taking the mules back to their owner theyve been used for work outside penamacor what sort of work transport transporting what said the guarda getting frustrated you know working around the mine wolfram i think so i think thats what it was were you carrying any wolfram no were just taking the mules back youre wet up to your waist youre wet weve just brought the animals across the river the chefe pointed them over to the mules with his pistol he slapped the mules bellies satisfied himself that they were wet he went to the riverside the guarda with the rifle arrived and dismounted he tore a branch from a tree and joined the chefe they walked along the side of the river dragging the branch along under the water it was late afternoon now and the light was failing abrantes didnt know where the guarda were from but they had a twohour ride ahead of them wherever the chefe and the rifleman talked out of earshot they came back to their horses all three mounted and rode back out of the river valley without exchanging another word abrantes brought salgado to his side and they sat and watched the river for some minutes the rain driving into their backs he took out his walther p and checked that it was loaded and still dry they made a fire abrantes worked on the mules hoof again salgado repaired the girth night fell and they slept around the fire having eaten some stale bread and ham in the morning they were up at first light wading into the river to bring out the sacks of wolfram it took some time as the river had swollen some more during the night and they could only bring them out one at a time they loaded the sacks on to the mules giving the lame mule the lighter load the rain had stopped but the cold wind was still blowing and there was more on its way down from the meseta they moved out of the gully and up on to the ridge to start the climb across the serra to spain thats where they were waiting for them on the other side of the ridge the chefe de brigada raised his gun and told the men to stop abrantes fell to one side as if hed taken a bullet in the side of the head the chefe instinctively squeezed the trigger and salgado openmouthed took the bullet high in his chest where it shattered his clavicle salgados mule took off the second bullet hit salgado in the stomach before hed reached the ground abrantes dragged his mule down to the floor he tore the gun from his waistband and shot the chefe in the chest under the armpit the man fell to the ground the rifleman was trying to keep his rearing horse calm and abrantes let off two shots the second hitting him in the head the third guarda wheeled his horse round in time to take a bullet between his shoulderblades he fell backwards with a crack and his horse ran back down into the gully abrantes tethered his mule and approached the chefe who was still breathing but bubbling blood out of his mouth he shot him in the head the rifleman was already dead the third guarda had a broken neck abrantes went to salgado who was lying on his back so flat that it was as if the ground had already claimed him he was panting scared and in pain his lips and face white abrantes tore open the mans coat and shirt and saw the mash of bone and flesh at his clavicle and the dark hole in his stomach salgado whispered something abrantes put his head down to his mouth i cant feel my legs he said abrantes nodded at him stood back and shot him in the eye the chefes horse had stayed abrantes loaded two guardas on to it and took them down to the river the other two horses were down there and he tethered them to a tree he went back and loaded the chefe and salgado he filled the dead mens clothes with rocks and dragged each one of them out into the river riding the chefes horse he picked up his own mule and found salgados grazing in a hollow still fully loaded with the wolfram he spread the loads from the mules over the guardas horses and set off once more across the serra for spain it was the afternoon of christmas eve and felsen was still in abrantes house waiting with his cleaned and loaded pistol it had been a long wait and one he had not been prepared for there was only so much time he could spend thinking about abrantes the missing wolfram and how he was going to manoeuvre the portuguese across the border and leave him out there amongst the rocks and broom with a bullet in his brain occasionally maria came in with coffee and then later food and drink she wanted his attention but he wouldnt give it to her her presence irritated him she triggered strands of thought that hed rather have left dormant he remembered a look shed given him when they were burying the englishman in the courtyard and that would start him thinking about that afternoon in the old mine and hed have to shake his head and pace the room to get rid of it he wondered why hed had her now how could it have been to spite abrantes when he was going to kill the man anyway at that moment shed appear again and the word rape would climb into his brain and hed remember the thrill as he rammed gently into her her eyes darting afraid above the knuckles of his hand over her mouth but then it had turned into something else hed felt that heel on his buttock shed come back the next night and it had sickened him he told her to stay in the kitchen he thought about other women he thought about the first woman a girl who was supposed to be out in the field working for his father but who hed caught sleeping in the barn shed seen the way hed looked at the flesh between her stocking top and skirt and had let him have her to keep him quiet she was still the only one by the time he arrived in berlin as a young man a girl picked him up in the railway station hed thought that this was all part of the wild city life until hed finished and shed demanded her money hed asked what for and her lips had hardened to chisel tips shed called the pimp whod taken one look at the size of the farmboy and produced a blade hed paid and backed out and then heard the pimp beating the girl wilkommen in berlin the weather closed in again over amendoa the rain raked die tiles felsen smoked and continued to amuse himself by trying to remember all the women hed ever had in the right order if he missed one he had to start again it took him some time to work his way to eva he didnt want to think about her but in the near darkness of the house and after their brief encounter back in berlin he found he couldnt prevent his mind from drifting back over the shards of the affair like gunsmoke over a battlefield he began to discern her slow dismanding of their relationship from the moment shed taken him back in after theyd split up over his accusation that she was acting to that last sexual act in his apartment before the gestapo removed him in the morning but even in that period he could still find moments when theyd reconnected and he could still feel that point of contact when their knees had touched under the table in the club only a few nights ago he rubbed it as if it was still burning he lit a cigarette and the draught in the room battered the smoke this way and that whipping it away to nothing he asked himself if this was what love wasthis strange acid in the stomach that burns a constant ulceration this airlock in his pipes that could send shudders around his system and stop the flow of everything but that was not how hed ever heard love described and like a man taking a short leap over a high drop to white water he lurched to a sudden conclusion hed gone from intimacy to loss without ever having experienced love it choked him and he had to pace the room again to try and free himself of the notion he took long hard draws on his cigarette until he was dizzy with nicotine and he reeled to the door and let himself out into the blustery afternoon the wind gusted needles of sleet into his face he breathed it in as if it would somehow clean him out he had no idea how long he stood there the afternoon had already darkened with the weather and his face had instantly numbed the only way he knew that there was ice in the rain was the way it spiked his tongue when finally he turned to go back into the house he saw that he wasnt alone in the street some way off two figures approached heads bowed against the wind felsen came level with the steps up to the house one figure split away and headed for the side of the house as if for cover in profile now he saw it was a mule the other figure came doggedly forward and he knew from the gait and the hat that it was abrantes he felt the hardness of the gun in his waistband he unbuttoned his coat in the middle the figure didnt hesitate until he was about five metres away felsens fingers flipped open another button hands appeared from the clothing of the man opposite felsen slid his hand into the opening of his coat and gripped the handle of the gun abrantes left hand came up and removed the scarfing from his face the right hand hung limply when it happened it was quick too quick for felsen to move abrantes covered the five metres in a fraction of a second threw his arms around the german and smacked two hands on his leather back bom natal he said happy christmas abrantes guided felsen back up the stairs and into the house he shouted for maria and told her to take care of the mule she disappeared out of the back of the house they went into the parlour room and abrantes threw logs on to the fire felsens face came back to life raw and aching abrantes went into the kitchen and came back with a bottle of aguardente and two glasses he poured the liquor and they drank to christmas he was happier than felsen had ever seen him i heard you were in foios he said as if felsen had dropped round there for a drink and found nobody in the chefe at vilar formoso said we could be in for a hard time i thought id take a look at the mules and you saw that id been running them for months months ive got more than fifty tons over there where in a warehouse in navasfrias you should have told me ive had a hard time explaining the shortfall in berlin im sorry for that i was only reacting to rumours which rumours that now youve invaded russia and that campaign is continuing dr salazar is not so concerned about an invasion here the germans are too stretched they say you remember the corte real going down in october and the cassequel said abrantes the cassequel was one of our best ships seven thousand tons so you dont think this is a lisbon problem i think we should go to vilar formoso tomorrow said abrantes take the chefe another christmas present i was there only a few days ago they have short memories he said and we could cross over and take a look at the product in navasfrias said felsen is it secure its secure secure meant men with shotguns felsen suddenly saw himself lying amongst the rocks and broom with his face blown apart but he couldnt back down from abrantes now he nodded and checked abrantes but all he saw was weathered skin stretched over large bones with eyes concentrated on the task of pouring more alcohol what was it poser had said to him or someone else in the legation about the portuguese two things the first that there wasnt a law in portugal that couldnt be got around and the second was that the portuguese never came at you headon they got you looking straight ahead and then they stuck you from behind it had been poser he remembered pointing it out to him that this of course would never happen in germany and the prussian had walked off sick of his irony the two of them ate a christmas dinner of a large hen and some roasted bacalhau they drank two bottles of prewar dao which left the warm rounded taste of a less complicated summer at the back of the mouth felsen went to bed early and smoked and drank aguardente from his metal flask in the dark he kept his gun under his pillow after an hour he went across the courtyard and listened at the door of the house with the gun dangling from his hand he heard abrantes familiar grunt and marias strange hiss in the morning he drank coffee and smoked a cigarette and ignored the stonefaced girl he had a problem he didnt want to cross the border with abrantes and walk into a team of shotguns in navasfrias at nine oclock this problem was solved by a driver whod come up from guarda with a telegram from lisbon dutch and australian troops invade e timor return to lisbon immediately poser he liked posers use of the word invade he knew that salazar would see it exactly like that an invasion of portuguese sovereignty is there a problem asked abrantes suddenly anxious our border difficulties are over said felsen the allies have made a mistake i have to go to lisbon now you will arrange for the one hundred and nine tons you have stored in navasfrias to go to the compound in ciudad rodrigo and no more smuggling until i authorize it one hundred and nine tons felsen gave him the calculations the numbers flickered through abrantes head his face impassive and grey as hoar frost from not shaving at that moment felsen realized what abrantes had been doing he hadnt been stealing but playing the price difference over the border selling high in spain to come back and buy cheap in portugal and pocket the difference but hed been caught out the price in spain had dropped maybe there were no buyers at the time he didnt have the money to replace the stock in foios all he could do was try to recoup the situation by underestimating the tonnage hed smuggled the good mood of last night had been the start of a bluff a man playing for time to control his losses when do you want the product moved asked abrantes anxiety showing through its supposed to be in last years accounts which should be finalized by the end of january felsen went into the kitchen maria was there holding her baby looking pathetic he strode past her crossed the courtyard and packed his clothes in the back of the citroen he wrote a note to the manager of the compound in ciudad rodrigo and gave it to the driver as they drove down the hill they caught up with a procession there were men he recognized carrying a body wrapped in cloth and women walking behind he dropped the window who has died he asked the men didnt answer a woman spoke up it is alvaro fortes she said and this is his widow and son felsen blinked and told his chauffeur to drive on th december german legation lapa lisbon salazar said poser who hadnt referred to him as a cheating arab for over twentyfour hours now was in such a lather still is about the invasion that we thought it expedient to open our wolfram negotiations for immediately its been a marvellous sight sir ronald campbell the british ambassador has been staggering about like a concert pianist with broken fingers the good doctor has spent the whole year in a state of irritation with the british whove put an arm around his shoulder and whispered the old alliance in his ear and taken advantage of his credit while with the other they blockade him and sweep troops into dili we on the other hand have been sinking his ships true minor but necessary corrective measures or should we say reminders of his neutral status as far as salazars concerned christmas happens once a year and he gets all the presents what are you offering steel said poser brimming with confidence steel and fertilizer well be making an offer in two weeks time salazar will give us guaranteed export licences for tons and once we have that these other negotiations about who will get what from the metals corporation will be immaterial we will get what we want and the british can learn about sweating for and do i continue my operations asked felsen of course you do unless you receive orders to the contrary i think a more clandestine approach might be in order but you should have an open field wheres this intelligence from not intelligence just an observation about british character you probably dont know much about cricket do you nor do i but im told its all about fair play theyll play by the book and report all your indiscretions to salazar like the good boys they are and salazar if we keep stroking his fur the right way will ignore them poser took one of felsens offered cigarettes lit it and stuck it in his prosthetic hand he sipped his coffee licked his lips and applied his handkerchief to them as if they were sore he sat back patting his chest as if that was where he had his winnings is that it said felsen you brought me all the way down from the beira just to tell me how brilliant you are no said poser just to smoke some of your cigarettes i like the brand felsen checked him over yes confirmed poser ive been learning from you felsen a joke a rare thing in diplomatic circles when are you and salazar getting married poser the wedding i fear is still some way off he said grinning happy christmas poser and to you felsen said the prussian raising his prosthetic hand in a half salute and by the way theres someone to see you in my office for an irrational moment caught up in posers good humour felsen thought that it would be eva but he was distracted by the smell of burning in his nostrils and poser tearing the cigarette out of his prosthetic hand the glove burnt through and ruined shit said poser another rare thing in diplomatic circles asked felsen in posers office sitting with his back to the door and his feet up on the window sill looking out at the weak winter sunshine filtering through the phoenix palms in the gardens was gruppenfuhrer lehrer heil hitler said felsen what a surprise herr gruppenfuhrer what a wonderful surprise dont waste any of that swabian charm on me herr sturmbannfuhrer sturmbannfuhrer youve been promoted so have i now im herr obergruppenfuhrer if you can manage that and as from next march well be operating under the auspices of the wirtschaftund verwaltungshauptamt or the whva if that means anything to you said lehrer who paused for a sign clearly not now we get promoted for failing to achieve our targets no for getting close to impossible ones the circumstances have not been easy i know and you havent had full control of the campaign but despite all this youve made considerable progress and more important the reichsfuhrer himmler has been able to shine in front of the fuhrer and annoy fritz todt the latter being the most gratifying i can only thank you for coming all this way to confer the honour sir lehrer whipped his feet off the sill and swivelled his chair to face felsen promotion had worked on him there was a greater and harder authority emanating from under the black eyebrows do you know what temperature it is in russia now asked felsen unnerved well below zero i imagine minus twenty if youre in moscow minus thirty if youre out in the wilderness somewhere and its going down not up its not so easy to remember that in plus fifteen with the blue sea and the estoril casino and the champagne the blankets forget the damned blankets the quality was complete shit anyway im glad you know this im glad the british preemptive campaign was so successful now theyve got all those blankets rotting in their own warehouses instead of them stinking out ours and poser seemed so cheerful what you dont know about poser is that he has a prosthetic head nothing in there is real said lehrer you know who theyve got fighting our boys out there on the eastern front russians siberians flatfaced sliteyed siberians those people they sleep in the summer its too warm for them they only wake up when the temperature drops below minus ten that is their operating temperature our troops are still in their summer tunics they havent even got gloves and theyre faced with those barbarians who dance because its so beautifully cold who rub rancid pig fat on to their bayonets so that when they stick our halffrozen soldiers the wound will be hopelessly infected and theyll die in agony if their screams could carry as far as berlin wed be out of there tomorrow why are you telling me this the reward for failure is a posting to the russian front what does that tell you we are not experiencing total victory the real winter has just started but its been damn cold for two months our supply lines are stretched over thousands of miles the russians have retreated and left us nothing theyve razed everything to the ground there isnt a single thing we dont have to transport you know what we do with our russian prisoners of war we stick them behind barbed wire and watch them starve and freeze to death we cant give them anything we cant supply ourselves grim is an unimaginably slight adjective for the situation out there the first half of the liverwurst sandwich have you been out in the beira with your head up a pigs arse what happened on th december pearl harbor we already have the makings of the sandwich the way we see it here were twentyfive kilometres from moscow were in the suburbs for gods sake the americans are on the other side of the atlantic theyve still got to invade europe lets be reasonable herr obergruppenfuhrer im hopeful herr sturmbannfuhrer but we must have contingency said lehrer now that peasant you work with up there in the beira abrantes can he read or write no said felsen but he has a signature is he under control hes under control said felsen thinking how close it had been as long as hes making money hes happy he does well enough out of the wolfram cleaning companies we set up this is a different thing altogether those cleaning companies are nothing they dont have significant assets you remember what i said to you at the beginning of the year about private thinking their eyes connected and achieved an understanding in the event of unlikely disaster felsen allowed the sentence to drift what i have in mind said lehrer were going to open a bank a portugueseowned bank portugueseowned if it comes to it the completion of the sandwich i mean i can assure you the allies will be vengeful no german assets will survive in europe this bank will be portugueseowned with significant but very discreet german shareholders and who are they going to be you and me for the moment said lehrer this is our private enterprise no one and certainly not that prussian idiot should know about it is this an ss thing in a manner of speaking said lehrer trying to get a clearer reading from felsen but i hope you understand the importance of abrantes in this he must be reliable he must be a friend hes a friend said felsen holding lehrers adamantine look good said lehrer easing himself back into his chair now all we need is a name a good portuguese name what does felsen translate as in portuguese rochedo rocha rocha that sounds reliable but i think we should have something big and encompassing to go with it the sea is probably the most important portuguese icon said felsen whats sea in portuguese mar no no mar e rocha sounds like a bad restaurant oceano e rocha i think that could be it banco de oceano e rocha said lehrer looking out into the gardens id put my money in that chapter xviii st october central berlin eva brucke sat in the study in her apartment she smoked cigarette after cigarette and took sips of brandy from a glass she held with white hands in which she could see the blue veins working clearly her face had so little colour in it she thought her teeth might be visible through her cheeks if she stood in front of the light her insides she didnt have any insides she felt like a plucked and drawn bird freezing too there were two of them in the apartment nameless of course hansel and gretel tristan and isolde the two were practised expert at not being therequieter than insects but not so silent that the tension in the rooms became palpable theyd been at it around berlin for months and this was their last stop eva had been getting ready to go out had just got to the point of applying a nub end of a lipstick to her mouth when thered been a knock at the door a polite knock she put the lipstick away she didnt want to fluff it and break up the valuable nub end the next knock was a roll of thunder a heartstopping pounding on the door followed by the dread threesyllable word that could jelly the thighs of a berlin bartender gestapo it was loud enough that the two in the back of the apartment would have heard and hidden themselves she had no time im coming she said getting it out clear first time with no croaks and adding a slightly irritable intonation the pounding continued she shrugged into her overcoat and opened the door yes she said efficient a slight divot of a frown on her forehead i was just on my way out the two men pushed past her into the living room they both wore black leather coats and black hats which neither of them removed one was thin the other a brute come in she said your papers she took them out of her handbag and handed them over straightarmed on the confident side of impertinent eva brucke said the thin one not reading the papers i think youll find thats who i am youve been reported for what and by whom harbouring illegals he said your neighbours i dont have any neighbours im surrounded by rubble were not necessarily talking about people who live next door neighbours could be those who overlook from the back for instance they were bombed out last week she said you dont mind if we have a quick look around i was on my way out she said verging on the desperate it wont take long said the thin one sniffing the air as long as you dont mind giving me the names of the neighbours the names of your superior officers so that i can report those neighbours for nosiness when your superiors come to my club tonight and your names too so that what so that you can report us too asked the brute hanging his face in front of her muller said the thin one pointing to his own chest and schmidt do you want to write those down can we get on with it now the back of the apartment is still unsafe from the bombing i will not be responsible if you hurt yourselves and if a wall falls out because of your carelessness and im left to freeze this winter ill sleep in this room finished schmidt his eyes gone sleepy his nose broken and bent to the right no i will ask my friends your superiors at the rhsa to pay for the reconstruction in a pigs arse said schmidt crudely nobody was sure what he meant they stared into her shed overdone it on the haughtiness and the namedropping nerves muller gave her back her papers perhaps ill go first he said if schmidts hundred kilos starts slipping hell take the whole of the side of the building away with him he smiled as if his mouth was a recent cut turned away from her and sniffed the air again she didnt like him he seemed a little too intelligent for gestapo what happened to the dolts or did they all get sent to stalingrad eva sat down in the living room and jammed her hands into her coat pockets schmidt leaned against the door jamb and watched mullers progress down the corridor tell him its the last two rooms he has to watch out for hell feel it in the floorboards schmidt glanced at her nodded and looked back without saying a word she wanted to smoke but didnt dare take her hands out of her pockets she knew from the state of her stomach theyd be shaking he smells them first said schmidt after a few minutes what jews said schmidt he says they smell of rancid cheese tell him ive got some in my kitchen jews he asked as a matter of fact cheese said eva i dont want him to smash the place up just because ive got a piece of gruyere somebody gave me six weeks ago doesnt it keep he asked gruyere where do they find you people he jolted himself off the door jamb and moved across the room at an alarming pace as if pleasantries were over and the usual tools were to be applied he clamped his meaty hands on to the arms of her chair and leaned his face into hers so that she could see each nascent bristle above his top lip youve got nice legs he said unlike your manner i hope we get you down at prinz albrechtstrasse he said glancing down at her lap and then back to her eyes we can do anything we like down there schmidt shouted muller from the back of the apartment eva jumped get down here schmidt smiled and pushed himself away from the chair he went down the corridor eva pressed one of her hands still in her pocket between her legs and clamped her thighs in case she pissed herself her bowels were trembling and liquid take hold of my belt said muller this floors completely fucked said schmidt with a construction engineers precision eva forced herself out of the chair and down the corridor for gods sake be careful she said its a sevenmetre drop to the street the fall will kill you if the rubble doesnt shes concerned for you muller muller strained forward craning his neck around the door schmidt held on smiling and winking at eva i think she must like them slim he added shut up schmidt and pull me back up schmidt without taking his eyes off eva twitched his forearm and muller sprang back and thumped into his chest schmidt put an arm around him you know what you have to do said schmidt you have to be totally confident you cant piss about you just have to do it he took two steps down the corridor and went into the bedroom on the left the whole floor lurched beams groaned plaster and masonry broke off and powdered there was a loud crack schmidt reappeared ashenfaced his head wobbling on his neck a line appeared in the plaster work above their heads you fucking idiot said muller springing back down the corridor theres nobody in there said schmidt walking tightly buttocks squeaking were going now didnt you smell anything asked schmidt recovering his cool only the shit youve got in your pants eva led them back to the living room muller was tightlipped furious and thwarted schmidt opened the door and looked back at eva whats in that said muller pointing at an old chest shed moved up from the damaged room it wasnt a big chest it couldnt have taken a grown man books said eva try lifting it muller tried the lid it was locked open it he said i havent opened it in years i dont even know where the key is find it i dont eva stopped schmidt had opened his coat and taken out a walther ppk what are you doing best jew detector ive ever known he said and if there isnt a jew in there youre prepared to give me six months of your salary six months thats a seventeenthcentury chest and the books are valuable too why do you think i moved it up from the bedroom schmidt regripped the gun and turned it on eva you know the penalty for harbouring illegals i imagine it involves some years in a kz boom he said lets go said muller they left eva went straight to the lavatory and let out a thin stream of diarrhoea she lit her first cigarette with her dress and coat still up around her waist she had to force herself out of the house she had said she was going out so she had to do it she knew theyd be sitting there in their car waiting for her she finished the fourth cigarette dropped the last of the brandy swilled her mouth out with water and goaded herself out on to the street she walked in the road the pavements were covered in piles of rubble and there were always poles and czechs carting more of it out of the halfcollapsed buildings the gestapo car pulled alongside and schmidt rolled down his window want a lift he said we must be going your way ill walk thanks see you again number eight prinz albrechtstrasse she arrived at her club on the kurfurstendamm it had been cold in the street but she was in a sweat traudl was in her office lying on a camp bed behind a curtain she lived there when she couldnt find men to take care of her which was most of the time she was thin and white her facial bones as clear and as fragile as porcelain eva sent her out to clean the bar and sat back with another brandy and more cigarettes her body which had begun to feel as dislocated as a cubists idea of one slowly came back together her insides warmed and filled her guts firmed she did the september accounts and put hansel and gretel to the back of her mind at pm she left for home to change into her evening wear it was a cold night small groups of jews all with the yellow stars theyd been required to wear by law since the beginning of september trotted past her making for home before the pm curfewarmaments factory workers they were all legal before turning down her cobbled street off kurfurstenstrasse she looked up at the starry night she sniffed the air it was clean and there were no obvious gestapo cars in the street the bombers would be out though it had been a terrible summer first lubeck then cologne dusseldorf hamburg osnabruck bremen and of course berlin putrefaction had clogged the air only the rats were fat but tonight was clean she went up to the apartment let herself in and checked each room its safe she said quietly gradually there was movement from the end room a young man inched around the door his face contorted from the stiffness of his body wheres the girl asked eva the girl appeared behind her where were you in the chest she said i was just trying it for size when they came eva suddenly had the girlseye view from inside the chest she shuddered youll be leaving tonight for gothenburg she said moving on to better things the girl smiled at the ceiling the boy squeezed evas arm there was a soft knock at the door the boy crept back down the corridor and around the door the girl was gone eva cleared her throat whos that another soft knock she opened the door two girls one late teens the other fourteen at the most yellow stars yes said eva looking down the stairwell behind them can you help us said the eldest girl weve come from herr kaufman i cant she said and heard the girls gasp as if theyd been stabbed im being watched what can we do youll have to go somewhere else now its too dangerous for you to stay here where shall we go she blinked why hadnt kaufman said he was sending two more she thumped her forehead with a closed fist and tried to think of somewhere nearby do you know frau hirschfeld she asked they shook their heads do you know berlin again she wrote out the instructions for them it wasnt such an easy place to get to after pm without papers she sent them on their way she still had plenty of work to do with hansel and gretel she went into her office and unlocked and removed the second drawer she took the contents out and turned it over taped on the underside were forged papers for hansel and gretel in the names of hans and ingrid kube another soft knock on the door what now she put the drawer and the contents back into the desk another soft knock those girls what was herr kaufman thinking of she strode across the living room and opened the door the two girls were standing there in their coats their shoes planted together good as gold behind them with a hand on their shoulders was muller schmidts colossal fist came into the light waving the instructions shed just writtena moments loss of concentration the smaller girl began to cry frau hirschfeld sends her regards said schmidt shoving eva with the flat of his hand between her breasts so that she fell on her back and skidded across the room how expensive did you say that chest was he asked and slammed the door behind him he took out the gun footsteps down the stairs he eased off the safety catch no said eva no why no ive found the key its too late for keys i havent the time for keys he pumped two bullets into the chest there was a muffled cry eva launched herself at schmidts gun arm and he cracked her across the forehead with the barrel she went down but not quite out schmidt pumped another bullet into the chest eva felt herself lifted her cheek landing on the carved top of the chest schmidt rucked up her skirt and his hand grabbed her roughly between the legs his fingers finding their way in there was a shout from the back of the house an incoherent wail something fell something big and heavy like the wardrobe eva hadnt been able to move out of there the hand left her there was a stupendous crack and then a small stroke of silence before the back end of the whole apartment building collapsed with a noise that went on and on eva slid off the chest schmidt was standing over her looking in the direction of the endless collapse mouth open unable to move not knowing how much of the building was going to break up and whether theyd be consumed with it eva no longer felt fear for the first time in two years she felt relief that it was over relief that was until the house fell silent again and the floor was still there underneath her and schmidt said that really wasnt very safe at all was it ist october largo do rato central lisbon in the largo do rato felsen had picked up a taxi a gasogenio something introduced nearly a year ago when the fuel shortages began to bite for some reason he felt less safe with a woodburning stove mounted on the boot generating steam into a cylinder in the front than he did with petrol doing much the same thing he couldnt wait to get out which was what he did no more than seventy metres down rua da escola politecnica but not because hed lost his nerve he thought he was mistaken but the likeness was so exact he had to get out to check the girl turned right into rua da imprensa nacional and he put in a limping sprint to catch up with her he had not been mistaken it was laura van lennep he grabbed her by the wrist as she was taking another right turn and she spun round and tried to wrench herself away from him remember me he said holding on she looked blank chave douro estoril casino hotel parque march we fell in love he said sarcastically she blinked and he looked at her more closely there was something missing something not quite right in her head that was making itself known in her face i have to go to america she said trying to twist her wrist away from him klaus felsen he said hanging on to her you might remember you stole my cufflinks they were engraved with my initials kf no how much did you get for them not enough to get you to america by the looks of it she backed away up the street not out of fear but because she knew she had to get away from the pressure the nasty pressure she wanted to get to the place the place where they were nice to you the place where they looked after you she turned felsen let go of her hesitated and then followed she went into the travessa do noronha where there was a soup kitchen and hospital set up by the commissao portuguesa de assistencia aos judeus refugiados it was lunchtime other people were going into the building he watched her queue up and receive her food she didnt talk to anyone she looked around occasionally but furtively with her head dipped over her spoon he approached a whitecoated doctor who was waiting to be served he pointed out the girl and asked after her we dont know exactly what happened to her said the doctor speaking in portuguese but with a viennese accent we had another case very like hers in which we saw the same neurotic obsession with getting to america this other case had been put on a train by her parents in austria and told to get to america at all costs she later found out that her entire family had been taken to the camps this news induced a curious reaction which was a deep need to obey her parents combined with an obsessive guilt which prevented her from achieving it the only reason we think the same might be true of this dutch girl is that weve seen in her passport that at one stage she had an american visa and amongst her possessions we found a valid ticket for a sailing long gone sad but look around you the doctor rejoined the queue for his meal felsen looked around him without seeing what the doctor had meant the girl wasnt at the table any more he left the building stood on the steps lit a cigarette and flicked the match off into the street he walked down through the bairro alto in the high autumn sunshine to the largo do carmo where he took the elevador down to the rua douro he went up to the second floor of the building theyd leased for the banco de oceano e rocha the offices occupied the ground and first floors and there were two apartments on the floors above the top floor being his and the second floor belonging to abrantes and his family abrantes had asked him to be godfather to his second son hed called felsen at the german legation that morning to say that maria was being released from hospital and he should come and look at his new godchild the maid led felsen through to the living room maria was lying on the chaise longue in a fur coat which wasnt necessary given the weather he could hardly bear to look at her in less than a year the peasant girl had transformed herself into a travesty of a forties film star she couldnt read but shed flicked through the magazines choosing whatever took her fancy and abrantes had indulged her felsen lit a cigarette to stop himself from sneering maria lit one too and blew smoke out in a practised stream abrantes was staring down into the rua do ouro through windows crisscrossed with sticky tape against the bombing raids that the portuguese were still expecting to move down from europe like a bad weather front felsen had even heard air raid warnings and seen the soldiers sitting on sandbags behind their barbed wire barricades in the praca do comercio wondering what the hell they were supposed to be doing abrantes was dressed in a grey suit and now wore spectacles although he never pretended he could read he smoked a charuto his transformation from beira peasant had gone better than marias he had some stature and a sinister look that could command respect from the citydwellers hed learnt things about behaviour and manners just as felsen had done when he first came up from swabia he greeted felsen flamboyantly as a successful wartime businessman should he guided him to the edge of the cradle on which maria rested a proprietorial hand my second son he said your godson we have called him manuel i would have liked to have called him after you but klaus im sure you understand a portuguese boy cant bear the name klaus so we named him after my grandfather felsen nodded the baby was sleeping tightly wrapped in what seemed like far too many clothes he looked like any other baby except a little less wrinkled than usual maria tickled the baby with her finger felsen was aware of her watching him the baby struggled against the intruding finger a bubble appeared at his pursed little mouth his eyes suddenly opened surprised and big for his face felsen frowned marias face came into his vision he looks like his mother this one said abrantes on his shoulder there was a lot of blue in those eyes and maybe if you were the father the faintest hint of marias green in them but to felsen they were blue eyes his own eyes a beautiful baby said felsen automatically and maria sat back on the chaise longue abrantes dug the baby out of the cradle and held him high he growled at him the baby blinked at the big bad bear my second son he said no man could be happier than one with two sons what about a man with three sons asked maria cheeky confident of her status no no said abrantes superstition rippling through him like wind through the broom in the beira out of three one will always be bad the baby gathered his small but impressive powers and let out a long piercing wail chapter xix list december sswhva unter den eichen berlinlichterfelde stalingrad said lehrer who was sitting sideways to his desk his elbow resting on a blotter hand up in the air poised bladelike are they talking about stalingrad in lisbon are they drinking to stalingrad in the goddamned hotel parque in estoril felsen sat alone on the other side of the desk he smoked but didnt answer nobody was talking about stalingrad are they insisted lehrer not at the dinner i was at last night just cutlery clattering on the plates not quite as bad as that and poser what did poser look like asked lehrer shifting in his seat his belt longer than a pack mules girth creaking over the movement of his belly like poser always does but sicker mrnm murmured lehrer seismically zeitzler the army chief of staff went on stalingrad rations for two weeks to show solidarity with his men at the front he lost twelve kilos what does that tell you felsen closed his eyes at another of lehrers endless test questions he wanted to say that it told him that zeitzler probably had more than twelve kilos to lose but one look at lehrers creaking belt told him this would not lighten the tone the sixth army is in big trouble felsen trotted it out lehrers best pupil you know i have my contacts in the east prussian headquarters at rastenberg herr sturmbannfuhrer i am reliably informed that field marshal paulus and his two hundred thousand men are finished said lehrer and his hand dropped guillotining the sixth army off the third reich cant they break out retreat regroup the fuhrer wont allow it hes obsessed with the disgrace of retreat with the disgrace of losing all our heavy artillery he doesnt appear to see zeitzlers point that by leaving them there he will lose everything and not just stalingrad the whole russian campaign does stalingrad have some vital strategic importance lehrer held up his hands if not to god then the blackout blinds its mythical he said you hold stalingrad you hold stalin by his steel balls they talked about wolfram lehrer was listless and disinterested he couldnt even raise the flag for the latest smuggling operation where felsen had loaded tons into rail cars in lisbon and seen them travel on papers as manganese all the way through the border without even the customs opening them up the allied agents had come close to a fistfight with the customs chefes who cleared the cargo in lisbon and vilar formoso they hadnt grasped that these two public servants creamed five million escudos between them which made their thousand escudos per month salaries look like felsens bar bill lehrer managed a few halfhearted questions about the bank which hadnt been doing very much except lending money to buy mining concessions on the border it was early evening by the time felsen finished his report but before lehrer released him the obergruppenfuhrer suddenly staggered to his feet hobbled around the desk and sat on the corner we have a special understanding you and i said lehrer suddenly grave i promised you when i took you away from your factory in berlin that you would be properly rewarded for the work you have done next year possibly your job will be a different one it is one in which you are experienced but whose nature is not the same you must trust me you must not be dismayed when i tell you that at this point we might have already reached the beginning of the end one thing poser did say was that since speers promotion to armaments minister earlier this year there has been a massive improvement in our production capacity ive felt it the pressure for us to ship wolfram has been enormous this is true said lehrer batting him down gently but my feet are telling me that this will only prolong the agony and my feet are never wrong both men looked at lehrers bootencased agony it was six oclock and dark and freezing from a wind sent directly down from the eternal finnish darkness the car crawled forward like the halfblind creature it was felsen sat in the back confused did lehrer know what he was talking about hed always billed himself as the visionary but did the future of the third reich really come down to his being twenty kilos overweight sitting behind a desk too much and atrocious chiropody could the great german army that had crashed through europe smashed through russia all the way to the caucasus all the way to within twentyfive kilometres from moscow to the suburbs for gods sake could it all be over for the loss of one city felsen smoked behind a cupped hand and looked at the destruction in the suburbs of steglitz schonberg and wilmersdorf and remembered poser telling him something at the beginning of june he hadnt believed on the night of the th may in just over an hour and a half allied bombers had dropped more than two thousand tons of bombs on the city when poser had told him this it was four days later and berlin was still burning he hadnt believed him and had tried to get past the demented prussian and out of the room but poser had snagged his elbow with his prosthetic hand and said quietly in his ear ive seen the damage estimation the real one not goebbels version now go and find your wolfram well need every kilo youve got as they came into the south of berlin on the potsdamerstrasse he asked the driver to carry on and take a left up the kurfurstenstrasse the street was unrecognizable with rubble piled in heaps on either side and destroyed and burntout buildings evas apartment building appeared to be still standing he took a torch from the driver and went down the cobbled side street and into the backyard of the building through a gate which opened to a precise quarter circle of rubble and a narrow path to the door of the building whose whole rear was down so that he could see into evas kitchen the place wasnt habitable and he started to back out when he heard a voice thin as bone china singing an absurdly robust childrens song from his homeland ich bin ein musikant ich komm vom schwabenland du bist ein musikant du kommst vom schwabenland ich kann aufspielen auf meiner geige du kannst aufspielen auf deiner geige dela schum schum schum dela schum schum schum dela schum schum schum dela schum felsen went up the stairs still solid and unbroken the voice continued the manic refrain of the bow across a violin the door to the apartment was open the living room had been stripped to the floorboards and even some of those had been taken up at the far end he followed the voice into evas study huddled in the corner in a wild mix of clothingscarves cardigans skirts even a mans waistcoatwas traudl she stopped singing did you bring me anything today her face had completely regressed to a childs a childs with no fat in it the white skin over her skull was thinner than the finest glove leather her temples were sunken he knelt down to her oh she said seeing he was a man do you want to fuck me wheres eva traudl all right then let me sit with you just let me sit with you you can sit with me but tell me where eva is too shes gone away where did she go the girl frowned but didnt answer he tried to put his hand through her hair but it was too matted she began singing her song again footsteps up the stairs light wobbled in the living room a woman appeared in the doorway what are you doing she asked aggressive until she saw the uniform im trying to find eva brucke frau brucke was arrested by the gestapo months ago the girl stopped singing the grating song what for asked felsen judenrein judenrein judenrein chanted traudl harbouring illegals said the woman this one turned up some days after she wont move not even for air raids i bring her something to eat now and again but shell have to move soon with this winter felsen took her to his apartment which had been requisitioned by the organization todt and filled with speers construction workers he gave one of the women there all his ration cards and some money and left traudl with her felsen told the driver to take him to wilhelmstrasse and booked himself into an absurdly luxurious room in the hotel adlon by the next morning he was at no prinz albrechtstrasse sitting in the office of ss sturmbannfuhrer otto graf they were waiting for the file to be delivered and graf was enjoying one of felsens cigarettes and staring out into the still dark morning what is your interest in this case herr sturmbannfuhrer i knew her intimately shed been running clubs and bars in berlin for years a lot of people knew her but you what about you i knew her well enough to know that she wouldnt let herself be known maybe what she was doing you have to be i knew her before the war she was always like that the file arrived graf looked at the photograph and remembered her he flicked through the pages yes yes i know the type he said she looks as if shell snap like a pencil on the first morning and three weeks later shes told us nothing not that three weeks it was a very serious matter she was smuggling jews out sending them in rail cars of furniture to gothenburg and after the three weeks she was lucky if the presiding judge had been freisler she would have hanged as it is shes been sent to ravensbruck for life felsen offered another cigarette which was taken they were american lucky strikes hed brought over from lisbon he gave graf the packet and another one from his pocket he said he could arrange a carton two cartons graf nodded come back at lunchtime ill have a visiting permit ready for you it wasnt difficult to arrange a car but it took all afternoon and another two cartons of cigarettes to get the petrol for it he could have taken the train up to furstenberg but someone had told him the railway station was a long way from the camp and transport not always available in the evening he went to the back of the burntout reichstag building and bought four bars of chocolate on the black market he didnt sleep much that night but lay on his luxurious bed in the hotel adlon drank far too much and swelled his chest with fantasies of rescue he could see eva and himself climbing the steps up to the aeroplane in tempelhof airport and flying out of the bombshattered berlin to the blue sea the wide tagus and a new life in lisbon it was the closest hed come to crying emotional crying as a grown man the next morning was cloudless the landscape on the sixtykilometre drive north of berlin was frozen still and dusted white with an ironhard frost that the low winter sun would never burn off felsens eyeballs felt hot and were cracked with red lines his stomach was burning sour but he still managed to feel some of the heroicism of the night before he parked outside the camp and was admitted through the barbedwire walls into a compound consisting of low wooden huts he was taken into one of these and left alone with four lines of wooden benches time passed hours of it no other visitors came in he sat on the bench and moved with the sunlight coming in through the window to keep warm at lunchtime a female guard came into the room in a grey greatcoat and side cap felsen stood to complain but saw that she was followed by a figure in a striped prison uniform about three sizes too big with a green triangle on the breast pocket the guard sent the shavenheaded prisoner down the benches towards felsen the prisoner marched like a soldier on drill you have ten minutes said the guard felsen was not prepared for this the prisoners appearance was so dislocated from the human beings beyond the barbedwire periphery that he wasnt sure if his language would be the same it took a full halfminute to find the vestiges of eva brucke berlin nightclubowner in the sunken grey papiermache skull he had thought for a moment that this prisoner was going to take him to evablonde whiteskinned and smoking somewhere else in the camp you came she said flatly and sat down next to him he held out his massive hand she folded her shrivelled blackened monkeys paws in her lap he broke off a piece of chocolate she took it whole and swallowed it the chocolate combusted inside her instantly you know she said i used to have dreams about my teeth falling out nightmares people would tell me it was because i was worried about money but i knew it wasnt that ive never cared that much about money not like you i knew that i was petrified of losing my teeth because id seen all those toothless women in villages their faces fallen in their beauty gone their personality diminished i have eight left klaus i am still human what happened to your hands i make uniforms all day every day its the dye she looked at his hand still held out for hers and then at his face she shook her head im going to this is my lunch break klaus she cut in on him savagely give me some more chocolate thats all im interested in not hope not promises and certainly not sentimentality just chocolate he broke off another piece and gave it to her and i wont waste your time either she said i presume youve come for an explanation well you did see me that night in bern that pig lehrer he was such a bad loser i warned you about him didnt i why lehrer i knew him i knew him before you years before he came to all my clubs i was surprised youd never met he asked me one night if i knew anyone who could speak languages and was good at business good at making things happen and it all just fell into place you him and what i was doing you should consider yourself lucky if he hadnt sent you to lisbon youd probably be in dachau it was a solutionlehrer removed you from the scene and my involvement with him meant that people didnt look at me so closely but why didnt you tell me he was angry he looked into her ruined face the prominent craters of her eye sockets the remaining yellow teeth blackened by molten chocolate the veins standing out on her shaved head the scabs from shaving nicks in the down forming over her chinathin cranium and she saw that he was angry more chocolate she said not bothering to answer the question from the man in an ss uniform the man who had been a forderndes mitglied of the ss the man whod made couplings for the ss for gods sake the man who bought wolfram for the ss so that the nazi war machine could thunder on why hadnt she told him he broke off another piece dont think i was being brave klaus it all happened by accident after what happened to those two jewish girls you remember that i told you everything about that didnt i the ones i sent to lehrer and his friend that was a risk me telling you that a risk i did not repeat when i saw she stopped and controlled herself so i moved the other two jewish girls i had out of berlin and that was it i was involved they kept coming to me and i couldnt turn them away id become a link in the chain one more minute said the guard when you saw what asked felsen nothing tell me when i saw that it didnt concern you she said quietly ill speak to lehrer said felsen in a rush so that he didnt have to contemplate what shed just said for too long you dont get it do you klaus it was lehrer who put me in here he got rid of me id become an embarrassment to the obergruppenfuhrer the only person who can get me out of here is the reichsfuhrer himmler himself so dont even think about it more chocolate he gave her the three bars in his pocket and they disappeared into her clothing she got up and he rose with her she stood to attention he took the back of her babys head in the palm of his hand her head jerked back in astonishment and she turned out of his hand and away from him visit terminated said the guard she marched to the door and without looking back straight out into the winter sunshine it was the last he saw of her chapter xx th july hotel riviera genoa n italy felsen lay in bed the windows of his hotel room wide open the sun streaming across the breakfast tray and his body he was exhausted and drowsy as a dog in the village square the hand that held the cigarette weighed twenty kilos he had to drag it off his chest to his mouth he felt himself floating like a barrage balloon just a thin thread of cable tethering him to the earth hed worked for sixteen months solidly with only one break the one break was to let him return to berlin to view the total destruction of neukolln kupplungs unternehmen in the bombing raid of th march speer was not even going to attempt to revive it it was flattened the only reason felsen could think of that lehrer had brought him back for this miserable funeral was to show him what had become of the capital of the third reich from high up in the air it had looked like the same city apart from the various plumes of smoke it was only as the aircraft dropped towards tempelhof airport that he saw that where walls still stood the buildings were skeletal windowless gutted and roofless they provided no accommodation everybody was living underground the city had been turned upsidedowna honeycomb below a catacomb above hed walked through the rubblestrewn streets past the fourteenyearold firefighters still trying to control blazes started several nights earlierthe roads a pasta dish of hoses tornup tram tracks overhead cabling drainage and water pipes their ends wedged shut by overturned buses and burntout trams and walking had been the only option no sbahn no ubahnall the stations were packed with people no fuel hed walked to no prinz albrechtstrasse to ask sturmbannfuhrer otto graf one question which he didnt want to go down a telephone line for a carton of lucky strikes graf had told him that eva brucke had died on the th january when he flew out of berlin that afternoon he could think of no reason for ever going back lehrer had promised him that his job would change but until the end of april he worked exclusively on smuggling wolfram out of portugal it was only at the beginning of may that he began hauling bullion his first transport was to take four trucks containing more than kilos of gold from the swiss border to madrid where it was deposited in the spanish national bank he repeated this twice in june in early july he took his first convoy since the start of the wolfram campaign to portugal and deposited kilos of gold in the vaults of banco de oceano e rocha four hundred and eighty kilos were sold to the banco de portugal to buy escudos the rest was shipped to the banco aleman transatlantico insao paulo brazil then came the battle of the kursk salient and on th august he met lehrer in rome lehrer had lost ten kilos in three months his face was permanently red and not blasted by the sun they went to a restaurant where lehrer chased his food around the plate and consumed two and a half bottles of red wine before starting on the grappa he winced and pushed his fingers into his stomach three or four times during the meal he smoked all his own cigarettes and started on felsens we lost kursk he said i heard said felsen thereve been black days in lisbon the wars finally got there has it said lehrer unpleasantly poser shot himself not in the head i hope said lehrer that wouldnt have killed him what about wolfram fuck wolfram dont you know what kursk means lehrer exploded suddenly outraged so that felsen had to close his fist to keep himself calm kursk means were not a tankled army any more blitzkrieg is over we can never replace the panzers we lost at kursk the soviets have opened a new factory at chelyablinsk ours are being destroyed daily by the allied bombers the red army is kilometres from berlin we dont need wolfram we need a fucking miracle what about for solidcore ammunition speers using something called uranium from a special bomb project theyve had to give up is that the end of wolfram for you yes abrantes can keep that running now your job is to take as much gold bullion out of switzerland as possible and deposit it in spain and portugal youll receive instructions as to what to do with it in the year since that rome meeting felsen had taken nearly two hundred and fifty trucks of bullion from the swiss border to the iberian peninsula from there the bullion was shipped out to banks in argentina uruguay brazil peru and chile during this time felsen became lehrers most trusted subordinate he worked at it as far as he was concerned it wasnt good enough just to be lehrers colleague he had to be nothing short of the mans son by the time salazar proposed a total embargo of all wolfram on ist june felsens success had been total when lehrer and he met now they didnt shake hands they embraced lehrer even allowed himself to get emotional they called each other oswald and klaus for lehrer felsen had become the only piece of solid ground in a europe of chaos a knock on the door jerked felsen off the bed he stubbed out the cigarette and put on a dressing gown he unlocked the door and lehrer pushed in past him with a clothbound roll under his arm and a buff envelope in his hand is the truck loaded klaus he asked the truck was lowered on to the deck of the ss juan garcia at six oclock this morning lehrer leaned the roll up against the wall and put the envelope on the table he helped himself to some of felsens breakfast hed put the weight back on and had got his ulcer under control in the last year im worried he said slurping at the top of the coffee the americans are going to hit us in the french riviera any day now the ships spanish flag and the americans have got other things on their minds whats in the roll lehrers dark eyebrows jumped a rembrandt he said take a look in the envelope felsen emptied the envelope out on to the bed there were photographs and details of lehrer wolff fischer and hanke you know what to do he said papers passports visas for brazil i want you to take a property somewhere close to the border in portugal not in the wolfram mining areas where youre known further south perhaps ive heard its a desert down there the alentejo weve been down there buying cork there are places on the border youd just have to get across the guadiana river said felsen but getting there from berlin there will be chaos believe me and what about the rembrandt itll go with you on the truck youll keep it in the vaults of the banco de oceano e rocha with the gold felsen looked down at the bed the photographs the personal details so this is it oswald the last one have you arranged an escort at tarragona theres no escort nobody must know about this consignment not the spanish and not the portuguese either you want me to smuggle it into portugal you must have smuggled over a thousand tons of wolfram over the years why not two and a half tons of gold and then what you wait how long that i cant say if the fuhrer capitulated it could be tomorrow but he wont he cant why not did you read the documents for this gold consignment read them no i dont read anything any more i just signed them you didnt notice the origin of the three parcels asked lehrer no lublin auschwitz and majdanek polish gold in a manner of speaking i dont follow my star pupil said lehrer shaking his head there are no gold mines in those towns polish national gold was removed from warsaw a long time ago felsen said nothing lisbons been a long way from this war said lehrer nobodys spoken to you about the final solution its not dinnertable conversation in lapa this gold has come from the jews their watches their spectacles their jewellery their teeth their teeth said felsen moving his tongue over his own molars the fuhrer will not capitulate because he knows even in his madness that the world will not accept his systematic annihilation of european jewry we will all have to go down fighting on the th august operation dragoon began with a landing by american troops on the french riviera by that time kilos of jewish dental and jewellery gold and a rolled rembrandt canvas were sitting in the vaults of the banco de oceano e rocha in the rua do ouro in the baixa in lisbon it would take obergruppenfuhrer lehrer another nine months to come and claim them chapter xxi th may quinta das figueiras alentejo portugal the farmhouse was huge and fifteen kilometres from the nearest village on a chassisbreaking track of dried mud and slate nobody came to this place except the odd wandering shepherd to get water from the well in the high summer the house occupied the top of a small rise in a landscape of rolling hills flecked with cork oaks and olive trees the east side of the house overlooked the confluence of the lucefecit and guadiana rivers and there was a large terracotta tiled terrace surrounded by a low wall and seven fig trees it was under these trees that people would sit in the perfect cool and watch the river beyond the walled orange grove disappear into a rocky gorge heading south to the atlantic it was hot not the brutal summer heat which came when someone left the saharas furnace door open but hot enough that after midday the birds fell silent the sheep lowered their heads and gathered under the wide spread of the cork oaks and the guadiana slowed almost to a stop a car could be heard arriving for an hour and the local people would listen because they were rare in these parts felsen and abrantes were driving a threeton truck through a field of bloodred poppies mowing through the blooms up to the rear of the quinta they were carrying two weeks supply of tinned food forty litres of wine in fivelitre flagons a case of brandy a case of port four suitcases of clothes a stack of bed linen and two walther ps which theyd stowed under the drivers seat there was a briefcase between them containing identity papers and passports for four men four densely packed blocks of ioooescudo notes and a velvet bag with twentyfour uncut diamonds felsen was trying to smoke but the truck was bucking so violently over the ruts in the field that he couldnt get the cigarette to his mouth it was pm they reached the beaten earth courtyard at the rear of the quinta and backed the truck up to the kitchen door felsen unlocked it and threw it open the cool of the thickwalled house met him they unloaded the supplies from the truck and drove it into the barn at the side of the house abrantes picked up two terracotta jars to fill from the well felsen took the bed linen further into the cool dark house he crossed the large dining room with its vaulted ceiling and opened up a set of double doors which led into a threemetrewide corridor with eight bedrooms four on either side the windows and shutters were closed in all the rooms with only cracks of intense light around the edges the walls were half a metre thick here too and all the ceilings vaulted felsen dropped linen into four rooms on the east side and the last two rooms on the west side at the end of the wide corridor was a crucifix which he straightened on the wall he felt chill with the sweat of the drive still on him he opened a set of doors from the dining room to the terrace by removing a thick wooden pole inserted into holes within the walls on either side he stood in the middle of the terrace and let the sun warm him through his damp shirt he lit a cigarette and heard a distinct metallic click he turned to find a man he didnt recognize but whom he knew instantly was german standing by the doors with a revolver in his left hand good evening he said i am felsen we havent met the man was bigger than felsen and brutallooking with halfclosed eyelids and a broken nose schmidt he said and smiled laughter came from under the fig trees and a familiar voice schmidt is very security conscious were glad to have him along klaus lehrer hanke and fischer all three of them dressed in collarless shirts black waistcoats and trousers came out from under the thick green fig leaves felsen embraced each of them where is wolff hes here said wolff who appeared alongside schmidt with abrantes in front of him on the end of a mauser i wasnt expecting you for some days said felsen we got away early said lehrer and the men laughed weve spent two nights in the barn has there been any news from germany asked hanke weidling surrendered berlin on may nd jodl surrendered to eisenhower on the seventh and keitel to zhukov the day after wasnt one surrender enough said hanke and the fuhrer asked wolff they think hes dead but there has been some confusion said felsen they havent found a body he will return said wolff and lehrer looked at him sceptically ive bought you new clothes if you would like to change for dinner said felsen no no said lehrer were quite happy as labourers after ten days as priests lets eat weve been starving out here for two days living on unripe figs after dinner they sat in candlelight around the table with the doors open on to the terrace they were all drinking brandy or port except for schmidt who didnt drink but sat with his left hand resting on the revolver and the fingers of his right stroking the break in his nose felsen had distributed the identity papers which they were inspecting in the weak light did schmidt bring photographs asked felsen as if schmidt was out of the room schmidt removed a packet from his waistcoat and threw it down the table that could take me a few weeks to organize said felsen were in no hurry said lehrer were enjoying the peace you have no idea of the chaos we have had to endure the five men nodded solemnly felsen poured more liquor and checked the mens faces to see how this endurance had worn them hankes eyes had cratered deeper into his face his eyebrows had greyed as had the heavy beard on his sunken cheeks fischer had added more ruches to the pouches under his eyes and there were more red tributaries on his raw cheeks which had lost some of their tightness wolff had lost his middleaged youth his blonde hair had thinned on top his eyes had creased and he had two deep lines from his nostrils to the corners of his mouth lehrers head was entirely white the hair cut short and close to his head like a new recruit hed lost weight a lot of it and the unfilled skin hung off his face and below his jaw to his neck curiously his eyebrows were still dark they were all tired but the food and drink had enlivened them so that they now looked like pensioners on a summer jaunt to the local spa they drank until midnight they drank until hanke fischer and wolff staggered off followed by the vigilant schmidt abrantes bored by the germans conversation had turned in at ten oclock lehrer and felsen went out on to the terrace with a hurricane lamp and another bottle of brandy they lit cigars whose smoke lingered before dispersing into the night now faintly perfumed by the vestiges of the orange blossom still on the trees in the walled garden its worked out said lehrer inspecting the coal on the end of his cigar its worked out splendidly thank you klaus you of all people said felsen picking up on the sentimentality have no need to thank me oswald its important to thank people said lehrer swaying a little in his chair you were always very good at showing your appreciation way back in the neukolln kupplungs days thats how i first heard your name thats one of the reasons i chose you and this man schmidt why did you choose him ah yes schmidt was gestapo and a very devout catholic his priest was very important to our plan we came here from the vatican his nerves might draw attention to you he must learn to relax ach i know but its good to have someone to be careful for you its in his nature gestapo men are always suspicious lehrer took a gulp of brandy swilled it around his mouth and swallowed he let his arms drop to his sides dangling the glass and cigar letting the stress pour off him he breathed in the warm night the crickets sawing through their longest shift and the frogs barking their chat like drunkards who never listen or give a damn how long are you going to stay in brazil asked felsen a couple of years said lehrer and then thought about it rolling his cigar between his lips maybe more itll all blow over in a year said felsen people are desperate to get back to normal lehrers head turned slowly in the leaping light from the lamp his eyes black but not shiny as if any health in them had gone for good nothing will be normal again after this war he said they said the same after the last war all those men dead for senseless stretches of mud remember what i said to you about the origin of the gold said lehrer in a voice so tired and quiet he could have been on his deathbed there are other names to be careful of treblinka sobibor belzec kulmhof chelmno in this same quiet voice lehrer gave felsen his final lesson he told him about the rail cars the cattle trucks all joined together by couplings that used to be made in neukolln kupplungs unternehmen he told him about the selections the shower rooms of zyklon b and the ovens he told him numbers the numbers of people in a single cattle truck the numbers of rail cars the numbers tattooed on forearms the numbers that could fit in a shower room the numbers they could put through a crematorium in a day and he told him the names again just so that he would remember ive told you these things said lehrer because this could take as long as five years for the world to forget and during that time any association with the ss will be very dangerous if you are going to stay here and theres no reason why you shouldnt you must keep quiet about these things and when they are mentioned say nothing felsen did just that he smoked his cigar and sipped his drink lehrer got to his feet and shook his history off his shoulders he jammed his hands into his kidneys and stretched back his head to look up at the clear night sky its late he said ive drunk too much and i must sleep take the lamp oswald said felsen youll need it to find your room ive slept well here said lehrer the peace has been magnificent goodnight youll go to bed too in a while im not sleepy yet lehrer hobbled into the house his feet still giving him trouble but not telling him anything any more felsen heard the faint click of the latch as he opened and closed his bedroom door he sat for an hour in the darkness his eyes gradually picking out the leaves of the fig trees the line of the wall and the fields beyond he tuned out the insect noise and listened to the rafters creaking in the cooling roof and to the rhythmic snoring from an open window he crouched under the branches of the fig trees and crawled over the low wall he eased a piece of slate out of the drystone wall and took out a cloth package which contained a bowie knife and another shortbladed knife used for severing the spinal columns of animals it was am he went back into the house and opened the second bedroom door on the west side abrantes was waiting by the open window he handed him the short brutal knife and crossed the corridor to the first bedroom the room was full of fischers snoring the man was lying on his back his neck perfectly displayed felsen drove the blade unhesitatingly in and across the windpipe feeling the tip connect with the vertebrae fischers eyes snapped open his mouth widened to draw in air felsen threw back the covers and jammed the blade up to the hilt under the mans ribs he backed out of the room abrantes whod just delivered hanke to a deeper sleep with a single stab to the cerebral cortex was waiting for him felsen pointed him down to schmidts room at the end of the house felsen pushed against wolffs door and knew that something was wrong the door would only open a crack he rammed his shoulder into it which sent the bed in the room scraping across the floor he squeezed himself through the onefoot space wolff came awake with his hand already enclosed around the butt of his mauser felsen lashed out with his fist and caught him on the side of the neck the blow smacked wolffs head against the whitewashed wall but didnt stop him from loosing off a round which seemed to split the roof open with its colossal roar felsen grabbed the hand holding the mauser and thumped the blade of the bowie knife high into the mans rib cage it went through but only punctured a lung he yanked it out and punched the blade in once more and hit bone and the knife clattered to the floor he tore the gun from wolffs slackening grip wolff grabbed at him and hung on he coughed a splatter of warm blackness into felsens neck and chest felsen fitted the gun barrel into the mans stomach and fired twice the force of the bullets jerked the body but wolff did not release him and they fell on to the bed exhausted as lovers felsen pushed away from him and reeled out into the hall and down towards lehrers room hes not there hissed abrantes across the hall pointing into schmidts empty room the window was open and he wasnt there before or after the shot he wasnt there said abrantes confused find him where hes out there find him suddenly abrantes features crept out of the darkness and into the yellow oily light of a hurricane lamp lehrer stood in front of them in a vest and undershorts he had a walther ppk in his right hand whats going on he asked not groggy with sleep but wide awake and full of his old authority hanke fischer and wolff are dead schmidt is not in his room said felsen without pausing to think and him he asked twitching his gun at abrantes whose short brutal knife was dangling from his hand and you your shirt the front of felsens shirt was black with the blood from wolffs haemorrhage the two men looked at each other lehrers eyes widened with horrific comprehension lehrers gun was pointed at neither man felsen hit it and a bullet ricocheted through schmidts open bedroom door felsen fired wolffs mauser low into lehrers body just to get a round off not bothering to bring the barrel up and get a killing shot in lehrer went down fast with a shout and his gun slithered across the floor the hurricane lamp shattered and the paraffin burst into yellow flame lehrer was foetal holding on to his bloody knee roaring he had flames attached to his ankles shins and shorts felsen stepped over the body and picked up the gun he carried on into lehrers room tore the sheet off the bed and smothered the flames lehrer gritted his teeth and hissed in agony abrantes stood over him the knife in his hand felsen gave him lehrers walther ppk and told him to find schmidt felsen grabbed lehrer under the armpit and hauled him up to the dining room the man shouting out in pain all the way he lit the candles on the table he propped lehrer up on a chair who collapsed across the table gasping one leg was badly burned the flesh blistered and blackened his other leg had a bullet below the kneecap felsen sat opposite him the warm mauser between them he reached for the brandy and two used glasses he filled them and slid one across to lehrer drink it oswald itll get you through the next ten minutes lehrers head came up the sweat of pain and effort peeling down the side of his face tears spreading across his cheeks he drank felsen refilled theres some morphine in my room is there a small leather case by the window theres a syringe and four ampoules whats that for just in case you know felsen didnt move he lit a cigarette i didnt think that with your deep understanding of it youd be afraid of pain by the window a small leather case felsen sat back and smoked lehrer let out rhythmic grunts as if constipated what was the worst thing oswald get me the morphine klaus please tell me the worst thing i cant say what does that mean there were too many or one was too awful i cant i dont know what you mean i just want to know if there was one thing that made you suffer i mean personally just do me the kindness of shooting me klaus im not going to play this not until youve tried felsen lit another cigarette and handed it to lehrer who took it and hid his face in the crook of his elbow like a schoolboy faced with an ugly test ill start you off oswald said felsen taking a gulp of brandy there was a woman who used to be a whore who got some money together and opened a club not much more than a bordello with drinks and bad acts but a popular place with the military because the woman could always find something special for her clients your turn oswald lehrers head came up bewildered to find himself in such a place he knocked the brandy glass over felsen righted it and refilled lehrer tried to get the cigarette into his mouth felsen pushed it in one day she got a telephone call from a gruppenfuhrer in which she was asked to send two jewish girls to an address on the havel they were taken into a beautiful highceilinged room with a view over the lake from tall windows there were two officers in there the gruppenfuhrer and his superior the girls were told to strip naked and then to put their coats back on the gruppenfuhrers superior pinned a star of david on each lapel do you remember this oswald lehrer said nothing the cigarette smoked in his lips the sweat continued the girls were given a horsewhip each and told to administer a beating on the the bare buttocks of the superior officer they were young girls and not very strong and the horsewhips were too short so they were given canes instead after theyd laid stripes across the officers arse they were told to kneel down and still with his trousers around his ankles the ss officer shot them both in the head is this true asked lehrer as if hed dreamt it you were there you saw it you told eva you had to tell her what had happened to her girls thats why she started harbouring illegals thats why the gestapo called one day hah said lehrer leaning into the candlelight thats what this is all about eva brucke youre a sentimental one after all arent you klaus you had her arrested schmidt told me what she was doing i had no choice in the matter is that true asked felsen you dont have to justify what youre doing said lehrer you dont have to try and ennoble your actions with some sentimental cause shoot me and take the gold klaus you deserve it you outplayed me i chose too wisely and too well they sat there for a few more minutes in silence felsen not quite satisfied wanting to draw something more from the situation lehrer stared into the wavering light of the candle and smoked another cigarette a shot broke open the night the echo cracked over the terrace felsen picked up the mauser and walked around the table he bent over lehrer like a solicitous waiter he put an arm around him and lifted him up lehrer hooked an arm around felsens neck they walked out into the cool night across the terrace past the thick rough green leaves of the fig tree through the break in the wall across a rutted track and out into a field of grass and wild flowers which were closed up for the night after barely fifty yards lehrers legs gave way and felsen lowered him to the ground he lay on his side panting and blinking like a wounded animal which has retreated into itself felsen put the barrel to lehrers temple and fired once the gun kicked back the jolt ran through the body and there was a sharp cough as if there had been something inside that couldnt wait to get out felsen walked back to the house with a predawn freshness in his nostrils abrantes was waiting for him drinking brandy his face dirty and sweating you found schmidt said felsen abrantes nodded where was he down by the river you shot him hes in the river i weighed him down with rocks felsen went out to the truck and came back with a mattock and a shovel in the dining room he gave the mattock to abrantes and drank brandy from the neck of the bottle abrantes spat on his hands they walked out across the terrace with the first light turning the darkness part two chapter xxii saturday th june rua actor taborda estefania lisbon it had been dark in the teachers apartment the evening had felt more advanced than it really was i crossed the largo dona estefania with neptune riding his two dolphins to eternity in the fountain and headed for rua almirante reis and the arroios metro station the streets were empty and there was no traffic the tall trees were still in the evening heat there wasnt a single child in the arroios park not even a couple of old boys playing cards just pigeons it was as if the population knew something i didnt and had skipped town i telephoned carlos who wasnt there and left a message that i was going to the alfama to speak to jamie gallacher i peeled my jacket off and walked the silent blue mosaicked corridor into the deserted metro station and waited fifteen minutes in the striplit tunnel music was playing faintly on the sound system i couldnt pick it up and it was broken anyway by the thunder and hiss of a train heading north i thought about meeting luisa madrugada under different circumstances but none of my conversations with her got very far because the only thing i wanted to do was go back to the darkened room in her apartment with all its intimate possibilities what would a different woman be like after eighteen years a different smell shampoo perfume sweat wind thumped in the tunnel pushing out the smell of burnt brake linings as i got into the empty compartment the music became more distinct it was al green and it was absurd because he was singing im so tired of being alone why do these things happen i looked at my blurred reflection two images slightly different laid over each other until the door shut leaving a single sharp outline of my new face i got off the metro at martim moniz and took a number tram full of spanish tourists all talking as if they were due to go on a trappists retreat for a month the next day the tram groaned up the steep hill bored to death i got off early and walked to the largo das portas do sol to catch the breeze and a beer perhaps and to look out across the red roofs of the alfama to the blue tagus wide as a sea at this point the spanish herd followed me and sat down at the cafe that id wanted to and ordered fifty drinks between them the barman soaked up the order without changing his expression i retraced my steps and followed the rua das escolas gerais around the corner and dropped into the medina of alleyways that made up the alfama the old arab quarter wasnt smelling so fresh after the night ofsanto antonio after a night when half a million sardines have been grilled and consumed jamie gallacher lived just off the beco do vigario above a barbers shop in which an old boy was having his weekly shave lying down on an old black leather hydraulic chair a crewcut kid stood beside him taking an interest and the old guy ran his hand down the boys shirt reminding himself what it felt like to be young i walked up a narrow staircase barely wide enough for my shoulders and knocked on the only door at the top it took some time for jamie gallacher to open it he was unshaved with hair like an exploded mattress he was wearing a wrinkled and faded led zeppelin tshirt and a pair of ruckedup boxer shorts gathered in a twist around his crotch he had a joint unlit in his left hand yeah he said in english with a very slight scottish inflection one eye gummed up who are you police i said and showed him my id he cupped the joint ungummed his eye youd better come in he said polite apologetic sorry about the mess bit of a session last night every surface in the room was covered with empty bottles of wine and beer plastic cups and glasses stuffed with cigarette butts piled ashtrays and empty packs of cigarettes pictures nosedived down the walls the carpet was freshly stained a kitten nosed through the debris looking for something nonalcoholic ill get dressed be with you in a sec he scooped up the kitten and left the room voices started up further in the apartment i followed him to a door in the corridor open three inches a naked girl with a mass of frizzy hair was sitting crosslegged on a mattress on the floor she was rolling a joint and looking unconcerned slowly a black foot appeared in her lap and the toe rubbed up against her pubic hair she breathed in sharply for fucks sake said jamie and ripped open the door the owner of the black foot was slumped across the mattress eyes halfclosed the girl stroked the black leg jamie slammed the door shut behind him fucking people friends of yours i asked in english cant even sleep in my own bed without strangers fucking in there all day and night we went back into the living room jamie searched the ashtrays for a usable

his cheek with a nail in the bathroom she knelt on the toilet seat im not proud of it inspector but you have to know and there it is you were seen leaving the school with catarina sousa oliveira

what is all this catarinas dead mr gallacher she was murdered yesterday afternoon about six oclock and i want to find out whether you did it he didnt look as if hed done it he looked as if a trapdoor had just opened up underneath him and he was on his way down into the abyss when he stood his legs were shaking what about those two in there he asked theyre leaving i went into the corridor and threw open the door the black guy was lying collapsed on his back still breathing heavily slick with sweat in the airless room the girl lay facedown with her legs apart i kicked their clothes at them the girl twisted round her cheeks flushed her eyes unfocused you two out chapter xxiii th april abrantes office banco de oceano e rocha rua do ouro baixa lisbon absinthe eats the brain said abrantes abrantes suddenly knowing everything about everything these days full of his success in the lisbon business fraternity felsen took another sip of the green liquid in his glass and watched the platoons of black umbrellas in the rainlashed street below it was ten oclock in the morning and the second absinthe of the day felsen fingered his head wondering where the rot would start and why abrantes had dragged him out of his apartment before lunch felsen had been back from africa for two weeks having spent most of the last decade out there setting up branches of the bank in luanda angola and lourenco marques in mozambique he was at a low point as he always was whenever he set foot back in europe and its unfolding history berlin had been isolated by the reds the iron curtain was rusting into place across the middle of the continent and the whole of the iberian peninsula was as good as cut off and adrift out in the atlantic with salazar and franco madmen on the bridge flying their oldfashioned fascist flags the great empires were breaking up the british lost india the french lost morocco tunisia and indochina culminating in the humiliation of dien bien phu in may last year world power transferred to the americans while europeans contemplated their own nations bleakened by the expense of war their nails torn and bloody from the last desperate attempt to hold on to world domination to felsen the whole place had the stink of death about it the rotten odour of decline and to keep that stench out of his nostrils during the second coffee of the morning hed let the absinthe trickle greenly into his glass after the war the allies had moved into portugal the americans had set up shop in the nazi legations old palacio in lapa but felsen and abrantes had been lucky their wolfram mines had been sealed but wolfram had little value their stocks of cork olive oil and canned sardines had been confiscated because they were perceived as future german goods but the bank with its curious management structure had survived several attempts at having its assets frozen by the men in dark suits sent by the allies it was abrantes connections in the salazar government that had saved them as the war ended construction boomed in portugal and abrantes was there sitting at the table knowing nothing about building but everything about graft officials in the ministry of public works received plots of land and had houses built for them their sons earned jobs they didnt deserve planners and municipal architects in lisbon town hall the mayor all suddenly began to find life more affordable the banco de oceano e rocha developed a property company a construction arm eased projects towards friends and earned protection from the highest offices in government and the gold was still there ten metres below felsens feet sitting in the underground vaults with the traffic on the rua do ouro thundering above it abrantes sat over his third small halfcup of tar of the morning he drank these until he moved his bowels which normally happened around number five or six after a successful movement hed take an anis after a poor one more coffee he smoked cigars now they too seemed to help loosen his guts constipation a problem since hed moved away from the beira to worry at a desk and eat too much meat havent they finished that house of yours yet he asked felsen knowing they had i suppose you need my apartment for one of your mistresses said felsen turning away from the window quick to find the acid that morning abrantes sucked on his cigar knowing something felsen didnt he stared up at the ceiling looking for inspiration a stain was developing up there after the winter rains and these april showers it was fat and broad at the corner where a crack ran through it like a river and tapered off to something like argentina and tierra del fuego close to the ceiling rose have you thought any more about brazil asked abrantes you can have the apartment joaquim said felsen ill move out really theres no problem they grinned at each other brazils a natural step said abrantes maybe we should have gone there first the brazilians they we didnt know anybody we still dont ah said abrantes and took a flamboyant drag of his cigar enjoying himself grinding felsen down he blew the smoke out extravagantly tell me said felsen bored you were always the german who spoke portuguese with a brazilian accent thats how i first heard about you i told you about that a brazilian girl in berlin taught me susana lopes said abrantes wasnt that her name an image flashed in felsens brainsusana hooking her legs over the back of his knees and pressing her pubis down on to him he cleared his throat his penis lumbered in his trousers did i tell you about her said felsen abrantes shook his head were getting to it now thought felsen i dont think i told you her name even i had a phone call last night susana lopes looking for her old friend klaus felsen who shed heard had become a director of the banco de oceano e rocha felsens heart leapt forward and he had to press himself back into the chair where is she a very charming woman said abrantes toying with his cigar clipper shes here he said possibilities suddenly opening up we talked about brazil did i tell you how i met her no she did said abrantes she was a girl in a club felsen faltered as a huge chunk of complex history broke off the glacier of his memory and crashed into his mind those kind of girls know everybody said abrantes what said felsen still midavalanche she seems to have done well over there she owns a beachside club on an estate outsidesao paulo place called guaruja you covered some ground said felsen cooling to him now theyre different to us the brazilians they like to talk have fun they always look ahead the portuguese well you know the portuguese he said flapping his hand at the squally weather the dark street the stain blooming across the ceiling to the size of russia felsen sat back not wanting to give abrantes any more sport his partner saw it was over i said youd meet her for lunch in estoril hotel palacio felsen sat in the dining room of the hotel palacio he was wearing a powderblue suit and a yellow silk tie the light outside darkened and brightened as clouds crashed across the clearing sky bringing showers which dashed through the gardens and wrestled with the palm trees in the square he was feeling sick then hungry then sick again his life came back to him in waves in big thumping atlantic rollers he gulped back another glass of white wine and reached for the bottle in the ice bucket already threequarters gone he ordered another felsen watched the diners arrive watched all the women settle into their chairs until he found one who just kept coming and coming at him she was taller than he remembered her youth had gonethe long black shiny hair was cut short the whippy slenderness of a girl in her late teens had filled out but had been replaced by what an american would have called class she wore a figurehugging crisp white squarenecked dress which looked as if it had some material in it and her nyloned thighs swished like a mating call male heads strained to keep their eyes from drifting over to her susana knew the effect she was having shed designed it but there was only so much time shed allow a man to get his slack jaw working well she said and cutlery resumed on china felsen got to his feet the waiter appeared with another bottle of wine they danced around each other kissed sat manoeuvred closer how longs it been asked felsen at a loss for a moment fifteen years no no sixteen i think he said and was annoyed at himself for being so german about it he held up his glass they chinked and drank without taking their eyes off each other my partner says youre a big success he said thats only what i told him you look successful ive just been to paris and bought some clothes that proves something ive been lucky she said ive had good friends rich men who wanted somewhere to go to get away from their wives i learnt a lot in berlin she said from eva eva taught me everything i needed to know do you still see her the name shot past him like a wild animal in the night leaving him stunned shaky the dining room darkened rain raked the windows turning heads in the room she died in the war he said blurting it a little sinking his face into the wine susana shook her head we heard about the bombing you got out just in time said felsen the waiter laid a bread roll on her side plate with a pair of silver tongs so what did you learn from eva what men want she said and left it at that so that felsen began to think that shed learnt other things from eva like leaving things unsaid it excited him the waiter gave them the menus they ordered instantly you lost your brazilian accent said susana ive been in africa doing what the bank minerals logging you should come to brazil youre not in brazil yet are you were thinking about it well ill be there if you need any help with your friends he said and she smiled at him without volunteering what he wanted to know the soup arrived a crab bisque they sipped through it the wind shuddered against the dining room windows and the rain thrashed the petals off the roses in the gardens i wanted to ask you he said if you ever came across someone called lehrer in berlin oswald lehrer she put her glass down the waiter removed the soup plates i didnt like him she said looking above his head he had very unpleasant tastes he gave me a job down here in the war he knew i spoke portuguese that was lehrers way she said he always liked to know everything a piece of turbot in a white sauce appeared in front of her a swordfish steak before felsen felsen found himself wanting to smoke drink eat and everything else humanly possible susana opened up her fish felsen tore a roll apart theyd touched on all their history each point with its pain and pleasure he felt welded to her in spots youre looking good susana he said confirming his notion out loud even after two children she said looking to see how he took it a mother he said but not a wife she said and you he laid down his cutlery and opened his hands i didnt think so she said and why not a powderblue suit and a yellow tie doesnt say daddy to me he smiled she laughed the sun came up in the room like theatre lights zoomed to the maximum they ordered more wine and talked about her two children who were with her mother insao paulo she didnt elaborate on the absent father they took coffee in another part of the hotel and felsen smoked one of the slim tancoloured cheroots which susana preferred they went wordlessly up to her room she unlocked the door they kissed her hand went to the front of his trousers firm expert gripping felsen stripped and was naked before shed stepped out of her underwear he fell on her her suspendered thighs rasped on his they made love with only marginally less urgency than they had done sixteen years ago the only differenceafter felsen had come shuddering to a haltshe pushed his head down into her lap and drew him to her he wasnt sure about it he hadnt done that before he didnt like it but she held him there until he felt her trembling in his hands susana had a week left of her stay shed wanted to go to berlin but couldnt get a visa and that had left her with spare time in lisbon they spent most of the week together felsen moved into her room at the hotel palacio for the duration they spent the time driving out to his house the westernmost house on mainland europeonly heather gorse the cliffs and the lighthouse at cabo da roca between it and the ocean they walked through the empty rooms which still smelled of paint and the musty humidity of drying plaster they bought two chairs and sat in the enclosed terrace on the roof and drank brandy and watched the storms out at sea the deranged clouds and the bloodorange sunsets they talked they renamed the housecasa ao fim do mundohouse at the end of the world together they furnished the house from the contents sale of an old palacio on the serra da sintra susana bidding wildly for a pair of old rosecoloured divans which they christened the next afternoon and lay under rough blankets telling each other their own plans and then eventually making one together felsen bought a ticket on the same plane tosao paulo he spent an afternoon talking things through with abrantes about the opening of thesao paulo branch how susana would introduce him to her friends get the business started the three of them had lunch the next day abrantes on one side of the table impressed by susana and nearly jealous of felsen on the day of the flight felsen woke with a teakhard erection and his head full of the future he pressed himself against susana and felt her stiffen she rolled he grinned over the monolith she flicked the tip the menhir toppled i came on in the night she said were going to be late the luggage was enough to make the bellhop straighten his cap felsen went down to pay the bill which was enormous and came on several pages he wrote a cheque with his mind on other things they sent the luggage in one taxi and followed in another it was a bright clear blustery day and the sea by the marginal was deep blue and whitecapped they didnt speak susana looked out of the window felsen drummed the upholstery still smarting slightly from the mornings rejection at the airport felsen organized a porter for the luggage susana paced around in tight geometry her heels nervous on the pavement they joined the queue at the checkin desk susana gave felsen her passport and went to find the ladies room felsen flicked through her passport checked her photo one taken a few years ago the hair longer the eyebrows denser unplucked he riffled the pages a paper fell out which he picked up it was a ticket stub for a return internal flight frankfurtmunichfrankfurt dated th march just over three weeks earlier felsen turned over the stub there was a telephone number written on the back not a local one he went back to the passport and found the german visa and an entry stamp for the th march in frankfurt there was an exit stamp from lisbon next to it and below it the stamps for the return dated th april on another page were the exit and entry stamps out ofsao paulo and into lisbon dated th march there were no other stamps there was no french visa he looked at the telephone number again thinking quicker than he had done for a month he took out the hotel bill and noticed this time the colossal amount of the telephone bill he turned the pages seven calls had been made to a number which matched the one on the ticket stub he went to one of the airline offices and asked to use the telephone he called the operator and gave her the number and asked where it came from she told him immediately that it was a brazilian number and after a minute that it came from a town called curitiba his chest suddenly felt as a cold as a cathedral susana appeared next to the luggage looking around for him he crossed the highly polished floor on stiff legs his thigh muscles feeling weak and cold susana asked if anything was the matter he shook his head they checked in the flight was delayed until three in the afternoon susana fumed silently as she reclaimed her passport and boarding card they went to the restaurant and sat opposite each other the place was as crowded as felsens head he ordered wine and looked out of the window as the four propeller engines of a cargo plane started up with a clatter followed by a long unending howl the wine was poured into the palpable silence between them susana looked around aware that the presence in front of her was not where she wanted her eyes to rest felsen relaxed his shoulders down from around his ears leaned back saude he said raising his glass forcing some lightness she matched him i never asked he said lighting a cigarette how you found me by accident she said i was looking for the number of a friend of mine whose surname is felizardo yours was underneath i didnt think it would be you but i called anyway there was no answer the next day i was in lisbon i went to the address and found your apartment above the bank my friends father knew who you were when i came back to lisbon after my trip with my extra week i called againthis time the bank they put me through to your partner he nodded through the plausibility the lengthy wellthoughtout plausibility but you didnt go to paris did you is this she paused an interrogation he laid the ticket stub out in front of her i was in germany she said coolly eyes sliding to the right that number on the back said felsen comes from curitiba in brazil youve called that number every day since weve been in the palacio whose is it your friends my family a different one to your mother and children insao paulo the waiter came and reared away from felsen whod shown him the back of his hand yes she said defiant now teeth gritted behind her lips you never showed me any photographs of your children he said and lunged at her purse she snatched it away from him you didnt ask im asking now she tore out two photographs and held them to his face for a fraction of a second the boy was dark brazilianlooking but the girl although darkskinned had blonde hair and blue eyes susanas mouth was bent into a sneer ive heard of curitiba said felsen theres a very large german community there i know what theyd have been doing just three days ago in fact the th of april every year the fuhrers birthday they raise the flag who sent you susana she didnt answer i cant think of anybody who would know about me except perhaps odessa they might have have had the resources the information the organisation der ssangehorigen was it them susana the most important thing i learnt from eva she said sitting back chin up the contempt radiating out of her was that klaus felsen only ever thinks with his big stupid swabian cock that cut him right through and he hit her for saying it he slapped her across her face with his big open hand it went off like a tyre blowout and everybody looked out of the window susana wheeled out of her chair and came up with the mark of his hand on her cheek her eyes were fixed and dark flashing with anger an intensity of hate she muttered something at him hed have liked to smack her again so raw was his humiliation but the eyes of the restaurant were on them now he turned and went to retrieve his luggage st july abrantes apartment rua do ouro baixa lisbon portugal maria abrantes sat at the arm end of the chaise longue in a blue pencil skirt and a white blouse with the suit jacket open she had a tight string of pearls at her throat which was red with anger right up to her earlobes and had infected her cheeks too she smoked and listened as she had been doing for the last threequarters of an hour crossing uncrossing and recrossing her legs once every three or four minutes waiting for what was going on in the next room to come to an end shed thought that it was over three times already and had braced herself tightened her mouth and clenched her fist but each time it had resumed and shed breathe in a slow deep breath through her nose and unlock her jaws in the hand that wasnt smoking she held a card of the type distributed by tobacco kiosks for the last ten or fifteen years she tapped the arm of the chaise longue with it the card was a photograph of an actress who called herself pica but whose real name was arlinda monteiro maria looked at the card for the hundredth timepica the dyed blonde with large glossed lips trying to look american she straightened her own true blonde hair as if it conferred a higher status the bedroom door opened a crack and shut maria abrantes foot started nodding and stopped the bedroom door was flung open with a laugh and pica with her head thrown back over her shoulder came into the living room her high heels were strict with the wooden floor she didnt see maria at first but the bristling presence in the room slowed her heels progress when she did see her the heels took four little steps back and her shoulder hit the closed half of the double doors to the bedroom she glanced into the bedroom and lengthened her neck to muster some dramaclass dignity she tilted her jaw and resumed her passage across the bare wooden floor swinging her white handbag from her left hand puta said maria abrantes quietly the word thudded into the actresss back and turned her round her bosom inflated maria abrantes was hoping for a spew of abuse but the hatchet shed set her face into must have been too sharp the actress only managed the kind of hiss she must have heard from the back stalls on a slow weekday night joaquim abrantes appeared at the bedroom door sensing wildlife in his living room he was in the grey trousers from a suit a white shirt with cuffs already linked up and a silk tie in his hands which maria had never seen before what are you doing here he asked pica turned her heels rapped the floorboards and the apartment door opened with a gust of wind and closed gunshot loud abrantes slowly made up his tie and stretched his neck free of his collar everything maria had rehearsed scrambled and fled from her mind leaving neat spite and no words i thought you said you were going to be in estoril today said joaquim abrantes who left the doorway went into the bedroom and came back in a grey suit jacket i was she started what brought you back into the city he asked performing as if pica had never been in the apartment shopping he took a seat in front of her and shot his cuffs he opened a silver box on the table and removed a cigarette which he tapped on the lid he lit it and sat back inhaling the smoke grossly into his snarling mouth it maddened her no it wasnt shopping she said oh it was because i cant stand any more talk in estoril about the whores youre entertaining down here they talk in estoril about whores down here i dont think so they do they might not call them putas they might call them actresses maybe but theyre paid in presents and dinners just as surely as the whores at the docks get cash abrantes wondered whod helped her rehearse that he didnt think those words were her own in the cafes of estoril they might see tie parisian cut of her suits the american nylons the millinery in from london but he saw a girl from the beira with an urn of water on her head and you he asked the imitation lisboeta making him cruel im your wife she shouted and flung the kiosk card of pica in his lap he picked up the card checked it and snapped it down on the table next to him he gave her a flat level stare with dull black onyx eyes she froze and corrected herself im the mother of your children your two sons she said thinking this would weaken him but this time it didnt ive had some news he said from the beira two weeks ago two weeks ago she repeated automatically a strange darkness settling on her like the shadow on an xrayed lung my wife died your wife she said momentarily confused dont repeat everything i say i know what im saying my wife died you remember her dont you she did the old hag on the hill whod been moved out for her she nodded she died said abrantes do you understand i understand she said the realization creeping up her like hemlock i am going to marry again he said getting to his feet and walking away from her ill be announcing my intention to marry senhora monteiro at the end of this week she yelled something at him which was incoherent it turned him the large slow head blacker than a bulls inside and me she shrieked what about me you will continue to look after the boys in estoril like a nanny she said leaping to her feet like an english nanny youre their mother he said icily they need you and youre their father she yelled stamping her foot and we the words stopped there were no more inside abrantes saw a flit of pure malevolence behind her eyes she was puce her fists clenched by her hips he thought he might have to slap her to bring her out of this little fit and took two steps towards her for the purpose you remember christmas she asked and he stopped midstride no he said weighing his hand you were out selling your wolfram across the border when senhor felsen came back early and caught you how would you know this you were still a child then you were trying to cheat him i knew that much and so did he i saw him waiting for you all day furious she said slowing down now to deliver but he cheated you too cheated me he raped me in our bed that night and the night after and it she saw what it did to him she saw that momentary selfpitying shallowness in his eyes and the muscles in his face slackening punched silly by her words she felt suddenly strong too strong because she was enjoying herself she leaned her face out at him manuel is not your son she said quietly and laughed the emotion in the room too high for her the giggle grated over her larynx like claws screeching down glass abrantes head lowered his eyes blinkered by his thick forehead the big spaces in his head were suddenly filled and directed his fist came up slowly and then snapped into her face her nose crunched she felt the splintering of it in the bones of her face and cranium warm thick blood spread in a fast gush over her lips the metallic taste creeping into her mouth she fell flat on her bottom her head kicked back into the arm of the chaise longue stunning her a wide cravat of red opened down her blouse she felt another blow coming and managed to get her hands up abrantes fist slammed the back of her own hand into her mouth taking her two front teeth with it and shattering her knuckles she fell sideways choking and saw the blood pool out and soak into the edge of the carpet youre going back to the beira and live with the pigs chapter xxiv saturday th june alfama lisbon i arranged for a car to pick us up i let jamie gallacher buy cigarettes and he smoked all the way to the policia judiciaria and played with the door lock until the driver couldnt take it any longer i hadnt let him wash or shave he was still in the creased tshirt and beerstained jeans but with a brandnew pair of nikes on his feet which might not be his for very much longer in the tacos which is what i had in mind for him after hed made his statement it wasnt that i didnt believe him it was that i didnt like him the big dark car possibility coincided with the way my thoughts were leaning that a creep had turned up after valentim and bruno after jamie gallacher and had sodomized her and killed her for being someone out there who knew the type of person he really was it felt right too that the victim had had a spat and stormed off it could happen to girlsthey got emotional became vulnerable and that was when a creep might pick them off and rape or kill them ive seen them not many of them lisbons not a violent city theyre cruel these creeps they offer comforta hug a stroke a little kiss a small squeeze an ugly grab and then mayhem it was possible that the driver of the big dark car knew her already maybe hed been waiting outside the school seen gallacher hit her and moved in my stomach was telling me things the only problem was that it had been telling me things since id been in luisa madrugadas apartment jamie gallacher made his statement and i sent him down he protested telling me he had to teach on monday morning youre under suspicion of murder mr gallacher youve admitted to a sexual relationship with an underage girl who was one of your pupils i told him i can keep you in a police cell for a year without charge while i carry out my investigations this is portugal its our system of law youre guilty until proven innocent have a nice weekend carlos had the search warrant we drove out to odivelas it was getting late now but i had to see the tick opened the door and read the warrant through he took it to valentims mother she sat at the kitchen table smoking facing away from the television in the next room which showed fat people pretending to be rich and trying to be funny with no success the tick sucked on a bottle of sagres she looked up redeyed the sockets blackened by mascara lipstick worn off her voice was thick with saliva from drink and tears where do you want to start she asked just his room is it locked she shrugged the tick nodded key the tick shook his head the tick knew everything i turned the door handle down and leaned into it it cracked open easily the door too small for the frame i started at one end of the room carlos at the other he gave me a pair of surgical gloves and snapped into a pair himself he was methodical careful i knew he would be he went through every page of every book treating each one as if it was his own he did the same with the sheet music i went through the bedside locker there was nothing unusual in the drawer the cupboard contained spiralbound exercise books which were full of notes from academic books i leafed through them carlos slid under the bed with a pen torch in his mouth a few moments later he grunted and came out with a key with a plastic tag it had d written on it we bagged it and left the room find what you want asked the mother i asked them if the key meant anything to them the tick shook his head but he knew the woman looked down at the ashtray in front of her the strap of her bra down her shoulder we sat in the car and held the key up to the street lighting what do you think asked carlos garage maybe the car possibly or just somewhere to keep his things private a face appeared at the window on carlos side the tick out for more blood you want to know which door that key opens you dont like him do you i said little piece of shit get in the tick took us on a short drive of less than two kilometres into a light industrial zone with small warehouses workshops for panelbeating car repairs foamrubber furniture makers and other low capital businesses unit d was the size of a double garage with a large door for shipping and delivery and a small door for the office it was a cheap place if you werent a student and this was how you made your money i tried the key it fitted and turned i pulled it out youre not going in asked the tick not without a search warrant im not going to tell i dont give a shit i said if theres something in there i dont want to risk not being able to use it and i dont know what your game is either maybe youll change sides we dropped the tick at a bar close to the apartment block he went in there and hooked his buttock up on a stool and flicked his finger for a beer we drove back to saldanha and did the paperwork for the key carlos was sulking so i took him across the road and bought him a beer in the only place open the city dead on its feet around here after a long week and the heat we sat in silence under the glare of neon and sipped super bock with our jackets hooked over the chair backs the barman was watching football i asked him the score not that interested zerozero he said barely listening you can watch that stuff all year round now i said no answer i turned back to carlos who was weighing things in his head you speak english like an englishman said carlos was there for four and half years four and a quarter of them in the pub i said i only spoke to my wife in english and i still use it with olivia you didnt tell me why you were in england i lit a cigarette and gave him a direct look arent you tired i asked somethings got to happen while i drink this beer you dont want to talk about football i dont know anything about football shit said the barman we looked up in time to see the ball sailing into the stands my father was in the army you know that already he was serving in guinea fighting those good old colonial wars under general spinola maybe you know this too carry on they were unwinnable wars guys your age were getting killed every day for no very good reason other than that salazar wanted to be an emperor general spinola had a brilliant and unconventional idea rather than killing people in order to make them portuguese citizens why not be nice to them he decided to wage what was called a hearts and minds war he improved medical care education supplied books that kind of thing and suddenly the africans loved him and the rebels lost their cause it meant that my fathers men didnt get killed any more and it also made him a big spinola fan carlos sat back a little resistance building already it made me feel tired so after the revolution after the euphoria had worn off when portugal was a seething mass of dozens of different political parties and agendas with the communists cornering a fair amount of the functionary power my father decided that his old pal spinolas solution to the problem of this chaos was the right one a second coup said carlos exactly and as you know it was uncovered and my father had to get out fast he had friends in london so we moved there thats it he should have been shot said carlos into his beer what was that i said your father he should have been shot thats what i thought you said thered been a revolution the democratic process was in hand chaotically in hand i agree but thats the process what it didnt need was another coup and the installation of a military dictatorship i think without absolutely any doubt at all that your father and all the rest of them should have been shot it had been a long day and a hot one id had a beer on an empty stomach id spent a day having my new exposed face read by people who didnt know me there were all sorts of reasons why hearing this kid calmly condemning my father my dead father to death well it brought something out in me that hadnt been aired for some time to use an english expressioni lost it id never been sure what the it had been until then now i know its the control that makes us human i lashed out claws exposed for once i slammed my fists down on the table the two beers jumped and hit the deck the barman braced himself against the steel counter who the fuck do you think you are i roared are you the prosecutor jury and judge rolled into one you werent even out of your nappies when all this happened you didnt even have your own teeth you didnt know my father and you have no fucking idea what its like to live under a fascist dictatorship to see men getting killed to see them saved by the ideas of one man to see your country dropped in the shit by a bunch of powerseeking selfaggrandizing bastards so who the fuck do you think you are condemning men to death youre the whole bloody reason this kind of shit happens in the first place carlos tipped back on his chair and saved himself on the front window beer down his shirt and trousers but his face calm impassive not cowed and you think thats part of the democratic process do you to get back into your tanks and drive down the avenida da liberdade you think thats the proper way to address political differences in a modern world maybe they should have shot you as well i went for him crashed straight through the table tripped over it cut my hand on some broken glass slipped on the beer got back on to my feet lunged at him and found myself connecting with the fat porky shoulder of the barman who must have seen this sort of thing happen before and had vaulted his hundred kilos over the bar faster than a chinese gymnast he grabbed my flailing arms filho da puta i roared cabrao carlos shouted back i lunged at him again taking the barman with me and we all went down in a pile by the glass door of the bar god knows what anybody would have made of it from the outside looking inanother football argument that had got out of hand the barman got to his feet first he kicked carlos out into the night and hauled me away to the toilets at the back of the bar i sat down shaking blood streaming down my wrist soaking into my shirt cuff i washed the wound out in the sink the barman gave me some napkins never in my life said the barman have i seen you like that never he went back behind his counter i picked my jacket up and opened the door shit said the barman back at the tv how did it get to be i crossed the road to the policia judiciaria building and did some firstaid on my hand i drove home my blood still fierce rocketing around my system with bigger and better arguments ripping though my brain i was approaching a choppy version of calm by the time i parked up in paco de arcos and walked to the house olivia was out and the door locked i searched my pockets for the keys inspector said a female voice behind me teresa oliveira the lawyers wife was standing a couple of metres down the street looking different her hair tied back and wearing jeans and a red tshirt with the word guess on the front i tried to summon some gentleness from the corner of my brain where it was still cowering is this important dona oliveira i asked its been a long day and i dont have any news for you im afraid it wont take long she said but i thought it might we went into the kitchen i drank some water she upset herself over my bloody shirt i changed and offered her a drink she went for coke the medication you understand she felt the need to explain i poured myself a glass of whisky from an old bottle of william lawsons that hadnt seen the light for the last six months ive left my husband inspector she said and i lit a cigarette was that wise i asked they say its better not to make traumatic changes immediately after a tragedy you might have realized that its been coming for some time i nodded without commenting she fumbled in her bag for her own cigarettes and lighter between us we got one going for her it never worked right from the start it didnt work she said referring to her marriage how long ago was that fifteen years thats a long time for a marriage not to be working i said looking for angles here and seeing none it suited us to keep it going and now youre leaving him i said and shrugged was your daughters death the catalyst no she said flatly the hand with the cigarette shaking so badly she had to hold it with the other he was abusing her sexually her coke fizzed in its glass now were getting to it thats a very serious allegation i said if youre going to make a formal complaint i would suggest you get a lawyer on your side and establish some strong evidence and if its true it could also have an impact on my murder enquiry but i am not the person you should be talking to i laid it out for her so that she knew i knew it is true she said feeling stronger the maid will corroborate it how long had this been going on for five years that i know of with you tolerating it her hand still shook as the cigarette went to her mouth my husband has always been a powerful man both publicly and privately he extended that power into his relationships with me and his children was that the attraction in the first place i never went for men my own age she shrugged my father died when i was young maybe that was it you were twentyone when i was only ever interested in established men she cut in and he took an interest in me he can be very charming i was flattered how did you meet i worked for him i was his secretary so you know everything there is to know about him i used to know she said when i was his secretary as you might know wives are not so well informed so you dont know who these few clients are hes working for now

limitada very big people i said do you think you your maid and whatever lawyer you can find for the money are up to taking on this kind of person i dont know she said her thumb flickering over the filter of her cigarette is that why you came here tonight she looked up with charcoalsmudged eyes in deep sockets her face not puffy as it had been in the morning gravity taking over from fluid retention im not sure what you mean by that i have my work cut out for me in this case already dona oliveira i said shying away from a small but unpleasant truth your daughter was very promiscuous wouldnt you expect that from a girl whod been abused she said getting a handkerchief out and wiping her eyes the behaviours been noticed in girls who havent been abused i said but thats your point not mine as the days gone on weve discovered that shes had sex with your exlover and shes had sex with two boys from the band in a group session in a pensao in rua da gloria the landlord of that roomsbythehour pensao had seen her before on friday lunchtimes with other men who he thinks were paying customers and ive just finished interviewing one of her teachers who had a sixmonth involvement with her catarina could have gone with anybody and ive got to the point in my investigation where i need some luck to move it on i know all that she said im trying to help im trying to show you that there were psychological im not on anybodys team dona oliveira i said quiet and firm she stood and chased the ashtray around the table crushing her cigarette out she shouldered her handbag i followed her to the door with half a mind to ask my burning question was catarina your daughter but i was too exhausted for the reply the front door clicked shut i opened it again to call after her but she was already halfway down the street walking into the yellow glow of the municipal street lighting having trouble with her heels on the cobbles chapter xxv rd august casa ao fim do mundo azoia km west of lisbon felsen looked down into the courtyard from the verandah on the roof of his house it was full of people he didnt know friends and business contacts of abrantes some of them were standing some sat at tables some picked over the decimated buffet with the bald disappointment of vultures late at the kill the day was hot with hardly a breath of wind which happened about once a year on this weatherblasted point of cabo da roca the sea was in a flat calm slow and viscous under the sun felsen smoked and sipped champagne from a shallow glass the party was to celebrate his permanent return from africa hed gone back there in the middle of june and spent almost the entire six years out there but it was over now angola had exploded into war and business had collapsed felsen looked across to the walled garden on the south side of the house one of his current girlfriends patricia the only one hed invited was standing next to joaquim abrantes in a group consisting of pedro abrantes eldest son pica abrantes wife and the monteiros picas parents abrantes had one hand in the small of patricias back and the other resting on his wifes waist he was leaning forward listening to pedro who as usual was charming everyone with one of his long amusing stories which felsen had probably heard before but never managed to grasp the humour he had no desire to be down there with them he was used to pedros brilliance and like good brandy he didnt need too much of it he looked around for manuel the second son the one with his eyes he found him there in the walled garden but four metres back from the group standing on his own under the shade of a bougainvillea perhaps hiding merging into the shadows ignored by all invisible to them waiting for something to happen of particular interest to him felsen had seen him in that position before at another party hed thrown some of pedros friends had been standing near the bougainvillea one a girl with blonde hair manuels hand had stretched out from the shade touched her on the head and halffrightened her to death where pedro was the tall confident lighthaired browneyed footballplaying eldest son leader in his economics class at lisbon university the nineteenyearold manuel was shorter fatter and already losing his dark hair in a strange way that had left a straggling fuzz across his brown scalp his jaw had merged into his neck his breasts pouched in his shirt and his trousers were inexorably drawn up the crack of his arse however big he bought them he had a magnificent moustache though compensating for what he was losing on top it was thick luxuriant shining as if all the energy in his head was drawn to it and there were the eyeslonglashed blue with the faintest green in them from his mother his best feature manuel was a morose boy hed suffered from his mothers absence more than his brother had school was torture the reports on his academic ability were poor he couldnt kick a football without sending a clod of turf after it and the memory of his attempt at roller hockey still brought tears to peoples eyes he didnt even have the distinction of being very unpopular he was just mildly sonot reviled just overlooked if there was harsh treatment coming from his fathers hand and there was plenty of it at school report time it found its way to the back of his head or his backside and never to pedros this didnt make him hate his brother he liked him too much as everybody else did and his brother always stood up for him he didnt hate his father either but he became watchful and sly to avoid confrontation it was women that he found difficult he had no way of talking to them couldnt find anything inside himself that might interest them and as a result they didnt like him he wanted to learn about them and underwear drawers seemed as good a place as any to start these investigations developed in manuel an adolescent passion for spying on people he found it thrilling to observe without being seen to soak up information that people would never know he knew it empowered him against their unconcern and it taught him things about people and about sex his sex education started with the nextdoor neighbours maid and his fathers chauffeur hed let himself in to the neighbours house and was wandering about rifling through drawers poking about in cupboards when he heard them come in he hid in the laundry room and waited for them to leave but they followed him in there he wasnt sure what he was watching at first as the man and woman tussled gently making strange scoffing noises he was only twelve at the time but as soon as he saw the girls skirts go up her bare legs and a coppery bush at their apex his own excitement told him that this was a thrill in a totally different category to picas underwear drawer he was shocked by the chauffeurs behaviour the man dropping his trousers as if he was going to do caca in front of the girl who hed picked up and placed on the table it was repellent but when he saw the mans equipment the state of it the size of it where he put it the way he rammed it up against the girls shiny bush her strange fearful gratitude the increased savagery of the chauffeurs thrusts and the confusion followed by the mans semen spraying everywherehe realized he was on to something extraordinary the state of his own pants told him so his mind told him something differentpart thrilled part disgusted with a strange overhanging calamity that this was what would be expected of him part of the mystery was clarified two days later the laundry room was now one of his permanent hideouts when his father burst in with the same maid manuel realized that only lowerclass people sprayed their semen everywhere whereas proper people more politely he thought and less messy left it all in the girls bush it was a number of years later and a succession of maids later that he fully understood the situation and even then it took a visit to a prostitute around his eighteenth birthday to completely demystify the procedure it was she who with a wellpositioned knee demonstrated that the withdrawal technique was a crossclass practice in a catholic society felsen moved to get a better view of what was fascinating manuel was it picas bottom if so it was a healthy sign as his own eyes had frequently drifted over that region shed kept her figure she hadnt had any children abrantes had offered to take her up to see the senhora dos santos in the beira and been met with a pitying silence instead hed taken her to london several times and spent large amounts of money in harley street but shed never even been pregnant let alone miscarried this was why her parents were excessively polite whenever they came to abrantes house or his parties it made for dull conversation felsen drifted back to manuel who in that instant straightened as if hed seen what hed come for his fathers hand had slipped off patricias back and was now definitely cupping a buttock while with the other hand he was playing with the suspender clip beneath the material of picas dress the old dog thought felsen as pica turned and saw the white of manuels shirt beneath the bougainvillea she shrugged her husbands hand off her bottom abrantes other hand shot off patricias buttock quick as a lizard the afternoon progressed people left as the food ran out abrantes joined felsen on the veranda with two brandy glasses and a bottle of aguardente hed brought down from the beira they sat on raffiaseated chairs with a wroughtiron table between them and drank and smoked cigarettes while abrantes softly slapped the painted wooden rail thats the portuguese for you said felsen watching people leave they cant do anything without food abrantes wasnt listening he flicked ash over the rail not caring where it went its been a bad year he said slipping into the role of very successful but naturally pessimistic businessman we got out of africa without losing our shirts said felsen no no im not talking about business business was all right its what you say its the colonies that african trouble is not going to go away salazar will follow the british theyve given independence to ghana and nigeria kenya will follow so will salazar in a couple of years well be back in africa making money with new independent governments ah said abrantes leaning forward knees spread ankles crossed glad for once to be able to correct the german if you think that then you dont understand salazar youre forgetting what happened when the australians landed on east timor during the war salazar will never give up the colonies they are empire they are portugal they are part of his estado novo come on joaquim the mans seventytwo years old now if you dont think hes got the stomach for it youre wrong its a weakness of his everybody knows it why do you think hes having all this trouble at home moniz trying to get him to resign felsen sneered and threw his hand up in the air as if he was chucking salt over his shoulder and dont forget general machedo hes still out there in brazil a few thousand kilometres away theres a man with popular support said abrantes ignoring felsen theres a man who would do anything to get into power and if he couldnt get the top military on his side hed even talk to those people those people asked felsen abrantes wound his hand round and round slapping the rail each time to show there was more and more the two businessmen acting at each other as if they were performing some brand of formal theatre these people are drawing attention to themselves they took that cruise liner the santa maria they hijacked that tap aircraft they who are they who are those people or these people which people the communists said abrantes his eyes widening in what felsen assumed was mock fear but was in fact astonishment these are people to be feared you of all people should know that look what theyve done to berlin the wall that wont last its a wall said abrantes you dont build a wall unless you expect it to last believe me and theyre gathering strength here too i know how i have friends said abrantes in pide and pide talk like that about salazar you dont understand my friend youve spent a lot of time out of the country i am here in lisbon all the time the pide he said stretching out an evangelical hand the pide arent just the police theyre a state within the new state they see how things really are they understand the dangers they see the african wars they see trouble at home they see dissent they see communism all these things are a threat to the stability of the do you know what communists do to banks felsen said nothing he knew abrantes as a lot of animalsthe shrewd business partner the ruthless practitioner of brutal labour relations the costcutter the dealmakerbut never not to his knowledge the political animal they nationalize them said abrantes throwing his hand out as if there was a bible in it felsen ran his hand over his grey fuzz abrantes was irritated by his apparent lack of concern that means we own nothing he reiterated the horror i know what nationalization is said felsen i know what communism is im scared of it i dont need any convincing but what are you proposing that we sell up and get out im not going to brazil manuel is joining pide said abrantes and felsen bit back his instinct to shout with laughter that was a solution what about his university education he asked automatically he didnt get the grades said abrantes tapping his temple with his cigar end i look at pedro i look at manuel i cant believe they have the same parents but dont misunderstand me i think manuel will do very well in pide ive made the introductions they like him the boy has a structure to his life now and he doesnt like communists either they wont have to teach him anything about that youll see we will benefit if there are communists working in our factories hell root them out and run them up to caxias prison and they know what to do with communists in the caxias prison felsen murmured tired now the mans fanaticism giving the aguardente a rough edge that it didnt have before abrantes sat back plugged the cigar into his mouth and straightened his tie over his belly manuels fuzzy head slipped back into the darkness of the enclosed terrace behind the veranda abrantes left at dinnertime with his family and patricia who claimed she wasnt feeling well but it was because felsen was powerfully drunk drunk to the point where it took several tentative stabs to get a cigarette between his lips he managed to put jailhouse rock on the record player and somehow got himself up on to the veranda where he took extravagant nosefuls of the still slack sea air and looked out into the black night when the music finished and he was left with static and the rhythmical click of the needle he blundered downstairs and drank water until he was gasping a short aeon slipped by and he found himself miraculously in his bedroom wrenching the windows open tearing his shirttails out of his waistband and treading his dropped trousers into the floor he felt hot and had a great need to be naked under cool sheets unconscious he ripped the bedclothes off jerked himself straight and took two startled steps back in the middle of the bed was a huge lizard a live lizard it bobbed its head braced itself against the white sheet felsen careered out of the room grabbed tools and came back with a rolling pin and a hammer his first strike was wildly off the mark and bounced the lizard on to the floor they fought for ten minutes wrecking the bedroom until felsen managed to stun the animal with the rolling pin hurled in frustration he beat the lizard with the hammer and only stopped when an incident on a hot dusty road in the beira leaked into his mind he picked the lizard up by the tail it was surprisingly heavy he threw it into the courtyard in the morning he was woken up by his heart thumping into his chest wall he was still drunk he knew it because his head didnt hurt and he wasnt disturbed by the sight of blood across both pillows and the sheets weak grey light and an open sea chill came through the windows there was cloud in the room it was ten oclock in the morning the house was buried in dense fog felsen had an encrusted gash on his forehead he cleaned it in the bathroom and showered some sense into his body he went out to the car wearing a suit under a wool coat he skirted the lizard backing towards the garage amazed at it a huge thing half a metre with its tail he went back and rolled it with his foot not an indigenous beast he thought he opened the garage and looked straight down at his feet as if instructed at the back of the car on the floor below the bumper a pair of crossed rusty horseshoes had been arranged he dropped to his haunches other horseshoes had been placed behind each rear wheel he gathered them up and hurled them over the wall with exaggerated force one bounced back at him and he gave it special treatment he was panting as he reversed out when he went back to shut the garage he saw two other horseshoes which had been under the front wheels he ran at them and launched them into the scrub outside with crazed strength he drove down to estoril with a pounding just beginning behind his eyes less than a kilometre from the house he emerged into brilliant sunshine he arrived in estoril in sweat and took a coffee in the main square which seemed to damage the part of his brain controlling his breathing his heart raced as if pumping ether instead of thick strong blood he left his coat in the car and walked up to abrantes house with his suit jacket over his shoulder he arrived with his eyebrows full of sweat and dark african states on the front and back of his shirt the maid nearly shut him out she sat him in the living room with a glass of water but felsen was too agitated to sit and paced the room like a caged panther joaquim abrantes rolled in full of energy and purpose until he saw felsen in his patched shirt his head gashed and wearing his hangover on the outside what happened he told him a lizard said abrantes i wouldnt mind knowing who put it there manuel was called and the accusation of a practical joke levelled it stunned the boy who was standing like a soldier at ease he denied it vehemently and was dismissed i wonder about that boy said abrantes hes always snooping around peoples houses felsen told him about the horseshoes abrantes stood stock still hunched and felsen caught a glimpse of the peasant from the beirasuperstitious pagan nose turned up to the smell of things not right this is bad he said this is very bad perhaps youve upset your neighbours i dont have any neighbours people from the village maybe i dont know anybody from the village apart from the maid and shes happy to take my money you know what you have to do im hoping youre going to tell me these are your people you must go to the senhora dos santos in the beira no no a local one ask in the village theyll know this magic is not from the beira magic abrantes nodded gravely felsen drove back up to azoia which was still in fog a stationary closed muffled world and freezing after the august sunshine in estoril he went to the bar which contained four people three in black and a barman nobody spoke he asked his question and a boy chico was called chico led the way into the narrow lanes of the village the fog so thick that felsen in his state would stop occasionally and rear back as if from a solid wall the boy took him to a low house on the edge of the village the moisture had collected on his black hair like morning dew a woman came to the door in a blue floral overall wiping her bloody hands on a ragfresh from killing lunch or maybe an entrail inspection she was roundfaced with very small eyes which only opened to the tiniest slits she looked at the boy who was her height but it was felsen who spoke i have a problem id like you to come and see my house he said she shooed the boy away felsen gave him a coin they went through to the yard at the back of her house where there was a large domed dovecote the size of a churchs cupola she reached in and the doves flapped and cooed one came out on her hand white with brown traces on its wings she held it to her bosom and stroked it down felsen felt strangely calm they drove to the house in fog so thick that felsen stuck his head out of the window to see if it would improve his vision the senhora dos santos inspected the dead lizard already seething with ants you found it in your bed you said felsen nodded scepticism crouched on his shoulder it would have been better if you hadnt killed it why lets look in the house as soon as she entered the hallway her breathing became laboured as if she was having a respiratory attack she walked through the house struggling with every step her face reddening and despite the oceanic cold sweating felsen found himself close to laughing at the absurdity of the spectacle he walked behind her unmoved as if on some vague barracks inspection the senhora dos santos looked at the bed which was still bloodstained from his head injury as if there was a thricestabbed body on it she staggered from the room down the stairs and out into the courtyard pursued by felsen keen as a ghoulish schoolboy her breathing recovered her face went back to its natural colour the dove was not so fortunate it fell dead and already stiff from her hands they looked at it she sad felsen affronted by the womans quackery he was in no doubt shed killed it herself what do you make of it he asked the face that looked up at him was not encouraging her eyes were now fully open from the slits they had been before they were black all pupil no iris this is not our magic she said but what does it all mean he asked the lizard the horseshoes you killed the lizard in your own bed it means you will destroy yourself kill myself no no you will bring yourself down he snorted and the horseshoes they will stop you from going anywhere they will ive just been somewhere you and i have just been in the car not the car senhor felsen she said and he wondered for a moment how she knew his name what then your life what is this this he said his hand revolving over and over looking for the word this is macumba macumba brazilian black magic chapter xxvi saturday th june paco de arcos lisbon during those six hard months of controlled fat intake to get myself back into shape id planned to celebrate the end by cooking something exquisitely drenched in fat for olivia and myself somewhere in my body there was a high whining for something like arroz de pato duck with ricethe fat soaked into the rice studded with chourico the flesh of idle chunks of duck falling apart the skin crispand a deep cutting slatey red to wash it down but the dish took hours to make it was late nearly midnight olivia wasnt home and there was nothing in the fridge i tipped the whisky undrunk into the sink i showered and changed i slapped around the kitchen in bare feet and thawed some turkey steaks id found in the freezer in warm water i boiled up some rice a tin of corn and opened a bottle of esteva red by halfpastmidnight i was sitting with a small coffee and an aguardente smoking my penultimate cigarette olivia came in smelling of perfume and beer she sat down and smoked my last cigarette for me i complained she hugged me around the head and kissed me loudly on the ear i crushed her to me and resisted biting her like i used to when she was small she squirmed away from me and asked what had happened to my hand a little accident i said not wanting to face that again so she said taking a sip of my coffee speaking in english as we did from time to time you look happy i said i am you met somebody you liked sort of she halflied automatic at any age how was your day you heard anything the girl on the beach dad paco de arcos hasnt been talking about anything else and cascais cascais too you stopped talking about the manic street preachers for two seconds not that long yes well she was dead on the beach hit on the head and strangled not nice the only thing how old was she a bit younger than you what was the only thing my sweet daughter my little girl i still saw that under the clothes the hairstyle the makeup and perfume i used to disturb myself at night because im a man and i know men thinking about all those young guys who wouldnt see that who saw who saw what she wanted them to see i suppose thats it girls dont want to be little girls for ever not even for ten minutes these days maybe you knew this girl i said deviating me why not shes the same age her parents live in cascais she goes to school in lisbonliceu d dinis her names catarina sousa oliveira privileged kids get murdered too i dont know anyone at the liceu d dinis i dont know anyone called catarina sousa oliveira but that wasnt the only thing you changed your mind i can tell you dont i did the thing was she was under sixteen and for a kid that age she was getting up to a lot of tricks tricks its what prostitutes do they turn tricks i know that its just a weird word for the work i bet your mother didnt teach you that mum and i talked about everything turning tricks its called sex education she didnt get any herself so she gave me some did she use those words thats what women do dad when boys are kicking footballs in the park were talking about everything except football i bought you a present she said what else did your mother tell you there she said and laid out a razor five blades and a can of shaving foam i pulled her over and kissed her on the head what are these for i asked dont be difficult go on what we were talking about your mother you were being nosey about our conversations and if mum didnt talk to you about what she talked about with me then she probably thought it was none of your business or more likely dad you wouldnt have been interested try me she looked up into her head smoked a bit and polished her teeth with her tongue you first she said me tell me something personal that you talked about with mum to show me good faith like what something personal she said enjoying herself like sex didnt you ever talk about sex i looked into my aguardente glass for quite some time she talked to me about what it was like having sex with you she said did she i said astonished she said let me get this right its a wonderful thing to have sex with a man you love once youve felt that tenderness the deep intimacy of his total regard for you the thrill of that mental connection then theres no going back i think that was more or less it she told me that after my first time when i complained that it wasnt all that it was cracked up to be olivia stopped i was in trouble unable to swallow my eyeballs prickling my stomach clenching it was silent in the room a single dog barked in the night a long way off my daughter put her hand on my back rubbed me between the shoulders i pulled back from the precipice she put her forehead on to my arm i stroked her soft black hair more time passed she kissed my wrist the traffic reasserted itself in the room your first time i said coming round olivia sat up she didnt tell you did she i didnt think she would why i asked her not to i thought youd probably have arrested him when was this a while ago im not sure how long a while is in english sometimes its short sometimes its long about eighteen months ago when exactly i want to remember that time february last year carnival time you were only just fifteen thats right what happened she stretched and shivered with nerves not used to talking to me like this neither of us were you know she said tell me it was at a party he was eighteen you think of these things and then you find theyve happened without you knowing why hadnt i seen it dont women get that look in their eye when theyve eaten the forbidden fruit i know boys donttheyre nerds before and afterwards theyre just happy nerds it happened again i thought i was relaxed but i was coiled tighter than a metal spring where was all this this rage coming from for the second time that night my fist came down on the table and i roared against the bastard stranger whod deflowered my daughter i harangued my dead wife i railed against my reflection in the window for being so blind i castigated olivia who kicked back her chair and volleyed her entire lovelife straight back in my face yelling at the top of her voice so that ships crews heading out into the atlantic that night would have lined up on the rails to listen it didnt stop until she hit me tears streaming down her face she thundered her fists into my chest and stormed out the doors crashing behind her heels cracking the stairs a final door slam and i could see her thumping facedown on the bed then quiet apart from the blood thundering in my ears and the tick of a woodworm eating its way up the table leg after half an hour of circular thinking i went upstairs olivias light was out under her door i continued up the stairs to my attic room and the weakness id been indulging for the past six months i had a desk set up in the dormer window with a simple raffiaseated wooden chair in the desk i had a photograph of my wife a head shot taken by me at night on the terrace of a house we were staying in near lagos in the algarve in the shot her face is luminous it was a colour shot but only black and white and a yellow aura had come out in the flash she never liked having her photo taken id surprised her but she wasnt wideeyed and shocked she was actually staring intendy and with some intensity at the moment just before evasive action would be taken i set the photograph up in a black frame on the desk facing the window her face came up in one of the panes of glass as if she was outside looking in also in the desk in a locked drawer was a bag of grass and a packet of rizla papers i used to smoke it as a kid in africa it was the poor mans booze and the gardeners used it all the time i hadnt smoked since i left london but when i had to stop drinking to lose the weight i knew i wasnt going to get through the occasional hard lonely moment without something to soften the edges id smoked maybe two or three joints a week for six months when i smoked i talked to my wife in the window and the strange part was that after the dope had taken hold and id fallen into myself shed talk back i sat with the desk lamp on to give the reflection and smoked it didnt take much it was good stuff not local i mean i could have just walked out the front door and bought a deal in five minutes but that wouldnt do my fathers old driver from guinea provided the gear for me my black brother its been a day i said no answer her gaze as steady as a ships purpose through water you like my new face her lips slightly apart dark against her white face didnt move ive lost my rag twice today what does that mean ive never lost control like that before not even when ive been drinking that stuff about my father carlos talking about my father like that i couldnt stand it maybe you feel guilty she said what was that i didnt catch that maybe you feel guilty about your father guilty i said i was defending him but you were lefter than left when i first met you it was the way to rebel against the against fascism was it was it just that silence i steeplechased a marathon around my head i knew the answer to this but how to get it out you can just say it she said its only me and you it wasnt the right thing for him to have done i said thats what you thought and i still think that now thats a hard thing for you to have to admit she said i know how much you admired him but why did i go crazy like that banging my fists down on the table you always said that the portuguese prefer to live in the past perhaps youve decided to live in the present and the future she said youre changing youre lonely and youre changing maybe you dont want to be lonely any more i missed you tonight hearing olivia say your words i missed you you didnt mind me telling her that no no not that what then i just had the thought that even when you were alive i was still a bit lonely not lonely a loner she said correcting my english its what makes you the man you are but it can break you too in my job you mean you dont have to think of your job all the time ze youre right i spent too much time thinking about that you were too inquisitive for the truth about everything and everybody nobody likes that not even policemen and the ones closest to you dont always want to tell it or know it either i dont get that especially when you dont reveal your own little truths when you hide ah yes i knew wed get to that the beard the beard she snorted the beard didnt matter metaphorically i meant ok if you like she said but remember thats the first time youve told me about what you thought of your fathers actions why didnt you tell me about olivia i said it in a rush she trusted me not to i see she said she couldnt have borne your disappointment my disappointment she remembers all those times you used to take her off as a little girl all those hours you spent with her telling her about things and about how wonderful she was and how much she meant to you were you disappointed i took the joint down to the roach and stubbed it out in the tin seashell ashtray i reexperienced that crushed feeling after a girl youve fallen for lets you down lightly were strange creatures i said love is a complicated business i stared at my own reflection in the pane above my wife i met someone today i said who was that a teacher he or she she what about her she asked with a little edge im i like her like whats like im attracted to her silence shes the first woman ive met that id like to you dont have to be explicit ze i didnt mean to then dont it was just that ze her image shuddered in the windowpane a breeze smartening off the sea rattled the loose panes whose putty had come out long ago the lamp buzzed on the corner of the table i leaned back and found myself crouching braced against the edge of the desk tiles on the roof shifted against each other as the breeze freshened more the jolt when it came seemed to come from behind my sternum it thumped me forward into the desk the photograph collapsed the pane blackened the lamp keeled over i lay on the floor in the dark my hands folded on my stomach i was half under the desk unable to get enough air in my lungs a doctor might have thought it was a heart attack and it was of sorts after a small aeon i crawled up the chair just made it to the door and halffell down the stairs i stripped vehemently my clothes sticking to me like a crazed lovers i lay on the bed with my hand in her dent of the mattress tears leaked down the side of my face over my ears and wet the pillow chapter xxvii th december monte estoril near lisbon felsen sat on the edge of a wooden chest with his back to the black rainlashed window which in daylight would have shown the grey ocean and off to the right the fort of cascais squat robust taking on the waves he was watching picas family leave after a christmas eve dinner pedro joaquims eldest son was in amongst the guests kissing and shaking hands manuel leaned against the wall feet crossed at the ankle hands in pockets watching confident in his watching the party broke up pica went upstairs pedro and manuel disappeared into the house abrantes and felsen poured themselves some prewar armagnac and lit a cuban cigar apiece abrantes sat down in his favourite piece of furniture a highbacked leather armchair with an arched hood he liked to gently and absentmindedly slap the arm of this chair and there was a dark patch where the natural grease of his palm had been kneaded in you dont look well said abrantes youre not eating properly it was true felsen hadnt had any appetite for some weeks he felt as if there was a big moment pending and to be ready for it he wanted to be sharp hungry concentrated he looked out of the black window watching abrantes reflection you put alcohol on an empty stomach youll ruin yourself said abrantes demonstrating his allround expertise as if his visits to harley street with pica had been part of his education and allowed him to pontificate on all things medical felsen puffed on his cigar the coal at the end sending morse code back to him smokings bad too unless you eat added abrantes which tempted felsen to announce a midnight swim to see if his partner would say that that would kill him too everythings all right as long as you eat properly felsen paced the length of the window looking out across the other houses to the ocean youre nervous too said abrantes you cant sit still any more youre not working youre spending too much time with too many different women you should calm down marry joaquim what he asked looking up from his chair innocent putupon im just trying to help you havent been yourself since you came back from africa if you had a wife i wouldnt have to worry about you thats what wives do i dont want to get married said felsen for the first time out loud but you have to you have to have children or or or what it all stops you dont want to be the end of the line its not as if im the last male hapsburg joaquim abrantes wasnt sure what a hapsburg was it shut him up they drank felsen refilled and went back to the window he saw abrantes reflected craning his neck to see what was worth looking at manuel is doing very well in pide said abrantes you told me they say he has a natural ability for the work a suspicious mind maybe an enquiring mind said abrantes they tell me he likes to know everything theyre going to make him an agente de i classe is that impressive after less than six months in the job i think so what does he do you know he checks up on people he talks to informers he finds the worms in the apple felsen nodded hardly listening abrantes writhed in his favourite chair unable to get comfortable i meant to ask you this said abrantes i meant to ask you this months ago what said felsen turning away from the window interested for the first time that night did you see the senhora dos santos about your problem in the summer of course i did abrantes sat back legs spread relieved i was worried he said that you wouldnt take it seriously its a very serious business she didnt do anything said felsen she said it wasnt her type of magic abrantes came out of his chair as if a mechanism had thumped him in the back he took felsen by the elbow squeezed it hard to impress upon him the gravity of the matter now i know he said his eyes staring and wide now i know why youre behaving in this way you must see someone immediately felsen eased his elbow out of the mans mechanical grip he threw back the armagnac remaining in his glass and left the house it was pm he was drunk but not too drunk to drive himself back out to cabo da roca he drove his mercedes through the silent streets black and glistening from the rain he slowed past a couple of addresses in cascais but each time moved onnot lacking in any physical appetite just the talk necessary to get him to that point he smoked the remains of the cigar and drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and it occurred to him out there in the blustery darkness on the guincho road with the storms stacked up over the atlantic waiting to come in that in a fit of madness maria might have told abrantes thai manuel was not his child was that why she was back up in the beira was that why abrantes talked about continuing the line and in the next breath mentioned manuel and his success in pide abrantes had made a remark at that party in the summer too about manuel not having the same parents as pedro he shook his head at the indecisive windscreen wipers at the rain gusting across the road slashing and buffeting the car his thoughts unnerved him he began to feel uncomfortable between his shoulders and up the back of his neck suspicious suddenly that the back seat of the car was not empty drunk again he sighed a car approached on a long straight section of the road they dipped their headlights at each other as the car drew nearer he took advantage of the light to check the back seat in the rear view nothing he reached behind him and swept his hand across the seats stupid drunk red lights receded into the blackness quickly obliterated the road climbed up through the dense darkness of the pine trees past malveira da serra the road winding cutting back on itself the steering wheel shooting through his hands a little sweat on his top lip from the drink oozing out of his system he turned off at the top and dropped down through the village of azoia and out towards the lighthouse where his house huddled in its own courtyard shouldered the weather he got out to open the gates the wind inflated his lungs the rain battered his hot ear he drove the car up to the garage and went back to close the gates hed left a lamp on outside the house on the corner and in the light that shone off the hard wet mud in the courtyard he saw footprints going to the side of the house he put his own foot down over one of the footprints his were smaller he squeezed his chin and swallowed the gnr had warned him that bandits were operating on the roads around the serra da sintra he drove the car into the garage he opened the glove compartment and removed an old walther p hed kept from the war he checked the magazine and tucked it into his waistband his mind worried over ammunition corroded by the sea air and he tried to remember when hed last cleaned and oiled the damn thing still having it in his hand was the important thing he stumbled into the house and saw his rubbery face in the hall mirror maybe that was it he was just drunk and they were the gardeners footprints that must be it he took off his coat shook the rain off it and hung it up the gardener was small didnt even come up to his shoulder had the feet of an elf his ears strained for movement and returned to him the tinnitus that had developed since coming back from africa he wiped his feet and moved down the corridor his leather soles sounded loud against the wooden flooring he turned on the kitchen light empty he crossed to the living room flicked that light on the rembrandt looked down on him he went to the sideboard and poured himself a shot of aguardente from an unmarked bottle he sniffed it the raw alcohol unstuffed his head the paranoia backed off a notch he lit a cigarette took two fast drags and crushed it out he removed the gun from his waistband and turned a man was standing by the door grey hair swept back blue raincoat the wet shoulders glistening in the light he had a gun in his hand schmidt said felsen surprisingly calm given that the name had come into his head like a lobbed grenade schmidt adjusted his grip on the revolver and the fourinch barrel performed a small circle he was surprised that felsen wasnt thrown against the wall in astonishment at the sight of him he was surprised to see the walther in the mans hand how could he be armed and ready did he know things you should put that down said schmidt you could do the same neither of them moved schmidt breathed loudly through his broken nose his mouth sealed the stress of the situation working his jaw muscles his brain calculating as hard as a chess grandmasters but without the clarity smoke said felsen i gave up he said my lungs didnt like the tropics a drink then i had a brandy earlier i didnt think you drank i dont usually have another then see if you can get a taste for it put the gun down i dont think so said felsen his heart pounding in the roof of his mouth why dont we both put our guns down over here on the sideboard schmidt moved through the furniture his gun leading as he came closer the greyness in his face became more apparent he was a sick man and more dangerous for it with a nod they laid their guns down simultaneously on the polished wood felsen poured drinks im surprised said felsen not sounding it a days drinking and the burst of adrenalin having a curious effect on him i was told you were lying in a river with your pockets full of rocks and a bullet in your head felsen handed him a glass of the aguardente schmidt sniffed it your partner he never even came after me i saw him he stayed close to the house as if he was giving me time to get away and when he thought i was well gone he walked out into the poppy fields and let off a round into the air not a brave man but not a stupid one either id have killed him why didnt you come into the house after us like they do in the films said schmidt canting his head to one side sardonic i thought about it but i decided it was too dangerous and anyway killing the two of you wasnt the point at that time was that why you sent eva after me eva susana i meant susana lopes fromsao paulo susana got close she made a beginners mistake but then that was what she was are you working for someone schmidt this is a personal thing he said why dont we start with what you want felsen said lets get that out into the open youre not after the gold are you gold he said not a question not an answer youre sick said felsen disturbed by the mans lack of direction i can see that fibrosis of the lungs said schmidt where are you living now back in germany bayreuth he said sipping his drink i was from dresden did you know that you know what they did to dresden i havent been back did your family survive theyre in dortmund he said children two boys and a girl theyre quite grownup now i see said felsen feeling oddly like a bank manager thats an american gun you have there a souvenir does it fire the stars and stripes schmidt smiled the stress eased felsen edged him away from the guns he sat on the arm of a leather sofa with schmidt on the arm of one of the chairs their knees almost touching that painting looks familiar said schmidt another souvenir it doesnt look like a cheap print i bought it on the bayswater road in london is it a copy of asked schmidt starting to get up felsen rested his hand on the mans shoulder its a rembrandt schmidt now tell me the purpose of your social call ive had a long dinner and im tired schmidts creased neck turned in its frayed collar he had a patch of grey bristles visible under the jawline missed in the morning shave a thicket of dark hair protruded from his ear im not the only one with a sensitive past he said ah said felsen the angle revealed another of your american imports schmidt ive heard blackmails very popular over there now schmidts eyes switched back to the guns on the sideboard the old man in the rembrandt watching theyre very interested in certain circles he said his mind not on it you dont think theyve got their hands full with the russians theyve got plenty of hands when it comes to a multimilliondollar corporation established with wartime ss funding theres a risk of course that it could all blow up in your face schmidt youve got no evidence except your own colourful past schmidt threw himself at the sideboard felsen whod been halfwaiting for this moment found that the other half wasnt as alert as it should have been he lashed out with his foot and caught schmidt on the shin schmidts arms flailed but his hands managed to come down on the sideboard a gun clattered across the uncarpeted edge of the floor schmidt fell and twisted on to his back felsen found himself kneeling and looking down the barrel of his own gun held in schmidts hand i thought we were talking schmidt we were but i changed my mind he said blackmails a complicated business a lot of things can go wrong in it so is burglary and fencing an old master i was thinking about murder murder asked felsen what do you get from murder your healths gone you should be thinking about your childrens future they dont know me ive seen them but they dont know me what is this asked felsen i dont know what this is about any more this is about loyalty he said felsen gasped as schmidt pulled the trigger there was a dry click schmidt racked the slide felsen leapt towards the corner of the room his hand reaching out for schmidts gun there was a headringing explosion far louder than a detonating bullet in a confined space and felsens ear and arm burnt white hot the next sound he heard was the horror sound from prinz albrechtstrasse the sound of a man on the brink of orgasm he picked up the gun and rolled over schmidt was slumped against the sideboard his legs out in front of him his eyes wide and staring at the bloodied stump at the end of his right arm blood covered his chest and lap his raincoat was torn open his face and grey hair flecked with red schmidt wanted to scream but like a man having a nightmare his mind shuddered but his voice only whimpered the quantity of blood that had spurted from his severed brachial artery was creating a creeping stain through the carpet towards the leather furniture im going he said in a strange polite voice as if hed got what hed come for and hed be running along now felsen got to his feet his reflection in the window showed dark streaks across his face the mirror showed him that hed lost half an ear his left arm burned from shoulder to wrist he eased the fingers of his right hand around there and they disappeared into a deep wound in his triceps his knees went and he nearly fainted he stripped off his jacket in the bathroom and washed himself as best he could he ran water over his arm it made no difference it felt as if he had a white hot lump of charcoal in there he hung his head over the sink not only did he have schmidt to move but he also had furniture and a large antique arraiolos carpet to shift he wrapped a towel around his arm he went back to the living room he reached over schmidt and uncorked the aguardente bottle and drank heavily from it he sat on the divan with the bottle in his crotch and with the most westerly telephone in europe put a call through to abrantes the operator connected him the maid answered and refused to disturb abrantes felsen worked on her for half a minute he knew what abrantes was doing he drank again and found a new packet of cigarettes abrantes finally picked up the telephone i need your help said felsen cant it wait he said irritated i need help from your friends the ones manuel works for silence now he had the mans attention he gulped more spirit blinked back the tears theres been a development from that situation i had with susana lopes theres a man dead up here thats enough said abrantes shut up now im sending somebody are you hurt felsens face was burning from the alcohol his lips with the cigarette stuck to the bottom one itched sweat sprang from the sandpaper of his moustache my arm leave the door open said abrantes felsen raided the phone back he made it to the front door and halfway back he fell across the threshold to the living room schmidts white face was his last image he was vaguely aware of people in the room shadows and light in his eyes furniture scraping voices remote and indistinct and the wind still driving into the house rattling the windows he was being moved something flashed in the dome of his cranium and he floated out again his raft creaking under the heave of a big sea he woke up several times over a period he could not judge each time the heat inside him was tremendous as if his body was burning fossil fuels on the last occasion there was a smell a terrible smell one that frightened him and left him as weak as the runt cub in a litter of twelve there was morning light when he came round the very first inch of the day when the earliest grey seeps out of the black his head was too heavy to lift off the pillow was he awake this time was he conscious he waited to see where he was to make sure that he wasnt still inside his own head more light leaked into the room a little white the colour of bone he felt cool not so much pain in his bad arm a saline drip in the other not parched as before he heard voices talking in the corridor about a coup attempt in beja the name of general machedo but it was too much effort to listen and he tuned out he lifted his right arm it was secured to the bed frame by a pair of handcuffs he lifted his left gingerly the pain still there the arm came up easily he looked down his chest at it but it wasnt there it felt there but it wasnt the hand was there but it wasnt the wrist the elbow the biceps all there but not he yelled loud enough to split the two sacs of his lungs two guards both with rifles crashed into the room what the hells going on said the first and older one my arm roared felsen my arms gone they looked at him dumbly from across the room thats right said the younger one they cut it off the older guard nudged him with his elbow what said the younger one hes lost his arm for gods sake he smells a lot better now than when they brought him in the older guard gave him a deadeyed look and went to get a doctor the younger one paced the room why am i chained to the bed asked felsen you killed a guy said the guard you were completely drunk and you killed a guy as soon as youre fit to move were taking you back to caxias i dont remember the trial thatll come felsen dumped his head back on the pillow and did some blinking at the ceiling will you do something for me you dont look as if youve got much money on you if i give you a number will you call joaquim abrantes hell give you money the guard shook his head not worth the bother two weeks later felsen was moved back to the caxias prison a week after that he was taken out of his cold damp cell to a room with a table an empty sardine tin for an ashtray and two chairs abrantes was shown in by a prison officer he and felsen shook hands abrantes clapped him on the shoulder and tried to nod some encouragement into him felsen tried to keep the coldness out of his eyesabrantes the only man on the outside who could help him they sat down abrantes produced some of felsens favourite turkish cigarettes and a hip flask of brandy they lit up and drank to each other so whats happening asked felsen a very difficult and now bureaucratic situation i dont remember very much after i called you that was the first problem you came through to an operator in cascais by the time id contacted my friends in pide another squad had already been advised by the telephone exchange that a death had occurred and that you werent phoning the police to report it suspicious very suspicious he broke into my house he was armed so were you your fingerprints were on the unregistered gun a bullet from that was found in the dead man i dont felsen drifted and chewed on his remaining thumbnail you see how complicated it has become that wasnt my gun he had my gun my gun blew up in his face what was he doing with your gun what were you doing with his felsen closed his eyes and squeezed the bridge of his nose he told abrantes as best as he could remember what had happened abrantes listened glancing at his watch and drinking more of the brandy than was his share he nodded and murmured to keep felsen going you know said abrantes once he was sure the german was finished i dont think you can say any of that in court in court there has to be a trial what about your pide friends as i mentioned a very difficult and now bureaucratic situation youre in the system its not so easy to get you out i dont remember being charged the charge my friend is murder felsen dabbed the sardine tin around the table with the end of his cigarette you know who he was dont you who the dead man according to his papers he was a german tourist called reinhardt glaser felsen shook his head his eyes so intense they grabbed abrantes around the throat you owe me he said i owe you the dead man was schmidt you remember him schmidt the one you told me you shot that night in the alentejo you said you put him in the river no no no no yes joaquim said felsen easing the hip flask from abrantes grip it was him you lied to me he said you didnt come after him he said you fired a shot out in the poppy fields he saw you schmidt saw you no no no his name was reinhardt glaser you made a mistake i didnt make a mistake you know i didnt me how i never saw him it was quiet enough to hear the tobacco crackling in their cigarettes you owe me for that joaquim look he said you lost your arm im sorry for that youve had a bad experience youre still in a state of shock your memory is playing tricks with you this is what im going to do for you im getting one of the best criminal lawyers to help you out of this mess if he cant get you an acquittal nobody can now drink i have to be going pica is waiting for me in the chiado the later i am the more she spends forca amigo meu that was the last felsen saw of abrantes the lawyer never appeared his old partner didnt attend the trial nine months later and he wasnt present to see felsen sentenced to twenty years imprisonment for the murder of the german tourist known from his passport details as reinhardt glaser as felsen began two decades of imprisonment in caxias he had a short vivid dream it featured four horseshoes which gradually straightened out into a lattice of metal strips and behind the strips was a live lizard with its head mashed to a bloody pulp front legs braced bobbing he woke with a jerk and into his head came the memory of a dark stretch of road out to guincho on a squally christmas eve night he knew then that even in his drunken state his instinct had been rightmaria had told abrantes that manuel was not his son he replayed that last meeting with abrantes the man seemed to have come with drink and cigarettes and the possibility of hope but felsen now realized that he was there to enjoy his satisfaction to rub his hands over the warm fire of completed vengeance two weeks after the trial on november th joaquim abrantes sat down with his new lawyer dr aquilino dias oliveira and rewrote the statutes of the banco de oceano e rocha amongst the shareholders and directors there was no mention of the convicted murderer klaus felsen chapter xxviii sunday th june paco de arcos near lisbon olivia was still sleeping when i looked in on her in the morning facedown under her black hair i went downstairs and ate fruit drank coffee and talked to the cat whod stretched herself out into the longest cat in paco de arcos the time snipped round to am and i went to look at the telephone the telephone had been mildly interesting years ago when we had a large bakelite affair that was heavy enough to curtail young girls conversations now we had a sleek graphitegrey pushbutton apparatus that looked absurd in the rooms decaying decor and was light enough for olivia to tuck it behind her ear and cut a suit of clothes whilst talking about boys i straightened the telephone on its table checked the flex olivia came in wearing a tshirt down to her knees her eyes still puzzled by sleep what are you doing she asked im looking at the phone she did too is it due to perform i was thinking of making a call the cat came in and sat beside her paws neat sensing a moment of possible interest she yawned widely who are you going to call i gripped my chin and looked up at her suddenly feeling in need of something and not just a beard my head was suddenly crowdedi was going to call a possible witness in a murder trial to ask her out to lunch i was going to have to tell my daughter about her i had to explain last nights madness the door bell rang i wanted to talk to you about what happened last night i said shif ting on to my back foot the door bell rang again she left the room fast glad to be out of there the cat looked around to see if there was anything worth nicking and left too i lunged at the telephone and dialled luisa madrugadas number she picked it up before it had even rung this is inspector ze coelho i said the words sprinting out panicstruck would you like your work interrupted i always want my work interrupted inspector we talked about that yesterday its by what and whom thats the question lunch i said would lunch inspector she asked suddenly grave and chill is this business something cold ran through me i felt sick with regret absolutely not i said changing my original idea forcing the words out she laughed and told me to come to her apartment at one oclock olivia came back into the room followed by carlos with a newspaper under his arm and the cat still looking for the cocktail party progress said olivia still unimpressed i refitted the handset reliving the rollercoaster moments of the start of something newhope despair joyall in ten seconds id forgotten the stamina it took carlos approached and held out his hand i took it he held on and with his head bowed uttered an extensive apology that must have kept him up all night i looked at olivia who was transfixed until something more important occurred to her and she left the room i put my hand on carlos shoulder he was suffering and still couldnt look me in the eye my chest felt as big as a cathedral roof if id opened my mouth thered have been a chord from an organ with all the stops pulled out i put an arm around his shoulders youre a good man i said apologizings never easy especially when it wasnt entirely your fault i should never have said that about your father it was unforgivable its my problem i say things when they come into my head i dont think about other people ive tried to get my thoughts into some kind of holding pattern but i cant thats why they move me around i upset people you know that by now its a sensitive subject the revolution i said we shouldnt have been talking about it after a day like that thats what my father said he said its not even a generation old its still raw and you your generation can be objective about it im still i was involved i said what about your father he was a communist a union activist in one of the shipyards he did nearly four years in caxias we stood there nodding the seriousness too big and awkward to be commented on i felt like a man whod joined hands with someone around the trunk of a massive tree i steered him into the kitchen and sat him down with some coffee he put the wellread newspaper down on the table anything interesting in that i asked catarina oliveiras in there is she you wouldnt have thought i read the article it was the facts of the casewhere her body was found and when the time of death the school she went to her friday routine after school the way she was killed and most surprising of all i got a mention what do you make of it asked carlos shrugged i didnt know it was very unusual if i was of a suspicious mind i might think it was dr aquilino oliveira telling his friends to be careful who they talked to i began to sense a higher profile to the case a public face it might throw up something we can use i said what else theres a long article about this gold business i wasnt aware there was any gold business were setting up a commission to look into it theres been a lot of pressure from the united states the european community and jewish organizations and weve been trying to squirm away from it but now finally weve got to do something about it we who what i said you sound like a portuguese reporter they say everything except the nugget you want to hear the government has set up a commission to look into portuguese complicity in accepting looted nazi gold in exchange for raw materials during the second world war and towards the end of the war laundering the gold out to south america the government actually no he said spreading out the newspaper its the governors of the banco de portugal theyve appointed a guy to look into their archives who some professor thats going to be a carefully managed exercise i said whos making us wash our linen in public the americans one of their senators says he has proof of portuguese involvement listen our gold reserves in were nearly fifteen hundred million escudos by they were nearly eleven thousand million how about that so we sold a lot of raw materials in the war thats not laundering where did all this gold come from switz he started and stopped i followed his eyes olivia had come into the kitchen and sat down sideways on a chair at the table she was in her shortest miniskirt and a pair of her mothers strappy high heels her legs were long and honeycoloured already from a day on the beach she crossed them and poured herself a cup of coffee her hair was brushed to a glossy blue blackness her lips were chillired her young breasts strained against a midnightblue top which ended two inches above the waistband of the skirt showing the taut brown skin of her belly going somewhere i asked she tossed her hair over her shoulder as if shed been practising out she said later this is my new partner carlos pinto her head turned as if there was a very expensive mechanism in her neck for smoothing things out her tongue was attached to her top lip we met at the door carlos cleared his throat we looked at him he hadnt intended to draw attention to himself but he had to say something now remember the holding pattern i had a fight with your father last night he said never mind brawling in pubs she said in her fanciest english accent i thought you were the police she finished in portuguese it was just the two of us he said what about the barman i said dont forget the barman my father was fighting with everybody last night you me my dead mother the barman did i miss anybody it was my fault said carlos what were you fighting about she asked nothing i said quickly what about you asked carlos me she said and somehow stopped a blush from creeping along her jawline nothing too it was important at the time i said and what was all that noise up in the attic last night she turned on me carlos frowned the cat loped in i fell over in the dark i said where did you say you were going later ive been invited to lunch by sofias parents sofia the bankers daughter the guy who gave you all that money for your beard you see a lot of them the rodrigues sofias in my class shes olivia hesitated looked across at carlos whose eyes hadnt left her face shes adopted the past year weve been getting on you know how it is carlos seemed to ill be in lisbon this afternoon i said ill be going home said carlos if youre going to the station said olivia with a grab in her voice forgetting that later hadnt quite arrived you could walk me up there olivia kissed me on the cheek and rubbed the lipstick in something she liked doing something she saw as grownup dont forget to shave she said rubbing her fingers together they left i shaved and went down to the cafe and drank a bica widi antonio borrego i felt relaxed after olivias performance if a sixteenyearold can manipulate two grown men then i might as well deliver myself into the hands of luisa madrugada and let her make a monkey or a man out of me i drove into lisbon wrestling with my octopodial conscience should i really be taking a possible witness out to lunch when i didnt know her level of importance to the case it was an ugly argument that word possible became very important and for once i let the impetuous personal beat the responsible professional into the ground i spent twenty minutes in rua actor taborda sitting in my car waiting for the time to get less embarrassingly early i was watching the entrance to a porno cinema faintly interested in the type of people who would have the strength for sessoes continuas on a sunday lunchtime apparently no one i rang the bell at pm and to my slight disappointment luisa came down to meet me i didnt know what my subconscious had been hoping but my stomach was telling me it wasnt to miss lunch i wanted her to grab my arm as olivia would and march down the street which finally made me rein in on hope and instigate some equanimity we went to a cervejaria on avenida almirante reis one in a chain wellknown for their seafood i wanted to stand at the bar because i liked to eat seafood in an informal way but the bar area felt cheap and sleazy even with the magnified tanks of puzzled crayfish and lobster the waiter sat us in the window of the restaurant there were two other couples and the rest of the cavernous interior was empty we ordered a plate of large prawns and a couple of dressed crab and two beers i have to admit you surprised me she said by calling you up i surprised myself too well yes that but i meant you surprised me by being a policeman i dont look like one the ones you see are taken over by their jackboots and sunglasses the ones you dont people like you in the policia judiciaria i dont know i imagined them to be stern hard men weary too i was weary weary of life weary of the worst aspects of life you were tired the beers arrived i offered her a cigarette and she sneered at the ultralights and took out a pack of fullstrength marlboro she lit the cigarettes with a petrol zippo which she buffed on the tablecloth as she looked into the treelined street outside she rested her chin on the heel of her hand and smoked and thought about something that made her eyes greener ive always thought she said that if you want to be sad lisbon is the place to do it and youre sad i meant melancholy thats better but im sad too sitting up there in front of my computer on the first beautiful sunday afternoon of summer but youre not any more youre right she said and shook her head to get rid of it her strange and large earrings bounced off her cheeks the earrings i asked i have a friend who makes jewellery out of restaurant detritus these were made out of the gold netting from a wine bottle i saw the spoons yesterday the spoons she said her mind still elsewhere on the beach with somebody else maybe she went back to the window you know why lisbons a sad place i said its never recovered from its history something terrible happened here which marked the place for ever all those shaded narrow alleyways the dark gardens the cypresses around the cemeteries the steep cobbled streets the black and white calcada in the squares the views out over the red roofs to the slow river and the ocean theyve never shrugged off the fact that almost the entire population of the city was wiped out in an earthquake that happened nearly years ago silence her chin pivoted on the heel of her hand she blinked at me twice what had i done poetic police she said the igreja do carmo can you think of anywhere else in the world where theyve left the skeleton of a cathedral in the heart of the city as a monument to all those that died no she said after a moments thought hiroshima i said that was the scale of it do you think hiroshima will ever be a happy place pensive police she said and this time not joking i can do pitiless police as well i said thinking hiroshima was not date talk all right i gave her my deadeyed look reserved for lying mothermurderers she shuddered how many other police have you got in there pleasant police i said giving her my bornagainchristian smile i dont believe pleasant police i slumped in my chair head on chest and that the police that everybody wants to see posthumous police youve got a diseased brain it helps with the job the waiter put the prawns and crab down we ordered two more beers we ate the prawns i liked her she sucked the heads out ladylike or not she didnt give a damn you dont look like a schoolteacher i said because im not im the worst teacher i know i love kids but i have no patience im too aggressive two more weeks and im out into what she sized me up for a second to see if i was worth telling what she had to say whether she wanted to go that far yet ive been resisting it for some time but now im going to do it im going to run one of my fathers businesses she sucked hard on a prawn head smacked her lips wiped them and drank threefifths of her beer down in three gulps just one of them i asked and she stopped wiping her hands to check me for irony im ambitious she said tossing her napkin to one side the waiter lowered two more beers in front of us for what for a life in which most if not all the decisions are my own is this a recent development she smiled and looked down at the shattered prawn shells on her plate was that perceptive police i finished my first beer and started on the second have you been in business before i worked for my father for four years after university we had a fight were the same type i left and went to do a doctorate on what was that deaf police i told you yesterday remember i was concentrating on other things i know she said and suddenly quantum mechanics came back into my life i was aware of every photon between us your turn to be perceptive i said the economics of salazar she said slowly the portuguese economy from we dont have to discuss it now do we not unless you can do it on your own which of your fathers businesses are you going to run he owns a publishing company what does it publish too many male writers not enough fiction no genre fiction like crime or romance no childrens books i want to change all that i want to get people who dont read to read get them hooked grow them the portuguese take literature like their foodseriously youre a policeman and youve never read a crime novel im worried its going to be as boring as the real thing and if it isnt it wont ring true youre missing the point a thirteenyearold will never read jose saramago but give him a crime novel and by the time hes seventeen he will and then whatll happen to our great footballing nation theyll be wellread footballers she said and laughed a deep dirty laugh that probably came from smoking marlboro but what the hell it made my chest boom my spine prickle we ate the crabs drank more beer and talked about books films actors celebrities drugs fame success and i ordered a lobster split and grilled and luisa said shed pay for a vinho verde soalheiro alvarinho which had more spunk to it than any vinho verde ive ever tasted so we ordered a second bottle and drank that down in flashing gulps and two and a half hours after wed arrived we fell out of the air conditioning and into the hot empty street with no traffic no people and the trees still in the siesta silence we walked arm in arm at the door of her apartment building she grabbed hold of my wrist and halfpulled me up the stairs she only let go to get her keys out and then we were in the dark corridor kissing and she kicked the door shut with a bang so loud glasses tinkled in the kitchen cupboards she led me through the living room walking out of her sandals into her bedroom where she turned and yanked the shirt out of my trousers and ran her hands up my chest she shrugged and the straps fell off her shoulders and the dress to the floor she tore my jeans down my thighs i wrestled out of my shirt she gripped me through my undershorts and looked up with eyes that dared me she pulled the shorts out and over and stripped down her own panties i pulled her to me and she jumped and wrapped her legs around my waist crooked an arm around my neck she lowered herself slowly her pubic hair scratching my belly impossibly hot heat beyond human tolerance until we connected and she held herself there until we were both trembling shuddering she straightened her arms and leaned back smiling at me smiling at my agony and as we fell on to the bed i felt like the surfer who feels the big wave hump underneath him tons of ocean drawn up the surge the roll the terrific speed and monumental collapse the traffic woke us the lisboans coming home at dusk wordlessly we crawled into each other and made love again the mirror looked darkly on a red light passed across the scrap of velvet sky visible from the open window followed by the sound of thumping helicopter blades the room smelled of sexsweat perfume and something sweet like berry juice smeared on skin life felt suddenly rich the city ripe the room winedark and full of easy complex possibilities i dont know how i got myself out of her apartment there was a brief leaden moment and i was in the car heading out of the city through the darkening monsanto park with her body smell still on me and something unfurling in my chest like the sails of a flotilla setting out the earth felt solid under my feet in paco de arcos as i let myself into the house i had that feeling of money in the bank and a fridge full of food neither of which was true it was pm there was a light on in the kitchen and voices olivia was tucked tight under the kitchen table listening to faustinho a local fisherman who was sprawled on a chair well back from the table barely within reach of his beer he was working himself up into a lather about the government the european unions fishing quotas and benfica in ascending order he struggled to his feet when i came in olivia looked relieved tired we kissed you smell different she said and went to bed faustinho grey as a wolf tossed his beer back and put an arm around my shoulder come he said you have to see this boy he saw something the other night itll help with your investigation you must talk to him have you got any money we walked to the gardens and through the underpass to the car park on the other side of the marginal faustinho strode ahead looking under boats in the sheds i lagged behind enjoying some purposelessness whats the rush i shouted after him its been an hour already he said i thought you said he was bedding down for the night hes a street kid anything could have happened maybe he got scared you didnt tell him i was the police no no but ive been gone an hour and maybe he starts thinking you know this kid ive seen him before skinny little bugger hes got some black in him too wears a jacket two sizes too big for him we searched the boatyard and car park nothing i sat on the keel of a boat and smoked and looked out to sea feeling useful we went back to a bandeira vermelha and drank aguardente distilled from vinho verde that antonio had brought down from the minho in fivelitre flagons faustinho gave another longer description of the kid having persuaded himself that i didnt believe him antonio and i leaned into each other on either side of the bar and looked impassively on as faustinho measured the kid up with the aid of his own shoulder i strolled home in the warm night i hovered at the bottom of the attic stair tempted i went into the bedroom stripped and got between the sheets naked still with her smell on me chapter xxix th july pensao isadora praca da alegria lisbon manuel abrantes woke up with a jerk staring at the threadbare central panel of the bedside carpet his moustache was full of sweat his head confused by alcohol gone bad in his brain he didnt know the room until the smell of cheap perfume made it through his dense nasal hair and a light snoring at his back reminded him some more he looked over his shoulder trying to remember a face or a name neither came to him she was young and a little fat she was lying on her back the sheet down around her waist her breasts were widely spaced and had slipped down her ribs under her armpits she had a light moustache her alentejana accent came back to him he got up wiped the sweat out of his moustache and was repelled by the smell of the girl still on him he found a towel and went down the corridor to the bathroom he showered under a trickle of tepid water standing up in a castiron bath a small headache had emerged which didnt bother him and a sore penis which did they always tell you theyre clean but he dressed his shirt was in a ghastly state yesterday the weather had been torrid and hed drunk too much and that had made him sweat doubly hed have to go to work via the family house in lapa and pick up a fresh shirt a suit too this one was trampled to death he looked like a broken salesman rather than an agente de i classe in the policia international e de defesa do estado pide and still not even twentytwo years old he clicked a coin down on the bedside table and left he looked for his car in the praca da alegria until he remembered hed left it up in the bairro alto he walked down rua da gloria and caught the funicular up the hill and found his car parked on rua dom pedro v he drove to lapa the house was silent the rest of the family were in the estoril villa for the summer he shaved showered moved his bowels massively and changed into fresh clothes which felt cool around his chafed penis he straightened himself up in the mirror pulled his shirt loose over his gut and then tucked it back in again undecided which looked better he had wanted to be at his best for this days work and it had all started badly but he hoped hed pulled himself back on track now he drove out on to the marginal and noticed for the first time on the outskirts of the city that the air was fresher and purer after five days of brutal swelter the sea was blue again the sky clear and the twin steel towers of the ponte salazar the new suspension bridge being built across the tagus were pinsharp in the flat calm of the estuary the workmen were already out on the massive concrete ramp preparing to string the first cable across the river he stopped off in belem to take a coffee and a pastel de nata in the antiga confeitaria he ate three and smoked a cigarette now that his body was clean and his stomach sweetened he began to relish his work hed been with the pide for two and a half years and hadnt regretted a moment hed spent his first year in the pide headquarters in rua antonio maria cardoso in the chiado district of lisbon where hed demonstrated to his superiors a natural talent for the work they didnt even have to tell him how to recruit informers he knew he found out peoples weaknesses he implied pide interest in their activities and then saved them from arrest and the dreaded caxias prison by bringing them into his network it surprised him that his most significant weapon was charm hed thought he was devoid of it but hed learnt more than hed thought from his elder brother pedro and now that he was in a new world where he had no history he could use what previously hed only observed it was so facile charm was just a question of demeanour if he smiled people liked him the smiling made his longlashed bluegreen eyes shine which attracted their attention while his moustache made him appear genial and his thinning hair gave him an air of vulnerability so that overall people trusted him he never made the mistake of despising people for this because he was so glad to be liked he just made sure that his superiors knew that this carefully crafted exterior concealed a ruthless persistence an unflinching severity and an unswerving relish for following through manuel asked the barman at the antiga confeitaria to make up a packet of six pastels de nata he crushed out his cigarette paid and drove to the caxias prison in his first year at the pide headquarters hed been particularly successful at rooting out dissent in the university it had been easier than hed expected his brother was at the university he was very popular his friends were constantly in the house manuel listened he took down names and fed them into his network he did more recruiting he cajoled threatened and manipulated until by the end of he had compiled dossiers on two professors who would never work again and eight students whose futures were over before theyd even begun his superiors were impressed his father wanted him to root out all the union men and communists from his factories and was annoyed to find that he didnt have the influence over this institution that hed come to expect elsewhere manuel was moved to the interrogation centre in the caxias prison where the estado novo detained their more serious more politically active dissidents these people needed more persuasive methods to encourage them to help pide uncover the network of communist cells threatening not just the stability of the government but the countrys whole way of life the first months in caxias were spent honing his interrogation skills partly through practice but initially by watching more experienced men through a recently installed twoway mirror the new mirror excited manuel it brought back memories of childhood he liked to sit close to it almost with his nose touching and sometimes with the prisoners face pressed right up against it on the other side the pleasure was exquisite almost sexual for him to openly observe without being seen a mans shattered face as he was brought to the limits of his endurance this was another part of the trainingthe breakingdown of the prisoner the preferred method was a combination of sleep deprivation and random beatings they had installed sound equipment which with little supervision could keep a prisoner awake for days they still used the old method the statue where the prisoner was made to lean against a wall his bodyweight supported by his fingertips but it was timeconsuming and required regular beatings and therefore manpower manuel parked up outside the fort he put his jacket on picked up his briefcase and the cakes and remembered with a thrill the reason why hed bought the girl the night before and why hed particularly wanted one with an alentejana accent he showed his pass which the guard ignored he walked across the inner courtyard to the interrogation centre waiting for him in his office was jorge raposo an overweight twentyoneyearold from caldas da rainha who was an agente de classe he was talking to another agente about an english pop group called the beatles and their new single called cant buy me love jorge was translating the tide into portuguese but he shut up when manuel came in and the other agent slipped out after a hurried bom dia whats his problem asked manuel laying his briefcase down and the packet of cakes jorge shrugged and eyed the cakes we havent got to the stage where were reporting each other for listening to pop music jorge shrugged again lit a cigarette and turned the box of matches over and over on his desk so you like the beatles said manuel sure said jorge sitting back and blowing smoke at the ceiling she loves me yeah yeah yeah said manuel in english to show he was groovy too she loves you said jorge what she loves you yeah yeah yeah not me manuel grunted and sat at his desk and laid his hands down flat jorge regretted correcting him now he thought it might have an impact on the cake situation what have we got today asked manuel jorge stuck his cigarette back into the corner of his mouth and looked down at his papers wondering how he could remedy the situation the name sprang off the page theres always that maria antonia medinas girl said jorge who saw immediately that hed hit the right button ah yes said manuel frowning as if hed forgotten her the girl from reguengos the one with the blonde hair the blue eyes and i thought they were all arabs out there said manuel you know dusky moorish she certainly isnt said jorge licking his lips shut up jorge and have a cake said manuel quickly jorge opened up the packet and took two god theyre good he said we should bring some cinnamon to the office get them to bring up the medinas girl said manuel jorge reached for the internal phone do you want to talk to her or no no ill watch this time said manuel the girl stood in the interrogation room jorge moved her up close to the mirror manuel looked into her face haggard now from lack of sleep the blue eyes were dark and sunken she blinked frequently in the harsh striplit room her hair was beginning to grease up she was scared but keeping it to herself manuel felt pity and admiration she stood with her shoulders square in a tightfitting grey top with four buttons that started between her jutting breasts and finished at her neck she wore a grey calflength skirt and a pair of black pumps she was neat and still looked clean apart from her hair jorge began with the same litany of questions he wanted to know about the copies of the communist rag avante which had been found in her possession as shed tried to board a ferry in cais do sodre her answers were the same she didnt know anything shed picked up the packet by mistake they werent given to her she didnt know about any clandestine printing operations she didnt know any names she didnt know any addresses of safe houses jorge grilled her for two hours she stuck rigidly to her story when jorges questions flagged and she began to drift into sleep hed slap her awake and make her stand in the crucifix position and do kneebends until she was sobbing after the third hour jorge had her sent back down to the cells the political side of the prison was overcrowded and theyd had to put the sleep deprivation equipment in one of the cells in the longterm block for criminals the guard took her down strapped her on to the hard wooden bench and clamped the earphones over her head felsen watched through a crack in the grille of his cell door such comings and goings were interesting to a man to whom nothing had happened for two years and to see a woman too jorge and manuel went out to lunch they ate fish drank a bottle of white wine and two bagacos each in the afternoon they interrogated a further four prisoners at five oclock jorge went home manuel went down to the sound room he took the keys from the guard and let himself in to the narrow cell maria antonia medinas lay on the board convulsing under the straps the noise pounding through her head was faintly audible from the door manuel turned the machine off her body stilled he leaned over her hands clasped behind his back the good doctor she looked wild confused and frightened like a carcrash survivor staring up through a shattered windscreen muscles twitched her breasts heaved manuel lifted off the earphones she swallowed hard he brushed the hank of hair off her forehead which was clammy cold with sweat he wiped his soft dry palms together slowly and sat on the edge of the bed he smiled without showing his teeth the good fattier the sick child its been hard he said in the softest most calming voice he could find i know how its been but its over now you can go to sleep a long deep sleep then well have a little talk and youll see after that everything will be all right he patted her cheek her lids dropped her mouth crinkled oddly and a tear crept down her cheek he wiped it away with his thumb her eyes opened he could see her gratitude dont say anything yet he said you sleep first well have time plenty of time later her eyes closed and her mouth slackened in her face he replaced the silent headphones over her ears he left her and instructed the guard that nobody was to go into the cell manuel drove west to estoril he felt good he felt happy for once he wanted the company of family they ate dinner together his father pica and pedro there was a festive mood in the house with eve rybody finding their appetite again after the days of brutal swelter they all agreed to go up to the cool of the mountains in the beira for holidays in august manuel slept until his alarm at am he woke up with a leap in his heart a strangling excitement he dressed and made a cheese sandwich with the best queijo da serra and drove back to the caxias prison the guard was playing cards on a different floor and it took some time for manuel to find him and get the keys he let himself into the cell and relocked the door he heard her rhythmical breathing he undid the straps on the bed the girl rolled on her side and curled up he sat and rested his hand on her hip he shook her shoulder she whimpered he kept at it jiggling her small shoulderbone between his thumb and forefinger she came awake with a desperate sigh she rolled and her eyes snapped open straight into fear dont be scared he said holding up his hands showing no weapons no intent she pushed herself up the bed and sat with her back to the wall her knees tucked up under her chin one of her shoes was missing he retrieved it from the floor he put it next to her bare foot she slipped into it she remembered this man the kind one the one to watch i have something for you he said and gave her the cheese sandwich wrapped in a paper napkin water she said hoarsely he found the guards clay pitcher full of cool water she drank heavily the spout of the pitcher not once touching her lips water spilled over her lip and dripped down her chin darkening a patch on the top of her left breast she checked the inside of the sandwich and ate it then she drank again not knowing when the kindness was going to stop manuel offered her a cigarette she didnt smoke he lit one himself and paced the room he gave her the last pastel de nata hed bought that morning she wolfed it she rested the back of her head against the wall hes strange this one she thought but theyre all the same underneath manuel suddenly sat down close to her so that she inched back her feet he crushed out the cigarette with his foot he looked at her throat what do you do in reguengos he asked im a loom operator i make mantas blankets is the factory closed for the summer no they gave me time off to come and see my uncle she tried to take it back once it was out shed never spoken about the uncle before manuel noted it but ignored the obvious it would all come out in the end she clasped her fingers together around her knees as if that would stop other things leaking out you have to watch this one theres a big fair for mantas down south somewhere isnt there asked manuel castro verde ive never been theres not much call for mantas from lisboans she said and he felt a little stupid its true its true he said im from the beira myself i know hows that the cheese in the sandwich she said to show him she was sharp again my father has it brought down and all the chouricos morcelas and presuntos the best in portugal without a doubt theres nothing wrong with a good paio alentejano the heat the heats not good for it it sharpens the meat we have ways of keeping things cool of course the cork and the cork oak produces acorns which feed the pigs which makes you could be right he said enjoying himself talking like this with a woman we only think of the heat when we talk of the alentejo and communists she thought and the wine she said yes excellent tinto but i prefer dao you would coming from up there when this is all over you should let me show you he let the sentence drift she stiffened inside and looked intensely at the mans ear he was staring across the room smiling he turned their eyes connected when whats all over she asked this resistance whose resistance to what your resistance he said and looked down he ran a finger and thumb around her slim ankle and then drew them down her foot to the rim of her shoe the touch shot panic up to her throat she wanted to squeal she pressed her head back into the wall closed her eyes for a moment to gather herself he smiled at her when she reopened her eyes he was closer his soft face moving closer his full red lips under the moustache parted filho da puta she said under her breath but they were so close her breath mingled with his and he reared back as if shed slapped him things happened in the mans face the softness went the jaw bunched the eyes closed a fraction and walled over his large soft hand reached over her knees and grabbed a twist of her blonde greasy hair he yanked her head round so sharply her body was forced to follow she was kneeling on the edge of the bed her neck stretched back he pushed her face into the corner his thick fist bunched in the back of her head a hand reached round and wrenched the skirt out from under her knees her voice left her nothing would come up over her voice box her cheekbones hurt where he forced her face into the corner she felt her skirt come up over her thighs she lashed out with her fist behind her he pulled her head back and thudded her face into the wall her skirt was around her waist he tore at her underwear like a feral animal it had gone green inside her head and she couldnt get things straight any more there was only one moment when she managed the faintest cry of the smallest child in the night pain flashed between her legs her body jolted her forehead thumped into the wall it was over in less than a minute she slid off the bed on to the floor her face cold against the rough concrete floor she vomited the cheese sandwich and water he tried to pull her up but she was a dead weight he kicked her in the stomach harder than hed intended something like an organ seemed to break inside her he grabbed hold of her leg and hair and pushed a knee into her belly and heaved her up on to the bed the pain reached right up to the top of the inside of her head he rolled her over strapped her down replaced the earphones breathing heavily he pinched his nose with thumb and forefinger and flicked a hank of sweat and snot on to the floor he turned on the sound machine her body strained he zipped up his fly with a short sharp jerk he picked up the pitcher and left the cell as he relocked the door the flesh at the back of his neck began to crawl he heard his name whispered softly over and over manuel manuel manuel the cell corridor was empty he shuddered picked up the pitcher and nearly ran back to the guards empty chair he drove back to the house in lapa needing to be quiet and alone he drank heavily aguardente directly from the bottle he slept deeply and horribly until late he was woken by the sun streaming through the undrawn curtains the clap of the palm trees in a nearby garden the noise of children playing his face was hot swollen and sweaty his insides felt black he showered and soaped himself until his body squeaked but he couldnt get shot of the blackness in his gut he drove to belem and had a coffee but couldnt get a pastel de nata down his constricted throat he was an hour and a half late getting to work jorge raposo was waiting for him weve got a problem he said and manuels black guts ran cavecold do we the medinas girl shes dead dead he said the blood vacating his head so that he had to sit down the guard found her this morning blood everywhere he said waving a hand distastefully around the genital area has the doctor seen her thats how we know shes dead she miscarried died of internal and by the looks of it external bleeding miscarried did we know she was pregnant no we didnt and by the way the boss wants to see you narciso jorge shrugged and looked at manuels hands no cakes today major virgilio duarte narciso eased the phone back on to its cradle and smoked the last inch of his cigarette as if each drag was lacerating his lungs manuel had been trying to cross his legs but he was in such a sweat that the material stuck to every inch of his lower limbs and he just couldnt get one over the other his boss the major rubbed the end of his large brown nose as thick as the thumb of a bodng glove with every pore visible as if theyd been pricked there youre being transferred he said but in this matter there is no argument the orders have come down from the director himself you are to head a team responsible for bringing that charlatan general machedo to justice weve had an intelligence report that he is over in spain preparing another coup attempt you are being promoted to chefe de brigada with immediate effect and you will be briefed by the director himself this afternoon in lisbon there what do you think of that you dont look very happy agente abrantes manuel still found himself staring into the cold crevasse of his own thoughts im honoured he stammered i thought i was too young for such a promotion the major closed an eye and looked at him shrewdly caxias is no place for a man of your ability i thought you wanted to see me about the medinas girl whos she she died in her cell last night miscarried internal bleeding the beat of silence was broken by the phone ringing it jolted them both and the major yanked it to his ear his secretary informed him that his son jaime had been taken to hospital with a broken wrist after falling out of a tree major narciso hung up mesmerized by the space between himself and manuel until he refocused once more manuel tried and failed to swallow ah said narciso finally crushing out the cigarette whose end was stinging his nail one less communist for us to worry about on february th manuel abrantes was having dinner in a small restaurant in badajoz in spain no more than two kilometres from the portuguese border his two fellowdiners were enjoying themselves and manuel himself was a mask of geniality in two hours time he and his two companions would be taking a short walk to a dark place for a meeting with a portuguese army officer from the barracks in estremoz who would outline the strategy which could be the beginning of a new life for eight million portuguese manuels two dinner companions were general machedo and his secretary paulo abreu this meeting had taken six months to bring off not to mention the four previous years pide had spent infiltrating the top echelons of general machedos entourage manuel had arrived at the best possible time hed brought fresh ideas to a man whod spent the best part of a decade in exile hed cured the melancholia that surrounded the general and had infected him with a new optimism around manuel the general had begun to believe in a future the february night was cold and the heating in the restaurant inadequate they sat in their coats and drank brandy to quell the shivers at pm a man came in and drank a coffee at their table fifteen minutes later they put on their hats and made the short twohundredmetre walk to the churchyard where the meeting was supposed to take place there was a halfmoon in a freezing clear sky and they had no trouble seeing their way the man whod come to their table walked a few metres ahead of them the men didnt speak the generals shoulders were hunched against the cold inside the churchyard the man told them to wait in a narrow passage between some marble mausoleums the general looked through the window of one and remarked on the smallness of the coffins they must have been children said his secretary which were his last words a hammer struck him on the back of the head and his forehead broke the glass in the mausoleum door the general stepped back shocked and found two men on his shoulders his hands were lifted out of his pockets and held behind him he watched in horror as his secretary was strangled in front of him even in his unconscious state paulo abreu struggled to hold on his legs straightening and straightening until they were still and the feet slack the general was forced to his knees the man whod come to the restaurant removed a handgun from one pocket and a silencer from the other he screwed them together and handed the piece to chefe de brigada manuel abrantes who looked down at the general whose hat had fallen off in front of him the face the whole body of the old man was suddenly completely exhausted the general shook his head but his neck couldnt support it and it sank on to his chest we must have been children he said bitterly manuel abrantes placed the muzzle of the silencer on the back of the generals head and squeezed the trigger there was a dull thud and the man shot forward with such force that his arms were torn from the grip of the two pide men manuel handed the gun back to the agente he reached down to the general and felt for a neck pulse there was nothing where are the graves he asked the man with the gun walked down the corridor of mausoleums and turned left to a corner of the churchyard the holes were barely a foot deep what the hell is this said manuel the ground was too hard bloody idiots chapter xxx monday th june avenida duque de avila saldanha lisbon by am i was washed inexpertly shaved suited and standing outside the liceu d dinis on the corner of duque de avila and republica enjoying the early cool of the day id woken up at am wanting it to be my summer holiday with nothing to think about other than book choice beach position and lunch the photos in my pocket of catarina oliveira jolted me back on to the rails i was going to work on the streets around the school to see if there was anything in jamie gallachers car pickup story i had a bica in the pastelaria sequeira on the corner opposite the art nouveau school building and asked myself if i felt lucky i had to after a weekend like that and immediately i drew a blank from the staff of the pastelaria i went up to the cafe bella italia whose barman had seen catarina come in for a coffee after the session in the pensao nuno it wasnt the same barman as on saturday but he pointed me to an old woman who sat in the window its her first shift he said morning lunchtime end of the afternoon nothing happens on that stretch of pavement that she doesnt know about i spoke to her the skin of her face was like crepe paper she wore white gloves with a single button at the wrist a heavily pleated blue dress and hefty white leather lowheeled shoes she nodded at the photo of the girl shed seen her with a man that fitted jamie gallachers description they were not happy she said and returned the photo fifty metres down the street from the bella italia was the traffic light where avenida de outubro crossed duque de avila this was the point where jamie gallacher said catarina got into the car the crossroads was surrounded by apartment and office buildings this was a place of work at that time of the afternoon there must have been plenty of people on the street heading for their weekend i went to the bus stop opposite the bella italia as the time approached am more people arrived if gallacher had hit the girl there must have been someone on this side of the street whod been at the bus stop and seen it marshalling portuguese people is not an easy thing to do even when theyre from the same family and heading for lunch but when theyre getting off a bus on the way to work they become a thunderous herd but i was lucky that day and so was jamie gallacher i found a twentyfiveyearold marketing executive who worked for an international computer company on de outubro shed seen the man hit the girl and walk away down duque de avila she saw three cars pull up at the traffic light the first was small and silver the second one was large and dark the third white the driver of the second car dimly visible behind tinted glass had leaned across the seat and shouted out of the window the girl had come off the pavement theyd talked briefly the lights had changed the silver car took off and the girl got into the passenger seat the car had crossed avenida de outubro and headed in the direction of the gulbenkian museum and the museum of modern art complex did you see what make of car it was i was looking at the girl most of the time she said id seen him slap her face and if hed gone after her id have done something but he didnt he fell back on a car and its alarm went off the car the girl got into did it look expensive it was new the windows were tinted thats all i can tell you you can talk to my work colleague who was with me hes a guy hell know about the car the womans work colleague remembered the car without a doubt he said it was a black mercedes if i send you some mercedes brochures do you think you could give me a series type and a model number he shrugged his eyebrows i took down their telephone numbers and walked back to the policia judiciaria building i took a slight detour so that i could walk the length of rua actor taborda and look up at luisas attic window i knew she wasnt there but i wanted to enjoy feeling young and foolish i succeeded on one count only i went to the personnel department in the pj building to follow up jorges lead on the private detective whod been sniffing around after catarina in the pensao nuno i asked one of the older guys if he knew of any retired policemen who were currently engaged in private work he gave me a list of six names do you know any of these guys to look at most of them if i havent seen them in the flesh ive seen their photographs short stocky grey hair no facial hair brown eyes wears a black brimmed hat which he never takes off lourenco goncalves he was bald and had a red birthmark on the back of his head which was why he never took the hat off have you got a number for him he told me to try the phone book and gave me the full name i went up to my office carlos had the search warrant for valentims garage unit i sent him out to get the mercedes brochures and take them round to the computer company i had jamie gallacher brought up from the tacos i called lourenco goncalves apartment in benfica there was no reply i pumped gallacher for more information on the car he was in poor shape but relieved and keen to help when i saw invention begin to play behind his eyes i sent him back to the cells i sat down and in an hour and a half wrote a sixpage report on the investigation carlos came back towards the end of that time and said that the car had been identified as a c series i rounded off the report collected the statements together and sent them up to narciso i tried goncalves again still no reply he must have a place of business i dropped it for the moment by am i was sitting in front of narciso watching him smoke his sg gigantes and finger my report as if it might be worth something he went to the window he was a small man in his midforties who took such care over his appearance that youd have thought he was due on television at any moment even in high humidity he could always get his shirts to puff out at the back and the creases down his arms were never anything less than bladesharp he looked more powerful and cooler than any policeman in the building hows it going with agente pinto he asked something id forgotten about already theres nothing wrong with agente pinto hell make a good detective answer the question will you inspector nobody likes him i know and you do i have no problem with him i heard there was a fight across the street on saturday night your hand you cut your hand and that fight wasnt his first im surprised to hear you like him thats all he has a difficult personality but it doesnt bother me narciso turned his smooth handsome face on me it had darkened a few shades over the sunny weekend but it hadnt warmed him uphe was still and chill as always the one concern i have about your report is this spurious allegation from senhora oliveira about child abuse i presume she didnt make a formal complaint no she didnt he said she died yesterday silence the air conditioning reached my bone marrow you make that sound like natural causes he shook his head overdose he said she was found in her car parked on a street insao joao do estoril about three hundred metres from a friends house where shed

account for every minute of his saturday night which brings us back to your report the allegation you mean an allegation made to the wrong person on an informal basis with no supporting evidence by an unstable woman with a history of barbiturate dependency has the maid said anything not that i know of you dont think it warrants inclusion in the report that was a good days work inspector lets see what valentim almeidas garage unit produces i want to see your report on that and the interview with him afterwards i grabbed carlos signed out a car from the pool and headed north to odivelas we sat in a traffic jam on campo grande for half an hour i told him about teresa oliveira which silenced us for several minutes horns blared indifferently techno music thumped loudly from behind tinted windows adjacent youre right about olivia he said seeing as we were following a van with that name on the back are we talking about my daughter now shes different halfportuguese threequarters english i said what did she talk to you about she told me about a kid at her school who has his own range rover that doesnt sound like her to be impressed she wasnt thats what i meant shes different she asked me what i thought a seventeenyearold kid with a range rover could aspire to a test questionwhat did you say i said it could leave him free to aspire to greater things than more material wealth did she buy that no he said she thought hed already been corrupted it was good i found i was arguing against myself for once she likes that i said looking across at his face staring resolutely out of the windscreen ideas arguing intellectual aggression its something she rarely sees in girls her own age what would you call her i got his attention a chicken with giblets i asked the traffic jam unlocked the vertebrae of metal snake stretched the techno music behind the tinted glass took off other things were playing on carlos mind you were in there a long time he said what are we talking about now with narciso he said was that all you talked about senhora oliveiras suicide and her allegation against her husband anything else about the investigation in general he hedged he asked how we were getting on too carlos hand tightened around the ceiling grip i suppose he knew about the fight he said not your first by all accounts i had one with fernandes in vice i dont know fernandes i said what happened fernandes is a pig he said jutting his face at the windscreen he had something going with some pimps and their girls he wanted to initiate me into his little score i refused he asked me if little boys was more my thing and i hit him youve got to try and lengthen that fuse of yours you know i overdid it too i punched him in the gut and he didnt get off the floor for fifteen minutes i was transferred away from him the next day im glad we didnt get that far id never have hit you you had every right to be angry when i told my father what id said to you he damn nearly beat me up himself he sounds a good man hes a hard proud alentejano who still eats pigs tail and ears at christmas boiled or what no no grilled he must be a hard man it was lunchtime when we arrived at the garage units and most of the others were closed only a tyre shop was doing any business we let ourselves in through the small door and walked into a black partition wall and the smell of death the lights didnt work we took out pen torches carlos squeezed past a wooden staircase and went through a black curtain underneath i went up the stairs carlos gagged at the smell getting stronger i came out on to a platform in the roof gable i still couldnt find the fuse box for the unit there was an expensive piece of computer equipment a video camera and a television along the wall were seven polystyrene heads with wigs all the eyes had been burnt out with cigarette ends porra said carlos fucking hell what this stink ive found it theres some dead chicks down here chicks thats what i said and a snake a very unhappy snake i dont like snakes is it in a cage do you think id be talking like this if it wasnt im coming down i joined him in a threewalled stage set at the back of the set there were seven pairs of stilettos three rubber dresses a bed a chest a moped a spare can of petrol and a tool board have you seen whats missing from the tool board asked carlos from the outline a shorthandled heavy lump hammer was missing lets find the electrics theres a box over there by the moped near the floor turn it on and lets take a look at valentims oeuvre carlos stepped over the chest and opened up the box he flicked the main switch and dropped four others there was a loud crack and four powerful halogen lights came on overhead shit yelled carlos this is out get out the studio lights suddenly went out sucking us back into a more intense darkness except the darkness wasnt total around the electrics box were yellow flames carlos crashed over the moped i ran at the black partition and dropped my shoulder into it it collapsed and i tore it away from the wall carlos was at my back when i heard the low thump of the spare can of petrol catching alight and i ripped the door open we fell out into the parking area followed by smoke and flames i got into the car and reversed it away from the unit carlos called the fire brigade i sat on the car bonnet in the shade of the units opposite and watched d burn carlos was wild sweating still scared and pacing up and down in front of the car he boobytrapped it are you sure no im not sure i didnt have enough time to check the fucking wiring diagram calma pa calma you saw what happened im asking you i threw the switches the thing started fizzing sparks everywhere there seemed to be petrol the smell of petrol from the moped or a boobytrap why dont we go and ask him at pm we were sitting in an interview room with valentim playing the air guitar his eyes closed in simulated ecstasy i introduced the cast to the tape recorder and asked valentim to give his full name and address he complied without stopping his guitar practice do you like film i asked movies making them with film or do you prefer video i like film i didnt see any in your studio just video i suppose its cheap but it gives an ugly effect you have to light everything or you lose it thats the problem films more subtle even millimetre but its expensive there are other problems too arent there valentim stopped playing his guitar he tapped a single finger on the table keeping time in his head waiting what other problems you have to develop the film edit it make a master print telecine that on to a videotape and then make your copies like i said its expensive he nodded and not private either thats true but if you go the video way theres a heavy initial investment you have to come up with what thirty million escudos you dont know anything about computer equipment do you inspector tell me that edit suite was a million escudos he said cheap isnt it youd be a long time working in mcdonalds to put that sort of money together if you thought that was the best way of raising it how did you like normal people i went to the bank and they dont mind lending to a student im not a policeman inspector coelho its not a compulsion of mine to be totally honest about who i am and what i do banks want to lend money theyve got a lot of it interest rates are going to come down when we join the euro ill make the repayments what do they care how many movies did you make of catarina asked carlos silence dont make us go through your whole collection you wouldnt enjoy it how do you know you dont seem to have a very artistic temperament just tell us how many films three they were silent movies not pornography sorry agente pinto to disappoint you were talking art are we with baby chicks a snake rubber dresses take a look id be interested in your opinion what were the three films of her face looking into camera that sounds interesting she had a very special look which was thats why it was special said valentim staring at me what did this look say to you this seems to have gone from interrogation to therapy now carlos snapped im going to bust you you piece of shit he said quietly im going to bust you for murder then youve got a job on your hands agente pinto because i did not kill her wheres the hammer the hammer from your tool board it was missing it should be in there somewhere take another look silence while valentim played a drum solo on the table where were you on friday afternoon asked carlos desperation creeping in i told you tell us again i went to the biblioteca nacional i stayed there until closing time which is seventhirty go and ask the librarian we had an argument she wouldnt let me use the computer after seven oclock do you know anybody with a c series black mercedes valentim laughed and frowned i didnt borrow that much money from the bank how do you make your repayments i work i sell my videos i make money pornography like i said you dont have a very artistic temperament perhaps its something to do with your work it must be quite boring carlos fist was already closed i should stop the tape recorder if i were you inspector coelho agente pinto wants to resort to more conventional police methods i terminated the interview at a few minutes before carlos and i walked to duque de avila hes involved said carlos still furious i know hes involved we should have asked him if he boobytrapped the switchbox just to see his face i think hed humiliated us enough by then well let the fire department give us that bit of information by pm we were working the bus queues on either side of duque de avila showing photographs of catarina it was an advertisement for not committing crime because theres always somebody out there whos seen you four people saw catarina get into the black mercedes one guy remembered it like it was one of the best scenes from his favourite movie the car in front was a metallic grey fiat punto the black mercedes was a c series petrol engine with the letters nt in the registration the car behind it was an old white renault with a rusted rear wheelarch and the car that jamie gallacher fell against was i told him that hed given us more than we needed and took his name i sent carlos back to the policia judiciaria and told him to give the information to traffic i also gave him lourenco goncalves name and told him to find a business address and phone number and i did what id wanted to do all dayi went to my favourite apartment in rua actor taborda chapter xxxi th april rua do ouro baixa lisbon joaquim abrantes stood in the dark in front of the open window it was late close to midnight his wife pica lay on the chaise longue playing with the dial of the radio trying to find some entertainment that didnt drive her husband into a frenzy shed almost lost the radio to the street below once already when shed come across some foreign station and picked up the rolling stones singing angie at a sudden full volume turn it off hed yelled i hear music like that and i think its the end of the world what are we doing here anyway shed asked annoyed why dont we go home and relax in lapa youre always like this when youre on top of your work im worried hed said but didnt take it any further she settled for a local station called radio renascenca she recognized the voice of jose vasconcelos whom shed met several times when shed been in the business abrantes grumbled again he didnt like music it offended his inner workings he smoked from one of four cigarettes he had going in various ashtrays around the room and now introduced the quiet voice on the radio zeca afonso sings grandola vila morena i dont know what you have to worry about im worried said abrantes crushing a butt out into another ashtray and picking up a lit cigarette from it because something is happening somethings happening said pica with mock astonishment nothings happening nothing ever happens manuel told me he thought something was going to happen what does he know said pica whod never liked manuel hes an inspector with pide if he doesnt know nobody knows im going to call him its after midnight joaquim turn that radio off said abrantes hearing the lyrics now that zeca afonso is a communist he dialled manuels number pica toyed with the volume turning it lower hes a communist said abrantes to the ceiling and i wont have him in the house now turn it off he listened on the phone it rang continuously pica turned the radio off hes in bed and thats where im going she said abrantes ignored her he walked to the window with the phone in his hand he disconnected and dialled another number but couldnt get a line four men sat in a car just off the eduardo vii park in the centre of lisbon they were a major two captains and a lieutenant the captain in the front seat had a radio on his knees which they all stared at hardly hearing it the major leaned back in his seat to look at his watch in the street lighting the lieutenant yawned with nerves and now said the quiet voice of jose vasconcelos from the radio zeca afonso sings grandola vila morena the four men held their breath for a moment until zeca afonso began to sing the captain turned in his seat to face the major its started sir he said and the major nodded they drove two blocks to a fourstorey building and parked up the four men got out and each took a pistol from his pocket they walked into the building which had a small plaque outside radio clube portugues manuel abrantes was sleeping at the wheel of his peugeot saloon the front righthand tyre thumped into a pothole and he came awake to find grass scudding under the front of the car he threw the wheel to the left and the car latched back on to the tarmac he stopped and breathed in quick short breaths until the scare subsided he wound down the window and sucked in the chill air he felt for the passenger seat and found his briefcase he undipped it and pulled out a file his own personnel file from the pidedgs headquarters on rua antonio maria cardoso he fed it back in everything was as it should be the little anxiety dream hed just had at the wheel was only that he loosened his trousers which were cutting into his belly and startled himself with a loud uncalledfor fart his stomach still upset he put the car in gear and started moving again calmer now where am i he asked out loud as if a passenger in the back might lean forward and tell him a sign loomed at the end of a long straight piece of road he gripped the steering wheel and blinked the sleep away madrid km an eighteenyearold ze coelho was drinking cheap bagaco in a whitetiled tasca in the middle of the bairro alto with three of his schoolfriends when the owner came thundering down the stairs from his apartment above somethings happening he said breathless and shocked i was listening to the radio some army officers busted in on the programme now theyre just playing music continuously if you want to go to bed said ze you dont have to invent a coup im serious the seven people in the bar looked at the man for several seconds until theyd all seen his seriousness they got up as one and went out into the street ze coelho flicked his shoulderlength hair over the wolfskin collar of his floorlength woollen capote alentejano and they started running down the narrow cobbled alleyway towards the square below they were not alone a crowd was gathering in the praca de luis de camoes and the words coup and revolution ricocheted off the statue in the middle of the square after fifteen minutes the crescendo of excitement hit its top note with a shout to march on the pidedgs headquarters in rua antonio maria cardoso they entered the street from the largo do chiado and found another gang of people coming up from rua vitor cordon behind the arched gateway and high walls the doors to the building were shut and the front dark but the faint glimmer in the windows told the crowd that there were lights on in the building somewhere they hammered on the gates yelling incoherently ze stood in the middle of the street punching the air with his fist and shouting revolution and inclined to go one step too far off with their heads windows opened at the top of the building and dark figures leaned out over the street four shots shattered the night air the crowd split both ways down the street with screams and shouts more shots followed them their boots thundered on the cobbles ze ran back up the hill and fell in a confusion of legs around him he rolled over on the cobbles and further down the street from in front of the pide building he heard terrible noises coming from a mans throat he checked the top of the building again but could see nothing he crouched and ran back down the street grabbed the man by his coat collar and hauled him up the hill when he was safe he fell back and reached down to the choking man his fingers found the slippery warmth of a neck wound joaquim abrantes had slept very badly he woke up at six oclock feeling groggy and badtempered as if hed spent the day before drinking he tried to call his sons but still couldnt get a line he opened the window and looked out into the empty street something was wrong the street should not have been empty he sniffed the air it was different like the first whiff of spring after a long winter except that they were in the middle of spring already a wildeyed young man burst into the street from the direction of the elevador up to the chiado he raised his fist in the air and shouted to the empty street its over he ran up the street towards the rossio there were horns blaring and a faint seethe of chatter and singing abrantes leaned further out of the window he wasnt wrong people were singing in the street this is bad he said to himself and strode back to the telephone whats bad asked pica standing by the bedroom door in her red silk dressing gown i dont know yet but it sounds bad people are singing in the street singing said pica both charmed and mystified that something really was happening ah well even if there has been a coup coup roared abrantes you dont understand do you this isnt a coup this is a revolution the communists have arrived so what she said shrugging herself off the door jamb what are you worried about half your moneys in zurich the other halfs insao paulo even the golds out of the country dont mention the gold growled abrantes wagging his finger dont even say the word gold that gold does not exist it never existed there never was any gold do you understand perfectly she said and went back into the bedroom slamming the door abrantes pulled on his coat and went out into the street and walked towards the terreiro do paco and the river the praca do comercio was full of troops but they were all laughing and joking with each other abrantes moved amongst them stunned at a little before am a column of tanks appeared from the barracks of the th cavalry abrantes positioned himself in the arcade at the north of the square now we shall see he said to a soldier who looked him up and down as if he was neanderthal the column of tanks drew to a halt the turret of the lead tank opened a captain on the ground stepped forward the lieutenant in the tank shouted down to him his voice was clear in the fresh early morning and the total silence in the square i have orders to open fire on you said the lieutenant and the soldiers in the square shifted but all i really want to do is laugh the shifting stopped and a murmur ran around the square go ahead then said the captain the troops in the square cheered the lieutenant held up his hand splayed his fingers and pointed back to the column the captain sent a platoon to the fifth tank and four of them clambered up on to its shoulders the turret opened and an explosive colonel put his head out and found himself looking up at four rifles barrels on the river tagus the navy ship almirante gago coutinho cruised to a halt in front of the praca do comercio its guns pointing into the heart of the city the troops and tanks in the square watched in silence preparing for the first volley several minutes passed no sound came from the ship the guns didnt move there was no signal until slowly one by one the ships guns turned away from the city and faced the south bank of the tagus to the gunners it looked like a flock of pigeons had taken off as a thousand caps were flung into the air on the back of a tumultuous roar in the praca do comercio joaquim abrantes turned and walked back up the rua do ouro ze coelho didnt get home until am he and his friends had taken the wounded man to the hospital and the nurses in the urgencia on seeing his bloodstained clothes had singled him out and refused to let him leave until a doctor had examined him which took some time theyd washed him as best they could but the wolf collar was still badly and irrevocably stained from the mans neck wound his mother opened the door and screamed which brought his father out of the bedroom his sister took zes coat and went to run a bath for him the telephone rang his father took the call ze and his mother watched in silence as the colonel spoke quietly and seriously looking at the floor refusing to catch anyones eye he replaced the heavy bakelite handset zes sister appeared in the doorway general spinola he said summoning a grave and quiet voice to communicate the full weight of the occasion has asked me to go to the largo do carmo barracks prime minister caetano is there with his cabinet and i have been asked to persuade them to allow general spinola to accept the unconditional surrender of the government did you know about this asked his wife her voice quavering with fear and shock at the terrifying implications for her and the children had the coup turned out differendy and badly no and neither did the general apparently the coup was organized by the junior officers but the general knows that caetano wont surrender to them the prime minister wont want power to fall into the hands of the mob he means the communists said ze and what have you been doing asked the colonel giving his bloodstained son his eagle look i was outside the pide headquarters when they opened fire on us some people were hit and we took one of them to hospital zes mother had to sit down the general said thered been no casualties well you can tell him from me when you see him that more than one went down in rua antonio maria cardoso did they bring anybody else into the hospital while you were there they locked me up in a room to prevent me from leaving the colonel nodded his forehead creased but smiling at his son you stay here now and look after your mother he said pulling his daughter to him kissing her on the head nobody leaves this apartment until i say its safe youll see said ze teasing his father now theyre dancing in the streets out there my son the communist said the colonel shaking his head at pm the guard came in to felsens cell in the caxias prison with a tray of food he put it on the bed the noise from the rest of the prison which had been going on all morning had not abated the politicals were into their fiftieth rendition of the antifascist song venham mats cinco and the guards had given up trying to quieten them long ago anything i

maternity wing of thesao jose hospital hed been told that his fourth child was a boy weighing kilos and was completely healthy the nurse was gabbling at him over her shoulder as she batted her way through the swing doors she didnt seem to need any response from him to keep herself going four dead and three wounded thats what they said down in the urgencia only four they cant believe it i cant believe it there are tanks in the terreiro do paco and the largo do carmo but theyre not doing anything theyre just there the soldiers have rounded up the pide agents but not to punish them you know

lawyer in his wife was screened off in the corner of the room with six other women in it his shoes skidded on the highly polished floor and he had to grab a bed to save himself from falling watch yourself said the nurse whose rubber soles squeaked on the floor he went behind the screen his wife was sitting up concerned are you all right she asked he nearly slipped over on the floor said the nurse ive told them before not to polish it so much its all right for us but anybody coming in here with leather soles theyre in trouble do you know what youre going to call him not yet well you wont have much trouble remembering his birthday ana rosa pinto sat with her mother in the kitchen they were holding hands and crying looking down at the threeyearold carlos who was playing on the floor shed started off the day annoyed because they wouldnt let her board the ferry to cross the river to get to her doctors appointment for carlos in lisbon then theyd pointed out the almirante gago coutinho with her guns up and shed gone home scared but excited to wait for news in the late morning her father had gone down to the first open meeting of the partido comunista portugues on the docks in cacilhas on the south bank of the tagus ana rosa and her mother were hoping hed bring back news of the release of political prisoners from the caxias prison little carlos had never seen his father his mother had been six months pregnant when the gnr had broken up a union meeting at the shipyard and his father had been taken across the river for questioning just two weeks before carlos was born ana rosa had heard that her husband had been taken to caxias to serve a fiveyear prison sentence for illegal political activities they waited all day until dusk had just changed to night when there was a knock at the door of the apartment ana rosa eased her hand out of her mothers and answered it a boy handed her a message and ran off without waiting she read it and the tears which had gradually dried through the day sprang back what is it asked her mother theyve taken the boat across theres a crowd gathering in the rossio theyre going to march on caxias prison tonight at am on th april the door to antonio borregos cell in the caxias prison was unlocked the guard didnt say anything he didnt even open the door he just moved on to the next cell and opened that one antonio looked out down the dimlylit corridor other men were doing the same there was cheering and embracing antonio squeezed past them and trotted down the three flights of stairs into the courtyard there were another fiftyodd men down there all looking expectantly at the gates to the prison he jogged across the courtyard to the hospital block and ran up the stairs two at a time he had to catch his breath at the top more out of condition than hed thought there were three men in the ward two of them were sleeping and the third alexandre saraiva was sitting on the edge of his bed trying to get his socks on but only managing to cough antonio took the socks and fitted them on his friends feet he found the mans boots and pushed alexs feet into them and tied them up alex spat into the metal dish on the bedside and inspected the phlegm still bloody he said to no one in particular have you come to take me home i have said antonio whos paying the cab fare were walking i dont know whether ill make it its damned nearly killed me to get dressed youll make it antonio wrapped alexs arm over the back of his neck they stood antonio hooked his thumb into the waistband of alexs trousers they went down the stairs into the courtyard there were more than a hundred people now the sound of a crowd clamouring on the other side of the gates reached them names were shouted out and lost in the noise antonio leaned alex up against the wall and held him there lightly with a hand on his chest the gates opened to pandemonium from the huge crowd whod come up from lisbon on free train rides the prisoners came out blinking into the flashlights of cameras searching for faces that meant something to them antonio waited for the courtyard to empty before he moved alex out into a freedom neither of them had known for nine years they skirted the euphoria and walked down the hill into caxias they didnt have to go far they got a free ride to paco de arcos from a tearful cab driver the cab dropped them off at alexs bar next to the public gardens the tiled sign set into the wall was still there it showed a blue linedrawing of the bugio lighthouse and underneath o farol alex tapped the lighted window of the house next door a woman sounding old and tired answered its me dona emilia said alex the toothless woman dressed in black opened the door and peered out into the night her eyes not so good any more she saw alex and grabbed his face with bent and twisted fingers and kissed him on both cheeks harder and harder as if she was kissing him back into existence she produced the key to the bar from her front apron as if shed been prepared nine years for this moment she brought them candles from her kitchen alex unlocked the bar door and antonio sat him down on a metal chair next to a wooden table in the dark they lit the candles there should be something behind the bar said alex nice and mature by now antonio found a bottle of aguardente and a couple of dusty glasses which he blew into he poured out the pale yellow liquid they drank to freedom and the alcohol set off a coughing fit in alex well go to the notary tomorrow said alex what for i want to make sure that when i go this place is yours eh homem dont talk like that theres one condition look forget it youre pour another drink and listen to me said alex im listening you have to change the name of the bar to a bandeira vermelha that way nobody will forget on nd may joaquim abrantes pedro manuel and pica had lunch in a small restaurant in the centre of madrid it was agreed that manuel would fly tosao paulo in brazil and open a branch of the banco de oceano e rocha joaquim and pedro would go to lausanne and track the political situation in portugal from there pica wanted to know why they couldnt do it from paris but nobody paid any attention to her on the rd may just as manuel abrantes flight from madrid to buenos aires was leaving the west african coast thirtysix expidedgs agentes made themselves available to the new regime for traffic control and vehicle registration chapter xxxii tuesday th june policia judiciaria saldanha lisbon there was a rush on at the office that morning which did not include me narcisos secretary was waiting for me in the corridor and led me straight up to see him but of course he wasnt ready and the five minutes that his secretary had promised turned into twenty she wouldnt let me leave at i was standing in front of narciso on the other side of his desk he was standing too with his chair pushed back to the wall his hands spread wide apart gripping the edge of his desk as if he was going to tip it over me emotions made rare appearances in his face but that morning there was oneanger not the eruptive volcanic type more the penetrating gelid variety i havent seen your revised report yet i havent had the opportunity to get behind my desk this morning i also havent seen the report on what happened yesterday for the same reason senhor engenheiro but i have already heard things he said about you and agente pinto putting yourselves at risk and the destruction of all evidence in a fire that was unfortunate what have you learnt from the fire department i havent ive heard a taped interview with the suspect of such glaring incompetence that i cant believe the two of you have got your minds properly on the job our minds are very firmly on the job senhor engenheiro what time did you leave this building yesterday something like quarterpastfour we were working the bus queues on avenida duque de avila which was where the girl was last seen getting into and you didnt come back to the office i sent agente pinto and where did you go i had nothing further you were seen going into an apartment building just up the road here in rua actor taborda the victims teacher lives there how long did you spend with her silence i cant hear you inspector four hours four hours and what did you have to discuss over four hours im seeing her privately sir narciso hardly missed a beat hed planned this through to the end do you have any idea of the pressure im under he asked im sure its considerable you asked me to make sure that inspector abilio gomes found out where dr aquilino oliveira was at the time of his wifes death it was just a thought he was having dinner in the private residence of the minister of internal administration i shut up the situation was not calling for my observations on the friendship between the lawyer and the minister narciso dropped his head and stared into his desk top im taking you off the case he said quietly abilio gomes will handle it from now on i want you to go down to alcantara and investigate a body thats been found in a rubbish bin at the back of the wharf one club but senhor engenheiro narciso you havent you are in no position to defend your professionalism on the catarina sousa oliveira case investigating officer has affair with witness he said stretching his hand out into the possible banner headline in the correio da manha now take agente pinto and go down to alcantara i sat in my office chewing various nails carlos had left a note with lourenco goncalves telephone number and a business address on avenida almirante reis i tried the number wondering why narciso had praised me yesterday morning for looking in the wrong direction and frozen me out twentyfour hours later just when i was getting somewhere there was no reply carlos came in and sat across the desk i put the phone down weve got a problem he said i know traffic wont give me the information were off the case do they know that he asked slumping back in his chair maybe i said and picked up the phone i called one of my friends in traffic who would do favours for me he put me on hold five minutes later he told me the computer had crashed i hung up we have an internal problem here i said carlos looked suddenly bewildered cold like a kid on the beach whod lost his parents i gave him a resume of narcisos conversation what does it mean it means that whereas before we were swimming close to the beach now the tide has suddenly swept us out over the continental shelf and weve got ten fathoms of dark cold water underneath us carlos leaned closer serious as a headstone what are you talking about i dont know any more it was hot and humid down in the alcantara docks complex and the body in the rubbish bin was already high enough for people to be holding handkerchiefs to their faces the photographer had been and gone and the pathologist a woman i didnt know was struggling into a pair of surgical gloves i took a quick look at the body which was of a male about eighteen years old darkskinned with black wavy hair no fat on him and only wearing a pair of brief burgundy underpants with a smiley face over the genital area i felt his feet soft the killer had stolen his shoes or somebody else had come along afterwards the pathologist joined me a couple of the staff were finishing cleaning up the nightclub she said they emptied the rubbish at five oclock and by seven when they closed up to leave out the back there the body was in place they also told me hes a known male prostitute can i move the body i nodded her on she was fast and thorough i briefed carlos on what he had to do and we waited for the pathologists initial report right cause of death she said severe cerebral haemorrhage caused by savage and multiple blows to the top back and side of the head the killer wanted this one unambiguously dead ill run an hiv test on the blood that could be a possible motive i had a quick look in his rectum and hed been working ill be fuller once ive seen him in my lab i left carlos with his notebook and dark intelligence and walked to the alcantara train station i telephoned my friend in traffic again while waiting for the train is your computer still down sorry ze he said does that mean that its always going to be down when i call i cant say i telephoned the lawyers house and the maid answered i said i wanted to speak to her she said she was alone in the house i boarded the cascais train and by am i was walking up to the lawyers house through the old village i rang the bell the maid opened the door but dr aquilino oliveira was walking down the corridor behind her thank you mariana he said and ordered her to bring us some coffee he stood at his desk in his study i remained standing too i wasnt expecting you inspector he said i called your office and they told me you were off the case i was put through to inspector abilio gomes not the same calibre as yourself of course but no doubt competent what can i do for you i came to offer you my condolences your wife its hard to believe what youve had to go through in the last fortyeight hours he lowered himself slowly into his chair his eyes didnt leave my face thank you inspector coelho he said i didnt think policemen could afford to care one of my weaknesses but possibly a strength too is that what drives you inspector yes i said that and i still have a belief in the sanctity of the truth you must be a lonely man inspector he said which shook me theres the mystery too i said papering over my unease humans need mystery speak for yourself yes perhaps lawyers and mystery dont go together well we love to mystify so ive been told by my clients mariana brought the coffee in she poured we waited she left your wife came to see me the night before she died senhor doutor were you aware of that his eyes came up from his coffee blinking but galvanized searching the inside of my head shed tried to kill herself before inspector did you know that how many times check at the local hospital theyve stomachpumped her there twice before the first time mariana found her just in time that was about five years ago the second time i did last summer what did you put these attempts down to im not a psychiatrist i dont know how neuroses work on the human brain i dont understand chemical imbalances that kind of thing a neurosis usually results from an original trauma which the victim is trying to suppress that sounds about right inspector how do you know such things my late wife was interested in the works of carl jung i said were you aware of anything that could have did my what did my wife say to you that night she said your marriage hadnt worked from the beginning i thought fifteen years was a long time for a relationship not to be working she seemed to be scared of you and dependent on you your small exercise in humiliation at the beginning of the investigation confirmed that and you dont think i was humiliated by her having an affair with a boy ten years her junior inspector he said fast and fierce almost hissing it when did you find out about the lover i dont remember last summer possibly yes yes it was last summer how i found a receipt for a shirt from a shop i dont use did you confront her with it i watched and waited the shirt could have been for her brother after all i knew it wasnt but my profession demands that i am certain so how did you confront her with it the question knocked him back he tried to cover his reaction by an elaborate alteration of position it snapped him out of the cosiness of our dialogue his finger had brushed the truth and found it razorsharp his surface temperature dropped quickly to subzero none of this is relevant to the investigation of my daughters death inspector more especially now that you are no longer working on the case i thought we were just talking he leaned forward and sipped his coffee he removed a small cigar from a box on his desk he offered me one i declined and lit a cigarette of my own he smoked and uncreased himself my question burned inside me you were telling me what my wife said to you that night he said she said things very important things without explaining them and i was very tired after a long day she said your marriage had never worked but not why she said you were a powerful man and that you extended that power into your intimate relationships but she didnt say how she made a very serious allegation but offered no evidence to back it up it was not a conversation with somebody of sound mind he finished there were traces of the truth i thought what was the serious allegation she said you were abusing catarina sexually do you believe that she offered no evidence but do you believe it im a homicide detective senhor doutor people lie to me not just occasionally they lie to me all the time i listen i crossreference i probe further i examine evidence i find witnesses and if im lucky i can put together enough facts to make a case but one thing i can assure you of senhor doutor if somebody tells me something i dont automatically believe them if i did we could empty our prisons of all those innocents and refurbish them into pousadas what did you say to her my insides winced at that a nagging memory a prickling responsibility i told her to proceed with extreme caution to get a lawyer and some evidence would help he sucked on his cigar the lawyer observing the weak point sound advice he said did you tell her you were not the right person to be speaking to that if i did so why do you think she came to you inspector i didnt answer do you think she was trying to influence you perhaps your attitude to me for instance still i didnt answer and the lawyer came across the desk at me perhaps she offered as evidence our daughters promiscuity her complete disdain for any sexual morality brought about by what a confusion the man in whose unconditional love she completely trusted took advantage of her innocence yes i imagine that would do it that would qualify as a trauma and the promiscuity as a neurosis am i right was that my wifes thinking the pressure of the mans intelligence its rapacity had the boiling intensity of a piranha shoal stripping a body down to its skeleton why did you marry her i thought why did she marry you why did you stay with each other im right he said slumping back i know im right he crushed out his cigar with venom until he felt himself observed i stood annoyed and confused my initiative gone i opened the door to l eave my question still unanswered the weight not with me to ask it yet there are two forms of child abuse senhor doutor i said the one you read about is sexual abuse its more shocking but the other type can be just as brutal whats that withholding love i went into the corridor closed the door and then reopened it i forgot to ask senhor doutor do you have another car apart from the morgan i imagine thats your fun car and you have something more formal as well a mercedes was that the car your wife was driving on sunday night yes it was i sat in the public gardens outside the lawyers house and waited for mariana the maid to come out which she did at lunchtime i followed her she was a small thickset woman not much more than a metre and a half tall she had dark shiny hair curled tight around her head she was the type of person you take one look at and trust completely the kind of woman perhaps that dr oliveira didnt deserve to have working for him i caught up with her on a steep cobbled street startling her can we talk for a few minutes i asked she didnt want to lets walk i said and stepped into the road to let her have the narrow shaded pavement youre upset she nodded dona oliveira was a good person she was she said an unhappy woman but a good person will you carry on working for dr oliveira she didnt answer her low heels clattered on the cobbles was catarina a good person mariana ive worked for dr oliveira for nine years thats how long ive known catarina every weekend and every summer for nine years inspector and no she was not a good person but it wasnt her fault even when she was six years old i have an understanding of unhappiness inspector that of the rich is not much different to that of the poor my husband is a drinker it changes him and he makes my children unhappy but at least when he is sober he still loves his children and dr oliveira doesnt she didnt answer she couldnt bring herself to say such a thing dona oliveira tried to give that child all the love she had but catarina didnt want it she hated her mother and you know the strangest thing shed do anything for her father dona oliveira came to see me the night before she died mariana crossed herself rapidly she told me that dr oliveira had been abusing catarina sexually mariana slipped on the cobbles i grabbed her she backed into a wall and stood there appalled dona oliveira said that you would corroborate this accusation i said is that true mariana she swallowed hard and shook her head the street was hot bright and empty the sky was a deep blue against the sunblasted whitewashed walls the smell of lunch was on the sea breeze mariana was looking at me as if i was a man with a knife she brushed a graze of whitewash off her shoulder i wouldnt have been able to stay in that house she said i wanted to leave it at that but i couldnt resist asking the question that i hadnt been able to ask either of the oliveiras whose daughter is she mariana who she asked bewildered now catarina i dont understand i stopped it there a car rumbled up the street tyres battering the cobbles i fell in behind mariana and followed her down to the main street and the cool of the trees at the door to the supermarket i said goodbye but with one last easy question mariana was relieved to tell me teresa oliveiras friend was an englishwoman called lucy marques and gave me an address insao joao do estoril i caught the train back down the linha tosao joao and walked away from the sea and station for a nearly a kilometer until i found myself in front of a traditionallystyled but recentlybuilt house with gates a circular drive and wide steps leading up to a portico it said money to me but not enough for the real thing i introduced myself to an intercom and video camera at the gate which opened electronically there was a large white satellite dish on the roof of the house a heavyset cape verdian maid took me across tiled white marble floors towards a living room from which came the sounds of an english soap opera lucy marques was sitting with her feet up on the sofa cradling a remote and a large tumbler of what proved to be a gin and tonic with plenty of backbone there was a stack of hello magazines on the floor beside her she clicked off the television im not speaking any more bloody portuguese she said fanning me away so if you dont speak gin and tonic you can get lost right now my gin and tonics pretty good i said is it pass me a nail then a what fallen at the first inspector a coffin nail a cancer stick a bloody fag for gods sake in the box there on the table she took two cigarettes from the box and put one behind her ear i lit the one in her mouth help yourself she said have a drink do the necessary you look a bit sharper than gumbo gomes what a depressing character he was abilio able was i ere i saw abilio she said and cackled at her own madness i put lucy marques in her midfifties from the back of her hands but her face and body age seemed to have been arrested at around thirtyeight an achievement given her regime she wore white jeans and a tshirt with some nautical applique can we talk about teresa oliveira only if you join me with a drink gin and tonic that was the agreed language i poured myself a weak one and lit a cigarette teresa teresa teresa she sighed and gulped her drink what a mess i was investigating her daughters death you were i was taken off it internal politics gumbo gomes is working it now gumbo gomes hes just the kind of portuguese i detest so serious so graaaave you couldnt brighten him up if you offered him a molotov cocktail and a light mrs marques im sorry can we of course gin makes me gabble teresa no catarina yes well im not surprised she came to a sticky end she was what we call a little minx that one do you know what a minx is inspector i can guess a flirty dirty little schemer she said and wriggled herself into the sofa preparing to deliver the dirt you know teresa had a lover last year paulo branco right and she caught catarina in bed with him it was a little more graphic than finding them under the covers inspector coelho pumping buttocks ankles round the ears the works i can tell you teresa felt faint for weeks after whenever she thought about it i understood that catarina called her to the house so that she would catch them at it you are wellinformed you must like to gossip inspector i was married to an englishwoman naughty naughty now you had a crack at the portuguese one all she said licking a finger and scoring the air the lover mrs marques ah yes teresa was convinced that he put her up to it who aquilino put catarina up to it finding out about the lover and then taking him to bed my god i said how did she get to think that well i said to her youre paranoid dear but she told me shed cornered catarina one day and confronted her with it and catarinas reply you shouldnt be having sex with other men nice family eh why didnt teresa leave him you portuguese and your marriage contracts said lucy marques shaking her head aquilino and teresas agreement was how do you call that arrangement when everything from both sides is thrown in the pot communhao total de bens thats it teresa came to him with hardly an escudo to her name she worked for him remember it was all aquilinos he wasnt going to divorce her and let her have half his cake which was what shed have had to take but exactly he was crazy about her he left his first wife for her and she was loaded money and name so what happened something right at the beginning and i dont know what teresa never talked about it and believe me i tried she said tapping her hello magazines this lot would have paid money for that i can tell you suddenly i wasnt sure how much i liked lucy marques teresa came here on saturday night she slept here inspector she came to see me first she told me that aquilino had abused catarina sexually she was always telling me he was impotent and i dont know how she knew that because she also told me that they didnt have sex again after catarina was born so make of that what you will inspector what did she do on sunday she must have taken a rhinosized sleeping pill because she didnt get up til midday i was worried about her and checked on her breathing several times in the morning she left here at one oclock saying she was going out to lunch and i didnt see her again she had a mercedes what colour was that black model series number havent a clue registration number i might look like a sad old lush to you inspector coelho but ive got better things to do with my time than remember my friends registration numbers anyway gumbo gomes has the car ask him i took the train back to lisbon wondering if it had come to that the mother killing her own daughter i couldnt see it i couldnt feel it i stared out to sea mesmerized by the waves breaking over the hump of a sand bank in the middle of the estuary and thought about the oliveiras their hopes foundered the family broken up and dead because of what because it had all gone wrong from the beginning i didnt get off at alcantara i could see from the train that the scene at the back of the wharf one was now empty it was lunchtime by the time i got to cais do sodre i started to cross the tram rails on avenida de julho to get to a restaurant near the market one of the new trams a humming electronic slug of effervescing up approached the crowd of people around me waiting to cross seemed to contract and pop open somebody thumped me in the back i fell off the pavement my ankle went my knee connected with the tarmac my fingers slid into the silver strips of track scintillating to the approach of the tram life slowed sound crunched faces slipped across my retina a dark curlyhaired girl wirehanger thin reached out a hand not to help but to point a thickset man with vast belly and wrestlers forearms stepped forward and reared back the womans face next to his had pencilledin eyebrows which disappeared into the creases of her forehead her mouth opened and a strange and distant ululation came out the strip of film in my head jumped out of its sprockets light and dark colour ripped through the gate my muscles unfroze i rolled metal squealed hydraulics hissed my fingers slipped out of the silver rail a steel wheel screeched through i was looking up at the sky through the crisscross cables overhead and everything beyond seemed suddenly simple after lifes complexities faces canopied over me someone held my hand which was cold and rubbed it warm i must have been smiling like an idiot because everybody was smiling back today had not been the day i sat up people helped me to my feet a woman brushed me down someone told me id been lucky i said i knew it and laughed and they all laughed with me as if theyd escaped it too i found myself swept into a restaurant with three or four people and they sat down with me at a long table and told all the other lunch people that id nearly been the slice of lemon under the up tram after lunch still dazed i decided that underground travel was safer i stood well back from the tracks in the cais do sodre metro the train travelled as far as anjos and i climbed the stairs on to avenida almirante reis it was there that i discovered that the day had edged up to it was there that i felt strange and cold inside it was there that i threw up my lunch and that i realized that i wasnt as safe as i had been

trousers and ordered her to bend over the desk chapter xxxiv tuesday th june avenida almirante reis outside anjos metro lisbon i fell into a cafe close to the metro station if it had a name it didnt snag in my brain if there were people in it they were faceless i went to the toilets at the back and washed my face i asked for a glass of wat er and swilled my mouth out i ordered a cup of tea with two tea bags catherine of braganca might have introduced tea to the british but her legacy in portugal is liptons i sugared the tea heavily and drank it i ordered something stronger and sat down sweating again the breathing not going well unsynchronized the barman kept an eye on me the tv was encouraging us all to go to madeira a large presence came from the rear of the bar stood over me and blocked out some of the neon in the room is this where all the old detectives come to cure their troubles he said sitting himself down at my table i knew him i knew that big nose those seedy eyes i knew that smooth black moustache sharpened at the tips i just had an accident i said nearly fell under a tram i feel a bit shaky thats all had to sit down in a city of trams like this one its amazing how few people disappear under them i dont remember your name but i know i know you youre ze coelho he said i nearly didnt recognize you you used to have a beard joao jose silva they called me jojo

said evasive he used to come in here until three days ago i heard he set himself up in business he calls himself a security consultant now a fancy name for private detective work following rich guys wives around the place seeing if theyre doing something more than the shopping on a wednesday afternoon youd be surprised would i he was so were the husbands which meant he didnt always get paid so why doesnt he come in here any more he shrugged we used to have a drink and go and play cards in the park in summer was he married he was his wife went back up to porto couldnt stand us southerners down here thought we were all moors took the kids with her i finished my drink the man was depressing me i didnt know why the seediness of those eyes maybe ive got to go i said i dont want to get

across the street second floor no answer maybe he went away he didnt have the money to go away call me if he shows up i said giving him a card and call me if he doesnt show up by the end of the week i didnt wait for his reply i had to get out of there before the neon split my head open i walked up to luisas apartment she was out i went to the policia judiciaria building no carlos i took some aspirin and began to feel stronger abilio gomes put his head in and told me i looked like death i watched him disappear down the corridor i went into his office and opened up the teresa oliveira file on his desk it was nearly the first detail on the front page she was found dead in a black mercedes e series diesel registration pr i closed the file i walked down to the avenida da liberdade to get some air in my lungs it wasnt a pleasant walk the traffic was heavy and the pollution high in the afternoon heat i carried on down to the pensao nuno and up the same strip of lino which must have been a midseventies vintage up the same dark flights of stairs which must have been eighteenthcentury to the onemetre bar of neon over the reception the most modern thing in the place jorge raposo was still there smoking over a different newspaper i put my hand on the counter looking for nuno he asked without looking up ive heard that one before inspector he said not pleased to see me its you your memory for faces is coming back he sucked his teeth and considered that only the ones i have to remember troublemakers for instance those three kids who were in here friday lunchtime you see what i mean inspector he sighed his eyelids closing and only returning halfway did anybody come out after them like three went up and four came down he said his shoulders beginning to shake with fake mirth it takes a little longer than that so i understand i gave him a long look he held it untroubled how many times a year do you get hit jorge in the last quarter of a century not once and before that the police force was the same just the uniforms were different and the methods you knownot so sensitive i nipped round the back of the counter and drove my knee into the side of his thigh he went down hard on the strip of dead carpet he had behind there the cigarette left his fingers i picked it up and stubbed it out a bit of nostalgia for you jorge i said now when you wake up every morning youre going to say shit inspector coelho might come and see me today id better start remembering how it happened with that young girl who came in here on friday lunchtime walked out and got herself killed four hours later your memoryll have an open line to pain and just when you think youve got over it and you can walk up the stairs one at a time ill be back and do the other one i went up to the room and looked around the bed had been moved back to the wall that was the only change i sat on it and smoked but nothing came to me i checked myself in the mirror still not good jorge was lying where hed fallen behind his counter grunting he looked up at me from the corner of his face he squeezed his eyes shut keep trying jorge i said and left i called luisa she was in i called olivia to tell her id be late i took a bus up to saldanha and walked down to luisas apartment the stairs felt long and hard she let me in and sat me down with a glass of ice tea i told her about the accident she sat on the chair with her knees up holding on to her ankles unblinking i had a little note she said when id finished it was under the windscreen wiper on my car she reached over to the table and handed it to me it was a sheet of a paper written in red felttip pen was the word puta how daring i said unimpressed i told her about my conversation with narciso that morning and how hed moved me off the case they know about me they saw me going into this building and they know your car now dont they but youre not sure who they are i wouldnt say its a concerted effort i said if it was id probably have been suspended by now i think were just talking about certain elements in the police force who have been told that influential people are not happy about how my investigation has developed all this because of catarina she had a full sexual history there are plenty of people out there who want to have sex with young girls some are persuasive others offer money and there are a few who just take it catarina had been sodomized even in this permissive age sodomizing a young girl is a shameful act the thought of appearing in court on that kind of charge could have been enough for her assailant to kill her there are some big men circling in this case her father you know and hes connected to the minister of internal administration dr oliveira was having a drink with him when his daughter was killed and having dinner with him when his wife committed suicide teresa oliveira committed suicide sunday night the loneliest time it upset her and she had to get up and pace the apartment floors i smoked and sipped ice tea no closer after talking it through with luisa to knowing who was applying pressure from where did it emanate from narciso or was he just a channel she kissed me to give some reassurance i kissed her back because it tasted good she thumped into the chair again and i had some good news today too you dont have to do your doctorate any more not that good she said my fathers offered to let me launch this magazine hes had on the blocks for the last two months i thought you wanted to publish books i do but this lets me burst on to the lisbon publishing scene which will be good for the bookpublishing business theres always more interest in a new magazine and ill get a lot of attention but i have to come up with the launch idea whats going to make this magazine stand out from the rest and your father couldnt find the answer so hes made it sound like a present in that i get all this free publicity but theres just this little gordian knot i have to untie you need a good oldfashioned sex scandal people caught with their trousers down something a little more serious than that ze its a business magazine for the iberian peninsula not a tabloid rag for the hairdressers you didnt say had i known what id have suggested a businessman with his trousers down nobodys going to have their trousers down in any magazine i publish then you might have circulation problems because that as far as i know is all people are interested in these days youre depressing me then lets drink to the rise of frivolity it was close to pm and still light with the days getting longer and the time shorter as i walked down through the blocks of flats from paco de arcos station a siren was blaring and men were running to the bombeiros voluntarios building moments later two fire engines blasted out into the street leaving me with the impression that nothing ever stops there are no blank spaces any more to colour in at your leisure i hovered at the street corner contemplating a beer with antonio borrego i was earlier than expected id felt too tired to have dinner with luisa but id come alive on the journey back i needed a shower first inside the house i knew i wasnt alone the cat was sitting on a chair in the darkening kitchen paws and tail neatly tucked away she closed her yellow eyes at me and i left her to contemplate her nights killing i went up the stairs and stood at the top and thought i heard the faintest sound of someone in pain there were no lights on i walked the strip of carpet to olivias room and opened the door straight into her wideopen eyes and mouth just beginning to gape with horror i shook my head and stepped back but the image kept coming at me she was lying on her back her bare legs wrapped around carlos rib cage her ankles crossed and resting on his buttocks he loomed over her naked boardstraight on outstretched arms his head snapped round i slammed the door shut and reeled back two small steps as if id been hit in the face and then like someone who has been hit in the face i was furious mad enough that my eyeballs pulsated i reached for the door handle the blood thumped in my forearm as a tremendous hammering started on the front door i gripped the door handle and felt it gripped from the other side the hammering at the front door didnt stop i thought of the fire brigade my mind going for an odd link i ran down the stairs the cat had vacated the kitchen chair i ripped open the front door there was a man i knew but not in this context standing with six men behind him and a van behind them inacio i said my mind in pieces now holding out my hand im sorry inspector he said ignoring the hand but this is business narcotics business here i said hearing movements up the stairs behind me thats right he said im still with narcotics but you said this was business i dont weve come to search the house he said holding out a warrant which i didnt read you know a local fisherman called faustinho trindade i know faustinho i said looking through the warrant now he was hes a wellknown drugsmuggler he was seen going into this house you were seen leaving with him and going down to the boat club search the house inacio search the house take your time i said inacio stepped into the hall and gave the men their instructions two went back to the van and returned with large tool boxes olivia and carlos met them on their way down the stairs inacio directed us into the kitchen the three of us sat around the table with an agente standing over us while the rest thundered around the house olivia engaged me in some direct eye contact who are these guys she asked in english narcotics agents theyre searching the house if youve got any in your room youd better tell me now no i havent she said unblinking are you sure im sure only then did i become aware of each blood cell every platelet in my veins my stomach went into free fall the bag of grass in the attic room carlos looked like a dog whod regretted eating some green meat from the bin there was a loud cracking noise from above i asked the agente what was going on floorboards i imagine he said empty your pockets on the table we emptied our pockets carlos i noted contained escudos some change four condoms which i was glad about a pen his id card and his policia judiciaria card i didnt know you were a cop said the agente looking at carlos card are you boyfriend and girlfriend nobody said anything the agente shrugged he picked up olivias card and measured the birthdate against carlos maybe not he said they were in the house for forty minutes they found nothing inacio apologized and this time shook my hand which was running with sweat the men left i stood in the darkened hallway and looked into the lit kitchen olivia and carlos were standing together like some movie couple whod survived a hurricane i pointed a finger at carlos you can leave now i said go on get out fuck off out of here he came towards me and slipped out of the door i had nothing to say to my little girl nothing to say to my daughter i went up the stairs one at a time all the way to the attic room i turned on the table lamp i sat at the desk i opened the drawer no bag of grass no papers i took out my late wifes photograph which was faceup and not how id left her i closed the drawer i put her photograph on the desk facing me i felt betrayed defiled rifled my world shaken up so that i was reduced to the one constantthe unflagging image of my dead wife half an hour passed and three ships in the night olivia appeared reflected in the dark panes of the window your bag of grass is outside in the bougainvillea and the papers youve been in here before i said tired not angry any more after school just to look at mummy she said but i dont talk to her like you do you think a year is a long time but it isnt i said i sat here the other day and wondered what it would be like to have her back whether i would want to have her back wouldnt you ive never stopped thinking mum would be interested in that ill tell her when i get home she said and then i get home and theres nobody here and theres never going to be anybody here absolutely never and thats when i miss her i want to have her back but it would have to be as it was before this gap this one year without her has changed everything i nodded slightly exaggerated like a drunkard i lit a cigarette olivia took it i lit another and played with the tin seashell ashtray loss is like a shrapnel wound i said where the piece of metals got stuck in a place where the surgeons darent go so they decide to leave it its painful at first horribly painful so that you wonder whether you can live with it but then the body grows around it until it doesnt hurt any more not like it used to but every now and again there are these twinges when youre not ready for them and you realize its still there and its always going to be there its a part of you a still hard point inside she kissed the top of my head i put an arm around her hips i put the photograph back in the drawer ive met somebody i said i know do you that business with the telephone on sunday the way you smelt when you came back and you might not know it but youre happier im not sure how to do it this getting to know someone again whats she like i couldnt tell you yet i said its been a rocket ride so far shes different to your mother but shes like her too in the important ways shes a good person a real person someone you can trust she stroked my head like carlos she said i resisted a reply but i didnt deny it im angry with him im not going to tell you otherwise if inacio hadnt turned up why he knows what hes doing he knows your vulnerability he knows hes ten years older than you he even knows its against the law he met you on a sunday morning and by tuesday evening hes in bed with you he abused he didnt know what he was doing ive already talked to him about mum whats ten years the laws stupid and so what mum told me that you two were in bed with each other inside a week and i knew i wanted him more than anything else in my life and thats what i did he did not seduce me he didnt abuse anything hes hes got something hes got something that all those fancy kids i go to school with havent what whats he got i said and stopped the second half of that sentence just in time that i havent thats the point dad she said running a hand through my hair what is youre being as cryptic as your mother used to be i dont know but i want to the thrill of that mental connection remember chapter xxxv rd october banco de oceano e rocha sao

secretary to straighten the magazines on the table and peered around his desk she dropped down on to her haunches to do the work after six years working for him she knew manuel abrantes sly tricks he waved her out of the room annoyed maybe he should take her out to dinner before he left get her back to his apartment show her a thing or two he opened the package inside was a passport an id card an envelope of cheques a cheque wallet from a portuguese bank a visa card and an amex card there was also a photograph of a thirtytwoyearold woman called lurdes salvador santos she looked goodnatured despite a severe hairstyle and a faint moustache a fourpage letter from pedro explained the documents and photograph he checked the id card and passport the latter was wellused broken in with plenty of stamps he opened the packet of cheques he removed three and put the rest in the cheque wallet he made up three fictitious amounts and wrote them in the account movements booklet within the wallet he read the letter four times and memorized every detail he burnt it with the three blank cheques he took one thousand us dollars from his top drawer and left the office he walked six blocks in the staggering afternoon humidity to a rubberstamp maker whod already prepared a brazilian entry stamp for him he went to a travel agent and booked a flight fromsao paulo to buenos aires and on to madrid he went to the argentine embassy with his tickets and they gave him a visa while he waited he went back to his office he took all his old documents out of his pockets and desk and passed them through the shredder he emptied the shredder and burnt the contents in the waste bin he went out past his secretary paused and came back to her they looked at each other too complicated he thought he nodded to her and left she gave him the finger to his departing back at pm the following day his passport received an exit stamp as he went through to the departure lounge insao paulo airport the immigration officer had no thoughts or opinions as to why a portuguese national miguel da costa rodrigues should be leaving brazil for argentina and he didnt ask him any questions by the th october after two flights and a car journey miguel da costa rodrigues was sitting in the office of pedro abrantes director of the newly privatized banco de oceano e rocha still in their old offices on rua do ouro in the baixa i cant believe whats happened to portugal said miguel looking up from the latest photograph of his brothers wife isabel and their three children the governments determined that we are going to join the eec at the same time as spain we have to make progress said pedro no no i mean i cant believe the sex theres sex everywhere on the advertisements the film posters have you seen that kiosk in the rossio the nudity i mean its incredible it would never have been possible yes well salazarismo was very catholic and respectful of women said pedro frowning there were censors you of all people should know that me of all people asked miguel alarmed by his brothers casual slip sorry senhor rodrigues i forgot said pedro youll see weve put all that behind us the portuguese never put anything behind them except a chair to eat lunch we live with our history as if its still all happening around us there are people in this country who think the hidden king sebastiao is going to come back after four hundred years to lead them on to greater things for all i know there could be people waiting for me pedro didnt say anything he loved his brother but he thought he was exaggerating his importance in the ancien regime his brother had never told him about general machedo his brother thought that pedro was an innocentan intelligent man a charming and gifted banker a muchrespected and wellliked person but an innocent i sold the gold said pedro to get off the old subject back on to something he felt confident with and the future seeing as were talking about history you mean said miguel i used it to capitalize the bank who bought it a swissbased colombian what did you get for it it seemed the right time to sell this us budget deficit scare is nothing its just a how much six hundred dollars an ounce didnt it go as high as eight hundred it did but he was the right buyer in the right climate not inquisitive if you understand my meaning doesnt this us budget deficit bring into question the real value of the dollar asked miguel trying to sound knowledgeable spouting stuff he didnt fully understand from reading time on the aeroplane thats why ive moved into property if the us goes bust it wont matter what youve moved it into pedro stood up and spun the dial on a wall safe behind him miguel saw the small kid in him the excited one at christmas the us wont go bust but if it does he said and opened the safe door inside were two gold bars miguel joined him on his side of the desk and rubbed his thumb over the eagle and swastika stamp of the old german reichsbank im hoping their value will be purely sentimental said pedro tell me about the job said miguel sitting back down sweating a little not sure in his slightly paranoid state whether it was such a good idea to have kept those souvenirs weve bought some property just off the largo dona estefania old apartments falling to pieces were expanding we dont fit in this old building any more so were going to demolish those old apartments and build ourselves a new office building well take the top three floors and rent out the rest i want you to manage the project the architects on my back and i havent got the time for him when do you want me to start asked miguel unnerved at the immediate possibility of heavy responsibilities as soon as youre comfortable theres an office ready for you upstairs weve had to convert the apartments to fit ourselves in here miguel stood and shook himself out i need some time to get used to being back in portugal i want to go back to the beira and smell the air again i want to eat some fish on guincho beach you know that sort of thing pedro suddenly moved to have his brother back in the country went round his desk to him and embraced him before you do any of these things we have to go to the notary tomorrow he said now that youre miguel da costa rodrigues there are a few small problems the first and most important is that i have to make you guardian to my children in case anything should happen to me and isabel dr aquilino oliveira has arranged everything of course said miguel nearly emotional they clapped each others shoulders and miguel made for the door theres one other thing said pedro klaus felsen was released from prison last month isnt that a year early dont ask me why you just have to know and you also have to remember that it was one of our fathers dying wishes that we have nothing to do with him miguel was surprised to see his brother cross himself has senhor felsen called hes tried well he wont have much interest in miguel da costa rodrigues im just telling you because he has every reason to be angry not with us maybe but you should make him an offer father made me promise on his deathbed i cant miguel shrugged it felt good to have a heavy suit on his shoulders again to not be sitting in the chill of air conditioning pedro straightened the photograph on his desk and watched his brothers wide back fit through the doorway he hadnt told him about his fathers other dying wish which was that his younger brother should inherit nothing from the banco de oceano e rocha or any of its associated companies it was the only thing he hadnt understood and his father hadnt explained but now strangely hed been relieved of the problemmanuel abrantes no longer existed and miguel da costa rodrigues would have to be on the board miguel da costa rodrigues was a different man to manuel abrantes the old manuel wasnt just a shredded passport or an old skin left in asao paulo apartment he was a dead man miguel da costa rodrigues proved to be more than just an identity change he wasnt someone whod tortured raped murdered and summarily executed anybody he was a graduate from an american university with an mba and seven years workexperience in brazilian banking he was charming and affable with a long line in bad afterdinner jokes he liked children and children liked him he was popular at work respected for his unique relationship with the owner of the bank and his instinctive ability to manage people to know their weaknesses and strengths for the second time in his life he became a success on january th he married the woman his brother had found for himlurdes salvador santos not even the name bothered him that huge buildup of sainthood would have had him sweating in the dark ten years ago now he basked if not in her beauty then in her sweet nature and of course in her total dedication to him their only unhappiness was over two miscarriages in quick succession and the doctors advice not to try again that last miscarriage had come at a time when he believed that nothing could go wrong in june he had delivered the planning permission for a twentystorey highrise on the largo dona estefania site a week later construction had begun and he became known to the lisbon business community as the director geral de oceano e rocha propriedades lda with a seat on the full board of the bank and a major shareholding his wifes news disappointed him and he unconsciously turned more of his attention to his work he bought property around saldanha for future development he bought old factory sites on the outskirts of lisbon for development into light industrial units and small businesses he bought sites on the edge of cascais near boca do inferno to build tourist apartments he bought an apartment block in the graca area of lisbon with a panoramic view of the city he converted the top two floors into his lisbon residence he refurbished his wifes house in the old part of cascais he became fatter and even more genial it was new years day and miguel and lurdes rodrigues had invited pedro and isabel abrantes with their three children over to cascais for lunch the sun had shone all day but it was cold and when in the late afternoon the sun went down the temperature hovered around freezing point pedros wife was seven and a half months pregnant with their fourth child she was enormous which had surprised her because with the first three shed hardly altered shape it meant that on the way back to lisbon she sat in the back seat with the two girls while the young joaquim travelled up front with his father they were just driving out ofsao pedro do estoril in their sixmonthold mercedes estate in the fast lane of the marginal when three things happened at once little joaquim stood on the seat a car coming the other way swerved briefly over the double white line into the oncoming fast lane and a bmw overtook pedro on the inside pedro put his hand across to pull joaquim back into his seat he yanked the steering wheel across to his right but hadnt seen the bmw which hit him in the rear wing the mercedes span twice turned over the roadside kerb rolled on to its roof and back on to two wheels on a high bank which dropped down to some rocks by the sea the mercedes rolled twisted and slid down the bank the front end crunched into the rocks shattering the windscreen the three children spilled out the car somersaulted over them and finished roofdown in the freezing atlantic the bombeiros voluntarios were there within ten minutes people were already weeping at the crushed bodies of the three children on the rocks the firemen quickly ascertained that pedro had not survived but that isabel was still breathing and crushed between the front and rear seats it took an hour to cut her out and they rushed her straight into lisbon with a police escort the foetus a baby girl weighing kilos was delivered by caesarean section and placed in an incubator her mothers heart weakened by the shock of the accident did not survive the operation the funerals took place twentyfour hours later at the mosteiro dos jeronimos in belem the coffins were all closed the spirit of the congregation broken by the size of the smallest three the abrantes family were placed in a family mausoleum in the cemiterio dos prazeres in lisbon which already contained joaquim abrantes senior whose body had been brought back from lausanne in miguel da costa rodrigues didnt get out of dark glasses for weeks and when he did his eyes were bruised and ruched his brothers death blackened him in a way that had only happened once before he derived small consolation at the delivery from the incubator of the child they named sofia which had been her intended name it was from early january that miguel da costa rodrigues began to get visits from manuel abrantes the banco de oceano e rocha moved from the baixa into larger temporary offices on the avenida da liberdade while the construction of the largo dona estefania building was completed miguel decided to maintain his brothers office in the rua do ouro he began trawling the streets around the praca da alegria for girls on the th march he found himself climbing the stairs of an old eighteenthcentury building on the rua da gloria followed by a twentythreeyearold prostitute from sines the top floors belonged to the pensao nuno which rented rooms by the hour he dinged the bell and heard a newspaper fold in a nearby room into the light of the neon strip above the reception came jorge raposo his old colleague from the caxias prison days miguel da costa rodrigues no longer had to walk the streets of the rua da gloria jorge raposo arranged for the girls to visit him in his office on the rua do ouro from the beginning of april friday lunchtimes and afternoons were spent in the rua do ouro office any papers that needed to be signed were brought to him by secretaries from the main office who knew where to leave them on may th a secretary from the banks law firm needed a signature which couldnt wait until monday there were no bank secretaries available to take the papers so she went down to the rua do ouro office herself chapter xxxvi wednesday th june lisbon i caught the train in early to cais do sodre i walked along the river buffeted by purposeful people arriving for work from the ferries it was another hot day and i had my jacket off and over my shoulder i looked out across the river and saw the massive lisnave gantry crane rising up out of the early morning haze i thought about carlos pinto i thought about seeing him again working with him accepting him you think you know yourself until things start happening until you lose the insulation of normality i would have called myself aware before i lost my wife people would look at me narciso for instance and think there goes ze coelho a man who knows himself but im like anybody else i hide my wife was right im inquisitive for the truth but i hide from my own the stuff ive carried with me and ignored my fathera good man who thought he was doing the right thing for his country he died of a heart attack without ever talking to me maybe a threeline conversation would have been enough and we could have unburdened ourselves my daughter unable to bear my disappointment like an unfaithful lover an horrific concept the sight of her and carlos in the graphic act an image flashed in my mind lucy marques description of what teresa oliveira had seen her daughter her lover pumping buttocks ankles around the ears what an absurd act but what a crucial one an unrecoverable situation i saw it then looking out over the water of the tagus the dazzling shimmering river i saw that i could pick up another bag of rocks hump another sack of guilt or history and carry that through the rest of my days or i could accept trust accommodate give myself a break but if i was going to do that there was something i had to see first i turned away from the river walked up through the baixa to the largo martim moniz and caught the metro north carlos and i were called straight into narcisos office without a word being exchanged i sent you down to alcantara yesterday said narciso his mood unchanged in twentyfour hours thats where we went senhor engenheiro i said you went there but you didnt stay senhor inspector a psp officer saw you leave the crime scene and board a train in the direction of cascais i want to know where you were going on police time i went to see dr oliveira i said and narcisos tanned face purpled to offer my condolences as part of the inspector ze coelho service i didnt answer narciso looked between carlos and me and what can you tell me about the murder of this eighteenyearold down in alcantara senhor inspector the maricao in the bin whats his name he doesnt have a name senhor engenheiro said carlos hes known as xeta cheta as in nao tenho cheta i havent got a penny its brazilian for kiss senhor engenheiro these people my god just tell me whats been going on the investigation started carlos i want the investigating officers report narciso cut in the boy was a known prostitute weve conducted i started dont give me any more bullshit inspector you dont know anything you havent done anything youre heading for suspension you know that suspension without pay and agente pinto yes senhor engenheiro the narcotics agents whod mounted a surveillance on the inspectors property noted that you went in there at sixthirty pm what the hell were you doing in paco de arcos i wanted to brief the inspector on developments there havent been any to discuss alternative approaches with the inspectors daughter she let me into the house yes i had to wait some time before the inspector turned up youre at the end of the road now agente pinto if you dont make your assignment with inspector coelho work youre finished youre out youll be looking for a job in the psp do you understand me perfectly senhor engenheiro get out both of you carlos made it out of the door first narciso called me back i clicked the door shut he stuck a finger in his collar and pulled it out too much blood stuck up in his head and the collar not letting it back down your tie senhor inspector he said where did you buy it my tie i said marking time looking for the angle what you have around your neck senhor inspector my daughter made it for me i see he said embarrassed by that would she make one for me youd have to ask her senhor engenheiro shed have to see your face you know to work out what would suit he wiped his face with his hand and waved me away i left his office with his aftershave in my nostrils and went back down to my own carlos was staring out of the window at the crowds of people in the photo booths in rua gomes freire i collapsed into my chair and lit an sg ultralight and drew on it fiercely desperate for a proper hit of nicotine whos going to get coffee carlos left without a word and came back with two mini plastic cups with an inch of coffee in each are we going to talk he asked putting my bica down have you spoken to your father what about about what happened last night no no i didnt think you would you wouldnt have made it into work with two broken legs after hed thrown you off his balcony he looked off out of the halfopen door with his hands clasped between his knees so you want to talk i said lets talk lets talk about how agente carlos pinto has gone through my life in a pair of jackboots trampling everything underfoot he ran a hand over his cropped hair and rubbed his nose vigorously with his finger and thumb shes sixteen youre twentyseven shit im beginning to sound like that bloody lawyer now we have laws about sex agente pinto do they cover that in the police academy these days they do have laws yes and they cover them but as you know inspector you can be an old hand at fourteen or an innocent at twentyfour thats a tenyear grey area twentyfour i said engaging his eyes he stuck his chin out daring me thats right inspector i live with my parents its not so easy olivia had said he didnt know what he was doing he grinned his nerves getting to him youre lucky agente pinto youre lucky narcotics turned up youre lucky i talked to olivia youre lucky i was married to an englishwoman for nearly half my life youre lucky to have met her he said fixing me with a look im lucky to have met your daughter and you for that matter thats what she told me i said riding that wave struggling with all sorts of things now im in love with her he said the statement of fact no frills im not sure if shes been around long enough to know the difference between someone whos in love with her and someone whos just looking for an easy lay the anger flared in him quick and bright as a magnesium flash it was what id wanted to see at least im not black he said which i probably deserved i pointed a finger at him my longest most penetrating one and jabbed it at him i trust you carlos pinto i said and that was the last reason why you were lucky he sat back blinking the anger gone now and something like pain in his face he nodded at me i put the finger down and nodded back i pulled the drawer open in my desk and put my feet up on it and stared at the ceiling and sipped my coffee for five minutes wincing what now asked carlos still nervous im thinking that this tooth here under my new bridgework hurts when i drink something hot i called my dentist who said shed fit me in some time during the afternoon what about xeta asked carlos narciso knows thats a hopeless case the lab report from the pathologist said he had three types of semen in his rectum two different types in his stomach and he was hiv positive i threw up my hands i dont like not giving my full attention to a case but you have to recognize when its unwinnable narciso knows hes put us out to grass so he said weighing things up we have lunch in alcantara youre learning i said youre learning too fast we sat outside the navigator restaurant two establishments up from the wharf one nightclub with a large platter of sardines boiled potatoes grilled peppers and a salad we shared a carafe of white wine the sardines were perfect not too large and fresh off the boat we dismantled them without speaking the waiter came and took our plates away we ordered coffee lets think about what weve got i said carlos took out his notebook and flicked through the sheets he began a resume weve got a sexually loose girl called catarina oliveira who was last seen getting into a black c series mercedes petrol with tinted windows and the letters nt in the registration this happened about an hour before she was murdered and took place about a hundred metres from her school on avenida duque de avila it seems this girl would do anything for her father to get his attention but despised her mother to the point where she would collude with the father in her humiliation probably in a desperate attempt to strengthen her relationship with her father we dont think that the lawyer is the real father he concluded have you checked that in the hospital records i asked yes dona oliveira was definitely the mother theres no doubt about that im impressed you dont have to tell me to do everything he said i even checked the librarian at the biblioteca nacional and all the other alibis im not used to initiative i said carry on the victim is associated with valentim almeida the guitarist in the band who we suspect is a pornographer and who had sufficient hold over her to persuade her to indulge in an unusual sexual act in the pensao nuno during the lunchtime before she was killed carlos flicked backwards and forwards through his notebook theres no evidence so far that the killer followed her from the pensao to the school or rather the cafe near the school go back to the notes you took from the people we interviewed at the bus stops four of them saw her get into the car did any of them say where the car came from we didnt ask that question we just wanted to know about the car she got into youve got all the telephone numbers of those people at the bus stop call them and ask that question i said if he was a passing motorist thats one thing but if he was waiting for her to come out of the school then hed already tracked her down the barman in the bella italia said she was alone when she drank the bica i tried to talk to him the other day but he was off i said ill try again after ive been to the dentist and then theres valentim said carlos hes still got something to tell us i dont know what but something i wouldnt mind establishing a link between him and dr oliveira theres one already the lawyer gave us his telephone number i mean a relationship of some sort a financial one the video equipment maybe thats an interesting possibility he wont tell us anything but maybe we can surprise it out of him is he still being held in the tacos ill check i left carlos making calls and told him to carry on working the xeta case in alcantara while i went to my dentist on campo grande i took the bus all the way from the docks it took for ever i sat in the waiting room flicking through caras magazine looking at all the halfcelebrities thinking about luisa and her dismay at the idea of sex scandal in a serious business magazine i dropped caras and picked up vip another in the genre flicking from the back i came across a bunch of photographs of charity functions there was one at the ritz and the photograph showed miguel da costa rodrigues and his wife in a lineup of people who mattered senhor rodrigues was wearing one of olivias ties the same one hed been wearing that friday night in paco de arcos his wife was wearing a suit that id seen olivia working on for the past month i tore the picture out and folded it into my wallet to show olivia later the dentist patched up a small gap between the bridgework and my tooth it took her thirty seconds and she told me id have to come back for a filling the repair work cost esc and the filling would be another esc it sounded like easy money to me if you could bear looking in rotten mouths all day i came out of campo grande and tested my repaired bridgework with a coffee i found myself looking at a building which i realized was the biblioteca nacional i wandered in and around the stacks of books until i got to the psychology section i saw him from the back first with that swag of brown ringlets he was out of the tacos that hadnt taken long i thought i sat down next to him he glanced over and i had his full attention are you interested in books inspector i like jose saramago really you surprise me he has the same attitude to punctuation that i do you dont need it or maybe hes no good at it i said thinking its a solution isnt it he nearly smiled i nodded in the direction of the door and we left the building we sat outside the cafe on white plastic chairs he ordered a bica i had a glass of water this time he took one of my cigarettes i let him hows it going inspector im off the case is this a social visit ive been through a lot these past few days how many of them did you spend in the tacos i didnt say yours had been a beach party it hasnt i had my house turned over it wasnt me by some narcotics agents sharksll eat anything even each other you know that who do you think organized it youre the detective why did you end up three or four nights in the tacos because you put me there and who gave me your phone number he bounced against the back of his white plastic chair youre cleverer than you look inspector thats why i used to have a beard so that people wouldnt see the stupidity and now its all out in the open can you think of any reason why dr oliveira should give a damn about you it would be curious if he started now he said because weve never met before your studio went up i had time to leaf through your bank statements i lied well thats the kind of interesting person you are inspector i didnt find a loan account and not one repayment detail in your current account so what are you saying now inspector that dr oliveira bought the equipment for me if you are youre off your head am i i said and left him with a small bill for a bica and a bottle of water i called carlos whod contacted all the people from the bus queues two women saw the car parked outside the school with the engine running for maybe five to ten minutes waiting for the kids to come out of school looks like it im going to talk to the barman at the bella italia now did you get anywhere with xeta nothing said carlos i spoke to the sergeant about valentim ive just been talking to him right the sergeant said that a guy called joao jose silva has been looking for you at the policia judiciariai thats what he said did he say anything he said he still hasnt heard from lourenco goncalves what does that mean i dont know if it means anything its just one of those names that keeps showing up chapter xxxvii friday th june pensao nuno rua da gloria lisbon how come girls do this now how come this girl is doing this now how has it come this far my god said miguel finally and out loud but not so loud that who he was watching in the next room through the back of the mirror through the rough hole in the plaster through the ragged edges of the lath would hear the thick bloodclotted lechery in his voice it had been a long slow slide to this latest little vice hed done with whoring now it was surprising how boring it got and how quickly pornography was no more than biology whoring no more than practical dissection he hadnt liked it it hadnt been the point the pressure of names had finally got to him too all the teresas the fatimas the marias all those little saints the santinhas he called them with their eyes staring up at him he didnt need it he got enough of that at church on sundays no more whores no more santinhas he thought he might be cured except that he found himself still reaching for something like an artist whos painted the same scene again and again trying to find what it was he had to say hed told jorge not to send him any more girls and that had been that but jorge jorge had kept something back he had something special but miguel would have to come to the pensao to see it hed come on a friday lunchtime when was that years ago now or not jorge had taken him up to the room told him about the twoway mirror and left a familiar constriction had come into his throat and hed pinched the skin around it with his thumb and finger he lifted the mirror away on his side of the wall and there framed raggedly was a leading lisbon architect he knew by name for gods sake with a girl a young girl her legs splayed heels braced against the sink as he was watching he had a sudden jagged fear that this wasnt a mirror but a window then he realized the heavily madeup eyes of the girl were focused elsewhere of course they were thered have been uproar if theyd seen his bald head ducked into the alcove he waved at them to test their reactions they toiled on oblivious he sat back on the bed unblinking for the minutes it took the architect to finish his business he watched fascinated as they fell back on to the bed and the man tipped the girl off his lap into the pillows he shuddered slightly as the man came to the mirror and inspected his face for telling defects and then set about some frantic washing of his peeledprawn penis jaw clenched teeth bared he found himself enclosed by the drama of this private screening the architect dressing tearing at his shirt desperate to be clothed again the throwing of money too much on to the bed the girl still not moving he found his heart thumping in his chest as the door closed and he heard the clattering feet on the wooden stairs he ran his hands over his pate and into the hairline of his neatly clipped brilliantined head to the fat of his neck and shoulders which he gripped the girl remained facedown in the pillows she stretched a small hand behind her he was touched to see a cheap puzzle ring on her third finger she reached in between her legs with thumb and forefinger and as if she was pulling a splinter yanked out the used condom the fat man sank to his knees with a low groan this had satisfied something in him turned some grey beaten crust of earth and found dark rich soil underneath miguel admired history he liked its weight its huge glacial unstoppable movement onwards he would have liked to have fashioned it he had in a way but not enough he supposed that this was why he enjoyed this little scene so mucha shot of a mans secret history his real story the one that would never get published but would be known had been observed then he saw this girl jorge had been right she was different she was something special jorge remembered things that worried him she was naked now and looking across the room to the mirror he liked to see her face he liked to see her fronton facing the mirror across the bed she never closed her eyes her big blue eyes stared out with terrible innocence and this is what joined him to her in all these things she did she was looking for something like him turning things over and over reworking things over and over never quite getting to the source not knowing what the source was hed already made up his mind he had to speak to her he already knew where she went to school hed followed her today would be the day he sat on the edge of the bed and held his belly in both hands black hairs burst through a hole in his shirt where a button had come undone he opened up his shirt and stood in front of the mirror he sucked in his gut fatter than an acornfed black pigs arse he rebuttoned the shirt flicked the collar up and fed the tie round the tie made for him by sofias friend the inspectors daughter he humped on his jacket and from a pigs arse made a patrician banker he looked around the room as if for the last time the cracked cornice the concentric stains on the ceiling the seasick floor patched with shagged and pileless rugs covering holes in the biscuitbrittle lino the wardrobe with its door hanging open permanently stupid he put his hands in his pockets and buffed his leg with his credit cards he left the room down the weaklylit wooden staircase with its strip of blue lino past the neonlit reception with no jorge down more stairs and more stairs to the huge wooden front doors and into the dark and shade of the sunstroked street and the distant applause of traffic he breathed that was the last time that was definitely the last time he sat outside the school on avenida duque de avila in his wifes mercedes with the engine running shed be coming out soon there was something sharp sticking into him from his pocket he put his hand in and what was this a tube of lubricant how did that get in there he didnt want to do that and condoms this was not what he had intended he threw them in the glove compartment its her whos she with whos she talking to hes after her the look in his eyes hes been there anybody can tell shes walking away now this is not how it should be look at her walk one foot in front of the other just like the models do hes not letting her get away hes after her hes grabbed her wrist now and shes turned and twisted it away from him she doesnt want this my god hes hit her that look on her face what does that say miguel swallowed hard everything happening quicker than hed expected more things happening than hed expected all these people in the street he pulled out she was on the move again down the catwalk he pulled up at the traffic lights and buzzed the passenger window down excuse me he shouted shes turned to him those eyes are on him now can he get the words out how do i get to the monsanto park from here he said shes come off the pavement shes rested an elbow on the window ledge shes glanced into the back of the car why what does she want suddenly her fingernails are bitten down to nothing monsanto park from here thats a bit complicated she said the sweat came up into his palms am i going in the right direction more or less its just it can get complicated after the parque de palhava youre not going in that direction are you im getting the train to cascais im going to cascais i just dont want to go out on one of the main routes at this time of day on a friday i want to cut through monsanto and join the cascais motorway that way ill give you a lift to your door hows that she looked at miguel those blue eyes looked into his and what did they see the vulnerability of the old fat guy nothing to worry about unless he said inspired by the stress of the moment you havent got to go back to your office first or anything have you the psychology was right he remembered things she got in the lights changed miguels foot came off the clutch a little too quick and the car shot forward with a squeak from the tyres he eased himself back into his seat calmed down they were together now hed done it hed made contact she had a small bag she threw it between her feet she didnt put on the seat belt he buzzed the window up they were comfortable in the air conditioning keep going straight she said and rocked very slightly backwards and forwards sadness flapped inside his chest like a flag at halfmast he changed gear his knuckle made contact with her brown thigh she didnt move it away he rested his hand on the gear stick whats your name he asked catarina she said he smiled behind his moustache she didnt ask him his kids dont he talked about his daughter sofia his brothers daughter but he didnt say that he tried to shut out the second voice in his head which told him that it knew what he was doing he was being nice he was good at being nice and it was working already she kicked off one of her clumpy shoes and brought her leg up rested the heel on the edge of the seat go right here and take the first left she said do you like music he asked wondering instantly if that sounded stupid sure she said and shrugged a small shoulder at him what sort of music maybe not your sort of music try me i know them all my daughter plays them all the time the smashing pumpkins he nodded and engaged her in a game to translate the bands name into portuguese but there were too many names for different types of pumpkin and they couldnt decide that was when she told him that she was a singer in a band and they missed the turning to monsanto they headed north and wandered the streets of sete rios around the zoo and then back down towards the gigantic aguas livres aqueduct striding out into the hot afternoon and then on to the right road which underpassed the railway line and into the park as they talked as she fielded his questions shed gather her blonde hair behind her in a fist and gnawing a nonexistent nail would study the windscreen looking for a reply in her head it made him feel how young she was again how sometimes she was fifteen and other times twentyfive how sometimes she was a schoolgirl and other times she could be having sex in a pensao with forget that strike it from the text they climbed up into the park through the pines the stone pines threaded with empty tarmacked tracks some leading up to the military installation and the forte de monsanto others cutting through to the motorway and still others heading deeper into the park what time is it she said and leaned over to look at the dashboard he smelt her hair just gone five oclock she sat back and slipped her shoe back on again and stretched her legs out into the footwell theres a place up here with a great view of lisbon shall we take a look he asked wanting it to be just an outing ok she shrugged he pulled into the empty car park of the restaurant at the alto da serafina and drew up at the low wall they got out and stood on the wall the city stretched out before them the squat colossal dark glass towers of the amoreiras dominated the skyline those towers she said that whole area used to be mulberry trees for the lisbon silk industry he said talking to her like he talked to his own daughter his brothers daughter theyre alien those towers they look like theyre going to kill the city suck up all its energy it surprised him he didnt say anything do i know you she asked doing her catwalk away from him down the low wall he tensed in his shirt and looked at her legs i dont think so i keep thinking ive seen you lets get back in the car he said i dont want to be late she got off the wall flashing the gusset of her knickers he pulled out of the car park and carried on through the pines the endless umbrella pines he took a wrong turning out of the sun she didnt notice he stopped the car this isnt right he said his heart pounding in his throat he backed into the trees what are you doing she asked im just turning round he moved deeper into the trees and into a clearing out of sight of the road now the engine stalled the sun shone into the car the tinted windows darkened she looked down at his hand on the gear stick whats the matter she said i dont know i did see you before she said i remember now you came into the cafe near the school you were standing behind me the cafe what school the bella italia near the school not me i didnt know you were at school im sure it was you that tie in the mirror in the mirror he asked something travelling through his veins now like electricity gone bad he saw everything pinsharp right down to the tiniest blonde twomillimetrelong hairs on her leg she moved into the corner of her seat and brought her feet up on to it not slipping out of her shoes this time ive seen you before he said and she brought her fists up under her chin in the pensao nuno at lunchtime with your two boyfriends were they the ones from your band the information mesmerized her how had it happened how had it gone wrong it should not have been like this he swallowed again looking at her but not looking at her reflection in the windscreen what do you want she asked her voice quavering there was still time to stop this he could stop it now go back to the talk go back to the smashing pumpkins he didnt have to he stretched out a hand a hand thick with hair hair that went up the fingers nearly to the top joint animal hands he circled her ankle with his thumb and forefinger she flicked her foot out and the rhinestonestudded heel of her shoe thumped into him just above his heart he gripped the ankle and held on she grabbed his tie he crushed her wrist in his hand and she yelped and let go he twisted her arm she lashed out with her other foot and caught him high on the chest this time he twisted her arm more and she turned she had to turn he pressed forward with his weight over her he pushed her face into the corner of the seat and the door dont hurt me she said please dont hurt me he grunted her noise coming to him muffled he pushed up her skirt and yanked her pants down under her knees right off over her stupid shoes she felt her back cracking under his weight heard him fumbling in the glove compartment not far from her head she wrenched her other arm out from underneath her and tried to lash out he drew her head back no she said no please dont hurt me do what you want but dont hurt me chapter xxxviii wednesday th june bella italia av duque de avila lisbon the bella italia was empty at this hour except for the old woman at her table with her view of the street and the young barman whod served catarina her last coffee do you remember me i asked the old woman who was wearing a pink silk dress of some class and antiquity youre the inspector she said looking up from under lids more heavily pleated than her silk dress the day that girl got slapped out there on the street do you remember a car a black mercedes outside the school around the time it happened like an old taxi except it didnt have a green roof yes i said i liked those old taxis black with a

only one inspector did he do anything he ordered a coffee over her shoulder i think they looked at each other in the mirror he was big and fat said dona jacinta and bald with a moustache and an expensive suit and his tie said marco his tie what about his tie he bought his tie in the same shop that you bought yours said dona jacinta my daughter made it for me i said automatically then your

out the picture id just torn from vip magazine i smoothed it out on to the bar and tapped the face of miguel da costa rodrigues shit said marco thats him show it to dona jacinta thats him i drank the water and went to the door dona jacinta had her glasses out she took the picture and nodded thats the same tie too she said i folded the picture back into my wallet nobody says anything about this not one word a man in dark glasses came into the bar he looked at the three of us and backed out i ran down to saldanha i was sweating in seconds i picked up a taxi and told him to go to the rua da gloria and he gave me a knowing look i sat in the back astride the drive shaft of a despised beige taxi and sweated supporting myself on two hands the traffic was heavy heading down to the praca marques de pombal and the driver cut down the back streets around the hospitals of miguel bombarda and santa marta i sprinted up the blue lino to the pensao nuno reception no jorge i slapped and hammered on the counter dinged the bell jorge came down the stairs his flipflops slapping the heels of his feet taking the steps one at a time leaning on the bannister that leg doesnt look too good jorge it isnt he said with instant aggression what do you want ive come to balance you out he stopped on the stairs look he said i told you id been sick are you going to answer my questions ask them first ill see catarina i said the girl who was killed you said shed been in here before friday lunchtimes i did what about the friday lunchtime before last she was here where he hesitated sensing i knew something more this time i came up the stairs at him you can stay down there he said i just need to think show me the room it was the same one as last time show it to me he turned and shuffled round on the step aged twenty years in as many hours i followed his flipflops his feet blue at the ankle who was she with jorge he didnt answer his breathing laboured at the top of the stairs he leaned over the bannister rail there were noises coming from the room wild ecstatic noises of the sort a working girl learns with her first customer who was she with jorge could have been a tap salesman from braga for all i know lets take a look in the room next to it see if thatll jog that memory of yours she wasnt in that room i dont feel like interrupting so well go in this room its occupied its very quiet in there for a room thats occupied i told you open the door its locked get it open he knocked on the door as if he didnt want to wake a princess you can do better than that jorge but the door opened a small man in a cheap suit with a neat little pot belly stood in the darkened room i nodded him out and he shot down the stairs quicker than a pickpocket i turned the weak light on the room was empty no girl i checked the cupboard its door already hanging open from the slope of the floor interesting jorge i checked the unrumpled bed there was a single dent close to the foot of the bed opposite the mirror i sat on it it was uncomfortably warm there were two thumbprints on the mirror i lifted the mirror off the hooks there was a view into the next room of a guy doing his very best with a girl handcuffed to the bedstead who was in here last friday lunchtime jorge i shouted and the friday before that and all the other fridays for all i know the guy in the next room stopped and looked over come on jorge the guy eased himself off the girl and came over to the mirror the girl followed him with her eyes i tapped on the back of the mirror and the guy leapt back as if hed seen his wife at the window and started ripping into his clothes didnt even take the condom off i took out the picture of miguel rodrigues and held it up to jorge was this the guy who was in this room last friday lunchtime he nodded out loud jorge it was him the guy from the next room appeared in the doorway looking murderous if you want to help with a police investigation leave your address at reception i said he thundered down the stairs without a word the girl framed in the hole left by the mirror looked from one chained wrist to the other how long have you known him jorge i asked you must be old pals by now thirtyfive years or so thirtyfive years or so i said early sixties a very old pal i looked him up and downthis tired ruined man i think i need a cigarette inspector mine are downstairs i gave him one and lit it for him his hands trembling now he lowered himself on to the end of the bed you and miguel i said it looks like your trains got separated went off on different tracks he had some advantages that i didnt family the room was stuffy airless jorge sucked on the cigarette pulled his shirt off the rolls of empty skin around his belly his face already grey and brokendown began to take on a green tinge in the weak fortywatt light his eyes unshifting stared into a deep waterless hole silted with bitterness his father owned a bank banco de oceano e rocha i asked and he nodded is that where you met no no we met in caxias in caxias prison i looked at the tornout picture of the sleek miguel da costa rodrigues at his charity function at the ritz you dont look like communists i said i mean he doesnt jorge shook his head were you crooks i asked thatd be more like it we were with the pide said jorge brushing some ash from his fly we worked in the interrogation centre wait a second here jorge i said his father owned the bank fifteen years ago i remember it it was a big thing it got into the newspapers all over the world the owner of the bank was killed in a car crash on the marginal the whole family was killed i dont remember the name but it wasnt rodrigues it was abrantes his name is manuel abrantes why did he change his name jorge dumped his cigarette in the sink it hissed and stuck youve come this far jorge he did some things inspector we all did some things manuel abrantes did some bigger things than most he was an inspector de policia how about that what sort of things are we talking about he killed a woman in caxias prison it was an accident i think she miscarried i dont know maybe he kicked her anyway after that he was promoted to chefe de brigada that sounds like pretty regular stuff for pide im sure there are a lot worse he was the leader of the squad that shot general machedo in spain a drop of sweat travelled the length of my spine now you see said jorge how you have to be careful i lit myself a cigarette this time and the hand was not so steady im finished with him now ive protected him over this thing this girl and now im done with him look at me inspector he said and i turned my eyes away from the floor not really wanting to look at him do i look like someone whos ever eaten at manuel abrantes table i started out of the room and looked back at him from the door a collapsed human being he stared into the niche above the sink without seeing further than his own head dont rush it inspector he said its not over by a long way dont worry jorge im not ready yet but if anything happens to me ill know where to come looking you dont have to worry about me where does he live abrantes somewhere in lapa where else he took over his brothers old house i dont know the address there was a faint cry for help from nextdoor jorges eyes suddenly registered what he was looking at he shook his head and hauled himself to his feet i ran down the stairs two at a time it was after five oclock now i called olivia and asked for miguel da costa rodrigues address in lapa i called carlos at a quartertosix we were standing outside a house in rua prior leaning up against an old wall on the other side of the street at pm an old guy opened up the gates to the house one of two garage doors opened electronically and a black mercedes c backed out into the street i could smell the petrol engine and the registration number was nt but it did not have tinted windows lurdes rodrigues was clearly visible through the glass she parked up in the sunny street and got out she went back into the house and returned with an envelope in those few minutes the windows turned to black chapter xxxix wednesday th june luisas apartment rua actor taborda lisbon we were lying on the bed she was at rightangles to me with her head on my stomach we were both naked not even a sheet over us the windows were open and the faintest cool breeze and late light were coming into the room we smoked and shared a heavy glass ashtray which sat in one quarter of the bed and a glass of whisky which lay in another we stared at the ceiling id spent the last forty minutes telling luisa madrugada everything i knew about the murder of catarina oliveira we hadnt exchanged a word for the last quarter of an hour i fingered a small pool of whisky spilt between her breasts and put it in my mouth ive been interested in the banco de oceano e rocha for the past couple of months she said dont open an account there ive been trying to find a link between them and nazi gold leave your money under the mattress like a good peasant listen to me i am listening i said fingering more whisky into my mouth why are you looking at nazi gold because its a hot topic all these commissions are forcing banks to open up their archives all over the world itll look good in my thesis if i can pull something off here in portugal and anyway a study of salazars economy without looking at wartime gold transactions would be a serious omission carlos read a piece out to me on sunday about our reserves going up sevenfold during the war on the back of sales of wolfram tin sardines olive oil blankets hides you name it we sold it to both sides some people see a problem in that or are surprised by it i said to me its just the way business works theres no morality in money my theory is that all salazars public building worksthe motorways the roads the th april bridge the national stadium all the urbanization in and around lisboni think it was funded not just by his successful playing of the market during the second world war but also by his acquiescence towards the end of the war in allowing the nazis to move their loot out of europe and somewhere in all that is the banco de oceano e rocha that could be a dangerous conclusion i said maybe you should tell me how you got there just on the other side of the banco de oceano e rocha building near the anjos metro in rua francisco ribeiro is a very ugly building belonging to the banco de portugal in there they have all the bank and company information all the statutes from all the companies registered in portugal since the nineteenth century if youre a really boring sad person you can go in there and leaf through all the statutes of the banco de oceano e rocha and youll find that the three original directors of the bank were joaquim abrantes oswald lehrer and klaus felsen when was this during the war she said taking another sip of whisky by there were only two directorsjoaquim abrantes and klaus felsen with a fiftyonefortynine split in the shareholding i thought they confiscated all german assets in portugal after the war they did but joaquim abrantes share was fiftyone percent he was the owner it was a portuguese bank she said another interesting thing is that ive been looking through an old archive which belonged to a belgian businessman im a friend of the granddaughter guess whose name turns up there klaus felsen he was a wolfram exporter so you think youve nearly got something i said what happened to klaus felsen after the war hes there in the company statutes right up to when he disappeared for good never to rise again so i asked my father if hed ever heard of the name and he said it was a bit of a scandal in the lisbon business community christmas eve klaus felsen shot dead a german tourist in his home and he spent nearly twenty years in the caxias prison for murder interesting and do you know who the company lawyer was i think i do i said dr aquilino oliveira he completely rewrote the statutes of the bank excluding our friend klaus felsen how long was he their lawyer for until and then what he stopped being their lawyer these things dont go on for ever but maybe it had something to do with the fact that pedro abrantes whod taken over from his dead father died in a car accident even i remember that those children and miguel da costa rodrigues became the new director and major shareholder of the bank things change when that happens lawyers for one theres something but im not really seeing a connection here im not seeing a motive for killing catarina i dont see how this can you want to question miguel da costa rodrigues i want to hit him hard and fast so that he doesnt have time to hide behind his big friends so that he has to come down to the policia judiciaria and face me and a tape recorder then you have to get public opinion behind you through the media i said but i havent got a story you should see this guy jorge raposo hes expide and the most pathetic seedy human being in lisbon but what about klaus felsen the guys got to be a hundred and ten years old eightyeight in fact hes still going and there was an address in the old company statutes so i did the easiest thing first i looked in the phone book to see if he still lives in the same place klaus felsen casa ao fim do mundo azoia and you see that piece of paper on the bedside table thats his phone number have you called him i didnt really know what i wanted to ask him about i thought id have to do a lot more work to be able to have a decent conversation with him and now i think we should both see what hes got to say ah i said now ive got it what this is your launch story isnt it could be no no no why not you said let me get this right nobodys going to have their trousers down in any magazine i publish i think that was it wasnt it thats your end of the story my end is that one of portugals largest international banks was funded directly by nazi gold she said you can do the trousersdown stuff ill let you tag that on the end you think klaus felsens going to tell you everything all on your first date see if hes alive first she said nodding at the piece of paper i picked up the telephone and dialled the number a woman answered speaking in german i asked for klaus felsen hes sleeping she said whats the best time to speak to him what is it concerning the banco de oceano e rocha silence and who are you im a detective with the policia judiciaria in lisbon im investigating the murder of a young girl i think senhor felsen might be able to help us with our enquiries ill talk to him but you know he doesnt keep regular hours sometimes he wakes up in the middle of the night other times in the late morning sometimes he sleeps all the way through if he agrees to speak to you you must come when i say i gave her luisas telephone number and put the phone down i paced the room naked chewing my thumbnail luisa smoked at the ceiling i called olivia on her mobile and told her id be late and possibly wouldnt come home at all and that she should get a meal at my sisters dont worry about me she said are you in a car i asked the signal breaking into static im with sofia and her mother were going back to cascais theyre going to take me out to dinner and ill stay the night ok no what i cant hear you no that wouldnt be ok i said why can please bloody thing ga i want you back at home but you just said you wouldnt be there i know what i just said then dont be unreasonable why should i go back to because i cant hear you olivia the lines breaking up bye the line went dead trouble asked luisa the telephone still in my hand rang i yanked it to my ear olivia inspector coelho asked a germaninflected voice this is me i said herr felsen is available now he will speak to you do you know the house no its the last house in portugal just before the lighthouse it could take us up to an hour to get there come as quickly as you can we got into the shower together and dressed i tried olivias mobile again but shed turned it off luisa told me not to worry about it that nothing was going to happen tonight but the tension crept into me and stiffened a ridge across my shoulders my daughter could be spending the night with a murderer a murderer of young girls luisa drove and talked me down on the way out of lisbon i sat with her laptop and camera on my knees and kept the lid on my panic what could we do trawl through every restaurant in cascais i didnt even know where the rodrigues weekend house was in cascais and when i checked the phonebook there was nothing under his namethe property was probably his wifes and the phone still in her maiden name we came off the end of the motorway and headed west through aldeia de juzo and malveira we climbed the twisting road the end of the day dying now behind the high chapel of peninha the lights of isolated houses suspended in the black velvet of the heather the ships on the dark atlantic heading for the last bluegrey moment we turned off left to azoia at the highest point of the road past old windmills transformed into bars through the village of barking dogs and out again into the heather and gorse the blades of light from the lighthouse slashing through the now complete darkness we came off the tarmac on to a length of beaten track which took us up to a low walled house with an enclosed roof terrace on the top in which a little light was burning a woman bent into our headlights opening the gate a chained german shepherd was barking madly in the courtyard when he saw us he took long pelting runs right to the limit of his chain i am frau junge she said in a sweet voice on the brink of a yodel she shushed the dog who liked the voice and sat down with his head cocked to one side frau junge took us up the outside steps to the enclosed roof terrace by the little light was a huddle in a wheelchair head down near his chestnot a livelylooking person one of the blades from the lighthouse swept above the roof of the house frau junge spoke into the ear of the heavilyblanketed man in the wheelchair his head came up frau junge dragged two chairs across from the wall and placed them near the wheelchair a single hand came out from under the blankets and beckoned one of the chairs closer she sighed as if he was a pesky child and moved the chair closer he wants the girl to sit next to him thats all watch his hand its the only one hes got and it can be fast and intrusive she said and left us in the room luisa had the look of a woman who wished shed worn a longer skirt i suffer from the cold now said felsen in a crackedchina voice small shards missing the bones of his skull the plates of his cranium seemed painfully obvious under the thin stretched skin under which veins operated close to the surface his eyelids were gathered in swags close to the lashes so that the corners slid down towards the cheekbones making him look inconsolable his nose was sharp pointed and scraped raw we introduced ourselves and he hung on to luisas hand do you know why were here asked luisa you can smoke if you like i dont mind people smoking near me frau junge told you why were here yes yes he said but please smoke i like the smell i lit a cigarette luisa lit one of her own im half the man i was im shrinking and they keep cutting bits off me i lost an arm in prison and half an ear when i came out they cut off my right leg up to the knee i dont remember why too much lying down in prison or was it the smoking that might have been it luisa stubbed out her cigarette and scratched her calf of course they dont take the bad one he said ive had a limp since i was a child no thats the one that stays they take the good one i told the surgeon i said this hospital is eating me alive what does he care he laughed which strained his voice to shattering point the bank he said thats why youre here you want to talk about the bank ive been waiting fifteen years to talk about the bank but youre the first people who want to listen nobody looks back any more nobody knows where they come from they only want to know where theyre going i need my hands to write while youre talking said luisa withdrawing her hand and arranging her laptop ill rest it on your shoulder he said klaus felsen told his story in two parts the first part with breaks took nearly four hours he faltered twice the first when he recounted the ambush on the car of the british agent he seemed to stop short he fell silent for some minutes and i thought hed run out of steam again and needed to rest but when he restarted his tone of voice had changed it was confessional he described how savagery had got off the leash and hed killed the driver and then in more chilling terms what hed done to the english agent edward burton luisa stopped typing the second time he faltered was over his last meeting with eva brucke he gave two versions the first was a noble one of love torn asunder by war and he quickly dried up when luisas hands stopped moving over the keys of the laptop we waited he gathered himself and he told the real version the killing of obergruppenfuhrer lehrer seemed to take something out of him his head dropped and he fell asleep we waited for a few minutes twenty or thirty turns of the lighthouse luisa eased herself out from under his hand and we went downstairs frau junge was still awake watching satellite television eating apple pie and drinking camomile tea she told us to wait that he would probably come round again in an hour she offered us some apple pie we wolfed it down normally its me listening to his endless stories she said ach the war its all such a long time ago my parents they never talked about it never this one he talks about it all the time as if it was yesterday has that hand of his been behaving properly the hands been fine said luisa still dazed from the work and the horror of it if he takes your hand be firm dont let him put it where he wants i tried olivia again on her mobile which was still turned off luisa called her father spoke to him briefly and plugged the computer into the telephone jack and squeezed the first half of the story down the line thirty minutes later he called back and luisa gave him more background about my murder investigation she hung up he wants some supporting documents hes not prepared to publish unless its backed up with some kind of documentary proof i looked at frau junge who sipped her tea and shrugged i have photographs but documents youll have to ask him a red light flashed on the wall by her head with a faint buzzing sound hes awake said frau junge the second half of the story was shorter but took longer to tell he needed more breaks his mind drifted and resettled on details wed already heard he kept coming back to a woman called maria antonia medinas who he was convinced had been killed by manuel abrantes i told him it fitted in with what jorge raposo had told me but we couldnt get him to tell us what she was to him was she a fellowprisoner a criminal or a political had he known her before he held things back whether on purpose or because his brain slid over things we couldnt tell it was close to the end before he stunned us with the revelation that hed been set up by joaquim abrantes pide friends whod put him inside for twenty years and that manuel abrantes was his son we asked who the mother was and he couldnt remember her name but he thought she might be still alive up in the beira somewhere dawn came up unspectacularly the lighthouse stopped flashing and became a foghorn as a dense sea mist rolled in over the cliffs and submerged the house so that the gate on the other side of the courtyard was only occasionally visible we have days like this said felsen it wouldnt be so bad if you knew the whole country was like it but i know that a hundred metres around the corner the sun is shining theres one last thing said luisa we need some documents if this story is going to mean anything have you got documentary proof that the gold existed his hand disappeared under the blankets and came back with a warm key everything you need is in the metal filing cabinet in the study frau junge will show you we stood up his hand went out for luisas which she gave him and he pressed it to his lips which made her shudder youve had an extraordinary life senhor felsen she said to cover herself we all had big lives then he said looking out at the fogfilled morning even an ssschutze could have a big life then but it might not have been the one he wanted the twenty years i spent thinking about this in caxias i wouldnt have minded a smaller life i wouldnt mind some of my regrets being smaller and what is your biggest asked luisa perhaps you are the romantic type you might think he said and hesitated for a response which luisa didnt give him perhaps after all ive told you you can tell me what my biggest regret should be she didnt respond he seemed to deflate it wasnt eva it was regrettable that she despised me in the end but that came about by my own inaction he said and struggled in his blankets for a moment like a baby the action i most regret was what i did to the english agent edward burton i dont know why it happened over the years i blamed abrantes for it i blamed the drink ive even blamed the dutch girl for stealing my cufflinks but after twenty years in caxias with nothing much else to think about i still couldnt find any reason for it and ive had to come to the conclusion that i had a visit from pure evil i am not senhora madrugada he said finally a man with prospects his head went down and we left in the filing cabinet we found copies of the documents showing the golds origination there were also photographs showing felsen and joaquim abrantes and other members of the abrantes family including the young manuel luisa dropped me off in paco de arcos she continued to lisbon i had breakfast with antonio borrego in his bar which was empty apart from the two of us you look tired ze he said laying out the coffee and buttered toast i had a long night you didnt eat properly no maybe i should cook something for you no this is fine what was keeping you up all night work as usual i heard they raided your house and theyve arrested faustinho i sank my teeth into the toast sipped some coffee you fell under a tram too he said fell i was being diplomatic i wiped molten butter from my chin is she a girlfriend the woman who dropped you off just now the whole world passes before you in here doesnt it antonio i said you dont have to go outside it all comes to you its the nature of running a bar he said i wouldnt do it if it was just a question of serving drinks i poured more coffee added milk you were in caxias werent you at the end there in i asked that was when i used to go out and do things and look what happened did you ever hear the name felsen klaus felsen we heard about him he was in for murder the politicals and the regulars didnt have much to do with each other they kept us apart what about a woman called maria antonia medinas silence i looked up from my toast he was pinching the bridge of his nose with his eyes closed i was just thinking he said was she a regular i dont know i dont know anything about her just the name she wasnt on the political side that i know of have you still got friends you could ask friends well comrades then i said and he laughed i went back to the house and found olivia in the bathroom brushing her teeth what happened to you i asked in english i did what my daddy told me to do she said and looked back at the sink annoyed you spent the night here thats what you told me to do she said have i been a good girl how did you get back senhor rodrigues brought me back after dinner on your own i said my hands suddenly icecold the others didnt want to come she said i felt a complete idiot what did you talk about with senhor rodrigues i dont know nothing much try and remember i said it would help she spat the toothpaste out and swilled her mouth oh yes he was asking me about the smashing pumpkins smashing pumpkins theyre a band dad she said saddened by my lack of cool a popular singing group i think you used to call them in your day then i told her without telling her why she shouldnt spend any more time with the rodrigues family chapter xl friday th june paco de arcos lisbon i was lying in bed unable to sleep listening to the traffic smoking cigarettes reading fernanda ramalhos pathology report for the hundredth time i was two hours away from a media storm that would change my life and now i didnt want it i wanted the old life back it had been a terrible week id assumed when luisa had said her father vitor madrugada had a magazine on the blocks that everything was ready and all he had to do was press a button but he didnt even have a printer and it cost him some very big money to get one because printers presses dont hang around doing nothing waiting for a jobtheyre running all the time it took a week it meant he had time to think hed wanted a big story to launch his new business magazine and had ended up with something monumental that would stand for as long as the marques de pombal had stood in his praca he had to be reassured i had to make a presentation to him his board of directors including luisa and his editor i had to lay out my entire case against miguel da costa rodrigues and my reasons for attacking him in this fashion the editor was nervous he was an intelligent man but one whod come from an age when the media still had respect for public figures a hangover perhaps from the days when journalists were told what to write to him the directorgeral of the banco de oceano e rocha was a very important man with influential friends and a wife also from an excellent family and a very religious woman whereas catarina oliveira im not convicting him in this article id replied im just making sure that miguel rodrigues also known as manuel abrantes comes down to the policia judiciaria to answer my questions hes done everything he can to block this investigation hes used his friends to make sure that i dont get the information i need about his car hes had me removed from the case hes had me pushed under a tram ive had my home invaded by narcotics agents and your bosss daughter has had hate messages plastered over her car we do have some justification the editor had looked at luisas father i hope youre right vitor madrugada had said to me this is a big storyimportant families a dynasty based on nazi gold a pide murderer sex drugs and the killing of an innocent or rather a young girl who did not deserve to die this is a story that will go through portugal like a forest fire in summer and you dont want to be perceived as an arsonist no hed said i dont and i dont think i am one hed pressed the button id left the meeting with elation and dread on either shoulder i drifted around for a few days jojo silva called me about lourenco goncalves who still hadnt turned up i told him to file a missingpersons report and id make sure it was handled carlos and i worked in a desultory fashion on the xeta murder case with little success at am i made some coffee and already there was a murmur in the street in less than ten minutes the calcada outside the house was full of journalists and cameramen i called the psp station and asked them to send down some men and a car at am i stepped out into the street and met a barrage of questions and flashlights i said nothing and set off at a brisk pace to where the psp were waiting with a car i led a motorcade into lisbon to the policia judiciaria building where more newsmen were waiting the psp car dropped me round the back and i went straight up to narcisos office this time i didnt have to wait and it was a very different engenheiro jaime leal narciso on the other side of the door he asked me to sit down he sat on the same side of the desk as me we smoked the secretary brought in some coffee he quietly reinstated carlos and me as the investigating officers in the case and gave me full permission to bring in miguel da costa rodrigues for questioning ill want to search his property as well i said theres a search warrant already prepared he said at there was a phone call in narcisos office from miguel da costa rodrigues lawyer volunteering to bring his client down for questioning in the policia judiciaria building at miguel da costa rodrigues was in the building his lawyer went out front and delivered an opening statement to the journalists he denounced the policia judiciaries methods of trial by media and clarified the voluntary nature of his clients appearance in the building he didnt respond to any of the questions that came back at him at narciso clapped me on the back and showed me a reassuring fist with which he would help me smash miguel da costa rodrigues he put on his jacket and went out to the front of the building he beat the lawyers statement to a pulp and took eightyfive percent of the credit for the investigation so far leaving me with fifteen and carlos with none he was doing what he was paid for he was doing what he did best at miguel rodrigues was shown into interrogation room three which had the largest observation window some of the men gathering at that window id never seen in the building before it was like a cocktail party in there at i made the necessary introductions to the tape recorder miguel da costa rodrigues showed no sign that wed ever met he looked like a man whod prepared a story in his head and it was going to take an earthmover to get him to deviate from it he was a pide man he would know about interrogation my only advantage was that he might not have been on the end of many interrogations himself he glanced at the reflective panel set in the wall his lawyer sat next to him like a trained hawk with only the tips of his fingers on the edge of the table i started by asking senhor rodrigues to clarify his identity and he calmly revealed that he was manuel abrantes and that hed changed his identity in order to reduce the possibility that his previous employment might reflect against the bank i didnt ask him to elaborate on that i didnt want to blur the focus of my opening interview with him senhor rodrigues i started where were you at lunchtime at around on friday june th i was in the pensao nuno what were you doing there i was watching three people engaged in a sexual act how i was in an adjacent room watching them through a twoway mirror set in the wall did you know any of these people no had you seen any of them before he conferred with his lawyer id seen the girl before where in the same pensao when exactly a week before engaged in a sexual act yes how many times have you seen this girl a few times can you be more specific senhor rodrigues you should know that senhor jorge raposo the manager of the pensao is cooperating with the policia judiciaria i cant be certain it could have been as many as twelve times and always in the pensao nuno and always engaged in sexual acts with other men although last friday was the first time id seen her with two men at the same time after any of these occasions did you make any attempt to follow her he leaned over to his lawyer again two weeks ago on friday i followed her from the pensao nuno to the school she was attending on avenida duque de avila thats not quite correct senhor rodrigues im sorry no she went to a cafe near the school first did you go in there yes do you remember its name no how did you know she was attending the liceu d dinis i followed her out of the cafe and saw her go into the building so when you were observing her in the pensao nuno last friday you already knew she was a schoolgirl yes the sexual act you were watching last friday can you describe it please the girl was kneeling between two young men one of the men had his penis in her mouth the other was sodomizing her sodomizing her i asked beginning to see his strategy now yes how did you know that he was sodomizing her i could see from where i was sitting how was that possible they had moved the bed in front of the mirror and i could see very clearly what was happening would you say that she was enjoying what she was doing there was nothing in her face to indicate to me that she was not did you follow her on that occasion no but you were in a car waiting for her outside the school later that friday afternoon at around fourthirty yes can you describe the car you were in it was a black mercedes c petrol registration nt is that your car the car is in my wifes name so you were waiting for the girl yes what were your intentions to talk to her talk to her about what the possibility of having sex with her and what happened she came out of the school she was talking to someone an older man perhaps one of her teachers i dont know they were talking or rather they were arguing because at one point he hit her slapped her face she walked away from him up the street in the direction of avenida de outubro when i saw that i pulled away from the kerb stopped at the traffic light next to her asked her if she was all right and whether i could give her a lift anywhere what did she say she got in the car she didnt say anything not that i recall we have witnesses who say you talked for nearly a minute until the lights changed thats correct i remember now i asked her the way somewhere she started to explain and then said it was easier to show me what did you discuss in the car music we talked about music is that it yes where did you go i wanted to go back to cascais i decided to cut through the monsanto park to get to the motorway i thought you wanted to have sex with her yes when was that discussed when we were in the monsanto park was she surprised how do you mean originally youd asked her the way somewhere where exactly i dont recall she seemed to think it was complicated monsanto i asked her the way to monsanto it is complicated to get to monsanto from there he said the flustering just starting but having guided you to monsanto i wouldnt think shed want to be dropped there in the middle of nowhere as we began talking she told me that she was going back to cascais and i said id give her a lift there i was but you werent you were only going as far as paco de arcos that evening i said using a recognized tactic for confusing a scripted storyconcentrate on a small detail and tease out the halflies look inspector he said frustrated now i asked her the way somewhere she said she was going to cascais by train i said i was going there by car she seemed happy to get a lift she got in the car i did not force her to come with me she got in there voluntarily if your witnesses are saying i dragged her in theyre not i just want to know exactly how it was senhor rodrigues in order to get her in the car youd told her you were going back to cascais he wasnt happy but he needed to get away from it she got in the car i drove we started talking he said firmly about music and going to cascais so how did sex come up it wasnt hot in the interrogation room but senhor rodrigues was finding it uncomfortable his collar was tight around his neck and sweat was beginning to pimple on his forehead he changed position in his chair several times and wrapped an arm around the back of his lawyers i told her id seen her in the pensao that must have surprised her why she thinks that shes got into a car at random she thinks shes showing somebody the way to monsanto she thinks shes being given a lift to cascais youre talking about music what sort of music were you talking about by the way she said she liked the smashing pumpkins that chilled me down to my liver so youre talking about the smashing pumpkins driving through monsanto and then you change it suddenly youre a punter suddenly youre the one whos been watching her through a twoway mirror in the pensao suddenly senhor rodrigues you are not a nice guy giving a girl a lift youre another creep you dont have to use that kind of abusive language to my client said the lawyer we both looked at him senhor rodrigues i said what was the question im not sure what was her reaction when you told her that youd seen her before performing sex acts in the pensao nuno she was a prostitute for gods sake she did not get into your car as a prostitute she got into your car as a schoolgirl whod had a spat with a man and who was going to show you the way to monsanto so that you could take her on to cascais think about it again senhor rodrigues and tell me how you changed it and what her reaction was changed it i havent changed anything changed what how you changed the situation senhor rodrigues silence the lawyer looked at his client unclear as to what the problem was and already noticing that the truth was not coming out in a continuous milky flow did you perhaps make an assumption senhor rodrigues an assumption i dont follow you did you assume that if you touched her in a sexual way that she would understand or maybe because you were being a nice guy she would just like you and when she didnt understand you had to tell her that youd seen her and how youd seen her and that you knew that really she was a prostitute if that was the case i dont think she would have liked it senhor rodrigues why not thats what she was because it was all going so well senhor rodrigues you were being a nice guy and then in one small sentence perhaps one small action youve shown yourself as something else a creep inspector please said the lawyer exasperated by my disrespect did she put up a fight senhor rodrigues did she lash out give you a little kick perhaps so that you had to be firm no no and no he said seeing his story off the leash and galloping away from him were stuck here senhor rodrigues you have to help this interview along i pulled over into the pine trees in the monsanto park i asked her if she was willing to have sex with me she was youre right inspector she was a little surprised i told her id seen her in the pensao but i didnt tell her that id seen her performing sex acts i just offered her ten thousand escudos for what to have sex with me he said annoyed this isnt your first time with a prostitute is it senhor rodrigues no it isnt i understand its common practice to state exacdy what you want for the price i offered her ten thousand escudos to have straight sex with me and how did this straight sex take place he took a deep breath she knelt on the seat and pulled down her underwear did she completely remove her underwear no i dont think so and what did you do senhor rodrigues i undid my trousers and knelt on the seat she knelt with her legs across the handbrake was that on or off off you were on flat ground yes carry on i knelt behind her and youd given her the money by now he faltered yes so she must have been very angry angry why when you sodomized her senhor rodrigues that wasnt in the deal i did not sodomize her inspector he said quietly that was one of the boys in the pensao he says he didnt hes lying in this situation senhor rodrigues i have an advantage over you because ive read the pathologists report a hundred times over and ive listened very carefully to what youve been saying so i did not sodomize her he said quietly placing his hand flat on the table as if there was a bible there ive just warned you that its not a question of your word against the boys in the pensao senhor rodrigues im giving you an opportunity to tell the truth he checked me over thoroughly he thought i was bluffing his eyes sneered at me i did not sodomize her inspector the medical examination conducted by dr fernanda ramalho indicates that catarina oliveira had been sodomized a condom was used and a waterbased lubricant dr ramalhos examination of the victims sphincteral muscle shows that it was torn indicating that the victim was not accustomed to this kind of sexual activity what do you think that means senhor rodrigues i dont i did not it means that it would be extremely painful senhor rodrigues did she shout out i did not sodomize her im sorry my mistake senhor rodrigues she didnt shout out because and i quote there was nothing in her face to indicate that she was notenjoying what she was doing catarina oliveira did not shout out in the pensao nuno that friday lunchtime did she senhor rodrigues silence did she senhor rodrigues my client has nothing further to add said the lawyer wed like to search senhor rodrigues two houses and his wifes car will you agree to that with a search warrant said the lawyer the rest of the interview was a series of denials senhor rodrigues admitted that he had sex with the girl he said that afterwards shed left the car and that hed driven at a leisurely pace to arrive in paco de arcos to present his cheque to the mayor at the festa he denied hitting her on the back of the head he denied stripping her he denied putting her in the boot of his car and he denied dumping her naked body on the beach in paco de arcos later that night i terminated the interview and took a team of men down to the house in lapa senhor rodrigues and his lawyer met us in lapa the lawyer inspected the search warrant and then sat with his client in the living room the lawyer was already avoiding looking at his client in the way that humans do when theyve been let down by someone theyve trusted i gave the house a quick inspection and announced to the team that i personally wanted to search the suspects wardrobe and study i left four men to work the rest of the house the double garage and the garden carlos and i started on the mercedes it had been valeted seriously valeted it was like a new car inside with that new car smell i told carlos to get the name of the valet company and to go down there and talk not to the manager but to the actual cleaners of the car i started with the front seats tucked under the front passenger seat was a pair of white knickers neatly folded the brand name was sloggi i bagged them as carlos came out of the house i told him to bring the person whod found the knickers back here i found nothing else of interest in the car i took senhor rodrigues up to his wardrobe and asked him to pick out the clothes he had been wearing on the afternoon of friday th june he pointed to a blazer a pair of grey slacks and the tie olivia had made for him the blazer and the slacks had been drycleaned the tie hadnt there was a small red brown stain on the back of it i bagged that and had it sent down to the lab in the study behind an old eighteenthcentury chest we found a cupboard recessed into the wall there were fifteen video tapes in there two wine boxes containing pornographic magazines and at the back neatly folded a white tshirt and a light blue with yellow check miniskirt which were lying on top of a pair of clumpy shoes studded with rhinestones the clothes and shoes were bagged the contents of the cupboard were taken down to the policia judiciaria the man from the valet company whod found the knickers said hed been in two minds about what to do hed found them stuffed down the side of the seat at first he thought they belonged to senhor rodrigues daughter and he was just going to leave them on the seat but then because it was senhor rodrigues whod brought the car in to be cleaned on the monday morning he thought this might be embarrassing so he put them under the seat and decided to mind his own business miguel da costa rodrigues was formally charged with the murder of catarina oliveira at when he was asked to remove his clothing two large bruises were revealed on his chest photographs were taken and he was issued with standard prison clothing and taken to the cells chapter xli monday rd november palacio da justica rua marques da fronteira lisbon ive never wanted fame if id wanted to be famous i wouldnt have been a policeman fame has always struck me as a perverse form of prostitution you perform or just appear and in return receive enormous attention an uncomplicated love nobody knows the famous and the famous know nobody and yet the intensity of emotion the wholesale adoration is bigger more impressive than any individuals love for me the greatest invasion of privacy was to have to accept the fame an inability to accept it would have meant that fame had changed me and for the worse it was the compulsory enjoyment that i couldnt stand i became famous i was a hero i was the little man from down the linha the one whod shaved his beard off for charity see how the smallest thing was changed for my benefit took on the establishment and brought them to justice the media loved me but would they have loved me as much with a beard no new bridgework and fifteen extra kilos i learnt the value of a good suit and a permanent smile the feeding frenzy was ferocious the river tagus boiled pink with the blood of the past miguel da costa rodrigues real identity of manuel abrantes the much feared inspector da policia in pide who ran a network of hundreds of bufos informers who permeated the lives of thousands of ordinary people and who was directly responsible for the suffering of many of the unfortunates in the caxias prison convulsed the nation currentaffairs programmes and talk shows bloomed for weeks as people aired their memories of oppression persecution and torturethe frying pans of tarrafal on cape verde the bull pens of aljube the flooding dungeons of the fort of caxias but this angle was shortlived and when the programmers saw the soaps reasserting themselves at the top of the league they realized their mistakepeople didnt want history they wanted personal history they quickly found jorge raposo in his house of joy and in a halfhour special he reassembled the pide infiltration of general machedos entourage the trap set in the badajoz churchyard the killing of the generals secretary and the summary execution of the general by manuel abrantes it was spellbinding television i couldnt take my eyes off him i got up close to see if i could find the familiar old ruined jorge that id known but his studio makeup was impenetrable his new doublebreasted suit as smooth and hermetic as armour plate i could only imagine his crusty heels encased in their brandnew loafers as a result of the programme the spanish government announced an investigation into the affair as it had taken place on spanish soil they found me the heroic widower fighting against odds that i didnt recognize they found luisa the committed teacher whod become the fearless publisher and the heros lover they found olivia the heros daughter whod cut the tie that had given the investigation its biggest break the new fashion designer who might have been backed personally by miguel da costa rodrigues finally and perhaps the most damaging development for my privacy was that with the publication of the supporting documents for the origination of the gold there was an immediate freeze of all the banco de oceano e rochas assets this was followed by a raid on their offices including the old offices on the rua do ouro in the baixa where two of the original bars of gold were found in an old wall safe the policia judiciaria leapt at the chance of a publicity coup and my face appeared on the front of all the newspapers flanked by the two bars of nazi gold in at least one publication appeared the legend inspector dourado the golden inspector this was followed by the announcement of a full government investigation into the origins funding and affairs of the bank since its inception at this point i thought i was going to lose control of my life completely but my luck turned there were further revelations about the financial scandal that had plagued the companies which had built expo and the developers of the upmarket residential area around the site the spotlight shifted the media reloaded but the zeitgeist was the samefat cats acting with impunity by the end of june id been promoted i didnt get a new job because one didnt exist at the time i got a pay rise which i didnt need because for weeks i wasnt allowed to buy a drink or pay for a meal all bills were settled by others more uncomplicated love i was given a secretary temporarily to handle all my calls which meant i hardly spoke to anyone who wasnt a journalist or a tv producer i had little time i did no work the pj rode high on the success of the investigation i was envied and despised by my colleagues and welcomed into the brotherhood of my superiors it was a relief after intense government pressure when the trial finally took place in record time in the middle of november the prosecution took it seriously i was endlessly coached and rehearsed the defence built their case on catarinas history that although she was a schoolgirl from a respectable family she was nothing more than a common prostitute and druguser they concentrated on her voluntarily getting into the car and her willingness to have straight sex there was no apparent violence against her the fact that no murder weapon was found the lack of motive for the killing there being no witnesses who saw the defendant hitting the girl stripping her loading her into the boot of the car or dumping her on the beach at paco de arcos they puffed miguel rodrigues good character his charity work and that of his wife and the impeccable upbringing of his brothers daughter the prosecutions case hinged on whether the defendant had sodomized the girl or not that was his motive for murder through my testimony the initial interview with miguel rodrigues and the photographs of his bruised chest they not only cast doubt on the veracity of anything that the defendant might have said but also proved beyond reasonable doubt that he had sodomized catarina oliveira that broke the back of the case there was no murder weapon because the murderer had killed with his own hands by strangling the girl he wasnt seen stripping her but ultimately the girls clothes had been found in his possession he wasnt seen dumping the girl but it was clearly established that he was in paco de arcos had left there at night and would therefore have had the opportunity they scythed his good reputation to the ground on monday rd november at the judge handed down his verdict miguel da costa rodrigues also known as manuel abrantes was found guilty of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment i was invited by the minister of internal administration to the jockey club to celebrate with some editors journalists tv producers presenters and highranking police officers when i declined they sent narciso after me it was then that i realized why he was my boss this was his territory i was a stray cat a photograph was taken of luisa and me at the champagne reception and after half an hour narciso let me know that i could leave we drove out to paco de arcos olivia had already eaten and was watching television at my sisters house i took luisa to a bandeira vermelha and a cheerful antonio borrego served us his dish of the day it was one of his favourite alentejano concoctions ensopado de borrego a large tureen of lamb broth with neck chops and breast stewed until the meat has all but parted from the bone nobody cooked it like him he opened a bottle of red borba reserva and left us to it i sipped the wine and ate some cheese and olives i didnt feel like talking even luisa was annoyed with me for dragging her away from the party to her it was an opportunity to network in her new role as fearless publisher and she would have preferred to stay eventually youll tell me what the problem is she said lighting a cigarette in time for the arrival of the main course im depressed is that a posttrial policeman thing like postnatal depression is for women i dont think so maybe youve got postevent blues now youve got to get back to real life i want to get back to real life i dont have to tell you all the reasons why you shouldnt be depressed promotion pay rise pinnacle of your career a bad man put away for life none of that matters what matters is being here eating antonios ensopado de borrego drinking red wine with you i was not built for drinking champagne with arseholes this is the best thing the best thing all right weve relax ze im teasing i sucked some more lamb bones drank more red wine we finished the meal antonio cleared everything away and brought two glasses of aguardente and two bicas we smoked luisa refused to coax me out of my mood the bar emptied antonio loaded the dishwasher tyres ripped along the marginal a bitter wind moved through the trees of the park he didnt do it i said what are we talking about now asked luisa the reason why im depressed i said is that miguel rodrigues or manuel abrantes did not murder catarina oliveira how long have you been thinking this do you want the truth or the media version dont be a chato ze no youre right im being a chato to the last person i should be a chato to i thought he didnt do it from the moment i found the girls clothes in his study which was amongst the most damning pieces of evidence in the whole trial exactly with those clothes in his possession he became the stripper of the body and therefore the most likely murderer and you think somebody else put the clothes there two things miguel rodrigues was supposedly harassing me on and off the case i wasnt getting the information on the car from traffic i was taken off the job i was invaded by narcotics i was pushed under a tram if he was feeling the heat that much why didnt he get rid of one of the most damaging pieces of evidence against him and the second thing why werent the girls knickers with the it was at this point that the parasites got out of control and the most virulent and debilitating of the diseases of the famous ran through me like a bad case of malaria i got a large ugly dose of paranoia nobody knows the famous the famous know nobody with the what asked luisa whod reared back at the same time why are you looking at me like that how am i looking at you i dont mean to youre looking at me as if youre looking into me as if youre looking into the back of my head its nothing i dont know what im thinking any more it wasnt true i did know what id been thinking id been thinking that id got a lot of harassment right up to the moment when i landed miguel rodrigues and having landed him under those difficult circumstances i had to find a way of getting public opinion on my side and what happened my girlfriend of one week is an expert on the salazar economy shes already been looking at the banco de oceano e rocha she produces the name klaus felsen she has a father in magazine publishing whos looking for a big story for a launch issue thats ready to go and when the story broke it was all so easy narciso was suddenly as dreamy as a pastel de nata from the antiga confeitaria in belem and i was desperately hanging on to the mane of a bareback media stallion galloping across the open plains it is the nature of paranoia that things which had seemed so right at the time suddenly become inflamed with suspicion and once id started thinking like that other thoughts began to assert themselves who had given me luisa madrugadas number dr aquilino oliveira like pure quinine for a bad malaria attack theres only one cure for paranoiathe absolute undiluted truth the arranged truth even though there is some justice in it will never be good enough will never absolve the most important people i was sick and i had to have the one and only cure if then i could have thought beyond the tight circles in my head i would have realized that in reaching for the pure truth i was going to disrupt the arranged one if it had been arranged then it had been arranged by somebody somebody powerful and somebody vindictive who would not take kindly to the disruption i looked at luisa again trying not to dig under the surface antonio borrego the only man still letting me pay for my food and drink put the bill down between us chapter xlii tuesday th november poticia judiciaria building rua gomes freire lisbon i sat at my desk and booted up the computer i accessed the missingpersons file and put in a search for lourenco goncalves to see if hed reappeared or been found there was no record of a missingpersons report being logged i looked out of the window at the brilliant sunshine and shivered i found carlos and took him for a walk down to avenida almirante reis it was cold very dry and the wind was a lacerating northerly thered been no rain this year the last three years it had rained the whole of november until i felt as depressed as an englishman this year it had been eerie no rain day after day of brilliant sunshine cloudless skies and rather than joy it brought with it the chilling notion that the planet had been irrevocably damaged the small narrow bar between the anjos and arroios metro stations where id first met jojo silva was packed with midmorning coffeedrinkers we went straight to the back of the cafe jojo silva was sitting at a table staring into an empty coffee cup as if the grounds were going to tell him this weeks lottery numbers i blocked out his light he looked up do they let you take your own calls yet inspector he asked i stopped being a demigod as from yesterday welcome back to mortality whats going on jojo nothing as usual you didnt file a missingpersons report on your friend lourenco goncalves he said i did inspector oh yes i did that it was the least i could do for him why do you think ive been calling you and been told youre not available for the last three months i even tried you yesterday yesterday i said knowing his name hadnt appeared on the message list you want to know why i called you yesterday of all the days he asked the rent is up on lourencos office hes not in a position to renew the lease so the landlord is going to clear the place and rent it out to someone who exists and once thats happened inspector he really is lost wiped clean the three of us crossed avenida almirante reis to a s featureless office building carlos and i went up to the second floor while jojo found the landlord and the key it took him some time are you doing anything tonight i asked leaning up against the wall outside the unnamed office looking for something to take my mind off the monster that was forming in my head just taking olivia to the movies to see what city of angels again she likes it he shrugged its a romantic movie its not the romance shes interested in he said she likes the idea that theres something bigger than all of us out there acting in an unpredictable way not always good not always bad she says it makes her feel secure maybe you have to be young to have that kind of faith in things bad night last night was it i just have the feeling that theres something big on the other side of that door why lourenco goncalves that name whenever ive thought about it ive felt a need to do something but ive never cracked it and now somebodys thought its important enough to delete the name from the missingpersons file that never happens not even if hes found the landlord opened the door and left us to it jojo sat in his missing friends chair the office wasnt crowded out with furniture there was a desk another chair and a filing cabinet there were four files in the filing cabinet and three empty drawers the files were old all dating to work the previous year carlos began taking the desk to pieces jojo didnt move was he working when you last saw him i asked he always said he was working said jojo he just grumbled about not getting paid none of this work is current the desk is empty said carlos i moved the filing cabinet away from the wall there was nothing behind it i tipped it on its back carlos went to the door i fiddled with the surround of the cabinet something big on the other side of the door said carlos tapping it there was a large poster covering most of the door it was a movie poster of a massive kodiak bear in mortal combat with a man he was obsessed with that movie said jojo it gave him his catchphrase what was the line asked carlos im going to kill the bear we laughed he had a sense of humour lourenco said jojo tap that door again carlos i said it was hollowsounding at the edges and solid in the middle it was one of those cheap doors made by slapping two pieces of veneer on to a frame and those sort of doors normally sound hollow from top to bottom take the poster off behind the poster was a panel carlos unscrewed it with a penknife set into the door was a thick file bound up with rubber bands you know what that looks like said jojo insurance youd better leave now i said to him he didnt want to im telling you for your own safety if thats the bear youve found he said making for the door kill it on the front of the file goncalves had written oliveira rodrigues it was the only work in hand and we saw why when we opened up the files it appeared that dr aquilino oliveira was the client and miguel da costa rodrigues the job in the file there were three thick dossiers containing every movement miguel rodrigues had ever made between august th of last year and june th of this year nine months solid surveillance in the last five months hed only missed three friday lunchtimes in the pensao nuno what have you got there i asked photographs shots of girls in the street dates on the back presumably girls that rodrigues had bought look at them theyre all blondes an obsession and that last one catarina oliveira i shivered badly shuddered the length of my body as if id just had a trickle of liquid slime down my spine carlos raised his eyebrows at me i was just wondering i said what sort of a person dr oliveira is to use his own daughter as bait in a murder setup not his own daughter i planted the heels of my hands into my eye sockets and didnt move or speak for five long minutes when i took my hands away the room was strangely dimmed as if autumn had moved quickly into winter do i get to know asked carlos sitting across from me looking young and unconcerned i had been thinking that i could stop this now that i could shred the files and walk away we could accept the original and believed version of events and move on but i couldnt i had to satisfy myself i had to be sure that luisa madrugada had not been involved and if i didnt do that i could see myself lying in bed watching her sleep one of those guys like a million others wondering why i couldnt make that ultimate commitment but knowing too what are we going to do asked carlos sensing the decision crisis did you keep all your handwritten notes on catarinas case theyre somewhere but its all in the reports you might think its all there but you and i know its not not absolutely everything and thats what i have to have now i want every single thing on catarinas case and im going to read it all from beginning to end ten times over and tomorrow were going to caxias prison to see miguel da costa rodrigues whats he going to tell us amongst other things why he would think that somebody would spend nine months on his tail i left the office early with the file and carlos notebooks and took them back home i read everything through several times until it was late and dark and i was hungry i had a quick steak in a bandeira vermelha and drank two coffees i went back home and moved pieces of paper around again olivia came in about pm and went straight to bed i opened another packet of cigarettes by midnight i had the beginnings of three ideas the first was to do with dates and times but i didnt have all the information the second was much more interesting but i needed a photograph that wasnt in catarinas case files the third needed the help of senhora lurdes rodrigues and another photograph i didnt have i went to bed and didnt sleep carlos was already in the office when i arrived id finished the night with an hour of deep sleep between six and seven and had woken up feeling as if id been broken on the wheel i sent him off to find the marriage date of dr and senhora oliveira while i went to the personnel department and asked for lourenco goncalves old pj file i hoped he hadnt grizzled up too much because the latest photograph of him was during his last weeks as an officer with the pj and was ten years out of date carlos came back with the date of th may for the oliveiras marriage i sent him down to the files to find a usable photograph of xeta the murdered male prostitute whod been found in alcantara and another of teresa oliveira looking as young as possible i arranged with the prison in caxias to see prisoner number at am i phoned inacio in narcotics and asked him whether he was still holding the fisherman faustinho trindade he wasnt we went first to the rodrigues house in lapa the maid answered the door and left us on the step lurdes rodrigues took her time coming to see us she didnt want us in the house her face was unambiguously hostile and now inspector she said a question senhora rodrigues did anybody you didnt know come into this house between saturday th june and friday th june what a question inspector do you really think id be able im talking about tradesmen delivery men repair men electricity meter readers youll have to ask the maid she said backing into the house she wouldnt even bother to tell me that sort of thing the maid came back on her own i asked the question again she thought about it for some time until her eyes widened with memory the only one i didnt know was the telephone man but theyre always different how come you remember him after all this time he wore a hat and wouldnt take it off even when he came into the house even when i glared at him what did he say the problem was with the phone people in the area had been complaining about static he wanted to check all our lines was he carrying anything a suitcase of tools and one of those phones they use for testing did you see inside the case he opened it but i wasnt much interested where were you there are three lines she said one in the living room and two in senhor rodrigues study one is a fax line did you leave him alone of course i did im not going to watch a repair man for half an hour half an hour maybe less did you see his van no he didnt have a van you left him in the study for half an hour no fifteen minutes in the study i took out the photograph of lourenco goncalves is that the man you saw she glanced over the photograph with no hint of surprise in her face he was greyer she said but that was him we continued down the marginal to caxias the prison high up on the hill must have given some of the prisoners one of the most expensive sea views in the area we parked up outside watched with casual interest by some tshirted inmates behind the chainlink we sat in an empty interview room while the staff brought the prisoner up from the cells miguel rodrigues body wasnt looking too bad on the prison regime hed lost maybe fifteen kilos his face however was grey with depression his eyes dull hed lost his manicured sleekness his billionescudo glow if this is about that general machedo business he said without sitting down im not talking without my lawyer present thats spanish business i said i just need some help on some dates i dont have much use for dates any more he replied this might help you or not he said did you know you were being followed for nine months before your arrest by the police privately by whom well come back to that to answer your question he said deliberately no inspector i did not know that i was being followed you had two offices one on the top floor of the banco de oceano e rocha building on the largo dona estefania and the other in the rua do ouro thats right until five months ago you used to spend friday lunchtimes and afternoons in the baixa office was there any reason for that i liked my privacy at the end of the week does that mean you used to entertain women down there i thought you were going to ask me about dates were getting there jorge raposo used to send girls down to those offices and what happened to make you start going to the pensao nuno boredom he said jorge revealed another service you only ever entertained women in the rua do ouro offices it was private there were no secretaries if papers needed to be signed my secretary would have them brought down to me it was my friday office was it always that way silence for some long moments since my brother died he said that was his office i didnt want to get rid of it i made it my own and when was this he died new years day he said desperation and sadness leaking into his already grey face as if this had been a watershed moment then soon after that it started what seeing girls that didnt happen when pedro was alive who was the company lawyer at the time the lawyer he said sounding surprised the lawyer was dr aquilino oliveira he was my fathers lawyer too before the revolution and what happened to him miguel rodrigues blinked his brain trying to make a connection that would help him see why hed ended up in prison for killing his exlawyers daughter i dont know im not sure what you mean hes not the lawyer any more is he no no he retired years ago retired i mean he stopped working for us it was a very confused period in file company i remember i wanted him to stay i wanted the continuity but he was adamant he said he had a new wife and he didnt want to spend too much of his later years working at high pressure that was it i had to accept that did you meet his wife no never you didnt go to the wedding it wasnt that sort of relationship did you ever see the wife if i did i dont remember so from early you started seeing girls in your office in the rua do ouro in those first few months did any of those girls stand out particularly i was a jaded man inspector its probably some kind of disease i couldnt help myself i used to feel very excited at the prospect but afterwards it was nothing my mind blanked the experience out if a girl came back three or four times maybe id remember her were all these girls blonde he sat with his wrists crossed between his legs and frowned but not as if he was having to think about it more as if he was examining new information at that time yes they were pretty well all blondes he said finally ive never thought of it like that i never asked for blondes but that seems to have been the case in those first few months of when you started seeing girls do you remember a time when you had to get rough with a particular girl some time in april perhaps rough i took out the photograph of teresa oliveira she was lying down her dyed blonde hair all around her she looked relaxed asleep not that young certainly not as fresh as she would have been at twentyone i pushed the photograph across to miguel rodrigues he looked down at it without picking it up theres no trick to this i said you wont be charged with anything this woman has since died quite recently can you remember whether this woman ever came to your offices in the baixa and whether you had to get rough with her in order to have sex i dont remember he said i really dont it was a very difficult time for me id lost my brother his whole family it was an awful time your secretary at the bank is she still there he shrugged a little aggressively was she the same one as in yes but look inspector who is this woman he asked tapping the photograph you tell me i said we left miguel rodrigues in a state of anguish still shouting questions to us as he was taken back down to his cell he had less idea than we did why hed been followed for nine months we went back into lisbon and straight to the banco de oceano e rocha tower we took one of the glass bubble lifts up the full height of the atrium and on to the top floor the top floor of the bank felt empty most of the staff had already been laid off the people who remained were the key workers being interviewed daily by the government investigators we had to wait half an hour to talk to miguel rodrigues secretary she was in her late forties wore spectacles and looked efficient and slightly fierce from some recent stress lines that had appeared around her mouth she was the kind of woman whod know everything there was to know about the company she worked for she recognized me from the newspapers it tightened up her mouth after a look through the diaries she recalled that period in the banks history early had been hell theyd been in temporary offices in avenida da liberdade which were bigger than the baixa ones but not much do you remember a friday in late april or may i asked a young woman from the lawyers office coming in to get some papers signed probably urgent papers and probably a lunchtime i normally sent one of our own girls down she was a blonde girl no more than twentyone years old yes i do remember her she said she got married to our lawyer dr oliveira she was his secretary i thought about her just the other day i used to see her in vip she died you know did she ever go down to senhor rodrigues office around april may on her own the secretary blinked behind her goldframed glasses yes she did it was the week before she got married and she didnt come up here any more after that yes there was nobody available to take the papers down to senhor rodrigues and she said shed do it herself i showed her the photograph of teresa oliveira and she nodded slowly she doesnt look so well in this photograph she said chapter xliii tuesday th november banco de oceano e rocha estefania lisbon we went for a late lunch in a small seafood restaurant on avenida almirante reis i had grilled squid carlos went for the cuttlefish in its own ink which my wife had always referred to as the tarry gym shoe we drank a halfbottle of white and finished with coffee maybe you should have told miguel rodrigues who the woman in the photograph was said carlos meaning teresa oliveira id have had to spell it out for him i said and prison is a lonely place full of nothing but the smell of men cooped up together and empty time miguel rodrigues is serving a minimum of twenty years for a crime he did not commit i dont like him i dont think hes a good man hes possibly a sick man but i am not going to be the one to inflict on his mind the fact that he sodomized his own daughter there was a prolonged silence while carlos stirred his coffee up to the required syrup if he raped her why didnt she report it he asked she was a young woman on the brink of a brandnew life a week away from getting married and thats quite apart from it being the feminist movement hadnt exactly built up a head of steam in portugal by then youd have had a job to find women anywhere even in england prepared to report rape in those days think about it it would have had an impact on her marriage it would have destroyed a large chunk of her husbands business there would have been a long intrusive investigation perhaps with a trial at the end of it no she just hoped it would go away and maybe it would have done if she hadnt got pregnant when that baby was born with those blue eyes that must have been a hard day we paid the bill and walked back up over dry dead leaves to where wed left the car the kids had come out in the arroios park to run screaming through the pigeons which swooped over the old boys playing cards in their woollen hats so we have a motive now said carlos i dont think weve got all of it yet this was just the obsession of the manhe was going to bring miguel rodrigues down but i think theres something else in this and the killer well find the killer you dont think dr oliveira paid someone to kill her like lourenco goncalves possibly i dont think so i think his obsession was a little more refined we stopped under a shops awning while a blast of freezedried air shot through the largo dona estefania and what now asked carlos we go to paco de arcos and find faustinho trindade you dont sound happy about this im not if you think some justice has been done why dont you leave it dont you want to nail dr oliveira i asked hating myself for asking it well be interfering wont we we will theyve achieved some kind of result are you including the minister of internal administration in they i think i might be and all those big men who came to watch my first interview with miguel rodrigues those spectators at the coliseum who enjoy the smell of blood as long as its not their own he swallowed hard disgusted by it i put my arm around his shoulder lets go to paco de arcos i said and take it from there the traffic was terrible in lisbon and out on the marginal thered been a fourcar smash the blood fresh and bright on the tarmac under the setting sun it was early evening by the time we arrived in paco de arcos the sea already dark but choppy in the wind with white caps still visible in the failing light the horizon was just a crack of light with two long grey melancholic streaks of cloud i did a small circuit through the town and came back on to the marginal heading for lisbon we pulled into the car park by the boatyard of the clube nautico there were a couple of anglers out on the stone quay i didnt know what they were expecting to catch in this weather but then fishing doesnt always seem to be about catching fish the lighthouse on bugio was already flashing three ships sat off the costa do estoril their cabin areas lit faustinho was in his work shed wearing a pair of blue overalls and a heavy jacket working with very little light on a strippeddown outboard motor his hands were dry and scaly with the cold his dog got up and sniffed us over when did you get out faustinho i asked just under a week ago and im not talking about it ze im sorry if i caused trouble for you but im not going to say anything its finished you should find a workshop to do this i said its too expensive you remember that kid look ze i told you he stopped the kid what kid you remember that kid you told me about who saw something that night before the girls body was found on the beach i never saw him again he said he used to spend quite a lot of the summer out here but this year is this the one carlos handed him the photograph of xeta thats him he said taking it down to the light looking at it more closely hes dead isnt he this is a photograph of a dead person i nodded carlos took the photograph back what does that mean he asked i looked across the marginal the town dark behind the trees in the park it means that maybe were going to have to look closer to home i said we went through the underpass and up into the public gardens they were empty the wind buffeted the trees the paths were covered in their dry scratching detritus i wiped a bench off and we sat down antonios bar was shut no lights on and we could have used a drink remember what i said to you that first morning said carlos about the significance of the body being here and you living nearby weve come full circle i said we lost sight of that i lost sight of it a white car pulled up outside a bandeira vermelha antonio borrego got out and opened the boot he lifted out a box of fruit vegetables and a separate one of meat he put them back in opened the door to the bar and turned the light on he went back to the boot its nice to see one of those still running said carlos and now finally you start talking about cars i said that said carlos is a renault car of the year back in the s some time my father had one but his was a pile of shit i spent a lot of my youth working on one of those the two ventricles of my heart iced up suddenly the blood was only going through in thin spurts and the oxygen in my breathing hard to find come with me i said we walked out of the gardens towards where the old faded pink cinema had been which was now the beginnings of an office block we turned left and left again and came up behind antonios car you remember your handwritten notes what did the guy say the one who saw senhor rodrigues mercedes what else did he see i dont remember what he saw in front of the mercedes was a brandnew metallic grey fiat punto and behind was a white renault with a rusted wheelarch rear wheelarch in the poor street lighting and with the light coming from the open bar the corroded edges of the rear wheelarch were visible antonio came out to pick up whatever else he had in his boot he saw us i waved how is it he asked its fine i said you want something to eat ive got some beautiful spare ribs already marinated sounds good antonio picked up another box and went into the bar when faustinho took me to meet xeta and he wasnt there i said almost talking to myself now we went back to a bandeira vermelha and faustinho described the kid in detail in front of me and antonio carlos head didnt move his eyes stayed fixed on the light coming from the bar i told him to go in there and talk to antonio about anything except the obvious while i phoned the local psp if hed already killed catarina and xeta there was no reason why he shouldnt go down fighting i went round the corner to make the call it took me a couple of minutes to explain the situation to them how i didnt want them sprinting in there and provoking him into an attack by the time i walked back to the bar i was feeling sick cold and tired not ready for this not wanting this i walked into the wedge of light coming from the door lying facedown on the bar floor in a pool of blood that i couldnt imagine having got to that size in the short few moments id been away was carlos the collar of his shirt showed red above his jacket and coat the back of his head looked all wrong his hand twitched the thumb splashing in his own blood antonio was standing between carlos feet with the hammer raised above his head it was the hammer he kept behind the bar next to the sickle his relics his workers tools his weapons i stepped into the doorway he turned to me what have you done antonio what the hell have you done his eyes had gone there was still the tiniest light in them but it was a pinprick at the end of a fourmile tunnel as if i was seeing straight through to some nicks of bone on the inside of his cranium let me call an ambulance i said he turned to me with his hammer raised and took one step forwards what did he say to you antonio what did he say to make you hit him maria antonia medinas he said each name separate is that what this is all about is that why you killed the girl he murdered her that pide bastard he murdered her and what was maria antonia medinas to you she was my wife he said viciously and he killed her and he killed our child inside her let me call the ambulance antonio it can still be all right if you let me call the ambulance i moved he tensed the hammer in his hand are you a girlkiller antonio is that what you do how did they get you to kill the girl she was his did she kill maria antonia medinas she was his she was an innocent she was his just let me call the ambulance he ran at me the hammer raised his teeth bared the eyes now dead black lightless i shut the door on him his hammer smashed through the glass blood ran down his wrist he wrenched the door open i fell back into the street half at a run half staggering he swerved away from me and ran to his car he pulled away in the rusting renault the boot still open he crashed across the public gardens through the flower beds over the grass and directly on to the marginal the oncoming traffic screeched and squirmed the renault slashed straight across two lines of cars into the lisbon lane the psp came running i told them to call for an ambulance and to get a hospital prepared to receive a policeman with a serious head injury i ran across the gardens through the underpass and got into my car i ran every red light on the way into the city i saw the renaults boot flapping up and down as it went over humps in the tarmac around caxias i pulled in tight behind him and flashed my lights he put his foot down our two ancient cars roared through belem and thundered under the whining th april bridge he swung to the left up towards the largo de alcantara where there was a sliproad to the bridge but not accessible from our direction antonio crashed through the lights which had just changed to red and swerved across the two cars and a truck which had just taken off the two cars missed him and slewed to a halt but the truck clipped him on his rear wing and the car was jolted sideways a full metre i stormed over the crossroads after him with my forearm on the horn and one hand raised out of the window people were already out of their cars we hit the ramp up to the bridge antonio crunched through the gears and found one low enough to get him up the steep turn i stuck on his tail we were going slower and slower the renault hit the main road to cross the bridge we couldnt have been going more than fifty kilometres per hour and i saw the problem his back tyre was flat and the stovedin rear wing was derinding the rubber until the tyre was entirely stripped off and he was running on his wheel rim sparks showering off it into the night he stopped and got out the hammer still in his fist he started running the cars howled over the expandable metal lanes in the centre of the bridge and horns blared behind us the ice wind even stronger up here blustered from the west and whistled at a highpitched scream through the support cables i ran after him he turned occasionally his face lit upwhite with two black eye socketsby the lights of the oncoming traffic suddenly he got up on to the bridges rail and jumped over the edge as if it was nothing as if he had no statement to make i bellowed after him but my voice went nowhere over the hellish noise i got to the point where hed jumped and saw him pacing about on a small platform a few metres below what did i want from him did i want to catch him bring him in was that what i wanted and i realized that it hadnt been police work making me run i had to talk to him i had to tell him i had to make him believe he was part of the cycle we were all part of the damaging cycle i swung my leg over the rail my foot searched for the first rung the platform was all that remained of the bridge works it was for the men painting the new rail link there was a lift that ran on a box rail down one of the concrete support columns to the docks below the lift wasnt operating antonio was contemplating climbing down the box rail i shuddered as trucks crashed past their weight undulating the road like a sea swell the wind booming against their sheer sides it was high enough up there that i could feel myself flying and with that strong knifing wind i felt i could be at any moment i screamed his name at him he responded by climbing over the rail of the platform and fitting his foot into the box rail he dropped down a few rungs i jumped down on to the platform the wooden sheets bounced me and i fell to my knees i crawled towards the lift and pushed my face over the edge antonio was three metres down the rail to the west the lights along the marginal stretched out into the blackness we were as good as night gliding antonio i yelled at him to come back up but the wind whipped my voice away and shutded it through the girders of the new rail link antonio looked up at me with the terrible religious eyes of a suffering saint or a tortured sinner on his way down to the next circle of hell his face seemed to be broken up into pieces now just shards of pottery miraculously floating together in a deep purple light he looked over his shoulder and saw what id seen the lights curving away over the black planet the sea and the sky dense and empty and only the dark cold wind calling the hammer went first a silver speck into the night his other hand disengaged from the rail and he fell backwards the wind caught him to begin with and shored him back up but then quickly let him have his weight he stretched his arms out and shouted something that the wind tore off him his foot caught in the rung of the rail the ankle snapped and then he was on his way dropping through the howling dark gravity making an ant of him in seconds and then nothing of him in a few more the sirens came steel light revolved in the night i rolled away from the edge and felt like a man whod momentarily had everythingfriends family love and then just as quickly lost them all chapter xliv wednesday th november hospital egas moniz santo amaro lisbon carlos was in intensive care his head and neck supported by some strange contraption that would keep it totally rigid and the back of his head free from any contact everything was functioning normally all his organs even his brain showed normal activity but he hadnt regained consciousness and there wasnt a neurosurgeon in lisbon who would tell us when he would come out of his coma we watched him his mother joined on to his father who was set in stone staring his will into his son olivia in shock over carlos state but also in tears because shed known antonio borrego all her life and me tarred and feathered with guilt if carlos didnt make it if he didnt make a full recovery it would be the end of all possibilities i would be as klaus felsen had said a man with no prospects theyd taken him off the ventilator after a few hours once they were sure he was breathing properly now he was wired and tubed up and with the blood transfusion over he had only a saline drip in his arm he was silent and still the monitoring machines made noises for him his muscles didnt twitch his closed eyes didnt flicker his face was relaxed his body at peace while his consciousness repaired itself where did they go these coma people over what dark landscapes did they travel was there any light there at all or was it a pothole with no light not even an inkling of ambient light only what your brain imagines as light at seven oclock i left olivia with carlos parents i went to my office and sat at my desk my colleagues came in to see me to ask after carlos even though none of them had liked him and i answered all of them at i went to see narciso who made the expert correct nearly human sounds i told him i was opening up an investigation into the disappearance of an expohaa judiciaria detective called lourenco goncalves he didnt respond i took a pool car and drove out to odivelas and sat outside valentims apartment block he surprised me by not keeping me waiting longanother man perhaps who wasnt sleeping so well at nights he banded up his swag of ringlets and i rolled down the window and told him to get in the car i cruised into the heavy traffic heading south into town did you ever meet a guy called lourenco goncalves i asked he repeated the name to himself and frowned preparing to lie i stopped the car in the traffic space built up in front of us and noise behind i gave him the photograph of goncalves he was a security consultant i said which is a perfumed word for private investigator he followed people around that kind of thing why should i know him wasnt he the one who told you to put on an interesting little sex show in the pensao nuno you know something unusual like you bruno and an underage blonde i said do you remember what happened to her after that after you made sure she was in the pensao nuno having sex with two guys at the same time she she he faltered as a guy from the car behind came and hammered on my window she went back to school i slammed my foot on the accelarator floored it and kept looking at valentim i threw his seat belt off he put his hands out i slammed on the brakes his forearms buckled against the dashboard his head smacked into the windscreen blood appeared in a line on his brow he slumped back into the seat his fingers feeling along the split skin i picked up the photograph pulled his hands away from his face tell me valentim and youre out of here he offered me money how much are we talking about initially it was a million escudos your new computer edit suite he nearly looked ashamed but that would have drawn on reserves he didnt have then he told me that id probably have to take some heat from your people and and i doubled it nice job valentim i said tell me your conscience is clear i thought you thought it was an interestfree gift i said you should take a look at the cost of money these days i pulled up and kicked his bony arse out of the car he cringed over the pavement like a village cur i turned round and went back up to the circular and took the motorway out to cascais i drove to cabo da roca to the last house on mainland europe the wind was stronger up there and the house looked sharpened honed clean in the freezing air felsen was in his enclosed terrace his head folded down on to his chest like a dead bird he came to as i sat down ah he said but he couldnt quite place me inspector coelho i reminded him and gave him a few seconds to digest it whos your lawyer senhor felsen am i being charged with something he asked confused for a moment i dont know that i have one any more did you have a lawyer in prison i didnt need one the damage was done once youre in its the devil to get out and when you got out not for some years then one came to the house or did i go to him his name was a shaky finger came out to place the name but didnt find it dr aquilino oliveira yes that was him he was my lawyer for maybe ten years i dont know he may still be now did you tell him your stories he was a very good listener unusual for a lawyer they always like to tell you how it is dont they with the law and thathow damned complicated it all is and how much you need them you never mentioned that you knew a political called antonio borrego in caxias prison a political cleaned out my cell for several months he asked me about this woman i used to know her name too maria antonia medinas i said the last time we talked you couldnt get her name out of your head can you tell me what antonio borrego wanted to know about her he asked if id seen her or heard anything about her had you well i knew she was dead how shed been murdered if thats what they call it in prison and did you see who did it i saw him i called out to him manuel he was my son you know illegitimate son but he didnt hear me and the next morning they carried her out he said and he looked as if he might cry until i realized he was in fact disgusted there was so much blood in her skirt the weight of it it dragged along the ground it left a brown trail he drifted back into sleep i sat for a moment looking at the brilliant clarity the purity of cold winter sunshine the visibility was stunning but hardedged unforgiving i asked frau junge about the lawyer she said hed looked after a few things for senhor felsen back in the early eighties but it wasnt for very long he said it was for ten years hes an old man but he still draws on his vanity she said id made the connections now i was brisding for a fight the lawyers cascais house was empty closed up for the winter i called at his lisbon home but nobody was there either it was late afternoon when i dropped back in at the hospital olivia and carlos parents were still sitting almost where id left them there was no news except that two men had been looking for me they found me in the corridor outside the toilets two men in dark blue raincoats at a glance you might have thought they were clonessomething to do with the way theyd been trained can we talk said one of them outside would be better who are you were from the ministry which ones that lets go outside the three of us hands jammed into our coat pockets sat on an icecold bench in the dark courtyard of the hospital with lights all around only one of them spoke the other looked around with the wary eye of a hen that knows whats happened to other hens weve come to tell you to drop your investigation into the disappearance of lourenco goncalves he used to be a detective with the policia judiciaria i have a duty you have a duty inspector coelho he said quietly agreeing with me that far you have a patriotic duty which now is to keep quiet a result has been achieved and it is the correct one and you must leave it that way i missed that result i said i wasnt aware of anybody winning anything did i lose i feel as if i lost they leaned forward on their elbows and looked at each other across me the one who didnt speak closed his eyes momentarily we have a scapegoat said the talker the banco de oceano e rocha he nodded to see if that was going to be enough theres a police officer in there who might never wake up again i said i think his parents might want to know what patriotic duty their son has been involved in youre the inspector dourado he said sticking it in you should know what its about ill start then i said nazi gold now you finish he sighed and looked around the dark patch of lawn all the neutral countries during the second world war he said clasping his hands are being asked to give their pound of flesh you might have noticed that some swiss banks recently awarded billion to the victims of the holocaust the banco de oceano e rocha has an estimated worth of billion we think we now have the potential to be generous miguel rodrigues i said theres a guy who ran out of friends the man unclasped his hands and showed me they were empty those gold bars he said with their little swastika stamp on them next to your sweet face that wasnt just a publicity stunt for the policia judiciaria that has saved us a lot of grief that showed the world that wed found the pound of flesh and we were prepared to surrender it youve got to admit inspector coelho theres some justice in it in that its come full circle through the nazis who stole it in the first place through lehrer through felsen through abrantes and right the way round to if not the original owners of the gold then their families at least i said yes i can see the justice in that but im concerned about the method nothing in this world is what it seems said the man touching my shoulder and indicating with a look that as far as he was concerned the conversation was over and lourenco goncalves i asked to clear up that loose end for jojo silva hes a happy man inspector but he wont be coming back to portugal sold his soul to the devil or shall we call him dr aquilino dias oliveira you have to leave dr oliveira alone otherwise it could all go very badly wrong he said severely meaning it the sacred cow i said they looked at me with the dead eyes of men who have made things go very badly wrong before id like to speak to him i dont think so im not going to do anything to him i said id just like to speak to him clear a few points up have we reached an understanding we have as long as i can speak to him for ten minutes the silent one got up took a mobile out of his pocket and walked off he made two calls packed up his phone and we left they drove me to the lawyers office in the chiado in a black mercedes we parked and walked down some steps of calcada under dry rustling trees they buzzed on an unmarked door and we were let in we walked up to the first floor they searched me very intrusively and fed me through the door i went into a dimlylit anteroom and on to a corridor dr oliveira was standing at the end of it smiling immaculately suited he had his hand out showing me the door of his office as friendly as if he was my lawyer and i still owed him a big bill his office was woodpanelled with english hunting prints of redcoated men dashing about with great futility and bugling i sat in a black leather chair which put me at a marginal height disadvantage to him on the other side of his green leather inlaid desk he leaned back and waited where is lourenco goncalves by the way i asked just to get started california he said he wanted to be somewhere where the sun always shines i suppose he could have ended up in the foundations of an apartment building around the expo site there might have been some propriety in that dr oliveira breathed in and closed his eyes as if he was thinking beautiful thoughts to keep the nasty ones away you have some questions apparently he said i wrestled with the one question which would give me what i wanted to know but i couldnt get it out i was the rummy player who didnt know which cards my opponent was collecting i came in on a tangent you knew about senhor felsen from your first job working for joaquim abrantes writing him out of the banks statutes did you know why you were doing that he was a convicted criminal but did you know why abrantes had him put away not at the time that only came out when you went back to senhor felsen he came to me after he got out of prison pedro wouldnt talk to him he found out that i was the lawyer whod drawn up the new statutes he told me his story which i dismissed as fantastic at the time but you went back to him after yes he cut in hard when did you find out that manuel abrantes had raped your wife raped her he said digging deep into the question isnt that what happened senhor doutor if hed raped her inspector she would have told me wouldnt she she wouldnt have waited until i looked down on a child i knew instantly was not my own to surely she would have told her husband inspector i couldnt tell if there was some madness at play here did he actually believe that his wife had consented or was he using the skewed logic of the cuckold to justify his actions did your wife say shed been raped pah he said and threw his head round to one of the hunting prints refusing to look at menot accepting any more questions on that subject what did senhor felsen know about your scheme i asked he was the key he said eyes back on me riveting i knew a lot from having worked with joaquim abrantes but i never knew about the gold he never spoke about it and pedro like a good son didnt either so you didnt know about the two remaining bars luck he said he also told you about maria antonia medinas dr oliveira chewed on his thumbnail and nodded how did you approach antonio borrego like we did everybody through lourenco goncalves when did you decide to use your daughter as bait my daughter catarina oliveira i added goncalves reported that they were using the same pensao he investigated further and found that abrantes was always in the adjacent room when she was in the pensao later on he went into that room and found the mirror the plan evolved from that situation didnt goncalves find it difficult to persuade antonio to kill the girl i was surprised he killed her i can only think that something went wrong that she must have seen his face and he was forced to strangle her im not sure how goncalves put the plan to borrego in the first place but he told me that once borrego knew who she was once he knew the girls connection to miguel rodrigues then i think borrego became a difficult man to control i dont think he was quite balanced manuel abrantes had killed his wife and unborn child did anyone speak to borrego afterwards goncalves when he went to pick up the clothes didnt he ask borrego what had happened borregos version of events was that hed followed them into the monsanto park he saw the mercedes leave the road he parked up and walked through the trees he saw the car rocking heard he cleared his throat heard the girl shouting out then abrantes got out of the car opened the passenger door dragged her out and left her on the ground borrego waited for the car to leave and and what i asked determined to make him say it make him say everything and he hit her with what he hit her on the head with a hammer inspector you know this now lets in the fifteen years that you shared the same house as catarina you didnt once feel any paternal she was a constant reminder inspector he said slowly of what your disappointment your lets move along inspector i agreed to ten minutes if you didnt expect borrego to kill catarina what did you expect of him he played the edge of the table with his fingertips a sonata to clear his mind and the minister of internal administration i said what did what does he know hes a politician and a very successful one results like getting elected for instance are important how they are achieved not so interesting he was only concerned with the delivery of miguel rodrigues disgraced head yes i suppose that was an important factor that he was disgraced we didnt want him to have anywhere to hide we sat in silence while i tried to heave the question over my larynx dr oliveira doodled with his mind you asked about felsen before he said about his involvement he wasnt involved in any of this business he was important of course because you had to find him you had to extract his story but he hes a very old man now his minds only really up to telling and retelling the story of his life in its many versions he had the documents though they were important yes i knew that hed shown them to me so he was very important to this this intrigue of yours very important yes he said and looked at me is there a question here inspector how could you guarantee that id find felsen i asked my palms running with sweat my heart batting against my ribs a frown shot across his brow faster than a lizard across a hot road you tell me he said his brain rattling through the permutations i tried again a little more direct this time how did luisa madrugada make the felsen connection ah he said grasping the matter now now i see no inspector she was not involved dont worry yourself on that score ask her ask her about some interesting notes pointers she found in the books that she was reading at the biblioteca nacional but was that luck as well that the investigating officer should have an affair with you dont have to believe me its no concern of mine he said i would have made sure you found felsen whether it was in luisa madrugadas bed or not and inspector dont blame her for not telling you about those ah vital clues im sure she loves youand lovers especially in the beginning want to look at their best for each other something that you would know about senhor doutor i said i a woman always wants to look at her best on her wedding day teresa was no exception it shut something down in him lights went out in his face the source of his mild affability dried up and was replaced with that fierceness that intellectual fierceness id seen in his study in cascais its easily forgotten inspector that history is not what you read in books its a personal thing and people are vengeful creatures which is why history will never teach us anything you got your revenge i can see that and you facilitated the revenge of othersantonio borrego klaus felsen even jorge raposo had his halfhour and the jewish people he said dont forget them they will finally get their property back if you think that that is any justification for you senhor doutor oliveira to conduct your own personal balancing of the vagaries of history by punishing your late wife and murdering her illegitimate daughter then you must be one of two thingsevil or mad which are you he leaned forward across his desk neck dipped eyes as bright and allseeing as an eagles over its territory we are all mad he said i only feel it when im in your company i said walking to the door we are all mad inspector for the simple reason that we dont know why we exist and this he waved his hand at the tissue of existence before him this life is how we distract ourselves so that we dont have to think about things too difficult for us to comprehend there are other ways of distracting yourself dr oliveira some of us perhaps have more recherche tastes yes i suppose the frisson was quite substantial for youthe knowledge that miguel rodrigues had sodomized his own daughter before antonio borrego cracked her skull open and strangled her he swivelled his chair away from me and faced the window the leather scoop rocked him i closed the door went down the lighted corridor down the wooden stairs and out on to the bonedry calcada the night was piercingly clear with the freshest air lisbon would ever smell there was a thin paring of windshaved moon and chestnuts were roasting in the square agente carlos pinto came out of his coma on friday th november two weeks later they inserted a steel plate in the back of his cranium on a clear day hes sure that he can hear the bee gees coming over the atlantic ive assured him its tinnitus he was lucky to have a thick skull and i like to think that his short dense unmanageable hair cushioned the blow the only thing carlos couldnt remember was why antonio borrego had hit him i told him that after felsen had given me his story id gone to a bandeira vermelha and asked antonio about maria antonia medinas hed stalled me so when five and a half months later and after our brittle exchange in the street by the rusted wheelarch of the white renault carlos appeared in the bar on his own to ask about the same womanthe one person who could motivate antonio to murder catarina oliveiraborregos paranoia did the rest he wouldnt have known that carlos and i had never discussed maria antonia medinas he wouldnt have known that to us it was just a name that needed some light shed on it he thought he was finished it still hasnt rained its still dry and cold the leaves are still scratching across the calcada a bandeira vermelha is closed ive had to find somewhere else to drink my bicas someone else to make my toast olivia still hasnt taught carlos anything about clothes he shambles about in that oversized thing but hes reciprocated in his own way by telling her nothing of murder he makes her happy in a way that she hasnt been for over a year luisa madrugada spares me the odd quarter of an hour from her publishing company and i occasionally look up from the book that shes been forcing me to write nothing about murder of course a childrens story ive seen the untouchable lawyer too dr oliveira in his morgan spanking down the marginal with a blonde in the passenger seat he didnt look bothered im getting out of this house the landlord offered to sell me an apartment at a good price if i moved out and let him convert this old mansion i thought it would be a difficult decision to make but i agreed as soon as he proposed it we looked at each other astonished and i bought a new car the old one never forgave me for leaving her on the bridge that night the new cars nothing special but the salesman highlighting all the extras included made it sound as if it could go into orbit and dock with discovery he knew everything and i questioned him endlessly because its in my nature finally i asked him how do they tint the windows so that theyre clear in the shade and dark in the sunshine you know he said without even a pause holding up a finger thats interesting its the only portuguese element of this car is that a selling point on the glass he said ignoring me they lay a very very thin layer less than a micron a fraction of a micron of the finest portuguese wolfram i thought about that the obscure talent of wolfram
