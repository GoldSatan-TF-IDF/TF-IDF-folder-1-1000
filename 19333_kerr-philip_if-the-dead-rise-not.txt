philip kerr if the dead rise not the sixth book in the bernard gunther series that i have fought with beasts at ephesus after the manner of men what advantageth it me if the dead rise not again let us eat and drink for tomorrow we shall die from the book of common prayer for caradoc king part one berlin it was the sort of sound you hear in the distance and mistake for something else a dirty steam barge puffing along the river spree the shunting of a slow locomotive underneath the great glass roof of the anhalter station the hot impatient breath of some enormous dragon as if one of the stone dinosaurs in berlins zoo had come to life and was now lumbering up wilhelmstrasse it hardly seemed like something musical until you guessed it was a military brass band but even then it was too mechanical to resemble manmade music suddenly the air was filled with the clash of cymbals and the tinkling of frame glockenspiels and at last i saw ita detachment of soldiers marching as if intent on making work for the road menders just looking at these men made my feet hurt they came clockstepping along the street their mauser carbines shouldered on the left their muscular right arms swinging with a pendulumlike exactitude between elbow and eagleembossed belt buckle their gray steelhelmeted heads held high and their thoughts assuming they had any occupied with nonsense about one folk one leader one empirewith germany people stopped to stare and to salute the traffic jam of nazi flags and banners the soldiers were carryingan entire haberdashers store of red and black and white curtain material others came running full of patriotic enthusiasm to do the same children were hoisted onto broad shoulders or slipped through a policemans legs so as not to miss anything only the man standing next to me seemed less than enthusiastic you mark my words he said that crazy idiot hitler means to have another war with england and france as if we didnt lose enough men the last time all this marching up and down makes me sick it might have been god who invented the devil but it was austria that gave us the leader the man uttering these words had a face like the golem of prague and a barrelshaped body that belonged on a beer cart he wore a short leather coat and a cap with a peak that grew straight out of his forehead he had ears like an indian elephant a mustache like a toilet brush and more chins than the shanghai telephone directory even before he flicked the end of his cigarette at the brass band and hit the bass drum a gap had opened around this illadvised commentator as if he were carrying a deadly disease and no one wanted to be around when the gestapo showed up with its own idea of a cure i turned away and walked quickly down hedemann strasse it was a warm day almost the end of september when a word like summer made me think of something precious that was soon to be forgotten like freedom and justice germany awake was the slogan on everyones lips only it appeared to me that we were clockstepping in our sleep toward some terrible but as yet unknown disaster this didnt mean i was ever going to be foolish enough to say so in public and certainly not when strangers were listening i had principles sure but i also had all my own teeth hey you said a voice behind me stop a minute i want to talk to you i kept on walking and it was not until saarland strasseformerly königgrätzer strasse until the nazis decided we all needed to be reminded about the treaty of versailles and the injustice of the league of nations that the owner of the voice caught up with me didnt you hear me he said taking hold of my shoulder he pushed me up against an advertising column and showed me a bronze warrant disc on the palm of his hand from this it was hard to tell if he was local or state criminal police but from what i knew about hermann goerings new prussian police only the lower ranks carried bronze beer tokens no one else was on the pavement and the advertising column shielded us from the view of anyone on the road not that there was much real advertising pasted on it these days advertising was just a sign telling a jew to keep off the grass no i didnt i said the man who spoke treasonably about the leader you must have heard what he said you were standing right next to him i dont remember hearing anything treasonable about the leader i said i was listening to the band so why did you suddenly walk away i remembered that i had an appointment the cops cheeks flushed a little it wasnt a pleasant face he had dark shadowy eyes a rigid sneering mouth and a rather salient jaw it was a face that had nothing to fear from death since it already looked like a skull if goebbels had a taller more rabidly nazi brother then this man might have been him i dont believe you the cop said and snapping his fingers impatiently added identification card please the please was nice but i still hardly wanted to let him see my identification section eight of page two detailed my profession by training and in fact and since i was no longer a policeman but a hotel employee it was as good as telling him i wasnt a nazi worse than that a man who had been obliged to leave the berlin detective force because of his allegiance to the old weimar republic might be just the type to ignore someone speaking treason about the leader if treason was what that was but i knew the cop would probably arrest me just to spoil my day and arrest would very likely mean two weeks in a concentration camp he snapped his fingers again and glanced away almost bored come on come on i havent got all day for a moment i just bit my lip irritated at being pushed around yet again not just by this cadaverfaced cop but by the whole nazi state id been forced out of my job as a senior detective with kripoa job i had lovedand been made to feel like a pariah because of my adherence to the old weimar republic the republics faults had been many it was true but at least it had been democratic and since its collapse berlin the city of my birth was hardly recognizable previously it had been the most liberal place in the world now it felt like a military parade ground dictatorships always look good until someone starts giving you dictation are you deaf lets see that damned card the cop snapped his fingers again my irritation turned to anger i reached inside my jacket for the card with my left hand turning my body just far enough around to disguise my right hand becoming a fist and when i buried it in his gut my whole body was behind it i hit him too hard much too hard the blow took all the air out of him and then some you hit a man in the gut like that he stays hit for a good long while i held the cops unconscious body against me for a moment and then waltzed him through the revolving door of the kaiser hotel my anger was already turning to something resembling panic i think this man has suffered some kind of a seizure i told the frowning doorman and dumped the cops body into a leather armchair where are the house phones ill call an ambulance the doorman pointed around the corner of the front desk i loosened the cops tie for effect and behaved as if i were headed for the telephones but as soon as i was around the corner i walked through a service door and down some stairs before exiting the hotel through the kitchens emerging into an alley that gave onto saarland strasse i walked quickly into anhalter station for a moment i considered boarding a train then i saw the subway tunnel connecting the station with the excelsior which was berlin s secondbest hotel no one would ever think to look for me in there not so close to an obvious means of escape besides there was an excellent bar in the excelsior theres nothing like knocking out a policeman to give you a thirst i went straight into the bar ordered a large schnapps and hurried it down like it was the middle of january the excelsior was full of cops but the only one i recognized was the house detective rolf kuhnast before the purge of kuhnast had been with the potsdam political police and might reasonably have expected to join the gestapo except for two things one was that it had been kuhnast who had led the team detailed to arrest sa leader count helldorf in april following hindenburgs orders to forestall a possible nazi coup the other was that helldorf was now the police president of potsdam hey i said bernie gunther what brings the adlon hotels house detective into the excelsior he asked i always forget that this is a hotel i came in to buy a train ticket youre a funny guy bernie always were id be laughing myself but for all these cops whats going on here i know the excelsiors the gestapos favorite watering hole but usually they dont make it quite so obvious there are guys with foreheads in here who look like they just walked out of the neander valley on their knuckles we got ourselves a vip explained kuhnast someone from the american olympic committee is staying here i thought the kaiserhof was the official olympic hotel it is but this was a lastminute thing and the kaiserhof couldnt put him up then i guess the adlon must have been full as well take a flick at me said kuhnast be my guest those oxtails from the gestapo have been flicking my ears all day so some shitsmart fellow from the great adlon hotel coming around to straighten my tie for me is all i need im not taking a flick at you rolf honest here why dont you let me buy you a drink im surprised that you can afford it bernie i dont mind getting it free a house bulls not doing his job unless hes got something on the barman drop by the adlon sometime and ill show you how philanthropic our hotel barman can be when hes been caught with his hand in the till otto i dont believe it you dont have to rolf but frau adlon will and shes not as understanding as me i ordered another come on have a drink after what just happened to me i need something to tighten my bowels what happened never you mind lets just say that beer wont fix it i tossed the schnapps after the other one kuhnast shook his head id like to bernie but herr elschner wont like it if im not around to stop these nazi bastards from stealing the ashtrays these apparently indiscreet words were guided by an awareness of my own republicanminded past but he still felt the need for caution so he walked me out of the bar through the entrance hall and into the palm court it was easier to speak freely when no one could hear what we were saying above the excelsiors orchestra these days the weathers the only really safe thing to talk about in germany so the gestapo are here to protect some ami i shook my head i thought hitler didnt like amis this particular ami is taking a tour of berlin to decide if were fit to host the olympic games in two years time there are two thousand workers to the west of charlottenburg who are under the strong impression were already hosting them it seems theres a lot of amis that want to boycott the olympiad on the grounds of our governments antisemitism the ami is here on a f actfinding mission to see for himself if germany discriminates against jews for a blindingly obvious factfinding mission like that im surprised he bothered checking into a hotel rolf kuhnast grinned back from what ive heard its a mere formality right now hes up in one of our function rooms getting a list of facts put together for him by the ministry of propaganda oh those kinds of facts well sure we wouldnt want anyone getting the wrong idea about hitlers germany now would we i mean its not that we have anything against the jews but hey theres a new chosen people in town it was hard to see why an american might be prepared to ignore the new regimes antijewish measures especially when there were so many egregious examples of it all over the city only a blind man could have failed to notice the grossly offensive cartoons on the front pages of the more rabidly nazi newspapers the david stars painted on the windows of jewishowned stores and the german only signs in the public parksto say nothing of the real fear that was in the eyes of every jew in the fatherland brundagethats the amis name he sounds german he doesnt even speak german said kuhnast so as long as he doesnt actually meet any englishspeaking jews things should work out just fine i glanced around the palm court is there any danger that he could do that id be surprised if theres a jew within a hundred meters of this place given whos coming here to meet him not the leader no his dark shadow the deputy leaders coming to the excelsior i hope you cleaned the toilets suddenly the orchestra stopped what it was playing and struck up with the german national anthem and hotel guests jumped to their feet to point their right arm toward the entrance hall and i had no choice but to join in surrounded by storm troopers and gestapo rudolf hess marched into the hotel wearing the uniform of an sa man his face was as square as a doormat but somehow less welcoming he was medium in height slim with dark wavy hair a transylvanian brow werewolf eyes and a razorthin mouth returning our patriotic salutes perfunctorily he then bounded up the stairs of the hotel two at a time with his eager air he reminded me of an alsatian dog let off the leash by his austrian master to lick the hand of the man from the american olympic committee as it happened there was a hand i had to go and lick myself a hand that belonged to a man in the gestapo as one of the house detectives at the adlon i was expected to keep thugs and murderers out of the hotel but that could be difficult when the thugs and murderers were nazi party officials some of them such as wilhelm frick the minister of the interior had even served a prison sentence the ministry was on unter den linden right around the corner from the adlon and frick a real bavarian square head with a wart on his face and a girlfriend who happened to be the wife of some prominent nazi architect was in and out of the hotel a lot probably the girl too equally difficult for a hotel detective was the high turnover of staff with honest hardworking personnel who happened to be jewish making way for people who turned out to be much less honest and hardworking but who were at least apparently more german mostly i kept my nose out of these matters but when the adlons female house detective decided to leave berlin for good i felt obliged to try and help her frieda bamberger was more than an old friend from time to time we were lovers of convenience which is a nice way of saying that we liked going to bed with each other but that this was as far as it went since she had a semidetached husband who lived in hamburg frieda was a former olympic fencer but she was also a jew and for this reason she had been expelled from the berlin fencing club in november a similar fate had befallen nearly every jew in germany who was a member of a gymnasium or sporting association to be a jew in the summer of was like some cautionary tale by the brothers grimm in which two abandoned children find themselves lost in a forest full of hungry wolves it wasnt that frieda believed the situation in hamburg would be any better than in berlin but she hoped the discrimination she now suffered might be easier to bear with the help of her gentile husband look here i told her i know someone in the jewish department of the gestapo a cop i used to know at the alex i recommended him for a promotion once so he owes me a favor ill go and speak to him and see whats to be done you cant change what i am bernie she said maybe not but i might be able to change what someone else says you are at that time i was living on schlesische strasse in the east of the city and on the day of my appointment with the gestapo id caught the ubahn west to hallesches tor and walked north up wilhelmstrasse which was how id run into that spot of trouble with the policeman in front of the kaiser hotel from the temporary sanctuary of the excelsior it was only a few steps to gestapo house at prinzalbrechtstrasse a building that looked less like the headquarters of the new germanys secret state police and more like an elegant wilhelmine hotel an effect enhanced by the proximity of the old hotel prinz albrecht which now accommodated the administrative leadership of the ss there were few people who walked up prinzalbrechtstrasse unless they really had to especially when they had just assaulted a policeman perhaps for that reason i figured it was the last place anyone would think of looking for me with its marble balustrades high vaulted ceilings and a stair as wide as a railway track gestapo house was more like a museum than a building owned by the secret police or perhaps like a monasteryjust as long as the order of monks was one that wore black and enjoyed hurting people in order to make them confess their sins i entered the building and approached a uniformed and not unattractive girl on the front desk who walked me up a stair and around a corner to department ii catching sight of my old acquaintance i smiled and waved simultaneously and a couple of women from the nearby typing pool fixed me with a look of amused surprise as if my smile and my wave were ridiculously out of place and of course they were the gestapo hadnt existed for more than eighteen months but it already enjoyed a fearsome reputation and this was why i was nervous and why i was smiling and waving at otto schuchardt in the first place he didnt wave back he didnt smile either schuchardt had never been the life and soul of the party exactly but i was pretty sure id heard him laugh when we were both cops at the alex then again maybe hed only been laughing because i was his superior and as we now shook hands i was already telling myself id made a mistake and that the tough young cop i remembered was now made of the same stuff as the balustrades and the staircase outside the department door it was like shaking hands with a deepfrozen undertaker schuchardt was handsome if you consider men with whiteblond hair and pale blue eyes handsome as a blondhaired blueeyed man myself i thought he looked like a muchimproved more efficient nazi version of me a mangod instead of a poor fritz with a jewish girlfriend then again i never much wanted to be a god or even to enter heaven not when all the bad girls like frieda were back in weimar berlin he ushered me into his little office and closed a frostedglass door which left the two of us alone with a little wooden desk a whole tank corps of gray metal filing cabinets and a nice view of the gestapos back garden where a man was carefully tending the flower beds coffee sure schuchardt dropped a heating element into a jug of tap water he seemed amused to see me which is to say his hawkish face had the look of one who had eaten several sparrows for lunch well well he said bernie gunther its been two years hasnt it must be arthur nebe is here of course hes the assistant commissioner and i daresay there are many others youd recognize personally i could never understand why you left kripo i thought it best to leave before i was pushed youre quite wrong about that i think the party much prefers pure criminalists such as yourself to a bunch of march violets who have climbed on the partys bandwagon for ulterior motives his razorsharp nose wrinkled with displeasure and of course there are still a few in kripo who have never joined the party indeed they are respected for it ernst gennat for example i daresay youre right i might have mentioned all the good cops whod been kicked out of kripo in the great police purge of kopp klingelhöller rodenberg and many others but i wasnt there to have a political argument i lit a muratti smoked my lungs for a second and wondered if i dared mention what had brought me to otto schuchardts desk relax old friend he said and handed me a surprisingly tasty cup of coffee it was you who helped me to get out of uniform and into kripo i dont forget my friends im glad to hear it somehow i dont get the feeling youre here to denounce someone no i dont see you as the type ever to do that so what is it that i can do for you i have a friend who is a jew i said shes a good german she even represented germany at the paris olympiad shes not religious and shes married to a gentile she wants to leave berlin im hoping i can persuade her to change her mind i wondered if there might be a way in which her jewishness might be forgotten or perhaps ignored i mean you hear of these things happening sometimes really well yes i think so i wouldnt repeat that hearsay if i were you no matter how true it might be tell me how jewish is your friend like i said in the olympiad of no i mean by blood you see thats what really counts these days blood your friend could look like leni riefenstahl and be married to julius streicher and none of that would matter a damn if she was of jewish blood her parents are both jewish then theres nothing i can do to help whats more my advice to you is to forget about trying to help her you say shes planning to leave berlin she thinks she might go and live in hamburg hamburg schuchardt really was amused this time i dont think living there is going to be the solution to her problem somehow no my advice to her would be to leave germany altogether youre joking im afraid not bernie there are some new laws being drafted that will effectively denaturalize all jews in germany i shouldnt be telling you this but there are many old fighters who joined the party before who believe that not enough has yet been done to solve the jewish problem in germany there are some myself included who believe that things might get a little rough i see sadly you dont at least not yet but i think you will in fact im certain of it let me explain according to my boss assistant commissioner volk this is how its going to work a person will be classified as german only if all four of his grandparents were of german blood a person will be officially classified as jewish if he is descended from three or four jewish grandparents and if that person has just one jewish grandparent i asked then that person will be classified as being of mixed blood a crossbreed and what will all of that mean otto in practical terms jews will be stripped of german citizenship and forbidden to marry or have sexual relations with pure germans employment in any public capacity will be completely forbidden and property ownership restricted crossbreeds will be obliged to apply to the leader himself for reclassification or aryanization jesus christ otto schuchardt smiled oh i very much doubt that hed be in with any sort of a chance for reclassification not unless you could prove his heavenly father was a german i sucked the smoke from my cigarette as if it were mothers milk and then stubbed it out in a nipplesized foil ashtray there was probably a compound jigsawpuzzle wordassembled from odd bits of germanto describe the way i was feeling only i hadnt yet figured one out but i was pretty sure it was going to involve words like horror and astonishment and kick and stomach i didnt know the half of it not yet i appreciate your candor i said once again his face took on a look of pained amusement no you dont but i think youre about to appreciate it he opened his desk drawer and took out an oversized beige file pasted on the top left corner of the cover was a white label containing the name of the subject of the file and the name of the agency and department responsible for maintaining the file the name on the file was mine this is your police personnel file all police have one and all expolicemen such as yourself schuchardt opened the file and removed the first page the index sheet every item added to the file is given a number on this sheet of paper lets see yes item twentythree he turned the pages of the file until he found another sheet of paper and then handed it to me it was an anonymous letter denouncing me as someone with a jewish grandparent the handwriting seemed vaguely familiar but i hardly felt up to the task of trying to guess the authors identity in front of otto schuchardt there seems to be little point in me denying this i said handing it back on the contrary he said theres every point in the world he struck a match put the flame to the letter and let it drop into the wastepaper bin like i said before i dont forget my friends then he took out his fountain pen unscrewed the top and wrote in the remarks section of the index sheet no further action possible he said as he wrote all the same it might be best if you were to try and fix this it seems a bit late now i said my grandmother has been dead for twenty years as someone of secondgrade mixed race he said ignoring my facetiousness you may well find in the future that certain restrictions are imposed on you for example if you were to try and start up a business you could be required under the new laws to make a racial declaration matter of fact id been thinking of starting up as a private investigator assuming i can raise the money being the house detective at the adlon is kind of slow after working homicide at the alex in which case you would be well advised to make your one jewish grandparent disappear from the official record believe me you wouldnt be the first one to do this there are many more crossbreeds around than you might think in the government there are at least three that i know of its a crazy mixedup world we live in for sure i took out my cigarettes put one in my mouth thought better of it and returned it to the pack exactly how would you go about doing something like that making a grandparent disappear frankly bernie i wouldnt know but you could do worse than speak to otto trettin at the alex trettin how can he help otto is a very resourceful man very well connected you know that he took over liebermann von sonnenbergs department at the alex when erich became the new head of kripo which was counterfeiting and forgery i said im beginning to understand yes otto was always a very enterprising sort of fellow you didnt hear it from me i stood up i was never even here we shook hands tell your jewish friend what i said bernie to get out now while the goings good germany s for the germans now then he raised his right arm and added an almost rueful heil hitler that was a mixture of conviction and perhaps habit anywhere else i might have ignored it but not at gestapo house also i was grateful to him not just for my own sake but for friedas too and i didnt want him to think me churlish so i returned his hitler greeting which made twice in one day id had to do it at this rate i was well on my way to becoming a thoroughgoing nazi bastard before the week was out threequarters of me anyway schuchardt walked me downstairs where several policemen were now loitering excitedly in the hall he stopped and spoke to one as we went to the front door whats all the commotion i asked when schuchardt caught up with me again a cops been found dead in the kaiser hotel he said thats too bad i said trying to keep in check the sudden wave of nausea i was feeling what happened no one saw anything but the hospital said it looks like he might have suffered some kind of blow to his stomach friedas departure for hamburg seemed to herald an exodus of jews from the adlon max prenn the hotels chief reception clerk and a cousin of the countrys best tennis player daniel prenn announced that he was following his relative out of germany in the wake of the latters expulsion from the german lta and said that he was going to live in england then isaac somebodyorother one of the musicians in the hotel orchestra went to work at the ritz in paris finally there was the departure of ilse szrajbman a stenographer who used to do typing and secretarial work for hotel guests she went back to her hometown of danzig which was either a city in poland or a free city in old prussia depending on how you looked at it i preferred not to look at it the way i tried not to look at a lot of things in the autumn of danzig was just another reason to have one of those treaty of versailles arguments about the rhineland and the saarland and alsacelorraine and our african colonies and the size of our military forces to that extent anyway i was much less of a typical german than the threequarters that were to be allowed to me in the new germany the hotel business leaderto give georg behlert the adlons manager his proper titletook businessmen and their capacity to do business in the adlon very seriously and the fact that one of the hotels most important and highestspending guests an american in suite named max reles had come to rely on ilse szrajbman meant that it was her departure among all the jewish departures from adlon that disturbed behlert the most the convenience and satisfaction of the guests at the adlon always come first he said in a tone that implied he thought this might be news to me i was in his office overlooking the hotels goethe garden from which every day in summer behlert took a buttonhole at least he did until the gardener told him that in berlin at least a red carnation was a traditional sign that you were a communist and therefore illegal poor behlert he was no more a communist than he was a nazi his only ideology was the superiority of the adlon over all other berlin hotels and he never wore a boutonniere again a desk clerk a violinist yes even a house detective help the hotel to run smoothly yet they are also relatively anonymous and it seems unlikely that a guest will be greatly inconvenienced by any of their departures but fräulein szrajbman saw herr reles every day he trusted her it will be hard to find a replacement whose typing and shorthand are as reliable as her good character behlert wasnt a hightoned sort of man he just looked and sounded that way a few years younger than metoo young to have fought in the warhe wore a tailcoat a collar as stiff as the smile on his face spats and a lineofants mustache that looked as if it had been grown especially for him by ronald colman i suppose i shall have to put an advertisement in the german girl he said thats a nazi magazine you put an ad in there and i guarantee youll get yourself a gestapo spy behlert got up and closed the office door please herr gunther i dont think its advisable to talk like that you could get us both into trouble youre speaking as if theres something wrong with employing someone who is a national socialist behlert thought himself too refined to use a word like nazi dont get me wrong i said i just love nazis ive a sneaking suspicion that ninetynine point nine percent of nazis are giving the other point one percent an undeservedly bad reputation please herr gunther i expect some of them are excellent secretaries too matter of fact i saw several just the other day when i was at gestapo headquarters you were at gestapo headquarters behlert adjusted his shirt collar to accommodate an adams apple that was going up and down his neck like an elevator car sure i used to be a cop remember anyway this pal of mine runs a gestapo department employing a whole pit of stenographers blond blueeyed a hundred words a minute and thats just the confessions obtained without duress when they start using the rack and thumbscrews the ladies have to type even faster than that acute discomfort continued to hover like a hornet in the air in front of behlert youre an unusual man herr gunther he said weakly thats what my friend in the gestapo said something like that anyway look herr behlert forgive me for knowing your business better than you but it seems to me that the last thing we want at the adlon is someone who might scare the guests with a lot of talk about politics some of these people are foreigners quite a few are also jews and theyre a bit more particular about things like freedom of speech not to mention the freedom of jews why dont you leave it to me to find someone suitable someone who has no interest in politics whatsoever whoever we find ill have to check her out anyway besides i enjoy looking for girls even ones who can earn an honest living all right if you would he smiled ruefully what what you said just now you reminded me of something said behlert i was remembering what it was like to speak without looking over your shoulder you know what i think the problem is that before the nazis there was never any free speech worth listening to that evening i went to one of the bars at europa haus a geometric pavilion of glass and concrete it had rained and the streets were black and shiny and the huge assemblage of modern officesodol allianz daimlerlooked like a great passenger liner cruising across the atlantic with every deck lit up a taxi dropped me near the bow end and i went into the cafébar pavilion to splice the main brace and look for a suitable crew member to replace ilse szrajbman of course i had an ulterior motive in volunteering for such hazardous duty it gave me something to do while i was drinking something better to do while i was drinking than feeling guilty about the man i had killed or so i hoped his name was august krichbaum and most of the newspapers had reported his murder for it transpired there had been a witness of sorts who had seen me deliver the fatal blow fortunately the witness had been leaning out of an upperfloor window of the kaiser hotel at the time of krichbaums death and had seen only the top of my brown hat the doorman described me as a man of about thirty with a mustache and upon reading all of this i might have shaved off my mustache if i had worn one my only consolation was that krichbaum had not left behind a wife and family there was that and the fact that he was exsa and a nazi party member since anyway i had hardly meant to kill him not with one punch even if it was a punch that had lowered krichbaums blood pressure slowed his heart and then stopped it altogether as usual the pavilion was full of clochehatted stenographers i even spoke to a few but there wasnt one who struck me as having what guests of the hotel needed most in a secretary beyond the ability to type and take good shorthand and i knew what this was even if georg behlert didnt the girl needed to have a little bit of glamour just like the hotel itself quality and efficiency were what made the adlon good but glamour was what made the place famous and why it was always full of the best people of course this also made it attractive to some of the worst people but that was where i came in and of late slightly more often in the evenings since frieda had left because while the nazis had closed nearly all of the sex clubs and bars that once made berlin a byword for vice and sexual depravity there was still a considerable number of joy girls who worked a more discreet trade in the friedrichstadt maisons or more commonly in the bars and lobbies of the bigger hotels and upon leaving the pavilion i decided to drop in at the adlon on my way home just to see what was what the doorman carl saw me getting out of a taxi and came forward with an umbrella he was pretty good with an umbrella and a smile and the door and not much else it wasnt what id have called a career but with tips he made more than i did a lot more frieda had strongly suspected carl was in the habit of taking tips from joy girls to let them into the hotel but neither of us had ever been able to catch him or prove it flanked by two stone columns each bearing a lantern as big as a fortytwocentimeter howitzer shell carl and i remained on the pavement for a moment to smoke a cigarette and generally exercise our lungs above the door was a laughing stone face no doubt the face had seen the hotel room rate at fifteen marks a night it was almost a third of what i made in a week i went inside the entrance hall tipped my damp hat to the new desk clerk and winked at the page boys there were about eight of them they sat yawning on a polished wooden bench like a colony of bored apes waiting for a light that would summon them to duty in the adlon there were no bells the hotel was always as quiet as the great reading room in the prussian state library i expected the guests liked it that way but i preferred a bit more action and vulgarity the bronze bust of the kaiser on top of a sienna marble chimney piece as big as the nearby brandenburg gate seemed to recognize as much hey who me sir what are you doing here gunther said the kaiser tweaking the end of a mustache shaped like a flying albatross you should be in business for yourself the times were living in were made for scum like you with all the people who go missing in this city an enterprising fellow like you could make an excellent living as a private investigator and the sooner the better id say after all youre hardly cut out to work in a place like this are you not with those feet to say nothing of your manners whats wrong with my manners sir the kaiser laughed listen to yourself that accent for one thing its terrible whats more you cant even say sir with any proper conviction you have absolutely no sense of servility which makes you more or less useless in the hotel business i cant imagine why louis adlon employed you youre a thug always will be why else would you have murdered that poor fellow krichbaum take my word for it you dont belong here i glanced around the sumptuously appointed entrance hall at the square pillars of marble the color of clarified butter there was even more marble on the floors and on the walls as if a quarry had been running a sale of the stuff the kaiser had a point if i stayed there much longer i might turn to marble myself like some musclebound trouserless greek hero id like to leave sir i told the kaiser only i cant afford to not yet it takes money to set up in business why dont you go to someone of your tribe and borrow some money my tribe you mean onequarter jew surely that counts for something when youre trying to raise some ready cash i felt myself fill up with indignation and anger as if id been slapped on the face i might have said something rude back to him like the thug i was he was right about that much instead i decided to ignore his remarks after all he was the kaiser i went up to the top floor and began a latenight patrol of the nomansland that was at this late hour the dimly lit landings and corridors my feet were big it was true but they were quite silent on the thick turkish carpets except for a small squeak of leather coming from my best salamanders i might have been the ghost of herr jansen the assistant hotel manager whod shot himself after a scandal involving a russian spy way back in it was said that jansen had wrapped the revolver in a thick bath towel to avoid disturbing the hotels guests with the sound of the gunshot im sure they appreciated his consideration entering the wilhelmstrasse extension i turned a corner and saw the figure of a woman wearing a light summer coat she knocked gently at a door i stopped waiting to see what would happen the door remained closed she knocked again and this time pressed her face against the wood and spoke hey open up in there you called pension schmidt for some female company remember so here i am she waited for a moment and then added do you want me to suck your cock i like sucking cock im good at it too she let out a sigh of exasperation look mister i know im a bit late but its not easy getting a taxi when its raining so let me in eh you got that right i said i had to hunt around for one myself a taxi she swung around to face me nervously putting her hand on her chest she let out a gasp that turned into a laugh oh you gave me such a fright she said im sorry i didnt mean to startle you no its all right is this your room sadly not i meant it too even in the low light i could tell she was a beauty she certainly smelled like one i walked toward her youll probably think me very stupid she said but i seem to have forgotten my room number i was having dinner downstairs with my husband and we had a row about something and he walked off in a huff and now i cant remember if this is our room or not frieda bamberger would have thrown her out and called the police and in all normal circumstances so would i but somewhere between the pavilion and the adlon i had resolved to become a little bit more forgiving a little less quick to judge not to mention a little less quick to punch someone in the stomach i grinned enjoying her pluck maybe i can help i said i work for the hotel whats your husbands name schmidt it was a sensible choice of name given the fact that i might have heard her use it already the only trouble was i knew pension schmidt to be the most upscale brothel in berlin mmmhmm perhaps wed better go downstairs and then we can ask the desk clerk if he can tell me what room im supposed to be in this was her not me cool as a cucumber oh im sure you got the right room kitty schmidt was never known to make a mistake about something as elementary as giving the right room number to one of her joy girls i jerked the brim of my hat toward the door its just that the fleas change their minds sometimes they think of their wives and their children and their sexual health and then they lose the nerve for it hes probably in there listening to every word and pretending to be asleep and getting ready to complain to the manager if i knock on the door and accuse him of soliciting the services of a girl i think theres been some sort of a mistake and you made it i took hold of her by the arm i think youd better come with me fräulein suppose i start screaming i grinned then youll wake the guests you wouldnt want to do that the night manager would come and then id be forced to call the polenta and theyd put your pretty little ass in cement for the night i sighed on the other hand its late im tired and id rather just throw you out on your ear all right she said brightly and let me lead her back along the corridor to the stairs where the light was better when i got a proper look at her i saw that the fulllength coat she was wearing was nicely trimmed with fur underneath she wore a violetcolored dress made of some gossamerthin material opaque shiny white silk stockings a pair of elegant gray shoes a couple of long pearl strings and a little violet cloche hat her hair was brown and quite short and her eyes were green and she was beautiful in a thin boyish way that was still the fashion despite everything the nazis were doing to persuade german women that it was all right to look and dress and for all i know probably smell like a milkmaid the girl on the stairs next to me couldnt have looked less like a milkmaid if shed arrived there on a shell blown along by some zephyrs you promise youre not going to hand me over to the bulls she said on the way downstairs so long as you behave yourself yes i promise because if i go up before a magistrate hell put me in the tobacco jar and ill lose my job is that what you call it oh i dont mean the sledge she said i just slide a bit when i need a bit of extra money to help my mother no i mean my proper job if i lost that id have to become a fulltime joy lady and i wouldnt like that it might have been different a few years ago but things are different now a lot less tolerant what ever gave you that idea still you seem like a decent sort there are some who might disagree with you i said bitterly what ever do you mean nothing youre not a jew are you do i look like a jew no it was just the way you saidwhat you said you said what a jew says sometimes not that it matters a damn to me what a man is i cant see what all the fuss is about ive yet to meet a jew who looks like one of those silly cartoons and i should know i work for a jew whos just the sweetest man you could ever hope to meet doing what exactly you dont have to say it like that you know im not sitting on his face if thats what you mean im a stenographer at odol the toothpaste company she smiled brightly as if showing off her teeth at europa haus yes whats so funny nothing ive just come from there as a matter of fact i was looking for you looking for me what do you mean forget it what does your boss do runs the legal department she smiled i know its quite a contradiction isnt it me working in legal so what selling your mouse is just a hobby she shrugged i said i needed the extra money but thats only part of it did you see grand hotel the movie sure wasnt it wonderful it was all right im a bit like flaemmchen i think the girl joan crawford plays i just love big hotels like that one in the movie like the adlon people come people go nothing ever happens but its not like that at all is it i think a lot happens in a place like this a lot more than happens in the lives of most ordinary people i love the atmosphere of this particular hotel i love the glamour i love the feel of the sheets and the big bathrooms youve no idea how much i love the bathrooms in this hotel isnt it a little dangerous joy ladies can get hurt there are plenty of men in berlin who like to dole out a little pain hitler goering hess to name but three thats another reason to come to a hotel like the adlon most of the fritzes who stay here know how to behave themselves they treat a girl nicely politely besides if anything went wrong id only have to scream and someone like you would turn up what are you anyway you dont look like you work on the front desk not with those mitts on you and youre not the house copper not the one ive seen before you seem to have it all worked out i said ignoring her questions in this line of work it pays to do the algebra and are you a good stenographer ive never had any complaints i have shorthand and typing certificates from kürfurstendamm secretarial college and before that my school abitur we reached the entrance hall where the new desk clerk eyed us suspiciously i steered the girl down another flight to the basement i thought you were going to throw me out she said glancing back at the front door i didnt answer i was thinking i was thinking why not replace ilse szrajbman with this girl she was goodlooking well dressed personable intelligent and if she was to be believed a good stenographer too something like that was easy to prove all i had to do was sit her down in front of a typewriter and after all i told myself i could easily have gone to the europa haus met the girl and offered her a job completely unaware of the way in which she chose to earn a little extra money any convictions most germans thought whores were little better than criminals but id known enough joy ladies in my life to recognize that many of them were much better than that often they were thoughtful cultured clever besides this one wasnt exactly a grasshopper she was quite used to behaving herself in a big hotel like the adlon she wasnt a lady but she could pass herself off as one me none so far and yet all my experience as a policeman told me not to trust her then again my recent experience as a german told me not to trust anyone all right come to my office i have a proposition for you she stopped on the stairs i dont do a soup kitchen mister relax im not after one besides im the romantic kind at the very least i expect to be taken to dinner at the kroll garden i like flowers and champagne and a box of chocolates from von hövel then if i like the lady i might let her take me shopping at gersons but i have to warn you it could be a while before i feel sufficiently comfortable to spend the weekend with you in badenbaden you have expensive taste herr gunther i approve it coincides with my own almost exactly i had a feeling it would we went into the detectives office it was a windowless room with a camp bed an empty fireplace a chair a desk and a washbasin there were a razor and a shaving mug on a shelf above the basin and an ironing board and a steam iron so that one could press a shirt and look vaguely respectable fritz muller the other house detective had left a strong smell of sweat in the room but the smell of cigarettes and boredom was all mine her nose wrinkled with disgust so this is life belowstairs huh no offense mister but by the standard of the rest of the hotel its kind of crummy in here by that standard so is the charlottenburg palace now about that proposition fräulein bauer dora bauer your real name you wouldnt like it if i gave you another and you can prove that mister this is germany she opened her bag to display several documents one of them in red pigskin caught my eye youre a party member doing what i do its always advisable to have the best documentation this one turns away all sorts of unwelcome questions most cops leave you alone as soon as they see a party card i dont doubt it whats the yellow one my reich chamber of culture card when im not typing or selling mouse im an actress i figured being a party member might get me a few parts but not so far last play i had was pandoras box at the kammerspiele on schumannstrasse i was lulu that was three years ago so i type for herr weiss at odol and dream of something better so whats the pitch only this we get a lot of businessmen here at the adlon quite a few of them need the services of a temporary stenographer they pay well much more than the going rate in an office maybe not as good as what youd make on your back in an hour but a lot better than odol plus its honest and above all its safe and it would mean you could come in and out of the adlon quite legitimately are you serious there was real interest and excitement in her tone of voice work here at the adlon really of course im serious on the level i smiled and nodded you smile gunther but believe me these days theres something dodgy about nearly all jobs a girl is offered do you think herr weiss would give you a reference if i asked him nicely hed give me anything she smiled vainly thanks thanks a lot gunther just dont let me down dora if you do i shook my head just dont all right who knows you might even end up marrying the minister of the interior with whats in your handbag i wouldnt be at all surprised hey youre one of the workers do you know that i wish i was dora i wish to god i was the very next day the guest in suite reported a theft this was one of the vip corner rooms right over the offices of north german lloyd and accompanied by herr behlert the hotel manager i went along to interview him max reles was a german american from new york tall powerful balding with feet like shoe boxes and fists as big as two basketballs he resembled a cop more than a businessmanat least a cop who could afford to buy silk ties from sparmann and his suits assuming he didnt pay attention to the jewish boycott from rudolf hertzog he wore cologne and diamond cuff links that were almost as polished and shiny as his shoes behlert and i advanced into the suite and reles looked at him and then at me with eyes as narrow as his mouth his bareknuckle features seemed to wear a permanent scowl id seen less pugnacious faces on a church wall well its about fucking time he said gruffly giving me an upanddown look as if i were the rawest recruit in his platoon what are you a cop hell you look like a cop he looked at behlert with something close to pity and added god damn it behlert what kind of flea circus are you chumps running here anyway jesus christ if this is berlin s best hotel then id hate to see the worst i thought you nazis were supposed to be tough on crime thats your big boast isnt it or is that just so much bullshit for the masses behlert tried to calm reles but to no avail i decided to let him sound off for a while through a set of tall french windows there was a large stone balcony where depending on your inclination you could wave to your adoring public or rant about the jews maybe both i went over to the window pulled aside the net curtain and stared outside waiting for him to cool off if ever he cooled off i had my doubts about that he spoke excellent german for an american although he sang his words a bit more than we berliners do a bit like a bayer which gave it away you wont find the thief out there fellow nevertheless thats probably where he is i said i cant imagine the thief is still in the hotel can you whats that german logic god damn it whats the matter with you people you might try and look a little more concerned he hurled a gas grenade of a cigar at the window in front of me behlert sprang forward and picked it up it was that or let the rug burn perhaps if you were to tell us whats missing sir i said facing him squarely and exactly what makes you think its been stolen what makes me think jesus are you calling me a liar not at all herr reles i wouldnt dream of doing that until i had ascertained all of the facts reless scowl turned to puzzlement as he tried to figure out if i was being insulting or not i wasnt exactly sure about that myself meanwhile behlert was holding the crystal ashtray in front of reles like an altar boy preparing to help a priest give communion the cigar itself wet and brown resembled something left there by a small dog and perhaps that was why reles himself seemed to think better of putting it back in his mouth he sneered biliously and waved the thing away with the back of his hand which was when i noticed the diamond rings on his little fingers not to mention his perfectly manicured pink fingernails it was like discovering a rose at the bottom of a boxers spittoon with behlert standing between me and reles i half expected him to remind us of the rules of the ring i didnt much like loudmouthed amis even the ones who were loud in perfect german and outside of the hotel i would hardly have minded showing it so whats your story fritz reles asked me you look too young to be a house detective thats a job for a retired cop not a punk like you unless of course youre a commie the nazis wouldnt want a cop that was a commie fact is im none too fond of the reds myself id hardly be working here if i was a red herr reles the hotel flower arranger wouldnt like that she prefers white to red and so do i besides its not my story that matters right now its yours so lets try to concentrate on that eh look sir i can see youre upset helen keller could see that youre upset but unless we can all keep calm and establish what happened here we wont get anywhere reles grinned and then snatched the cigar back just as behlert was taking away the ashtray helen keller eh he chuckled and put the cigar back in his mouth puffing it back into life but the tobacco seemed to smoke the traces of good humor out of him and he returned to his resting state which seemed to be that of low rage he pointed at a chest of drawers like most of the furniture in his suite it was blond biedermeier and looked as if it had been baked in a glaze of honey on top of that cabinet was a little basketryandlacquer chinese box it was early seventeenth century ming dynasty and it was valuable i had it parceled up and ready to send to someone in the states im not exactly sure when it disappeared might have been yesterday might have been the day before how big was this box about twenty inches long about a foot wide three or four inches deep i tried to work that out in metric and gave up theres a distinctive scene painted on the lid some chinese officials sitting around on the edge of a lake are you a collector of chinese art sir hell no its too chinese for my tastes i like my art to look a little more homegrown since it was parceled do you think you might have asked the concierge to have it collected and forgotten about it sometimes were too efficient for our own good not so as ive noticed he said if you could answer the question please you were a cop werent you reles sighed and combed his hair with the flat of his hand as if checking it was still there it was but only just i checked okay no one sent it then i have one more question sir who else has access to this room it could be someone with a key perhaps or someone youve invited up here meaning meaning just what i said can you think of someone who might have taken the box you mean apart from the maid naturally ill be asking her reles shook his head behlert cleared his throat and lifted his hand to interrupt there is someone surely he said what are you talking about behlert snarled reles the manager pointed at a desk by the window where between two sheaves of notepaper sat a shiny new torpedo portable typewriter wasnt fräulein szrajbman coming in here every day to do some shorthand and typing for you until a couple of days ago reles bit his knuckle goddamn bitch he said and flung away his cigar again this time it flew through the door of the ensuite bathroom hit the porcelaintiled wall and landed safely in the uboatsized bath behlert lifted his eyebrows clean off his forehead and went to retrieve it once again youre right i said i was a cop i worked homicide for almost ten years until my allegiance to the old republic and the basic principles of justice made me surplus to the new requirements but along the way i developed a pretty good nose for criminal investigation so its clear to me you think she took it and whats more that youve got a pretty good idea why if we were in a police station i might ask you about that but since youre a guest in this hotel its up to you whether you tell us or not sir we argued about money he said quietly about the number of hours shed worked is that all of course what are you implying mister im not implying anything but i knew fräulein szrajbman quite well she was very conscientious thats why the adlon recommended her to you in the first place shes a thief reles said flatly what the hell are you going to do about it ill put the matter into the hands of the police right away sir if thats what you want youre damn right i do just tell your old pals to swing by and ill swear out a warrant or whatever you flatfoots do in this sausage factory you call a country soon as they like now get the hell out of here before i lose my temper at that i almost told him hed have to keep his temper before he could ever lose it and that while his parents might have taught him to speak good german they certainly hadnt taught him any good german manners to go with it instead i kept my mouth shut which as hedda adlon was fond of telling me is a large part of running a good hotel the fact that it was now also a large part of being a good german was neither here nor there a couple of schupos wearing puttees and rubber macs against the driving rain were standing on duty by the main entrance of the police praesidium on berlins alexanderplatz the word praesidium comes from the latin meaning protection but given that the alex was now under the control of a bunch of thugs and murderers it was hard to see who was protecting whom from whom the two uniformed cops had a similar problem recognizing my face they didnt know whether to salute or batter me to the ground as usual the main entrance hall smelled of cigarettes cheap coffee unwashed bodies and sausage i was arriving just as the local wurst seller had turned up to sell boiled sausage to those cops who were lunching at their desks the maxthey were always known as maxwore a white coat a top hat and as was traditional a little mustache hed drawn onto his face with an eyebrow pencil his mustaches were longer than i remembered and probably would continue to be that way while hitler continued with a postage stamp on his own upper lip but i often wondered if anyone had ever dared ask hitler if he could smell gas because that was what he looked like a gas sniffer sometimes you saw these men fitting long pipes into holes in the road and then sniffing the open ends for escaping gas it always gave them the same telltale smudge on the upper lip havent seen you in a while herr commissar said the max the large square metal boiler hanging from a strap around his neck looked like a steampowered accordion ive been away for a while it must have been something i ate very amusing sir im sure you tell him bernie said a voice weve got more than enough sausage at the alex but not nearly enough laughs i looked around and saw otto trettin coming through the entrance hall what the hell are you doing back here he asked dont say youre another march violet i came to report a crime at the adlon the biggest crime at the adlon is what they charge for a plate of sausage eh max too right herr trettin but after that i said i was planning to buy you a beer beer first said otto then report the crime otto and i went across the road to the zum in the arches of the local sbahn station cops liked it there because with a train passing overhead every few minutes it was hard to be overheard and i imagined this was especially important in otto trettins case since it was generally known that he fiddled his expenses and probably was not averse to having his bread spread with some very dodgy butter he was still a good cop however one of the alexs best from the days before the police purge and although he wasnt a party member the nazis seemed to like him otto had always been a bit heavyhanded he had famously handed out a beating to the sass brothers which at that time was a serious breach of police ethics although they had certainly deserved it and doubtless this was one of the reasons that had helped him to find favor with the new government the nazis liked a bit of rough justice to that extent it was perhaps surprising i wasnt working there myself ill have a landwehr top said trettin make that two i told the barman named after berlin s famous canal in which the waters surface was often polluted with a layer of oil or gasoline a landwehr top was a beer with a brandy in it we hurried them down and ordered two more youre a bastard gunther said otto now that youve left ive got no one to talk to no one i can trust that is what about your beloved coauthor erich trettin and erich liebermann von sonnenberg had published a book together the previous year criminal cases was little more than a series of stories cobbled together from a trawl through kripos oldest files but no one doubted that the two had made money from it fiddling his expenses ramping up the overtime taking the odd backhander and now with a book already translated into english otto trettin always seemed to know how to make money erich we dont see much of each other now that hes head of berlin kripo heads up his arse with his own selfimportance these days you left me sitting in the ink do you know that i cant feel sorry for you not after i read your lousy book you wrote up one of my cases and you didnt even give me the credit you gave the bracelets on that one to von bachman i could have understood it if he was a nazi but hes not he paid me to write him up a hundred marks to make him look good youre joking no im not not that it matters now hes dead i didnt know sure you did youve just forgotten thats all berlin s like that these days all sorts of people are dead and we forget about it fatty arbuckle stefan george hindenburg the alex is no different take that cop who got murdered the other day weve already forgotten his name august krichbaum everyone except you he shook his head see what i mean youre a good copper you shouldnt ever have left he raised his glass to the dead where would we be without them steady on i said as he drained his glass a second time ive had a hell of a morning ive been to plötzensee prison with a load of berlin s top polenta and the leader now ask me why why because his nibs wanted to see the falling ax in action the falling ax was what we germans quaintly called the guillotine otto waved the barman back a third time youve seen an execution with hitler thats right there wasnt anything about an execution in the newspaper who was it some poor communist just a kid really anyway hitler watched it happen and pronounced himself very impressed so much so that hes ordered twenty new fallingax machines from the manufacturer in tegel one for every big city in germany he was smiling when he left which is more than i can say for that poor commie ive never seen it before goerings idea that we should apparently something about us all recognizing the gravity of the historic mission weve set ourselvesor some such nonsense well theres a lot of gravity involved with a falling ax let me tell you have you ever seen one at work just once gormann the strangler oh right then youll know what its like otto shook his head my god ill never forget it as long as i live that terrible sound took it well though the commie when the lad saw that hitler was there he started to sing the red flag at least he did until someone slapped him now ask me why im telling you all this because you enjoy scaring the shit out of people otto you always were the sensitive type im telling you bernie because people like you need to know people like me what does that mean youve got a smart mouth son which is why you have to be told that these bastards are not playing games theyre in power and they mean to stay in power with whatever it takes last year there were just four executions at the plot this year there have already been twelve and its going to get worse a train thundered overhead rendering all conversation meaningless for almost a minute it sounded like a very large very slow falling ax thats the thing about things getting worse i remarked just as youre thinking they cant they usually do thats what the fellow on the jewish desk at the gestapo told me anyway there are some new laws on the way that mean my grandmother wasnt quite german enough not that it matters much to her shes dead too but it seems as if its going to matter to me if you follow my meaning like aarons rod exactly and you being an expert on forgers and counterfeiting i was wondering if you knew someone who might help to fix it for me to lose the yarmulke i used to think an iron cross was all the evidence i needed to be a german but it would seem not a germans worst problems always start when he starts to think of what it means to be a german otto sighed and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand cheer up yiddo youre not the first to need an aryan transfusion thats what they call it these days my paternal grandfather was a gyppo thats where i get my latin good looks from ive never understood what they have against gypsies i think its something to do with fortunetelling hitler just doesnt want us to know the future he has planned for germany its that or the price of clothespins i suppose gypsies were always selling clothespins otto produced a nice gold pelikan from his coat pocket and started to write a name and address on a piece of paper emil is expensive so try not to let your tribes reputation for driving a hard bargain lead you to suppose that hes not worth every penny because he is make sure you tell him i sent you and if necessary remind him that the only reason hes not cooling his heels in the punch is because i lost his file but i lost it in a place where i can certainly find it again the punch was what berlin s police and underworld called the courthouse and jail complex in moabit because moabit was a heavily workingclass district someone had once described the prison there as an imperial punch in the face of the berlin proletariat certainly a punch in the face was more or less guaranteed when you went there regardless of your social class it was without question berlin s hardest concrete he told me what was in emil linthes file so that i might make proper use of it when i spoke to him thanks otto this crime at the adlon he said anything there for me like a nice young girl whos been passing dud checks its small fry for a bull like you an antique box belonging to one of the guests got stolen besides i already figured out who probably did it even better i can get the credit who did do it some ami blowhards stenographer jewish girl whos already left berlin goodlooking forget it otto she went home to danzig danzig is good i could use a trip somewhere nice he finished his drink come on well go back across the road as soon as youve reported it i can be on my way i wonder why she went to danzig i thought jews were leaving danzig especially now that its gone nazi they dont even like berliners in danzig like everywhere else in germany we buy the rest of the country a beer and still they hate us i finished my brandy your neighbors field of corn is always better i guess i thought everyone knew that berlin is the most tolerant city in germany for one thing its always been the only place that would tolerate the german government living here danzig i ask you then wed better hurry before she realizes her mistake and comes back the front desk at the alex was the usual crowd scene from hieronymus bosch a woman with a face like erasmus and a pink pigs bladder of a hat was reporting a burglary to a duty sergeant whose outsized ears looked as if they had belonged to someone else before being sliced off and stuck on the sides of his dogshaped skull with a pencil and an unsmoked rollup two spectacularly ugly thugstheir bloodied mugs stamped with the atavistic stigmata of criminality their hands manacled behind their twisting backswere being pushed and pulled into a dimly lit corridor that led down to the cells and a probable job offer from the ss a cleaning woman with a cigarette clamped firmly in her mouth against the smell who was badly in need of a shave was mopping a pool of vomit on the shitbrown linoleum floor a lostlooking boy his dirty face streaked with tears was sitting fearfully in a corner underneath an enormous spiderweb and rocking on his stringy buttocks and probably wondering if hed make bail a pale rabbiteyed attorney carrying a briefcase as big as the wellfed sow whose hide had been used to fashion it was demanding to see his client except that no one was listening somewhere someone was adducing his previous good character and his innocence of everything meanwhile a cop had removed his black leather shako and was showing a fellow schupo the large purple bruise on his closely shaven head it was probably just a thought making a futile bid to escape from his rusticated skull it felt awkward being back at the alex awkward and exciting i figured martin luther must have felt the same way when he turned up at the diet of worms to defend himself against a charge of spoiling the church door in wittenberg so many faces that were familiar a few looked at me as if i were the prodigal son but rather more seemed to regard me as the fatted calf berlin alexanderplatz i could have told alfred döblin a thing or two otto trettin led me behind the desk and told a young uniformed cop to record my statement the cop was in his midtwenties and unusually by schupo standards was as bright as the badge on his ammunition pouch he hadnt been typing my statement very long when he stopped bit his already wellbitten fingernails lit a cigarette and silently went over to a filing cabinet as big as a mercedes that stood in the center of the huge room he was taller than id expected and thinner he hadnt been there long enough to get a taste for beer and get himself a pregnant belly like a true schupo man he came back reading which in the alex was something of a miracle in itself i thought so he said handing otto the file but looking at me this object youre reporting stolen was reported stolen yesterday i took the particulars myself chinese lacquerandbasketry box said otto glancing over the report fifty centimeters by thirty centimeters by ten centimeters i tried to work that out in imperial measurement and gave up seventeenth century mong dynasty otto looked at me that sound like the same box bernie ming dynasty i said its ming ming mong whats the difference either its the same box or theyre as common as pretzels who made the report a dr martin stock said the young cop from the asiatic museum he was pretty exercised about it what kind of fellow was he i asked oh you know kind of how youd imagine someone from a museum would look sixtyish gray mustache white goatee bald myopic overweighthe reminded me of the walrus at the zoo he wore a bow tie ive seen that before said otto a walrus wearing a bow tie the cop smiled and then continued spats nothing in his lapeli mean no party badge or anything and it was a bruno kuczorski suit he was wearing now hes just showing off said otto i saw the label on the inside of his coat when he took out his handkerchief to mop his brow an anxious sort of fellow but you would have gathered that from the handkerchief on the level like he swallowed a geometry set whats your name son otto asked him heinz seldte well heinz seldte its my opinion that you should leave this fat mans desk job youve got here and become a cop thank you sir so whats the deal gunther said otto you trying to make a monkey out of me im the one who feels like a monkey i tugged the sheet and the carbons off seldtes typewriter and crushed them up i think maybe i should go and yodel in a few ears like johnny weissmuller and see what comes running out of the jungle i took dr stocks crime sheet from the police file mind if i borrow this otto otto glanced at seldte who shrugged back at him its okay with us i guess said otto but you will let us know what you find out bernie ming mong dynasty theft is a special investigative priority for kripo right now we have our reputation to think of ill get right on it i promise i meant it too it was going to be a pleasure to feel like a real detective again instead of a hotel carpet creeper but as immanuel kant once said its funny how categorically wrong you can be about a lot of stuff you think just has to be true most of berlins museums stood on a little island in the center of the city surrounded by the dark waters of the river spree as if the people who built them had decided that berlin needed to keep its culture separate from the state as i was about to discover there should have been a lot more importance attached to this idea than anyone might have thought the ethnographical museum however formerly in prinzalbrechtstrasse was now located in dahlem in the far west of berlin i traveled there on the underground railwayon the wilmersdorf line as far as dahlemdorfand then walked southeast to the new asiatic museum it was a comparatively modern threestory redbrick building surrounded by expensive villas and manor houses with large gates and even larger dogs laws were made for the protection of suburbs such as dahlem and it was hard to see why there should have been two gestapo men parked in a black w out front of the nearby confessing church until i remembered there was a priest in dahlem called martin niemöller who was well known for his opposition to the socalled aryan paragraph either that or the two men just had something to confess i went into the museum opened the first door marked private and found myself looking down at a rather fetching stenographer sitting behind a threebank carmen with maybelline eyes and a mouth that was painted better than holbeins favorite portrait she wore a checked shirt a whole souks supply of brass bangles which tinkled on her wrist like tiny telephones and a rather severe expression that almost had me checking the knot on my tie can i help you i felt sure she could but i hardly liked to mention exactly how instead i sat on the corner of her desk and folded my arms just to keep my hands off her breasts she didnt like that her desk looked as neat as a display in a departmentstore window herr stock about i guess if you had an appointment youd know it was dr stock i dont have an appointment so hes busy she glanced involuntarily at a door on the other side of the room as if hoping i would be gone before it opened again i bet he does that a lot is busy men like him always are now if it was me id be giving you a little dictation or maybe signing a few letters youd just typed with those lovely hands of yours you can write then sure i can even type not as well as you ill bet but you can be judge of that i reached into my jacket and took out the crime sheet id borrowed from the alex here i said handing it over take a look and tell me what you think she glanced at it and her eyes widened a few fstops youre from the police praesidium on alexanderplatz didnt i say i just came from there on the underground this was true but only as far as it went if she or stock asked to see a warrant disc i wasnt going to get anywhere which was the main reason i was behaving the way a lot of real cops from the alex behave a berliner is someone who believes its best to be just a little less polite than other people might think is necessary and most berlin cops fall a long way short of that high standard i lit a cigarette blew the smoke her way and then nodded at a chunk of rock on a shelf behind her wellcoiffed head is that a swastika on that bit of stone its a seal she said from the indus valley civilization from around bc the swastika used to be a significant religious symbol of our own remote ancestors i grinned at her either that or they were trying to warn us about something she stood up from behind the typewriter and quickly walked across the office to fetch dr stock it gave me enough time to study her curves and the seams in her stockings so perfect they looked as if theyd been done in a technical drawing class i always disliked technical drawing but i might have been a lot better at it had i been asked to sit behind a nice girls legs and try to make a couple of straight lines on her calves stock was less easy on the eye than his secretary but exactly as heinz seldte had described him back at the alex a berlin waxwork this is most embarrassing he wailed there has been an awful mistake for which im most dreadfully sorry he came close enough for me to smell the peppermint lozenges on his breath which was a nice change from most of the people who spoke to me and then bowed an abject apology dreadfully sorry sir it would seem that the box i reported stolen was not stolen at all merely mislaid mislaid hows that possible weve been moving the fischer collections from the old ethnographical museum in prinzalbrechtstrasse to our new home here in dahlem and everything is in disarray the official guide to our collections is out of print many objects were misplaced or wrongly attributed im afraid youve had a wasted journey on the underground you said perhaps the museum could pay for a taxicab to take you back to the police praesidium its the least we can do to make up for the inconvenience so you have the box back in your possession i said ignoring his bleatings stock looked awkward again perhaps i might see it for myself i said why why i shrugged because you reported it stolen thats why and now youre reporting that it has been found the thing is sir i have to fill out a report in triplicate proper procedures have to be followed and if this ming dynasty box cant be produced i dont see how i can very well close the file on its disappearance you see sir in a sense the moment i type that its been found i make myself responsible for it i mean thats logical isnt it well the fact is he looked at his stenographer and twitched a couple of times as if someone had a fishing line in him somewhere she stared at me with hat pins in her eyes perhaps youd better come into my office herr trettin criminal commissar trettin i followed him into his office and he closed the door behind me straightaway but for the size and opulence of the room i might have felt sorry for him everywhere there were chinese artifacts and japanese paintings although it could just as easily have been chinese paintings and japanese artifacts that year i was a little weak on my knowledge of asiatic antiquities must be interesting working in a place like this are you interested in history commissar one thing ive learned is that if our history were a little less interesting then we might be a lot better off now what about that box oh dear he said how am i going to explain this without making it sound suspicious dont try to finesse it i told him just tell it like it is just tell the truth i always endeavor to do that he said pompously sure you do i said toughening on him now look stop wasting my time herr doctor have you got the box or not please dont rush me naturally ive got all day to waste on this case its a little complicated you see take my word for it the truth is rarely complicated i sat down in an armchair he hadnt asked me to but that didnt matter now i wasnt selling anything and i wasnt buying anything while i was still standing on my size large i took out a notebook and tapped a pencil on my tongue taking notes of a conversation always puts people on their heels well you see the museum falls under the control of the ministry of the interior and while the collections remained at prinzalbrechtstrasse the minister herr frick happened upon them and decided that a few of the objects might serve a more useful purpose as diplomatic gifts do you understand what i mean by that commissar trettin i smiled i think so sir its kind of like bribery only its legal i can assure you its perfectly normal practice in all foreign relations the wheels of diplomacy often have to be oiled or so im told by herr frick no not by him by one of his people herr breitmeyer arno breitmeyer mmmhmm i took note of the name naturally ill be speaking to him as well i said but let me try to straighten this pretzel herr breitmeyer removed an item from the fischer collections yes yes adolph fischer a great collector of asian artifacts now dead namely one chinese box and gave it to a foreigner not just one object i believe there were several you believe i paused for more effect am i right in thinking that all of this happened without your knowledge or approval that is correct you see it was thought at the ministry that the collections left at the original museum were not wanted for exhibition stock colored with embarrassment that while being of great historical significance i stifled a yawn that perhaps they were unsuitable within the meaning of the aryan paragraph you see adolph fischer was a jew the ministry had formed the impression that under these circumstances the true origins of the collection made it impossible to exhibit that it wasin their words not mineracially tainted i nodded as if all this sounded perfectly reasonable and when they did all this they neglected to tell you is that right stock nodded unhappily someone at the ministry didnt think you sufficiently important to keep you informed about this i said rubbing it in a little which is why when you found the object missing from the collection you assumed it had been stolen and reported it immediately thats it he said with some relief do you happen to know the name of the person to whom herr breitmeyer gave the ming box no you would have to ask him that question i will of course thank you doctor you have been most helpful do i take it the matter is now closed as far as your own involvement is concerned yes sir you can stocks relief turned to euphoria or at least as near to euphoria as someone so dry was ever going to get now then i said about that taxicab back into the city i told the taxi driver to drop me at the ministry of the interior on unter den linden next to the greek embassy it was a dull dirty gray building just around the corner from the adlon it was crying out for some climbing ivy i went inside and at the desk in the cavernous main entrance hall handed my business card to one of the clerks on duty he had one of those startled animal faces that makes you think god has a wicked sense of humor i wonder if you can help me i said unctuously the adlon hotel wishes to invite herr breitmeyerthats arno breitmeyerto a gala reception in a couple of weeks and we should like to know the correct way to address him and to which department we should send the invitation i wish i was going to a gala reception at the adlon the clerk admitted and consulted a thick leatherbound department list on the desk in front of him to be honest they can be rather stiff affairs i dont particularly like champagne give me beer and sausage any day the clerk smiled ruefully as if he were not quite convinced and found the name he was looking for here we are arno breitmeyer hes an ssstandartenführer thats a colonel to you and me hes also the deputy reich sports leader is he now then i expect thats why they want to invite him if hes merely the deputy then perhaps we should invite his boss as well who would that be do you think hans von tschammer und osten yes of course id heard the name and seen it in the newspapers at the time id thought it typical of the nazis that they should have appointed an sa thug from saxony to be germany s sporting leader a man who had helped beat to death a thirteenyearold jewish boy i guess it was the fact that the boy had been murdered in a dessau gym that had really bolstered von tschammer und ostens sporting credentials thank you youve been most helpful must be nice working at the adlon you might think that but the only thing that stops it from being exactly like hell are the locks on the bedroom doors it was one of the many maxims id heard from hedda adlon the owners wife i liked her a lot we shared a sense of humor although i think she had more of it than i did hedda adlon had more of everything than i did back in the hotel i called otto trettin and told him some of what id discovered at the museum so this fellow reles said otto the hotel guest it looks as if he might have been in possession of the box quite legitimately that all depends on your notion of legitimacy in which case this little stenographer the one who went back to danzig ilse szrajbman maybe she did steal the box after all maybe but shell have had a good reason like that is it no but i know the girl otto and ive met max reles so what are you saying id like to find out more before you go charging off to danzig id like to pay less tax and make more love but its not going to happen whats it to you if i go to danzig we both know that if you go youll have to make an arrest to justify your expenses otto its true the deutsches haus hotel in danzig is quite expensive so why not telephone the local kripo first see if you can get someone local to go and see her if she really does have the box then perhaps he can persuade her to return it whats in it for me i dont know nothing probably but shes a jew and we both know whats going to happen to her if shes arrested theyll send her to one of their concentration camps or theyll put her in that gestapo prison near tempelhof columbia haus she doesnt deserve that shes just a kid otto youre turning soft you know that dont you i thought of dora bauer and how i had helped her get off the sledge i suppose i am i was looking forward to some sea air drop by the hotel sometime and ill have the chef fix you a nice plate of bismarck herrings i swear youll think you were on rügen island all right bernie but you owe me sure i do and believe me im glad about that im not sure our friendship could take the strain if it was you who owed me call me when you hear something most of the time the adlon ran like a big state mercedesa swabian colossus with handcrafted coachwork handstitched leather and six outsized continental ags i cant claim that any of this was attributable to me but i took my dutieswhich were largely routineseriously enough i had a maxim of my own running a good hotel is about predicting the future and then preventing it from happening so every day i would look over the hotel register just in case there were any names that leaped out at me as likely to cause trouble there never were unless you count king prajadhipok and his request that the chef prepare him a dish of ants and grasshoppers or the actor emil jannings and his predilection for loudly spanking the bare bottoms of young actresses with a hairbrush the events diary was a different story however corporate hospitality given at the adlon was frequently lavish often alcoholic and sometimes things got a bit out of hand on that particular day there were two groups of businessmen that were booked in representatives of the german labor front were meeting all day in the beethoven room and in the eveningby a coincidence that was not lost on me after my visit to the ministry of the interiorthe members of the german olympic organizing committee including hans von tschammer und osten and ss colonel breitmeyer were to convene for drinks and dinner in the raphael room of the two i was expecting trouble only from dafthe labor front which was the nazi organization that had taken over germany s tradeunion movement this was led by dr robert ley a former chemist who was given to bouts of heavy drinking and womanizing especially when the taxpayer was picking up the bill prostitutes were frequently invited into the adlon as the guests of labor front regional leaders and the sight and sound of heavy men making love to whores in the lavatories was not uncommon their light brown tunics and red armbands made them easy to spot which made me think that nazi officials and pheasants had something in common you didnt have to know anything about them personally to want to shoot one as things turned out ley didnt show and the daf delegates behaved themselves more or less impeccably with only one of them being sick on the carpet i ought to have been pleased by that i suppose as a hotel worker i was a member of the labor front myself i wasnt exactly sure what i got for my fifty pfennigs a week but it was impossible to get any kind of job in germany without being a member i was looking forward to the day when i could parade proudly at nuremburg with a brightly polished shovel over my shoulder and in front of the leader dedicate myself and my hotel work to the concept of labor if not the reality no doubt the adlons other house detective fritz muller felt much the same way when he was around it was impossible not to consider the true importance of work in german society or for that matter when he wasnt around because muller seldom did any work himself he had been tasked by me with keeping an eye on the raphael room which looked like the easier detail but when trouble broke out he was nowhere to be found and it was to me that behlert came seeking assistance theres trouble in raphael he said breathlessly as we swiftly walked through the hotelno member of the staff was ever permitted to run in the adloni tried to get behlert to paint a picture of exactly who all these men were and what their meeting had been about some of the names on the olympic organizing committee were not the sort of men you went up against without first reading the life of metternich but behlerts picture came out as poorly painted as von menzels copy of a raphael mural that had given the function room its name i believe there may have been one or two members of the organizing committee who were present earlier on in the evening he said mopping his brow with a napkinsized handkerchief perhaps it was a napkin funk from propaganda conti from the ministry of the interior hans von tschammer und osten the sports leader but now its mostly businessmen from all over germany and max reles reles hes the host well thats all right i said for a moment there i thought one of them might try to give us some trouble as we neared the raphael room we heard shouts then the double doors were flung open and two men stormed out you can call me a bolshevik if you like but from the size of their stomachs i knew they were german businessmen one of them had a black bow tie that had been twisted halfway around what was laughably called his neck above his neck was a face as red as the little paper nazi flags that were pinned among several paper olympic flags to an easel beside the doors for a moment i considered asking him what had happened but that would only have resulted in my being trampled like a tea plantation trying to resist a rampaging bull elephant behlert followed me through the doors and as my eyes caught those of max reles i heard him say something about laurel and hardy before his tough face opened into a smile and his thick body took on an apologetic placating almost diplomatic aspect that would hardly have disgraced prince metternich himself it was all a big misunderstanding he said wouldnt you agree gentlemen but for the fact that his hair was messed up and there was some blood on his mouth i might have believed him reles looked around the dinner table for support somewhere under a cumulonimbus cloud of cigar smoke several voices murmured wearily like a papal conclave that had neglected to pay the sistine chapels chimney sweep you see reles lifted his big hands in the air as if id pointed a gun at him and for some reason i got the feeling that if i had hed hardly have reacted differently hed have kept his nerve under the drill of a drunken dentist storm in a teacup it didnt sound right in german and snapping his thick stubby fingers he added i mean a storm in a water glass right behlert nodded eagerly yes thats right herr reles he said and may i say your german is excellent reles looked uncharacteristically sheepish well its a hell of a language to speak well he said considering it must have been invented to let trains know when its time to leave a station behlert smiled unctuously all the same i said picking one of several broken wineglasses off the tablecloth it does look like there was a storm a bohemian one i think this stuff is fifty pfennigs a time naturally ill pay for any breakages reles pointed at me and grinned at his complacentlooking guests can you believe this guy he wants me to pay for the breakages theres nothing that looks as pleased with itself as a german businessman with a cigar oh theres no question of that herr reles behlert said and looked at me critically as if i had mud on my shoes or something worse gunther if herr reles says it was an accident then theres no need to take this any further he didnt say it was an accident he said it was a misunderstanding which is how a mistake often falls just short of being a crime is that out of this weeks berlin police gazette reles found a cigar and lit up maybe it ought to be then again if it was i might still be a berlin policeman but youre not youre working here in this hotel in which i am a guest and i might add a bigspending guest herr behlert tell the sommelier to bring us six bottles of your finest champagne around the table there was a loud murmur of approval but none of them wanted to meet my eye just a lot of wellfed and watered faces intent on getting back to the trough a rembrandt group portrait with everyone looking the other way the syndics of the clothmakers guild it was then that i saw him seated at the far end of the room like mephisto waiting patiently for a quiet word with faust like the others he was wearing a tuxedo and but for his satirically grotesque saddlebag of a face and the fact that he was cleaning his fingernails with a switchblade he looked almost respectable like the wolf dressed up as little red riding hoods grandmother i never forget a face especially the face on a man whod once led a group of sa to carry out a gun attack against the members of a workers social club who were holding a dance party at the eden palace in charlottenburg four dead including a friend from my old school probably there were other killings for which he was responsible but it was that one on november that i particularly recalled and then i had his name gerhard krempel hed served some time for that murder at least until the nazis got into government come to think of it make it a dozen bottles ordinarily i might have said something to krempela witty epithet perhaps or something worsebut behlert wouldnt have liked that punching a guest in the throat wasnt the kind of hotelkeeping that read well in baedeker and for all either of us knew krempel was the new minister for level playing fields and good sportsmanship besides behlert was already steering me out of the raphael room that is when he wasnt bowing and apologizing to max reles at the adlon a guest is always given an apology rather than an excuse that was another of hedda adlons maxims but it was the first time id seen anyone in the hotel apologizing for interrupting a fight because i didnt doubt that the man who had left earlier had been hit by max reles and that he had hit reles back i certainly hoped that was the case i wouldnt have minded punching him myself outside the raphael room behlert faced me irritably please herr gunther i know you think you are doing your job but do try to remember that herr reles occupies the ducal suite as such he is a very important guest oh i know i just heard him order a dozen bottles of champagne all the same hes keeping some very ugly company nonsense behlert said and walked away to find the sommelier shaking his head nonsense nonsense he was right of course after all we were all of us keeping some very ugly company in hitlers new germany and perhaps the leader was the ugliest of them all room was on the second floor in the wilhelmstrasse extension it cost sixteen marks a night and came with an ensuite bathroom it was a nice room and a few meters bigger than my apartment i got there at long past midday hanging on the door was a do not disturb card and a pink form informing the rooms occupant that there was a message awaiting him at the front desk his name was herr doctor heinrich rubusch and the chambermaid usually would have left him alone except that he was supposed to check out of the hotel at eleven when she knocked at the door there was no reply at which point she tried to enter the room and found the key was still in the lock after a great deal more fruitless knocking she informed herr pieck the assistant manager who fearing the worst summoned me i went to the hotel safe to fetch one of the key turners that we kept in therea simple piece of metal about the size of tuning fork designed to fit an adlon keyhole and turn a key from the other side there were supposed to be six turners but one was gone which probably meant muller the other hotel detective had it and had forgotten to put it back this would have been quite typical muller was a bit of a drunk i took another key turner from the safe and went up to the second floor herr rubusch was still in bed i hoped hed wake up and shout at us to get out and let him get some sleep but he didnt i put my fingers on the big vein on his neck but there was so much fat on him that i soon gave up and having opened his pajama jacket pressed my ear to his cold ham of a chest shall i call dr küttner asked pieck yes but tell him not to hurry hes dead dead i shrugged staying in a hotel is a bit like life at some stage you have to check out oh dear me are you sure baron frankenstein couldnt make this character move the chambermaid standing in the doorway started crossing herself gravely pieck told her to go and fetch the house doctor at once i sniffed the water glass on his bedside table it had water in it the dead mans fingernails were clean and polished as if hed just had a manicure there was no blood visible anywhere on his person or on his pillow looks like natural causes but wed better wait for küttner i dont get paid any extra for an onthespot diagnosis pieck walked toward the window and started to open it i wouldnt do that if i were you i said the police wont like it the police when a dead bodys found they like it if you tell them thats the law or at least it used to be but considering the number of bodies that turn up dead these days who knows in case you hadnt noticed theres a strong smell of perfume in the room blue grass by elizabeth arden if im not mistaken somehow i dont see this gentleman choosing to wear it himself which means there might have been someone with him when he stepped off the pavement and that means the police will prefer things to be left the way they are now with the window closed i went into the bathroom and glanced over a neat array of mens toiletries it was the usual outoftown crap one of the hand towels was smeared with makeup in the wastebasket was a tissue with a lipstick mark i opened his toilet bag and found a bottle of nitroglycerin pills and a packet of three fromms i opened up the packet saw that one was missing and took out a little folded slip on which was printed please discreetly hand me a packet of fromms i lifted the lid on the toilet seat and checked the water in the lavatory there was nothing in the water in a wastepaper basket by the desk i found an empty fromm wrapper i did all the things a real detective would have done except make a tasteless joke i was going to leave that to dr küttner by the time he came through the door i was about to ready to toss him a probable cause but professional courtesy made me hang on to it until hed earned his retainer people in expensive hotels are seldom ever really ill you know he said at sixteen marks a night they usually wait until theyre back home to be really ill this one wont be going home i said dead is he said küttner its beginning to look that way herr doctor makes a change to be doing something for my fee i suppose he took out a stethoscope and set about looking for a heartbeat i had better go and inform frau adlon pieck said and left the room while küttner worked his trade i took another look at the body rubusch was a big heavy man with short fair hair and a face as fat as a hundredkilo baby in bed from the side he looked like a foothill in the harz mountains without his clothes it was hard to place him but i was sure there was a reason other than the fact that he was staying in the hotel why he seemed familiar to me küttner leaned back and nodded with what looked like satisfaction hes been dead for several hours i should say looking at his pocket watch he added sometime between the hours of midnight and six oclock this morning there are some nitro pills in the bathroom doc i said i took the liberty of looking through his things probably an enlarged heart an enlarged everything by the look of him i said and handed the doctor the little slip of folded paper and i do mean everything theres a packet of three minus one in the bathroom that plus some makeup on the towel and the smell of perfume in the air leads me to suggest that perhaps the last few hours of his life may have included a very happy few minutes by now i had noticed a clip of brandnew banknotes on the desk and was liking my theory more and more you dont think he died in her arms do you asked küttner no the door was locked from the inside so this poor fellow could have had sex shown her out locked the door gone back to bed and then expired after all the exertion and excitement youve got me convinced the useful thing about being a hotel doctor is that people such as yourself dont ever get to see that my surgery is full of sick people consequently i look like i actually know what im doing dont you only some of the time most medicine comes down to just one prescription you know that youll feel a lot better in the morning he wont there are worse ways to hit the slab i suppose said küttner not if you are married there arent was he married i lifted the dead mans left hand to show off a gold band you dont miss much do you gunther not much give or take the old weimar republic and a proper police force that catches criminals instead of employing them küttner was no liberal but he was no nazi either a month or two earlier i had found him in the mens room weeping at the news of paul von hindenburgs death all the same he looked alarmed at my remark and for a moment he glanced down at heinrich rubuschs body as if he might report my conversation to the gestapo relax doc even the gestapo havent yet worked out a way of making an informer out of a dead man i went downstairs to the front and picked up the message for rubusch which was only from georg behlert expressing the hope that he had enjoyed his stay at the adlon i was checking the duty roster when out of the corner of my eye i saw hedda adlon coming through the entrance hall talking to pieck this was my cue to hurry up and find out more before she could talk to me hedda adlon seemed to have a high opinion of my abilities and i wanted to keep it that way the passkey to what i did for a living was having snappy answers to the questions other people hadnt even thought about an air of omniscience is a very useful quality in a god or for that matter a detective of course with a detective omniscience is just an illusion plato knew that and its one of the things that made him a better writer than sir arthur conan doyle unseen by my employer i stepped into the elevator car which floor asked the boy his name was wolfgang and he was a boy of about sixty just drive smoothly wolfgangs white gloves went into motion like a magicians and i felt my stomach lower inside my torso as we ascended into lorenz adlons idea of heaven is there something on your mind herr gunther last night did you see any joy ladies go up to the second floor a lot of ladies go up and down in this elevator car herr gunther doris duke barbara hutton the soviet ambassador the queen of siam princess mafalda its easy to see who and what they are but some of these actresses movie stars showgirls they all look like joy ladies to me i guess thats why im the elevator boy and not the house detective youre right of course he grinned back at me a smart hotels a bit like a jewelers shop window everything is on show now that reminds me i did see herr muller talking to a lady on the stairs at about two am its possible she was a joy lady except for the fact she was wearing diamonds tiara too that makes me think she wasnt a joy lady i mean if she could afford to be wearing mints then why would she be letting people stroke her mouse at the same time if she was a little pinkie in the air then what was she doing speaking to a sows bladder like muller no offense intended none taken he is a sows bladder was this lady blond or brunette blond and plenty of it too im relieved to hear it i said mentally eliminating from my list of possible suspects dora bauer she had short brown hair and was hardly the type to afford a tiara anything else she wore a lot of perfume smelled real nice like she was aphrodite herself i get the picture did you drive her no she must have used the stairs or maybe she just climbed on the back of a swan and flew straight out of the window thats what aphrodite would have done are you calling me a liar sir no not at all just an incurable romantic and lover of women in general wolfgang grinned that i am sir me too muller was in the office we shared which was about all we shared he hated me and if id cared enough i might have hated him back before coming to the adlon hed been a leather hat with the potsdam policea uniformed bull with an instinctive dislike of detectives from the alex like me he was also exfreikorps and more right wing than the nazis which was another reason he hated me he hated all republicans the way a wheat farmer hates rats but for his drinking he might have remained in the police instead he took early retirement climbed on the temperance wagon for as long as it took to find himself the job at the adlon and started drinking again most of the time he could hold it too ill say that for him most of the time i might have figured it was part of my job to put him out of a job but i didnt leastways i hadnt done it yet of course we both knew it wouldnt be long before behlert or one of the adlons found him drunk on the job and i hoped it would happen without any help from me but i knew i could probably live with the disappointment if this turned out not to be the case he was asleep in the chair there was a half bottle of bismarck on the floor beside his foot and an empty glass in his hand he hadnt shaved and the sound of a heavy chest of drawers being rolled across a wooden floor was coming out of his nose and throat he looked like an uninvited guest at a brueghel peasant wedding i slipped my hand into his coat pocket and took out his wallet inside were four new fivemark notes with a serial number that matched the notes id found on the desk in rubuschs room i figured muller had either procured the joy lady for him or taken a bribe off her afterward perhaps both but it hardly mattered i put the leaves back in the wallet returned it to his pocket and then kicked him on the ankle hey sigmund romberg wake up muller stirred took a sniff of air and then let out a deep breath that smelled like a wet malting floor wiping his sandpaper chin with the back of his hand he looked around thirstily its by your left foot i said he glanced down at the bottle and pretended to ignore it only he wasnt very convincing he could have pretended he was frederick the great and he would have looked more persuasive what do you want thanks but its a little early for me but you go right ahead and have one if it makes thinking any easier ill just stand here and watch and have fun imagining what your liver must look like you know ill bet its an interesting shape maybe i should paint it i do a little abstract painting now and then lets see now how about still life with liver and onions we can use your brains for the onions okay what do you want his tone was darker now as if he were getting ready to hit me but i was on my toes moving around the room like a dancing master just in case i had to slug him i almost wanted him to try it so i could a solid right to the jaw might have helped sober him up since were talking of interesting shapes why dont we talk about that joy lady who was in here last night the one wearing the tiara the one visiting the man in name of rubusch heinrich rubusch did he give you the four leaves or did you take it off the pussycat in the corridor incidentally if youre wondering why its any of my damn business its because rubusch is dead who says i took four leaves off anyone your concern for the welfare of the hotels guests is most touching muller the serial numbers on those four new bills in your wallet match the numbers on a fold of notes lying on a table in the dead mans room youve been in my wallet you might ask yourself why im telling you that ive been in your wallet the fact is i could have brought behlert or pieck or even one of the adlons along here and found those leaves in front of an audience but i havent now ask me why all right ill take a card from your pack why i dont want to see you fired muller i just want you out of this hotel im offering you a chance to leave under your own steam who knows that way you might even leave with a reference suppose i dont want to leave then ill go and fetch them anyway of course by the time we get back youll have got rid of the leaves but that wont matter because thats not why theyll fire you theyll fire you because youre stinking drunk in fact you stink of it so bad the citys thinking of sending a gas sniffer here to check it out drunk he says muller picked up the bottle and then drained it what do you expect in a job like this with so much hanging around whats a man to do with himself all day if he doesnt drink i was almost ready to agree with him there the job was boring i was bored myself i felt like a calfs foot in aspic jelly muller looked at the empty bottle and grinned looks like i need another leg to stand on then he looked at me you think youre so clever dont you gunther with the intellectual equipment you have muller i can see that it might seem that way but theres still a lot i dont know take that joy girl did you bring her into the hotel or did rubusch hes dead you say i nodded i aint surprised big fat man right i nodded again i saw the girl on the stairs and reckoned i could tap the tree for a little trickledown you know he shrugged who can live on twentyfive marks a week she said her name was angela i dont know if thats true or not i didnt ask to see her papers twenty marks was good enough id as far as i was concerned he grinned she was pretty good too you dont see many snappers as goodlooking as that one a real peach so she was so like i said i aint surprised the fat man is dead i felt my arteries tighten like clams just looking at her was that when you saw him when you saw her no i saw him earlier on that evening in the bar and then in the raphael room he was one of the olympic committees party yes and where were you you were supposed to be keeping an eye on them what can i tell you he said irritably they were businessmen not students i left them to get on with it i went to that beer house on the corner of behrenstrasse and friedrichstrassepschorr hausand got soaked how was i to know there was going to be trouble hope for the best but expect the worst thats the job pal i took out my cigarette case and flicked it open in front of his ugly face so whats it to be a letter of resignation or louis adlons oxford toe cap buried up your arse he took a cigarette i even lit it for him just to be sociable all right you win ill resign but we aint friends thats okay ill probably cry a little when i get home tonight but i think i can live with it i was halfway across the entrance hall when hedda adlon winged me with a tilt of her jaw and the sound of my name in full hedda adlon was the only person who ever pronounced my first name as if it really meant what it means brave bear although actually theres some debate that the hard part actually means foolhardy i followed her and the two pekingese dogs that were always with her into the office of the hotels assistant managing director this was her office and when her husband louis wasnt aroundand he wasnt around much when the hunting season got under wayhedda adlon was very much in charge so she said closing the door what do we know about poor herr rubusch have you telephoned the police no not yet i was on my way to the alex when you caught me i wanted to tell them in person oh why is that in her early thirties hedda adlon was much younger than her husband although she had been born in germany shed spent much of her youth living in america and she spoke german with a slight american accent like max reles only that was as far as the similarity went she was blond with a full german figure but it was a healthy figure as healthy as several million marks you dont get a healthier figure than that she enjoyed entertaining and ridingshe had been an enthusiastic member of the berlin fox hunt until hermann goering had banned hunting with dogs in germanyand was very gregarious which was i suspected one of the reasons why the closelipped louis adlon had married her in the first place she added an extra touch of glamour to the hotel like a motherofpearl inlay on the gates of paradise she smiled a lot and was good at putting people at their ease and could hold a conversation with anyone i remembered a dinner at the adlon in which she was seated next to a red indian chief wearing his full native headdress she spoke to him all evening as if shed been talking to the french ambassador of course its always possible that he was the french ambassador the frenchespecially the diplomatsdo like their feathers and their decorations i was going to ask the police if they might handle the matter discreetly frau adlon on the face of it herr doctor rubusch who was married had been entertaining a young lady in his room shortly before he died no wife could ever like the news of her widowhood to be delivered with that kind of postscript not in my experience so for her sake and the sake of the reputation of the hotel i was hoping to put the matter straight into the hands of a homicide detective whos an old friend of mine someone whos equipped with enough human skills to deal sensitively with the case thats very thoughtful of you bernhard were grateful to you but you said homicide i thought his death was natural even if he died in his sleep with a bible in his arms there has to be a homicide inquiry thats the law but you do agree with dr küttner that his death was from natural causes probably only it wasnt with a bible in his arms but a young lady am i to assume you mean a prostitute very likely we chase them out of the hotel like cats where and when we can but its not always easy this one was wearing a tiara thats a nice touch hedda put a cigarette into a holder clever whos ever going to challenge someone in a tiara i might do it if it was a man wearing one she smiled lit the cigarette sucked at the holder and then blew out the smoke not inhaling the stuff at all like a child pretending to smoke pretending to be a grownup it reminded me of me pretending to be a detective going through the motions with just the taste of a proper investigation on my lips and not much more hotel detective really it was a contradiction in terms like national socialism racial purity aryan superiority well if thats all ill be getting along to the alex the boys in homicide are a little different from most people they like to hear bad news as soon as possible a lot of what id told hedda adlon was nonsense of course i had no old friends in homicide not anymore otto trettin was in counterfeiting and forgery bruno stahlecker was part of inspectorate g the juvenile section ernst gennat who ran homicide was no longer a friend not since the purge of and there was certainly no one with any human skills who worked in homicide what good were they when you were arresting jews and communistswhen you were busy building the new germany all the same there were some homicide cops who were worse than others and these were the bulls i hoped to avoid for the sake of frau rubusch and frau adlon and the reputation of the hotel and all of it courtesy of bernie gunther ringcycle hero and good guy dragon slaying a specialty near the front desk in the alex i saw heinz seldte the young cop who seemed too intelligent to be wearing a schupo uniform it was a good start i waved him over amiably who are the duty detectives in homicide i asked seldte didnt answer he didnt even look at me he was too busy coming to attention and looking over my shoulder you turning yourself in for a murder bernie given the fact that i had actually murdered someone and quite recently too i turned around and tried to look as nonchalant as i was able to but my heart was beating as if id run all the way along unter den linden that all depends on who im supposed to have murdered sir i can think of one or two people id be happy to put my hands up for might be worth it at that as long as i knew they were actually dead police officers perhaps well now that would be telling sir still the same young bastard i see yes sir only not so young not anymore come to my office lets talk i didnt argue its never a good idea to disagree with the head of the berlin criminal police erich liebermann von sonnenberg was still just a criminal director when id been a detective at the alex back in that was the year von sonnenberg had joined the nazi party and this had guaranteed his preferment by the nazis after i respected him in spite of that for one thing he had always been an effective policeman and for another he was a good friend of otto trettin as well as the coauthor of his stupid book we went into his office and he closed the door behind me i dont have to remind you whose office this was when you were last here i glanced around the office had been painted and there was a new carpet instead of linoleum on the floor the map on the wall showing the incidence of sa versus red violence was gone and in its place was a glass case full of mottled brown moths that matched the color of von sonnenbergs hair bernard weiss a good policeman im pleased to hear you say so sir given the circumstances of his departure weiss a jew had been forced to leave the police and to flee germany in you were a good cop too bernie the difference is you could probably have stayed on here it didnt feel like that at the time so what brings you back here i told him about the dead man in the adlon natural causes looks like i was hoping the investigating detectives might spare the widow the full circumstances of the mans death sir any particular reason all part of the adlons highclass service like fresh towels in the ensuite bathroom every day is that it theres the hotels reputation to consider as well it wouldnt do for people to get the idea that were pension schmidt i told him about the joy lady ill put some men on it right away he picked up the telephone and barked a few orders and waited covering the candlestick with his hand rust and brandt he said the duty detectives i dont remember them ill tell them to watch their umlauts von sonnenberg added some instructions into the candlestick and when he had finished speaking he hooked the earpiece and shot me a questioning look fair enough im grateful sir that remains to be seen he eyed me slowly and leaned back in his chair just between the two of us bernie most of the detectives here in kripo arent worth a spit and that includes rust and brandt theyre strictly by the book because they wouldnt have the nerve or the experience to know that theres a lot more to the job than whats written in there a good detective needs to have imagination these days the trouble is that that sounds like it has a subversive undisciplined aspect to it and no one wants to be thought of as being subversive do you see what i mean yes sir he lit a cigarette quickly what would you say were some of the characteristics of a good detective i shrugged the feeling that youre right when everyone else is wrong i smiled i can see how that might not go down too well either i hesitated you can speak freely its just you and me in here dogged persistence when people tell you to lay off you dont lay off i never could walk away from something because of politics then i take it youre still not a nazi i said nothing are you antinazi a nazi is someone who follows hitler to be antinazi is to listen to what he says von sonnenberg chuckled its refreshing speaking to a man like you bernie you remind me of how things used to be here of how cops used to talk real cops i assume you had your own informers you cant do the job without keeping your ear on the toilet door the trouble is everyones an informer now von sonnenberg shook his head gloomily and i do mean everyone which means theres much too much information by the time any of its been assessed its useless we get the police force we deserve sir you of all people could be forgiven for thinking that but i cant sit back and do nothing about it i wouldnt be doing my job properly under the republic the berlin police force enjoyed a reputation as one of the best in the world thats not what the nazis said sir i cant help that but i can try to arrest the decline i get the feeling my gratitude is about to be sorely tested i have one or two detectives here who might in time amount to something you mean apart from otto von sonnenberg chuckled again otto yes well otto is otto isnt he always but these cops are lacking in experience your kind of experience one of them is richard bömer i dont know him either sir no well you wouldnt hes my sisters soninlaw i was thinking he might benefit from a little avuncular advice i really dont think id make much of an uncle sir i havent got a brother but if i had hed probably have died of criticism by now the only reason they took me out of uniform and put me in plainclothes was because i was so short with the traffic on potsdamer platz advice from me sounds like a ruler across the knuckles i even avoid my own shaving mirror in case i tell myself to go and get a proper job a proper job for you like what for instance ive been thinking i might try to set myself up as a private investigator to do that youll need a license from a magistrate in which case you would need to show police consent it might be useful to have a senior policeman on your side for something like that he had a point and there seemed to be no use in wriggling he had me just where he wanted as if i were a moth pinned in the glass case on his office wall all right but dont expect white gloves and silver service if this fellow richard doesnt like boiled sausage from the wurst max ill be wasting his time and mine naturally all the same it might be a good idea if you were to meet him somewhere outside the alex and that better include the bars around here id like to avoid anyone pulling his chain about the low company hes keeping suits me but id rather not have your sisters soninlaw in the adlon no disrespect to you or her but they generally prefer it if im not teaching a class when im there sure well think of a spot somewhere halfway how about the lustgarten i nodded ill get richard to bring you the files on a couple of cases hes looking at cold ones who knows maybe you can warm them up for him a floater from the canal and that poor dumb cop who got himself murdered maybe you read about him in the beobachter august krichbaum once a huge landscaped garden the lustgarten was enclosed by the old royal palaceto which it had formerly belongedand the old museum and the cathedral but in recent years it had been used not as a garden at all but for military parades and political rallies id been part of a rally there myself in february when two hundred thousand people had filled the lustgarten to demonstrate against hitler perhaps that was why when they came to power the nazis ordered the gardens to be paved over and the famous equestrian statue of frederick william iii removedso that they could stage even larger military parades and rallies in support of the leader arriving in that great empty space i realized i had forgotten about the statue and was obliged to guess where it had been so that i might stand there myself and give kriminalinspector richard bömer half a chance to find me in accordance with liebermann von sonnenbergs arrangements before he saw me i saw hima tallish man in his late twenties fairhaired carrying a briefcase under his arm and wearing a gray suit and a pair of shiny black boots that might have been made to measure for him at the police school in havel deep laugh lines bracketed a wide full mouth that seemed on the edge of a smile his nose was bent slightly out of shape and a thick scar ran through one eyebrow like a little bridge over a golden stream except for his ears which were unscarred he looked like a promising young light middleweight who had forgotten to remove his gum shield seeing me he approached unhurriedly hey are you gunther he pointed southeast in the direction of the palace i think he used to face this way frederick william the third i mean sure about that yes good i like a man who holds on to his opinions he turned and pointed to the west they moved him over there behind those trees which is where ive been waiting for the last ten minutes i decided to come over here when it occurred to me that you might not know that hed moved who expects a granite horseman to go anywhere theyve got to march somewhere i guess thats a matter of opinion come on lets sit a cop never stands when he can sit we walked up to the old museum and sat on the steps in front of a long façade of ionic columns i like coming here he said it makes you think of what we used to be and what we will be again i looked at him blankly you know german history he said german history is nothing more than a series of ridiculous mustaches i said bömer smiled a crooked bashful smile like a schoolboy my uncle would love that one he said i take it you dont mean liebermann von sonnenberg hes my wifes uncle as if having the head of kripo holding a sponge in your corner wasnt enough so your uncle whos he hermann goering he looked sheepish i just want to work homicides to be a good policeman one thing i learned about being a good policeman it doesnt pay nearly as well as being a bad one so whos your uncle does it matter its only that liebermann wanted me to be your uncle so to speak and im the jealous type if youve got another uncle as important as me i want to know about it besides im nosy too thats why i became a detective hes someone at the ministry of propaganda you dont look like joey the crip so you must be talking about someone else bömer dr karl bömer these days it seems everyone needs a doctorate to lie to people he grinned again youre just doing this arent you because you know im a party member isnt everyone youre not somehow i never got around to it there was always a big line of people outside party headquarters when i went to apply it should have told you something that theres safety in numbers no there isnt i was in the trenches my young friend a battalion can be killed just as easily as a single man and it was the generals not the jews who made sure of that theyre the ones who stabbed us in the back the chief said i should try to avoid talking politics with you gunther thats not politics thats history you want to know the real truth of german history its that theres no truth in german history like me at the alex none of what youve heard about me is true the chief said you were a good detective one of the best apart from that he said it was you who caught gormann the strangler if that had been difficult the chief would have put me in his book did you read it he nodded what did you think it wasnt written for other cops youre in the wrong job richard you should be working in the diplomatic corps it was a lousy book it tells you nothing about being a detective not that i can tell you much except this perhaps its easy for a cop to recognize when a man is lying whats harder is to know when hes telling the truth or maybe this a policeman is just a man whos a little less dumb than a criminal your investigative method perhaps you could tell me something about that my method was a bit like what field marshal von moltke said about a battle plan it never survives contact with the enemy people are different richard it stands to reason that homicides are different too perhaps if you were to tell me about a case youre working on now better still if you brought me the file i could take a look at it and offer my thoughts the chief mentioned one case that needed warming up the murder of that cop august krichbaum wasnt it perhaps i could suggest something there thats no longer a cold case said bömer looks like there may be a lead after all i bit my lip oh whats that krichbaum got himself murdered in front of the kaiser hotel right pathologist reckoned someone clouted him in the gut must have been quite a punch i guess if youre not ready for it it might be anyway the hotel doorman got a look at the main suspect not much of a look but hes an excop anyway hes looked at the photograph of every crook in berlin and no luck since then hes been racking his brains and now reckons that the fellow who hit krichbaum might have been another cop a cop youre joking not at all theyve got him looking over the personnel files of the entire berlin police force past and present as soon as he thumbs the right mug theyll have the guy for sure well thats a relief i lit a cigarette and rubbed the back of my neck uncomfortably as if i could already feel the blade of the falling ax its said that all you ever feel is a sharp bite like the angry nip of the electric clippers in a gentlemens hairdressers it took me a moment or two to remind myself that the hotel doormans description of the suspect had been of a man with a mustache and it took me a while longer to remember that in the original photograph on my own police personnel file i had been wearing a mustache did that make it more or less likely that he could identify me i wasnt sure i took a deep breath and felt my head swim a little but i brought the file on something else ive been working on said bömer unbuckling his saddleleather briefcase good i said without enthusiasm oh good he handed me a buffcolored file a few days ago there was a body found floating in the mühlendamm lock a landwehr top i said i beg your pardon nothing so why didnt the mühlendamm murder commission deal with it because there was some mystery about the mans identity and about the cause of death the man drowned but the body was full of seawater see so he couldnt possibly have drowned in the river spree he handed me some photographs plus as you can see an attempt had been made to weigh the body down the rope around the ankles probably slipped the weight how deep is it there i asked leafing through the pictures taken at the scene and in the morgue about nine meters i was looking at the body of a man in his late fifties big blond and typically aryan except for the fact that there was a photograph of his penis which had been circumcised among german men that was a little unusual as you can see he might have been a jew said bömer although from the rest of him you wouldnt say he looks like a jew at all the strangest people are these days i mean to say he looks more typically aryan dont you think sure like a poster boy for the sa well lets hope so meaning meaning this if it should turn out hes german then obviously wed like to find out as much as we can but if it should turn out that hes jewish then my orders are that we dont bother to investigate that its understandable these things should happen in berlin and not to waste any police time investigating it i marveled at the calm way he said this as if it were the most natural distinction in the world i didnt speak i didnt have to i was looking at the pictures of a dead man but i was still thinking about my own neck broken nose cauliflower ear big hands i flicked my cigarette away and tried to concentrate on what i was looking at if only to get my mind off the death of august krichbaum this fellow was no choirboy maybe he was a jew after all interesting what is that triangular mark on his chest what is it a bruise the pathologist doesnt say which is sloppy wouldnt have happened in my day i could probably tell a lot more from the actual body where is it now at the charité hospital suddenly i figured that looking at bömers landwehr top was the best way of taking my mind off august krichbaum have you got a car yes come on lets go and take a look if anyone in there asks what were doing youre helping me to look for my missing brother we drove northwest in an opentop butz there was a twowheel trailer attached to the back almost as if bömer were planning to go camping after he was through with me this wasnt so far from the truth i lead a hitler youth troop of boys aged ten to fourteen he explained we were camping last weekend which is why i still have the trailer attached to the car i sincerely hope theyre all still in there go ahead and laugh everyone else at the alex laughs but i happen to believe in germany s future so do i which is why i also hope you locked them in the members of your youth troop i mean nasty little brutes i saw some the other day playing piggy in the middle with some old jews hat still i guess we should forget about it i mean its understandable that these things happen in berlin i dont have anything against the jews myself but theres always a but after that particular sentiment its like a stupid little trailer attached to the car but i do believe our nation has become weak and degenerate and that the best way of turning that around is to make being german seem like something important to do that properly we have to make ourselves a special thing a race apart to make ourselves seem exclusively german even to the extent of saying that its no good being a jew first and a german second theres no room for anything else you make camping sound fun bömer is that what you tell the boys around the campfire now i understand what the trailers for i suppose its full of degenerate literature to get the bonfire going he grinned and shook his head christ did you speak like this when you were a detective at the alex no back then we could all still say what the hell we liked he laughed all im trying to do is explain why i think we need the government we have now richard when germans look to their governments to fix things you know were really in the shit if you ask me i think were an easy people to govern all you have to do is make a new law once a year that says do as youre damn well told we drove across karlsplatz and onto luisenstrasse passing the monument to rudolf virchow the socalled father of pathology and an early advocate of racial purity which was probably the only reason why his statue hadnt been moved next to the charité hospital was the pathological institute we parked the car and went inside a redhaired intern wearing a white jacket showed us down to the ancient morgue where a man armed with a pumpaction spray gun was making short and pungent work of what remained of that summers insect life i wondered if the stuff worked on nazis the man with the spray gun led us into the cold store which from the smell wasnt quite cold enough he hit the air with some insecticide and walked us around a dozen sheetcovered bodies laid out on slabs like a tented village until we found the one we were looking for i took out my cigarettes and offered one to bömer i dont smoke too bad a lot of folks still believe we all smoked in the war to calm our nerves but mostly it was to cover the smell of the dead you should take up smoking and not just to help out in a smelly situation like this smoking is essential for a detective it helps convince us were doing something even when were doing nothing much at all youll find theres a lot of nothing much at all that happens when youre a detective i threw off the sheet and stared hard at a mans body the size of schmelings bigger brother and the color of uncooked dough looking at him you almost expected someone to shovel him into an oven and bake him back to life the skin on his face looked like a hand left too long in the bathwater it was crinkled like an apricot even his optician wouldnt have recognized him what was more the pathologist had already been at work a crudely sewn thoracic scar crossed the body from the chin to the pubic hair like a length of toy railway track the scar traversed the center of the triangular mark on the mans broad chest pinching the cigarette from my mouth i went down for a closer look not a tattoo i said a burn mark it looks a little like the tip of a flatiron dont you think bömer nodded tortured are there any similar marks on his back i dont know i took hold of a big shoulder then lets turn him over you take the hip and the legs ill turn the body well pull him toward us and ill lean over and take a look it was like moving a wet sandbag there was nothing on his back except some lank hair and a birthmark but as the body rested against our abdomens bömer swore uncomfortably too much for you richard something just leaked out of his prick and onto my shirt he said quickly stepping away from the slab and then staring in horror at a large brownyellow wound in the center of his belly shit close but not quite that was a new shirt now what am i going to do he pulled the material away from the skin of his belly and sighed havent you got a brown one in that trailer of yours i joked bömer looked relieved yes i have then shut up and pay attention our friend here wasnt tortured that much im sure of anyone using a hot iron on him would have used it more often than once if hed meant to hurt him so why do it i lifted one of the hands and bent the fingers into a fist as big as the fuel tank on a small motorcycle look at the size of these mitts the scar tissue on the knuckles especially here at the base of each small finger and do you see this bump i let bömer take a look at a bump that curled all the way around the back of the palm to a point just below the knuckle of the little finger then lowering the left i lifted the mans right this ones even more pronounced this is a common fracture in boxers id say this guy was a southpaw too which should help narrow it down a bit except that he hadnt boxed in a while see the dirt under these fingernails no boxer would tolerate that only the pathologist here didnt scrape them out and no detective ought to tolerate that if the medicine man doesnt do his job its up to you to put him straight i took out my pocketknife and an adlon envelope containing mullers resignation letter and scraped out what was underneath the dead mans nails i dont see what a few crumbs of dirt are going to tell us said bömer probably nothing but evidence rarely comes in a large size and its nearly always dirty remember that now all i need is to see the dead mans clothes and i need the use of a microscope for a few minutes i glanced around as i recall theres a laboratory somewhere on this floor he pointed in there while bömer went to fetch the dead mans clothes i put the contents of his fingernails into a petri dish and stared at them for a while underneath a microscope i was no scientist and no geologist either but i knew gold when i saw it there was just a tiny crumb but it was enough to catch the light and my attention and when bömer came into the lab carrying a cardboard box i went ahead and told him what id found even though i knew what he was going to say gold huh a jeweler maybe that might also be evidence that the man was a jew i told you richard this man was a boxer most likely he was working on a building site that would account for the dirt under the nails and the gold generally speaking outside of a goldsmiths the best place to look for gold is in the dirt i opened the cardboard box and found myself looking through the clothes of a workingman at a pair of strong boots at a thick leather belt at a leather cap the cheap flannel shirt interested me more as there were no buttons on it and there were small tears on the material where they should have been someone tore this mans shirt open in a hurry i said most likely when his heart stopped beating it looks as though someone tried to revive him after he drowned that would certainly explain the shirt it was ripped open so that an attempt could be made to start his heart again with a hot iron its an old boxing trainers trick something about the heat and the shock i think anyway that explains the burn are you saying someone threw this man in the water and then tried to revive him well it wasnt the spree you told me that yourself he drowned somewhere else then someone tried to revive him then they dumped him in the river thats the chain of causation but i cant attach any whys to that not yet interesting i looked at the mans jacket it was a cheap corduroy from c a except the lining had been opened and then restitched and squeezing the material under the breast pocket i felt something crumple in my fingers i took out my knife again cut away some of the stitches on the lining and picked out a folded piece of paper carefully i unfolded it until i was able to spread a strip of paper about the size of a schoolboys ruler on the bench beside the microscope after being in the waters of the river spree whatever it was that had been printed on the strip of paper was gone forever the paper was quite blank but there was no mistaking its meaning bömers face was equally blank could this have been his name and address it might have been if he was a tenyearold boy and his mother worried about him getting lost well then what does it mean it means that what you first suspected is now confirmed i believe this strip of paper was probably a fragment from the torah the what if god is german i for one wont be at all surprised apparently he enjoys being worshipped issuing people with ten commandments at a time and has even written his own unreadable book but the god that this man worshipped was the hebrew god jews sometimes sew a piece of the word of god into their clothes next to their heart yes thats right richard he was a jew shit god damn it all you really mean that dont you i told you gunther the chief is never going to authorize me to investigate the death of a jew damn it all i thought this might have been a chance to prove myself to lead a proper murder investigation you know i said nothing it wasnt that i was speechless but i certainly didnt feel like making a speech what would be the point i dont make police policy gunther said bömer even liebermann von sonnenberg doesnt do that if you really want to know the policy comes down from the ministry of the interior from frick and frick gets it from goering who probably gets it from the devil himself i know suddenly i badly wanted to be away from richard bömer and his vaulting forensic ambition and it was now obvious in a way it hadnt been obvious before that being a policeman had changed a lot more than i had supposed i couldnt ever go back to the alex even if i had wanted to i expect there will be other murders richard in fact im sure of it in that respect at least you can rely on the nazis you dont understand i want to be a detective like in the stories its all ive ever wanted to be a proper detective like you were gunther but police states are bad for crime and bad for criminals because everyones a policeman in germany now and if theyre not yet they soon will be he kicked the laboratory workbench and swore again richard you almost make me feel sorry for you i picked up the dead mans file and handed it back well i cant say its not been fun ive missed the job ive even missed the customers can you believe that but from now on im going to miss the job the way i miss the lustgarten which is to say not at all because its not the same its not like it used to be when someone gets murderedit doesnt matter who it isyou investigate you investigate because thats what you do when you live in a decent society and when you dont when you say that someones death isnt worth the candle then the jobs not worth having anyway not anymore i held the file out to him but he stared at it as if it wasnt there go ahead i said take this its yours but we both knew it wasnt ignoring the file he turned and walked out of the laboratory and although i wasnt there to see it the pathological institute as well a few months later erich liebermann von sonnenberg told me that richard bömer had left kripo and joined the ss at the time it looked like the better career move the two officers from kripo were very polite georg behlert told me frau adlon couldnt have been more grateful for the way youve handled this whole affair excellent well done we were seated in behlerts office overlooking the goethe garden through the open doors of the adjoining palm court a piano trio was doing its best to ignore a statue of hercules that seemed to demand something rather more muscular than a selection of mozart and schubert i felt a little like hercules myself returning to mycenae after carrying out some pointless labor perhaps i said but i cant think it was a good idea for me to get involved like this i should just have let them get on with it i might have known they would extract some sort of price behlert looked puzzled what price you dont mean not from the hotel i added a price from me and just to see the look of horror on his smooth shiny face i told behlert about liebermann von sonnenberg and the dead man in the charité next time i said if there is a next time i shant try to influence a police investigation it was naive of me to think i could and for what some fat guy in room i never even met why should i worry about his wife maybe she hated him if she didnt she ought to have it would serve him damn well right if the cops put their feet right through her feelings when they gave her the bad news he should have thought of her when he started monkeying around with a berlin joy lady but you were doing what you did for the sake of the good reputation of the adlon hotel said behlert as if that was all the justification required yes i suppose so he was on his feet now removing a stopper from a decanter of the good stuff and pouring us each a thimblesized glass here drink this it looks like you need it thanks georg whats going to happen to him to rubusch no i mean to the poor fellow in the morgue you really want to know he nodded with an unidentified body what usually happens is they take him around to the university anatomical institute and let the students loose on him but suppose the investigation reveals his true identity i didnt make that clear did i there isnt going to be an investigation not now that wei mean inot now that ive established that he was a jew the berlin police dont want to know about dead jews its not considered a proper use of police time and resources as far as the cops are concerned his murdererif indeed he was murdered im not at all sure about thatthat person is more likely to be congratulated than prosecuted behlert drained his glass of the excellent schnapps and shook his head with disbelief im not making this up i said i know it seems incredible but its all true hand on heart i believe you bernie i believe you he sighed one of the guests has just returned from bavaria hes a british jew from manchester apparently he saw a road sign that said something like dangerous bend speed limit jews hurry up what could i tell him i said it was probably a sick joke but i knew it wasnt in my own hometown of jena there is a similar sign outside the zeiss planetarium that suggests a new homeland for jews on the planet mars and the terrible thing is they mean it some of the guests are saying theyre never coming back to germany that were no longer the considerate people we were even in berlin these days a considerate german is someone who doesnt knock at your door early in the morning in case you think its the gestapo i handed him the letter containing mullers resignation as an adlon hotel detective he read it and then laid it on his desk i cant say im surprised or sorry ive had my suspicions about that man for some time of course for you it will mean theres more to do at least until we can find a replacement which is why im going to increase your salary how does an extra ten marks a week sound its not handel but i guess i like it good perhaps you can find a replacement after all you were very helpful with fräulein bauer the stenographer shes been doing a lot of work for herr reles in apparently hes very pleased with her good you might know someone else an expoliceman someone like yourself someone reliable someone discreet someone smart i nodded slowly and poured the drink down my throat georg behlert seemed to think he knew me but i wasnt sure i knew myself not anymore certainly not since my visit to see otto schuchardt on the jewish desk at gestapo house it was perhaps time i did something about that i caught a number tram west across invalidenstrasse and into old moabit past the criminal courts and the prison next to bolles dairyfrom which a strong smell of horse manure blew down the street toward the lessing bridge was a dilapidated tenement it was a crummy sort of areaeven the trash in the street looked like something someone had thrown away emil linthe was on the top floor and through the open window on the landing in front of his door one could hear noise from the machinetool factory on huttenstrasse it had been silent for almost a year during the great depression but since the nazis had come into government the place was constantly active there were just three iron beats over and over again like a waltz conducted by thor the god of thunder i knocked on the door and eventually it opened to reveal a tall slim man in his thirties with a plentiful head of hair that was high at the front and almost nonexistent at the back it was like finding a chaise longue on top of someones head do you ever get used to that noise i asked what noise i guess you do emil linthe gone away on holiday rügen island there was ink on his fingers enough to make me suspect i was talking to the right man after all my mistake i said maybe youre going by a different name these days otto trettin said it might be maier or maybe schmidt walter schmidt linthes persona deflated like a balloon a copper relax im not here to squeeze your wrists im here on business your kind of business and why would i want to do business with the berlin polenta because otto still hasnt found your file emil and because you dont want to give him any reason to start looking for it again or you might find yourself back in the punch his words not mine but im like a brother to that man i always thought coppers killed their brothers when they were still in their cradles ask me in theres a good fellow its a bit noisy out here and you wouldnt want me to raise my voice now would you emil linthe stepped aside at the same time he drew up his suspenders and picked up a cigarette hed left burning in an ashtray on a ledge inside the door as i came inside he closed the door and then quickly moved ahead of me along the corridor to close the sitting room door but not soon enough to prevent me from seeing what looked like a printing press we went into the kitchen i told you emil im not here to squeeze your wrists the leopard doesnt change its spots as a matter of fact thats exactly what i wanted to talk to you about i hear you can do exactly that for the right money i want you to give me what otto trettin called an aryan transfusion i told him the problem about my grandmother he smiled and shook his head it makes me laugh he said all those people who got on the nazi train now running back down the aisle to look for the station they started from i might have told him i wasnt one of those people i might have admitted i wasnt a cop but i didnt want to deliver myself into his potentially blackmailing hands linthe was a crook after all i needed to hold on to the whip or else i might lose control of a horse i planned to ride for as long as i needed it you nazis are all the same he laughed again hypocrites im not a nazi im a german and a german is different from a nazi a german is a man who manages to overcome his worst prejudices a nazi is a man who turns them into laws but he was too busy laughing to listen to what i was saying it wasnt my intention to amuse you emil nevertheless i am amused it is rather amusing i grabbed him by the braces and drew them tight in opposite directions so that i was half strangling him and then shoved him hard up against the kitchen wall through the window just north of moabit i could make out the shape of plötzensee prison where recently otto had seen the falling ax in action it reminded me to be gentle with emil linthe but not too gentle am i laughing i slapped him on one cheek and then the other am i no he yelled irritably perhaps you think that file of yours really is lost emil perhaps i need to remind you whats in it youre a known associate of the hand in hand a very nasty little criminal ring also of salomon smolianoff a ukrainian counterfeiter whos currently doing three years in the dutch cement for forging british banknotes you did three in the punch for the same offense which is why youve developed a profitable little sideline forging documents of course if they ever catch you forging currency again theyll throw away the key and they will emil they will i can guarantee it because if you dont help me ill walk straight round to the charlottenburg police praesidium and tell them about the printing press in your living room what is it a platen i let him go i mean im a fair man i would offer to pay you but what would be the point you could probably print more in ten minutes than i could earn in a year emil linthe grinned sheepishly you know about printing presses not really but i know what one looks like when i see it actually its a kluge better than a platen the kluge is the best for running any type of job work including die cutting foil stamping and embossing he lit a cigarette look i didnt say i wouldnt help you any friend of ottos yes i just said it was amusing thats all not to me emil not to me well then youre in luck i happen to know what the hell im doing unlike most of the people otto could have recommended you say your maternal grandmother surname adler right she was jewish by birth but was brought up as a roman catholic yes in the parish of neukölln ill have to fix it in the church registry and in the town hall neuköllns good a lot of officials there are old lefties and very easily corrupted if it was more than two grandparents i probably couldnt help you but one is relatively straightforward if you know what youre doing which i do but ill need birth certificates death certificates all youve got i handed him an envelope from my coat pocket its probably best i redo everything from scratch all records fixed how much will it cost me linthe shook his head like you said in ten minutes i can print more than you can make in a year so well call it a favor to you and otto all right he shook his head its no sweat adler easily becomes kugler or ebner or fendler or kepler or muller see not muller i said its a good german name i dont like it all right and just to make things that little bit more plausible well turn your grandmother into your greatgrandmother just put the jew in you back a generation so that it becomes inconsequential by the time ive finished youll look more german than the kaiser he was half english wasnt he his grandmother was queen victoria true but she was half german and so was the kaisers mother linthe shook his head no one is ever one hundred percent anything thats whats so stupid about this aryan paragraph were all of us a mixture you me the kaiser hitler hitler most of all i shouldnt wonder they say hitler is onequarter jewish what do you think of that maybe he and i have something in common after all for his sake i just hoped hitler had a friend on the jew desk in the gestapo like i did hedda adlon had a friend too but not the kind you find anywhere south of paradise her name was mrs noreen charalambides and a couple of days before i was introduced to her i had already committed her face and her backside and her calves and her bosom to a space in the flask of my faustian memory previously reserved for helen of troy it was my job to keep an eye on the guests and whenever i saw mrs charalambides in and around the hotel i kept all eight of them on her waiting for her to brush against the silken thread that marked the outer limits of my darker spidery world not that i would ever have tried to fraternize with a guest if that was what you called it that was what hedda adlon and georg behlert called it but something as brotherly as fraternity was a very long way from what i wanted to do with noreen charalambides whatever you called it the hotel took a dim view of that kind of thing it did happen of course and several chambermaids were not above selling it for the right price when erich von stroheim or emil jannings were staying at the hotel the chief reception clerk was always careful to have them attended by a rather elderly chambermaid named bella then again stroheim wasnt that particular he liked them young but he liked them old too it sounds ridiculous and of course it islove is ridiculous thats what makes it funbut i suppose i was a little in love with noreen charalambides before i even met her like some schoolgirl with a ross postcard of max hansen in her satchel i looked at her the way i sometimes look at an ssk in the window of the mercedesbenz showroom on potsdamer platz i dont ever expect to drive that car let alone own one but a man can dream while she was there mrs charalambides looked like the fastest and most beautiful car in the hotel she was tall an impression enhanced by her choice of hat the weather had cooled of late she wore a gray astrakhan shako that she may have bought in moscow her previous port of call although she was in fact an american who lived in new york an american who was on her way back home from some kind of literary or theatrical festival in russia maybe she had bought the sable coat in moscow too im sure the sable didnt mind mrs charalambides looked better in it than any sable id ever seen her hair which she wore in a bun was also sablecolored and i imagined every bit as nice to stroke nicer probably as it wasnt likely to bite all the same i wouldnt have minded being bitten by noreen charalambides any proximity to her pouting cherryred fokker albatross of a mouth would have been worth losing a fingertip or a piece of my ear vincent van gogh wasnt the only fellow who could make that kind of heady romantic sacrificial gesture i took to hanging around in the entrance hall like a page boy in the hope of laying eyes on her even hedda adlon remarked on the similarity im thinking of asking you to read lorenz adlons rulebook for page boys she joked i read that itll never sell for one thing there are too many rules and for another most of these page boys are too busy running errands to have the time to read anything longer than war and peace she laughed at that hedda adlon usually liked my jokes its not that long she said try telling that to a page boy anyway the jokes in war and peace are better have you read it war and peace ive started it several times but after four years of war i usually declare an armistice and then sell the book down the river theres someone whod like to meet you and it so happens shes a writer naturally i knew exactly whom hedda was talking about writers especially lady writers from new york were thin on the ground at the adlon that month it probably had a lot to do with the fifteenmarkanight room rate this was slightly cheaper if you didnt have a bath and a lot of writers dont but the last american writer whod stayed at the adlon had been sinclair lewis and that was in the depression hit everyone of course but no one gets depressed quite like a writer we went upstairs to the little apartment the adlons kept in the hotel i say little but only by the standards of the large hunting estate they also kept in the countryside away from berlin the apartment was nicely decorateda fine example of late wilhelmine wealth the carpets were thick the curtains heavy the bronze hulking the gilt abundant and the silver solid even the water in the carafe looked like it had extra lead in it mrs charalambides was seated on a little birchwood sofa with white cushions and a musicstand back she was wearing a dark blue wraparound dress a triple string of good pearls diamond clip earrings and immediately below her cleavage a matching sapphire brooch that must have fallen off a maharajahs best turban she hardly looked like a writerthat is unless shed been a queen whod given up her throne to write novels about the grand hotels of europe she spoke german well which was fine with me since for several minutes after shaking her gloved hand i could hardly speak german myself and i was more or less obliged to let these two women talk across me like a pingpong table mrs charalambides noreen please is a playwright and journalist freelance for the herald tribune in new york shes just returned from moscow where one of her plays my only play so far was being produced by the famous moscow art theater after a very successful run on broadway you should be my agent hedda noreen and i were at school together in america hedda used to help me with my german still does your german is perfect noreen dont you agree herr gunther yes perfect but i was looking at mrs charalambides legs and her eyes and her beautiful mouth now that was what i called perfect anyway her newspaper has asked her to write an article about the forthcoming berlin olympiad theres been a lot of opposition in america to the idea of our taking part in these olympics given your governments racial policies the aoc president avery brundage was over here in germany just a few weeks ago on a factfinding mission to see if jews are being discriminated against and incredibly he reported back to the aoc that they were not as a result of which the aoc has now voted unanimously to accept germany s invitation and to attend the berlin olympiad in any olympiad that doesnt include the united states said hedda would be completely meaningless exactly said mrs charalambides since the aoc president returned to the us the boycott movement has collapsed but my newspaper is puzzled no its astonished that brundage could have arrived at the conclusions he did the american ambassador mr dodd the chief consul mr messersmith and the vice consul mr geist have all written to my government expressing their utter dismay at the presidents report and reminding it of their own report sent to the state department last year which highlighted the systematic exclusion of jews from german sports clubs brundage hes the president of the american olympic committee said hedda interrupting redundantly hes a bigot said mrs charalambides becoming angrier and an antisemite youd have to be to ignore whats happening in this country the many instances of open racial discrimination the signs in the parks in the public baths the pogroms pogroms i frowned surely thats an exaggeration i havent heard of any pogroms this is berlin not odessa in july four jews were murdered by ss men in hirschberg hirschberg i sneered thats in czechoslovakia or poland i forget which its troll country not germany its the sudetenland said mrs charalambides the people there are ethnic germans well dont tell hitler i said or hell want them back look mrs charalambides i dont agree with whats happening in germany but is it really any worse than whats happening in your own country the signs in the parks in the public baths the lynchings and i hear its not just negroes who get strung up by white people mexicans and italians also go carefully in certain parts of the united states and i dont recall anyone suggesting a boycott of the los angeles games in youre well informed herr gunther she said and right of course as a matter of fact i wrote an article about just such a lynching i saw in georgia in but im here and im jewish and my newspaper wants me to write about whats happening in this country and thats what i intend to do well good for you i said i hope you can change the aocs mind id like to see the nazis take a blow to their prestige especially now that weve started spending money on it and id love it of course if that austrian clown got some egg on his face but i fail to see what any of this has to do with me im a hotel detective not a press attaché hedda adlon opened a silver cigarette box the size of a small mausoleum and pushed it toward me there were english cigarettes on one side of the box and turkish on the other it looked like gallipoli in there i chose the winning sideat least in the dardanelles and let her light me the cigarette just like the service was better than i was used to i looked hopefully at the decanters on the sideboard but hedda adlon didnt drink much herself and probably thought i felt the same way about the stuff apart from that she was doing a fine job of making me look nice after all shed had plenty of practice doing it herr behlert told me what happened when you went to the alex said hedda about that poor jewish man and how the police are refusing to investigate his death because of his race mmmhmm apparently you thought he might have been a boxer mmmhmm neither of them was smoking not yet perhaps they hoped to make me lightheaded the turkish cigarette in my mouth was strong enough but i had the feeling i was going to need more than one to go along with whatever it was they wanted from me noreen charalambides said i was thinking that the dead mans story might be the basis of an interesting article in my newspaper in the same way i wrote about that lynching in georgia it occurred to me that the dead man might have been murdered by the nazis because he was jewish it also occurred to me that there might be an important sports angle that could tie his story in with the olympics did you know that the german boxing federation was the first german sports organization to exclude jews it doesnt surprise me boxings always been an important sport to the nazis oh i didnt know that sure the sa has been punching people in the face since before those beerhall brawlers always liked a good fight especially after schmeling became world champion of course when he went and lost the title to max baer that didnt exactly do the cause of jewish boxers in germany any favors mrs charalambides looked at me blankly i guessed that her remark about the german boxing federation had probably emptied the spit bucket of what she knew about the sweet science max baer is half jewish i explained oh i see herr gunther im sure you must have already considered the possibility that the dead manlets call him fritzthat fritz was a member of a gym or a sporting association and was expelled because he was jewish who knows what happened after that i hadnt considered the possibility at all id been too busy thinking about what might happen to me but now that i did what she said made some sense still i wasnt about to admit that not yet not while these two wanted something from me i was wondering said mrs charalambides i was wondering if you might care to help me find out some more about fritz kind of like a private investigator i speak pretty good german as you can see but i dont know my way around this city berlin is a bit of a mystery to me i shrugged if all the world is a stage then most of berlin is just beer and sausage and the mustard thats my problem im afraid if i go around asking questions on my own ill run into a large dollop of gestapo and get myself kicked out of germany there is that possibility you see i also plan to interview someone on the german olympic organizing committee von tschammer und osten diem or possibly lewald did you know hes a jew i wouldnt like them to find out what im about until its too late for them to stop me she paused naturally id pay you a fee for helping me i was about to remind them that i already had a job when hedda adlon took over the sales pitch ill clear it with my husband and with herr behlert she said herr muller can cover for you he resigned i said but theres a fellow in the juvenile section at the alex who can probably use the overtime name of stahlecker ive been meaning to give him a call please do hedda nodded id count it as a personal favor herr gunther she said i dont want mrs charalambides to come to any harm and it seems to me that having you alongside her is the best way of ensuring her safety i toyed with the idea of suggesting her safety might be better enhanced by forgetting the whole idea but the prospect of spending time with noreen charalambides was not an unattractive one id seen comet tails that were less attractive shes determined to do this regardless of what you decide added hedda reading half of my mind so dont waste your breath herr gunther ive already tried to dissuade her but shes always been a stubborn woman mrs charalambides smiled you can borrow my car of course it was clear they had the whole thing worked out between them and all i had to do was go along with it i wanted to ask about the fee but neither of them seemed inclined to return to the subject thats the thing about people with money its only the absence of money that ever makes it seem relevant like having a sable coat the sable probably paid no attention to it until the day it wasnt there of course id be delighted to help in any way i can frau adlon if thats what you want i kept my eyes on my employer while i said this i didnt want hedda thinking that my delight in her friends glamorous company might be anything other than rhetorical not when her friend was so very beautiful not when my own excitement at the proximity of her person seemed to me so very obvious i felt like a porcupine in a room full of toy balloons mrs charalambides crossed her legs and it was like someone striking a match to hell with the gestapo i thought its me gunther she needs protection from its me who wants to strip her naked and to stand her in front of me and then think of some extra things she can do with her sweet behind than only sitting on it just the idea of being alone in a car with her put me in mind of a novice father confessor in a convent populated with nuns who were exchorus girls mentally i slapped myself across the mouth a couple of times and then once more to make sure i really got the message this woman is not for the likes of you gunther i told myself youre not even going to dream about her shes a married woman and shes your employers oldest friend and youre going to sleep with hermann goering before you lay a finger on her of course as samuel johnson reminds us sex is usually what happens when youre busy resurfacing the autobahn with good intentions perhaps it loses something in the translation but it was true enough in my case hedda adlons car was a mercedes sskthe type of car i never expected ever to drive k stood for short but with its enormous fenders and six external cylinders the white sports car looked about as short as a castle drawbridge and was just as hard to handle like any other car it had four tires and a steering wheel but there the similarity ended starting the supercharged sevenliter engine was like turning the prop for manfred von richthofen and only the addition of twin millimeter machine guns could have made it any louder the car drew attention like a spotlight in a colony of stagestruck moths undeniably it was exhilarating to drive the cari gained a new admiration for heddas abilities behind the wheel to say nothing of her husbands willingness to indulge his younger wife with expensive toysbut it was of less use for private investigation work than a pantomime horse at least a pantomime horse would have provided two people with a sort of anonymity and i might have appreciated the intimate practicalities of bringing up the rear behind mrs charalambides we used the car for a day and then gave it back and thereafter borrowed herr behlerts rather more discreet w berlin s wide roads were almost as busy as the sidewalks trams rattled up the center their steady clockwork progress invigilated by whitesleeved traffic policemen who prevented cars and taxis from cutting in front of them like so many potbellied linesmen in a metropolitan football match with the traffic cops whistles the car klaxons and the bus horns the road system was almost as noisy as a football match too and the way berliners drove you might have believed they thought someone stood a good chance of winning things looked calmer inside the trams sobersuited clerks faced men in uniform like two delegations signing a peace treaty in a french siding but the injustices of the armistice and the depression already seemed a long way behind us the citys famous air was thick with the smell of gasoline and the smell of blooms from the baskets of the many flower women not to mention a growing selfconfidence germans were good about themselves again at least those of us who were properly noticeably german like the eagle on the kaisers helmet do you ever think of yourself as aryan mrs charalambides asked me as more german than the jews i hardly wanted to tell her about my aryan transfusion for one thing i hardly knew her for another it seemed rather a shameful thing to tell someone who as far as i was aware was one hundred percent jewish so i shrugged and said a german is a man who can feel enormously proud of being a german while wearing a pair of tight leather shorts in other words the whole idea is ridiculous does that answer your question she smiled hedda said you had to leave the police because you were a wellknown social democrat i dont know about well known if i had been well known things would be different for me now i guess these days you recognize a man who was a prominent social democrat by the arrows on his pajamas do you miss being a policeman i shook my head but you were a policeman for more than ten years did you always want to be a policeman maybe i dont know when i was a little boy i used to play cops and robbers on the green outside our apartment building and i wasnt sure which i enjoyed being most a cop or a robber anyway i told my father that when i grew up i was probably going to be a cop or a robber and he said why not be like most cops and do both i grinned he was a respectable man but he didnt much like the police no one did i wouldnt say we lived in a tough neighborhood but when i was growing up we still called a story with a happy ending an alibi for several days we doodled our way across a street map of berlin with me telling her jokes and keeping her amused while we went visiting the citys gyms and sporting clubs and i showed around the photograph of fritz from the police file richard bömer had left with me its true fritz wasnt looking his best on account of the fact that he was dead but no one seemed to recognize him maybe they didnt at that but it was hard to tell given their greater interest in mrs charalambides a welldressed beautiful woman visiting a berlin gym wasnt unheard of but it was unusual i tried to tell her that i might get more out of the men in these places if she stayed in the car but she wasnt having it mrs charalambides wasnt the kind of woman you told to do anything very much if i do what you say she said how am i going to get my story i might have agreed with her except for the fact that it was always the same threeword story we came upon no jews allowed i felt sorry for mrs charalambides seeing that kind of thing whenever we went inside a gym she didnt show it but i guessed it might be upsetting for her the tgym was the last place on my list with the benefit of hindsight it ought to have been the first in the heart of west berlin just south of the zoological garden station is the kaiser wilhelm memorial church with its many spires of differing heights it looks more like the castle of the swan knight lohengrin than any place of religious worship grouped around the church were cinemas dance halls cabarets restaurants smart shops and at the western end of the tauentzienstrasse sandwiched between a cheap hotel and the kaufhaus des westens was the tgym i parked the car got mrs charalambides out and then turned to gaze in the kadewes shop window this is a pretty good department store i said no oh it is the restaurants good too i mean no im not going shopping while you go in that gym how about you go in the gym and i go shopping theres a mark on this tie im wearing then youd hardly be doing your job you dont know much about women if you think im not coming into the gym with you who said i know anything about women i shrugged the one thing i know for sure about women is that they walk along the street with their arms folded men dont do that not unless theyre queer you wouldnt be doing your job and i wouldnt pay you how about that im glad you mentioned that mrs charalambides how much are you paying me we never actually agreed on a fee tell me what you think would be fair thats a difficult one ive not had much practice at being fair fairs a word i use for whats on a barometer or perhaps to describe a maiden whos in distress why dont you think of me like that and then suggest a price because if i ever did think of you like that then id have to charge you nothing at all i dont recall lohengrin asking elsa for ten marks a day maybe he should have done then he might not have left her true well then ten marks a day plus expenses it shall be she smiled enough to let me know that her dentist loved her and then took my arm she could have taken the other one to match and i wouldnt have objected not that ten marks a day had anything to do with it just being near enough to smell her and get the odd snapshot of her garters when she climbed out of behlerts car was payment enough we turned away from the departmentstore window and went along to the tgym door the place is owned by an exboxer called the terrible turk people call him the turk for short and because they dont want to hurt his feelings he hurts people who hurt his feelings i never used to come to this place very much because it was the kind of gym that was more popular with businessmen and actors than with berlins rings rings what are they nothing to do with the olympics thats for sure the rings are what we berliners call the criminal fraternities that more or less used to run this city during the weimar republic there were three main rings the big the free and the free alliance all of them were officially registered as benevolent societies or sports clubs some of them were registered as gyms and everyone used to pay them tribute doormen bootblacks prostitutes toilet attendants newspaper vendors flower sellers you name it all of it backed up by muscle from a gym the rings still exist but they themselves have to pay up now to a new gang in town a gang with more muscle than anyone the nazis mrs charalambides smiled and tightened her grip on my arm which was the first time i realized her eyes were as blue as an ultramarine panel in an illuminated manuscript and just as eloquent she liked me that much was obvious how have you stayed out of prison she asked by not being honest i said and pushed open the tgyms door i never yet walked through the door of a boxing gym that didnt remind me of the depression mostly it was the smell and a fresh coat of pukegreen paint and a grimy open window did nothing to hide that like every other gym wed been inside that week the tgym smelled of physical hardship of high hopes and low disappointments of urine and cheap soap and disinfectant and above all of sweat sweat on the ropes and on the hand wraps sweat on the heavy bags and on the focus mitts sweat on the towels and on the head protectors a valleyshaped stain on a boxing poster for a forthcoming fight at the bock brewery might have been sweat too but rising damp looked a better bet than any of the musclebound prospects who were sparring or working highspeed bags in the main ring a man with a face like a medicine ball was washing some blood off the canvas floor in a little office in front of an open door a neanderthal type who might have been a cornerman was showing a fellow troglodyte how to use a bruising iron blood and iron bismarck would have loved the place two new things about the tgym since i was last there were signs on the wall next to the poster one read under new management the other germans defend yourselves jews not welcome that would seem to cover pretty much everything i said looking at the signs i thought you said this place was owned by a turk she said no he just called himself a turk hes german correction said a man walking toward me hes a jew the man was the neanderthal id seen beforea little shorter than i had supposed but as broad as a farm gate he was wearing a white rollneck white gym slacks and white gym shoes but his eyes were small and as black as two lumps of coal he looked like a mediumsized polar bear that explains the sign i suppose i said to nobody in particular and then to the nobody in the rollneck hey primo did the turk sell the place or did someone just steal it off him im the new owner said the man lifting his belly into his chest and poking a jaw as big as a toilet seat toward me well i guess you answered my question primo i didnt catch your name gunther bernhard gunther and this is my aunt hilda are you a friend of solly mayers who i guess you answered my question solly mayer was the turks real name i was hoping he could help me to identify someone thats all someone who used to be a fighter like the turk ive got a photograph here i took the picture of fritz out of the file and showed it to the rollneck maybe youd care to take a look at it yourself primo to give him credit he looked at the photograph as if he really was trying to help i know hes not looking his best when this was taken hed spent several days floating in the canal are you a cop private still looking at the picture he started to shake his head are you sure we think he might have been a jewish fighter he handed the picture back immediately floating in the canal you say thats right aged about thirty forget it if your floater was a jew then im glad hes dead that sign on the wall isnt for show you know snooper no itd be a strange kind of sign that isnt for show dont you think i slipped the picture back in the file and handed it to mrs charalambides just in case rollneck had the look of a man who was building up steam to hit someone and that someone was me we dont like jews and we dont like the kind of people who would waste other peoples time looking for them and by the way i dont like you calling me primo neither i grinned back at him and then at mrs charalambidesill lay you good money that the president of the aoc never came in this dump i said is he another dirty jew i think wed better leave said mrs charalambides maybe youre right i said it does smell kind of bad in here the next second he took a swing at me with his right but i was ready for it and his scarred fist whistled past the tip of my ear like a hitler salute gone awry he ought to have used the jab firsttested me out with it before throwing the kitchen sink my way now i knew everything there was to know about himas a fighter anyway the man was made for the corner not the ring when id been a criminal commissar id had a sergeant who was quite an accomplished pugilist and hed taught me one or two things enough to stay out of harms way half of winning any fight is not getting hit the punch that had put august krichbaum on a slab had been a lucky punch or an unlucky one depending on the way you looked at it for that reason i hoped i could avoid hitting this man harder than he probably needed to be hit he swung again and missed again so far i was doing just fine meanwhile mrs charalambides had the good sense to take several steps back and look embarrassed that was how it seemed to me anyway his third punch connected but only just like a flat stone landing on the surface of a lake at the same time he growled something that sounded like jew lover and for a moment i thought he might actually be right i was damned if mrs charalambides wasnt very lovable indeed and it angered me that she should have to witness this closeup display of rabid antisemitism i was also feeling a certain obligation to the small crowd that had stopped what they were doing in the gym to see what happened next so i let go with a left jab to primos nose it brought him up short as if hed found a scorpion in his nightshirt pocket a second demoralizing jab and then a third rocked his head on his shoulders like an old teddy bears by now there was blood on his face where his nose had been and seeing my client head for the door i resolved to roll the credits and i hit him just a little too hard with my right too hard for my fist that is even as primo was going down like a telegraph pole i was shaking my hand it already showed a degree of swelling meanwhile something hit the floor of the gym like a coconut falling off a dockers hoisthis head probablyand the fight such as it was had ended for a moment i stood over my latest victim like the colossus at rhodes but i might as easily have looked like the outsized doorman at the rio rita bar down the street there was a short murmur of approval not for my triumph but for the delivery of a wellexecuted hook and still flexing my hand i knelt down anxiously to see what damage i had caused another man got there before me it was the man with the face like a medicine ball is he all right i asked genuinely concerned hell be fine was the reply you just knocked some sense into him thats all give him a couple of minutes hell be telling us all how you caught him with a lucky one he took hold of my hand and looked at it sure its some ice youll be needing on that handle and no mistake here come with me but make it quick before that idiot comes around frankels the boss here i followed my samaritan into a small kitchen where he opened a refrigerator and then handed me a canvas bag full of ice cubes keep your hand in there for as long as you can bear it he ordered thanks i put my hand in the bag he shook his head you were looking for the turk you said i nodded hes not in any trouble is he in the corner of his mouth was a tenpfennig lilliput which he now removed and inspected critically not from me i just wanted him to look at a picture and see if he recognizes the guy yeah i saw the mug familiar but i couldnt fix him he thumped the side of his head as if trying to dislodge something im a bit punchy these days memorys all screwed up sollys your man for the memory he used to know every fighter that ever put on a pair of german gloves and plenty others besides it was a shame what happened here when the nazis announced that new law of theirs forbidding jews from all sporting clubs solly had no choice but to sell and because he had to sell he had to take what he was offered by that bastard frankel which wasnt even enough to cover what he owed the bank these days he doesnt have a pot to piss in finally i could bear the cold no longer and withdrew my hand from the bag of ice hows the hand he put the cigar back in his mouth and took a look still swollen i said with pride probably i hit him harder than i should have done at least thats what this hand says nonsense you hardly hit him at all big fellow like you if youd put your shoulder into it you could have broke his jaw maybe but relax he had it coming only no one thought it would be giftwrapped so neatly a real sweet punch thats what it was you dropped him with my friend you should take it up the fight game i mean fellow like you could make a real go of it with the right trainer of course me perhaps you might even make some money doing it thanks but no thanks making money might take away the fun of it im strictly an amateur when it comes to hitting people and thats the way i want it to stay besides while the nazis are around ill always be second best got that right he grinned it doesnt look broken might feel sore for a couple of days though he gave me my hand back where does solly live these days the man looked sheepish it used to be here in a couple of rooms above the gym but when he lost this place he lost his home as well the last i heard of the turk he was living in a tent in the grunewald forest along with some other jews whove lost out under the nazis but that was six maybe nine months ago so he might not still be there he shrugged then again where else can he go its not like theres any jewish welfare agency in this country is there and these days the salvation armys almost as bad as the sa i nodded and handed back the ice bag thanks mister give him my regards if you see him the names buckow like the town but uglier i found mrs charalambides standing in front of the kadewe staring intently at a new bosch gasengine washing machine with a builtin wringerroller she wasnt the kind of woman i could ever imagine using a washing machine she probably thought it was a phonograph it looked a lot like a phonograph you know when reason fails a fist comes in very handy i said she met the reflection of my eyes in the window glass for a moment and then stared some more at the washing machine maybe we should buy it so that fellow in the gym can wash his mouth i offered feebly her mouth stayed tight as if she were trying not to spill what was really on her mind i turned my back on the window lit a cigarette and stared across wittenbergplatz this used to be a civilized place where people always behaved with courtesy and politeness well most of the time but its people like him who make me remember that berlin is just an idea that a polabian slav had in a swamp i snatched the cigarette from my mouth and stared up at the blue sky it was a beautiful day hard to believe on a day like this goethe had his own theory about why the sky is blue he didnt believe in newtons idea that light is a mixture of colors goethe thought it was something to do with the interaction of white light and its opposite darkness i puffed hard for a moment plenty of darkness in germany eh maybe thats why the sky is so blue maybe thats why they call this hitler weather because it contains so much darkness i laughed at my own idea but i was babbling you know you really should see the grunewald forest at this time of year in the autumn its very beautiful i thought we might take a drive out there now as it happens i also think it would be very useful for your newspaper story apparently the turk is living there now in a tent like a lot of other jews it seems either theyre just hardened naturalists or the nazis are planning to build another ghetto maybe both tell you what if youre willing to try naturalism for a while then so am i do you have to make a joke about everything herr gunther i threw away the cigarette only the things that really arent very funny mrs charalambides unfortunately thats pretty much everything these days you see im worried that if i dont make jokes then someone will mistake me for a nazi i mean have you ever heard hitler tell a joke no neither have i maybe id like him better if he did she continued staring at the washing machine it seemed she wasnt ready to smile yet she said you provoked him she shook her head i dont like fighting herr gunther im a pacifist this is germany mrs charalambides fighting is our favorite means of diplomacy everyone knows that but as it happens im a pacifist too as a matter of fact i was trying to turn the other cheek to that fellow just like it says in the bible and well you saw what happened i did it twice before he actually managed to put a hand on me after that i had no choice according to the bible anyway render unto caesar that which is caesars thats another thing it says so i did i rendered him unconscious hell no one likes violence less than i do she tried to keep her mouth steady but it wasnt working now besides i added you cant tell me that you didnt want to hit him yourself she laughed well all right i did he was a bastard and im glad you hit him all right but isnt it dangerous i mean you could get into trouble i wouldnt want to get you into any trouble i certainly dont need your help for that mrs charalambides i can manage it quite well on my own ill bet you can she smiled properly and took my injured hand it wasnt exactly tiny but it was still frozen youre cold she said you should see the other fellow id rather see the grunewald itll be my pleasure mrs charalambides we got back into the car and drove west along the kurfürstendamm mr charalambides i said after a minute or two is a greek american and a famous writer much more famous than i am at least in america not so much here hes a far better writer than i am at least thats what he tells me tell me about him nick when youve said hes a writer youve said all there is to know about him except maybe his politics hes quite active in the american left right now hes in hollywood trying to write a script and hating every minute of it its not that he hates the movies or even the studios its just that he hates being away from new york which is where we met about six years ago since then weve had three good years and three bad ones a bit like josephs prophecy to pharaoh except that none of the good and the bad are consecutive right now were going through one of the bad years nick drinks you see a man should have a hobby me i like model train sets its more than a hobby im afraid nicks made a whole career out of drinking he even writes about it he drinks for a year and then he gives up for a year youll think im exaggerating probably but im not he can stop drinking on january the first and start again on new years eve somehow he has the willpower to last for exactly three hundred sixtyfive days doing one or the other why to prove he can do it to make life more interesting to be bloodyminded nicks a complicated man theres never an easy explanation for anything he does least of all the simple things in life so now hes drinking no now hes sober thats what makes this a bad year for one thing i like a drink myself and i hate drinking alone and for another nicks a pain in the ass when hes sober and perfectly charming when hes drunk thats one of the reasons i came to europe to have a drink in peace right now im sick of him and im sick of myself do you ever get sick of yourself gunther only when i look in the mirror to be a policeman you need a good memory for a faceyour own most of all the job changes you in ways you dont expect after a while you can look in a mirror and see a man who looks no different from any of the scum youve put in jail but lately i also get sick when i tell someone the story of my life at halensee i turned south onto königsallee and pointed north out of the window theyre building the olympic stadium just up there i said beyond the sbahn railway to pichelsberg from here on in berlin is just forest and little lakes and exclusive villa colonies your friends the adlons used to have a place down here but hedda didnt like it so they bought a place near potsdam in the village of nedlitz they use it as a weekend place for extraspecial guests who want to escape the rigors of life at the adlon not to mention their wives or their husbands i suppose the price of employing a proper detective is his knowing everything there is to know about you she said take my word for it the price is a lot cheaper than that about eight kilometers southwest of halensee station i stopped in front of the prettily situated hubertus restaurant why are we stopping an early lunch and a little information when i said the turk was living in the grunewald i neglected to mention that the forest covers almost eight thousand acres if were ever going to find him were going to have to pick up some local knowledge the hubertus was something out of a lehar operetta an ivyclad cozy villa with a garden where a crown prince and his young baroness might stop for a quick knuckle of veal on their way to some grand but doomladen hunting lodge surrounded by a chorus of rather wellfed berliners we did our best to look like a leading man and his lady and to hide our disappointment at our waiters ignorance of the local area after lunch we drove farther to the south and west and asked at a village shop on the reitmeister see then at the post office in krumme lanke and finally at a garage in paulsborn where the attendant told us hed heard of some people living in tents along the left bank of the schlachtensee in a place that could best be reached by water so then we drove to beelitzhof and hired a motorboat to continue our search ive had a lovely day she said as the boat cut through the chill prussian blue waters even if we dont find what were looking for and then we did we saw their smoke first rising above the thick coniferous trees like a pillar of cloud it was a small village of armysurplus tents about six or seven of them during the great depression a large tent shantytown for the poor and unemployed had been built rather nearer home in the tiergarten i cut the engine and we approached carefully a small ragged group of men several of them obviously jewish came out of their shelters they were carrying clubs and slingshots if id been alone its possible i might have met with a more hostile reception but seeing mrs charalambides they appeared to relax a little you dont go looking for trouble wearing a set of pearls and a sable coat i tied up the boat and helped her to step ashore were looking for solly mayer she said smiling pleasantly do you know him no one spoke my married name is noreen charalambides she said but my maiden name is eisner im jewish im telling you that so you can be sure were not here to spy on you or to inform on you or on herr mayer im an american journalist and im in search of some information we think solly mayer might be able to help us so please dont be afraid we mean you no harm were not afraid of you said one of the men he was tall and bearded he wore a long black coat and a broadbrimmed black hat two long curls of hair were hanging off the sides of his forehead like lengths of seaweed we thought you might be hitler youth theres a troop of them camped around here somewhere and theyve been attacking us for fun thats terrible said mrs charalambides mostly we try to ignore it said the jew with the earlocks theres a limit to what the law allows us to do in the way of selfdefense but lately their attacks have been increasing in violence we just want to live in peace said another man i glanced around their encampment several rabbits hung off a pole next to a couple of fishing rods a large kettle stood steaming on a metal grate laid over a fire a line of washing was strung between two threadbare tents with winter fast approaching i didnt give much for their survival chances i felt cold and hungry just looking at them im solly mayer he was tallish with a short neck and like the rest of them heavily sunburned from months of living in the open air but i ought to have picked him out immediately most boxers have their noses broken horizontally but the turks had been stitched vertically as well it looked like a small pink upholstered cushion lying in the center of a wide expanse called his face i could imagine a nose like that doing a lot of things ramming a roman trireme breaking down a castle door finding a white truffle but i couldnt imagine anyone breathing through it mrs charalambides told him about the article she was planning to write and about her hope that the americans might still boycott the berlin olympiad you mean they havent done that already said the tall man with the beard the amis really mean to send a team im afraid so said mrs charalambides surely roosevelt cant ignore whats happening here said the tall man hes a democrat and what about all those jews in new york surely they wont let him ignore it i kind of think thats exactly what he wants to do at the moment she said you see among his opponents his administration already has a reputation of being too friendly with american jews he probably imagines that its better for him politically to have no position on the matter of whether or not the american team comes here in thirtysix my newspaper would like to change that position and so would i and you think said the turk that writing an article about some dead jewish boxer might help yes it think it might i handed the turk the photograph of fritz he settled a pair of glasses on what was laughingly called the bridge of his nose and holding the photo at arms length stared at it critically what did this fellow weigh he asked me when they fished him out of the canal about ninety kilos so maybe he was about nine or ten kilos lighter when he was in training said the turk a middleweight or maybe a light heavyweight he looked again and then smacked the picture with the back of his hand i dunno after theyve been in the ring for a while a lot of these pugs start to look the same what makes you think he was jewish to me he looks like a goy he was circumcised i said oh and by the way he was a southpaw too i see the turk nodded well maybe just maybe it could be that this is a fellow by the name of erich seelig a few years ago he was a light heavyweight champion from bromberg if it is him this is the jew who beat some pretty good fighters like rere de vos walter eggert and gypsy trollmann gypsy trollmann yeah you know him ive heard of him of course i said who hasnt whatever happened to that guy hes the doorman at the cockatoo last i heard and seelig whats his story we dont get the newspapers here friend everything i know is months old but what i heard was that some sa thugs turned up at his last fight a title defense against helmut hartkopp in hamburg they put the frighteners on him because he was jewish after that he disappears maybe he leaves the country maybe he stays and ends up in the canal who knows berlin is a long way from hamburg but not as far as bromberg thats in the polish corridor i think erich seelig you say maybe i never had to look at no corpse before unless it was in the ring of course howd you find me anyway fellow named buckow at the tgym he said to say hello bucky yeah hes all right is bucky i took out my wallet and thumbed a leaf at him but he wouldnt take it so i gave him all but one of my cigarettes and mrs charalambides did the same we were about to get back in the boat when something flew through the air and struck the man wearing the big hat he dropped to one knee with one bloody hand pressed to his cheek its those little bastards again spat the turk in the distance about thirty meters away i saw a collection of khakiclad youths now occupying a clearing in the forest a stone flew through the air narrowly missing mrs charalambides yiddos they chanted in a singsong sort of way yiddos ive had enough of this said the turk im going to sort those little bastards out no i said dont youll only land yourself in trouble let me handle it what can you do said mrs charalambides well see give me your room key my room key what for just do it she opened an ostrichleather bag and handed over the key it was attached to a big brass oval fob i threaded the key off the fob and handed it back then i turned and walked toward our attackers be careful she said another stone sailed over my head yiddos yiddos yiddos thats enough i shouted at them the next boy who throws a stone will be under arrest there were maybe twenty of them aged between ten and sixteen all blond with young hard faces and heads full of the nonsense they heard from nazis like richard bömer germanys future was in their hands and so were several large stones when i was about ten meters away i flashed the key fob in the palm of my hand hoping that from a distance it might pass for a policemans warrant disc i heard one of them gasp hes a copper and i smiled realizing my trick had worked they were just a bunch of kids after all thats right im a policeman i said still holding the disc out criminal commissar adlon from the westend praesidium and you can all count yourselves lucky that none of these other police officers you attacked are more seriously hurt police officers but they look like yids some of them do anyway what kind of cops go around dressed as yids secret policemen thats who i said and slapped the oldestlooking boy hard on his freckled cheek he started to cry these are gestapo officers on the lookout for a vicious killer whos been murdering boys in this forest thats right boys like you he cuts their throats and then dismembers their bodies the only reason it hasnt been in the papers is that we dont want to cause a panic and then you mugs come along and nearly blow the whole operation you cant blame us sir said another boy they looked like yids i slapped him too i thought it best they formed an accurate impression of what the gestapo was really like that way germany might have some kind of future after all shut up i snarled and dont speak unless youre spoken to got that the members of the hitler youth troop nodded sullenly i took hold of one by his neckerchief you what have you got to say for yourself sorry sir sorry you could have had that officers eye out ive a good mind to tell your fathers to leather the lot of you better still ive a good mind to have you all arrested and thrown into a concentration camp how would you like that eh please sir we didnt mean any harm i let the boy go by now all of them were looking contrite they were looking less like hitler youth and more like a group of schoolboys i had them where i wanted them now i might have been handling a squad back at the alex after all cops do all the same stupid juvenile things that schoolboys do except the homework all right well say no more about it this time and that goes for you too tell no one about this no one do you hear this is an undercover operation and the next time you feel inclined to take the law into your own hands dont not everyone who looks like a jew really is a jew remember that now go home before i change my mind and run you all in for assaulting a police officer and remember what i said theres a vicious murderer at work in these woods so youd best stay away from here until you read that hes been caught yes sir well do that sir i walked back to the little group of tents on the edge of the lake the light was beginning to fade the bullfrogs were opening up shop fish were jumping in the water one of the jews was already casting a line at a widening ripple the man with the hat wasnt badly injured he was smoking one of my cigarettes to steady his nerves what did you say to get rid of them asked the turk i told them all you were undercover cops i said and they believed you asked mrs charalambides of course they believed me but why she said its such an obvious lie and when did that ever stop the nazis i nodded at the boat get in i told her were leaving i fetched my last cigarette from behind my ear and lit it from a piece of firewood that the turk brought to me i think theyll leave you alone i told him i didnt exactly put the fear of god in them just the fear of the gestapo but to them that probably means more the turk laughed thanks mister he said and shook my hand i untied the rope and climbed into the boat alongside mrs charalambides thats one thing ive learned in the last few years i said starting the engine to lie like you mean it as long as you can convince yourself of something first no matter how outrageous theres no telling what you can get away with these days and i thought you had to be a nazi to be that cynical she said i think she meant it as a joke but it didnt feel good hearing her say it at the same time i knew of course that she was right i was a cynic in my defense i might have told her i was an excop and that being a cop is to know but one truth which is that everything youre told is a lie but that wouldnt have sounded good either she was right and it was no good brushing it off with another cynical remark about how the nazis probably put something in the water like bromide that made all of us germans believe the worst about everyone i was a cynic who wasnt that lived in germany not that i could have believed anything bad about noreen charalambides and i certainly didnt want her to think anything bad about me there wasnt a dog muzzle handy so i folded one lip under another to keep my mouth under control for a while and then pushed the throttle forward its one thing biting your enemies its quite another when it looks like you might bite your friends to say nothing of the woman you are falling for we returned the boat and got back into the car we drove east into berlin along streets full of silent people who probably wanted nothing to do with one another it had never been a particularly friendly city berliners are not known for their great hospitality but now it was like the town of hamelin after the children had left we still had the rats of course respectable men in wellbrushed felt hats and cakebox collars were scurrying home after yet another day spent trying respectably to ignore the uniformed and licensed louts who persisted in resting their dirty boots on the countrys best furniture bus conductors leaned precariously off their platforms so as to avoid any possibility of conversation with their passengers these days nobody wanted to speak his mind they didnt put that in baedeker at the taxi rank on the corner of leibnizstrasse the cabbies were putting up their checkered hoodsa sure sign that the weather was getting cooler it wasnt yet cold enough however to deter the trio of sa men bravely continuing with their vigilant boycott of a jewishowned jewelry store next to the synagogue on fasanenstrasse germans defend yourselves dont buy from jews buy only from german shops with their brown leather boots brown leather cross belts and brown leather faces and lit up by the green neon of the kurfürstendamm the three nazis looked prehistoric reptilian dangerous like a bask of hungry crocodiles that had escaped from the aquarium in the zoological gardens i felt vaguely coldblooded myself like i needed a drink are you sulking she asked sulking as in silent protest its the only kind thats safe these days anyway its nothing a drink cant fix i could use a drink myself only not at the adlon eh someone will ask me to do something if we go there as we neared the junction with joachimstaler strasse i pointed there the cockatoo bar is that one of your regular haunts gunther no but its someone elses someone you should speak to for your article oh who gypsy trollmann thats right i remember the turk said hes the doorman at the cockatoo didnt he and hes the one who fought erich seelig the turk didnt sound like he was one hundred percent positive that seelig is our fritz so perhaps trollmann can confirm it when you spend time in the ring with a fellow whos trying to hit you you probably get to know his face pretty well is he really a gypsy or is he just a gypsy the way solly mayer is a turk unfortunately for trollmann he is the real thing you see its not just the jews the nazis dont like its gypsies too and pansies and jehovahs witnesses and communists of course we mustnt forget the reds so far the reds have had it toughest of all i mean i havent yet heard of anyone whos been executed for being jewish i thought about repeating otto trettins story about the falling ax at plötzensee and rejected the idea since i was already going to have to tell her about gypsy trollmann i figured one sad story was all she could handle that evening stories certainly didnt come any sadder than gypsy trollmanns we were earlier than the main crowd at the cockatoo and this meant that rukelie as trollmann was known to those working at the club hadnt yet arrived no one causes trouble at seven oclock in the evening not even me some parts of the cockatoo were done up to look like a bar in french polynesia but for the most part it was velvet bucket chairs flock wallpaper and red lights like any other place in berlin the blueandgold bar was said to be the longest in the city but clearly only by those who didnt own a measuring tape or thought that it was a long way to tipperary the ceiling looked as if it had been iced like a wedding cake there were a dull cabaret a dance floor and a small orchestra that managed to dance around the nazi disapproval of decadent music by playing jazz as if it had been invented not by black men but by a church organist from brandenburg with nude dancing girls now strictly forbidden in all clubs the cockatoos gimmick was to have a parrot perched on every table this only served to remind everyone of another great advantage of having dancing girls they didnt shit on your dinner plate not unless they were anita berber anyway while i drank schnapps mrs charalambides sipped martinis like a geisha drinking tea and with as little obvious effect and i quickly formed the impression that it wasnt just a talent for writing she shared with her husband the woman managed her drink the way the gods could handle their daily dose of ambrosia so tell me about gypsy trollmann she said taking out her reporters notebook and pencil unlike the turk whos no more turkish than i am trollmann is a real gypsy a sinti thats like a subset of roma only dont ask me to explain how because im not bruno malinowski when we were still a republic the papers all made quite a thing out of trollmann being a gyppo and because he was also goodlooking not to mention an excellent fighter it wasnt long before he was doing great promoters couldnt get enough of the kid i shrugged i dont suppose hes older than about twentyseven even now anyway by the middle of last year he was ready for a shot at the german light heavyweight title and there being no other obvious candidates he was matched against adolf witt for the vacant belt here in berlin of course the nazis were hoping that aryan superiority would win out and that witt would beat his racially inferior opponent to a pulp that was one of the reasons they let him fight in the first place not that this stopped them from trying to fix the judges of course only they hadnt counted on the crowd who were so impressed by trollmanns heart and completely dominant display that there was a riot when the judges gave the fight to witt and the authorities were obliged to declare trollmann the winner after all the kid wept for joy unfortunately his happiness was shortlived six days later the german boxing federation stripped the kid of the title and his license on the grounds that his style of hitandrun boxing and his unmanly tears made him unfit to hold the belt by now her neat shorthand covered several pages of her notebook she sipped her drink and shook her head they took it off him because he cried it gets worse i said this is a very german story as you might expect the kid gets death threats poisonpen letters shit in his mailbox you name it his wife and kids are intimidated it gets so bad he makes her ask him for a divorce and change her name so that she and the kids can live in peace because trollmanns not beaten yet he still thinks he can box his way out of trouble reluctantly the german federation gives him a license to fight again on two conditions one is that he gives up the hitandrun style that made him such a great fighteri mean he was fast no one could lay a glove on him and the other condition was that his first fight would be against a much heavier opponent gustav eder they wanted to see the kid humiliated she said they wanted to see the kid get killed is what i said the two meet in july at the bock brewery here in berlin in order to send up the new racial restrictions trollmann turns up for the fight looking like a caricature of an aryan man with his body whitened with flour and his hair dyed blond oh lord you mean like some poor negro trying to disguise himself in order to escape a lynching kind of i suppose anyway the fight takes place and forced to abandon the style that had made him a champion trollmann stands toetotoe with eder and trades the heavier man punch for punch he takes a terrible beating until in round five hes battered into submission and loses the fight on a knockout after which hes never the same fighter again last i heard he was taking monthly fights against bigger stronger fellows and taking regular beatings just to make the payments to his wife she shook her head its a modern greek tragedy she said if you mean that there are not many laughs in it then youre right and for sure the gods deserve a kick in the ass or worse for letting shit like that happen to someone from what ive seen so far theyve got their work cut out in germany isnt that the point if theyre not there for us now then maybe theyre just not there at all i dont believe that bernie she said its bad for a playwright to believe that man is all there is no one wants to go to a theater to be told that especially now maybe now most of all could be i should start going to the theater again i said who knows it might restore my faith in human nature then again here comes trollmann so id best not build up my hopes even as i spoke i knew that if my faith in human nature had come with a bookmakers ticket then just laying eyes on trollmann again would have had me tearing it into pieces gypsy trollmann once as handsome as any leading man was now the caricature of a ringdamaged pug it was like clapping eyes on mr hyde immediately after a home visit from dr jekyll so grotesquely were his features coarsened by his many beatings his nose previously small and combative was now the size and shape of a sandbag on a poorly built redoubt and this seemed to have shifted his dark eyes to opposite sides of his head like something bovine his muchenlarged ears were entirely without contours and might have fallen onto his head from a pork butchers bacon slicer his mouth now seemed impossibly wide and when he stretched his scarred lips into a smile to reveal several missing teeth it was like sharing a joke with king kongs little brother the worst of it was his disposition which was sunnier than a picture wall in a school kindergarten as if he hadnt a care in the world trollmann picked up a seat as if it were a bread stick and put it down again with its back to our table we introduced ourselves mrs charalambides flashed him a smile that could have lit up a coal mine and then fixed him with blue eyes a persian cat would have envied trollmann kept on nodding and grinning as if we were his oldest and dearest friends considering the way the world had treated him until now perhaps we were to tell the truth i do remember you herr gunther youre a cop sure i remember now never tell the truth to a policeman rukelie thats how you get caught its true i used to be a cop only not anymore these days im the carpet creeper at the adlon hotel it seems the nazis dont like republicanminded cops any more than they like gypsy fighters hey you got that right herr gunther sure i remember you now you came to see me fight you was with another cop a cop who could fight a bit right heinrich grund sure i remember him he used to work out at the same gym as me right we came to see you fight paul vogel at the sportpalast here in berlin vogel yeah i won that fight on points he was a tough customer was paul vogel he looked at mrs charalambides and shrugged apologetically looking at me nowits hard to believe maam i knowbut i used to win a lot of fights in those days now they just want to use me as a punching bag you know put me up in front of someone for target practice i could beat some of these fellows too only they wont let me fight my own way he raised his fists and went through the motions of ducking and diving on the chair you know she nodded and laid her hand on top of his welders mitt youre a pretty lady maam isnt she pretty herr gunther thank you rukelie that she is i said i used to know a lot of pretty ladies on account of how i was a goodlooking guy for a fighter isnt that right herr gunther i nodded none better on account of the fact that i used to dance around so that none of these other fellows could land a glove on me see boxings more than just hitting people its about not getting hit too but them nazis dont want me to do that they dont like my style he sighed and a tear appeared in the corner of his bovine eye well its all over for me now as a professional fighter i guess i aint fought since march six defeats in a row i figure its time to hang up the gloves why dont you leave germany she asked if they wont let you fight your own way trollmann shook his head how could i leave my kids live here and my exwife i couldnt leave them behind besides it takes money to set up in a new place and i cant earn like i used to so i work here and sell fight tickets hey you want to buy some i got tickets for emil scholz against adolf witt at the spichernsaele november sixteenth should be a good fight she bought four after her remarks outside the tgym i wasnt sure she actually wanted to see a fight and i imagined it was her way of kindly putting some money in trollmanns pocket here she said handing them to me you look after them do you remember fighting a fellow named seelig i asked trollmann erich seelig sure i remember erich i remember all my fights its all the boxing i got now my memories i fought seelig in june and lost on points at the brewery sure i remember seelig how could i forget right he had a pretty rough time of it himself did erich just like me on account of the fact that hes jewish the nazis took his titles away and his license last i heard he fought helmut hartkopp in hamburg and won on points in february last year what happened to him she offered him a cigarette but he shook his head i dunno but he aint fighting in germany no more thats for a hundred percent i showed trollmann the picture of fritz and told him the circumstances of the mans death do you think perhaps this might be erich seelig this aint seelig said trollmann seelig is younger than me and younger than this guy was for sure who told you this was seelig the turk solly meyer that explains it the turk is blind in one eye detached retina you give him a chess set and he couldnt tell black from white dont get me wrong the turk is an okay guy but he dont see so good no more the place was filling up now trollmann waved at a girl on the opposite side of the bar for some reason she had pieces of silver paper in her hair all sorts of people waved at trollmann despite the best efforts of the nazis to dehumanize him he remained a popular man even the parrot on our table seemed to like trollmann and let him smooth its gray feathered breast without trying to take a piece out of his finger trollmann looked at the photograph again and nodded i know this guy and it aint trollmann howd you figure him for a fighter anyway i told him about the healed fractures on the knuckles of the dead mans little fingers and the burn mark on his chest and he nodded sagely youre a clever man herr gunther and you were right this guy is a pug name of isaac deutsch a jewish boxer sure you were right about that stop it said mrs charalambides youre going to make his head swell but she was writing now the pencil was moving across the page of her notebook with the sound of an urgent whisper trollmann grinned but kept on talking zak was in the same workers sports club as me the sparta back in hannover poor old zak somewhere at home i got me a photograph of all the fighters at the sparta the ones who were contenders anyway and zak is standing right in front of me poor guy he was a nice fellow and a pretty good fighter with a lot of heart we was never matched though i wouldnt have liked to have fought him not from fear you understand although he was plenty tough but because he was a real nice fellow his uncle joey used to train him and he looked like a prospect for the olympics until he got kicked out of the federation and the sparta he sighed and shook his head again so poor old zaks dead thats sad so he wasnt a professional fighter i said whats the difference asked mrs charalambides i groaned but patiently like he was talking to a little girl trollmann explained it to her he had a good kind way about him except for the memory of seeing him fight i might have had a hard time believing hed ever been a professional boxer zak he wanted a medal before he turned professional he said might have won one too if hed not been jewish which makes it ironic i suppose if ironic means what i think it means what do you think it means she asked like when theres a difference between what is supposed to happen to a man and what actually happens to him that covers it pretty well in this case she agreed like the fact that zak deutsch couldnt box at the olympics for germany because he was a jew but he ended up being a construction worker at pichelsberg helping to build the new stadium even though he wasnt supposed to be working there see only aryan germans are allowed to get jobs on the olympic construction site thats what i heard anyway and thats what i meant about it being ironic see because there are lots of jews working at the pichelsberg site i was going to have to work there myself before i got this job you see theres so much pressure to get the stadium finished in time that they cant afford to turn any ablebodied man away be he jew or gentile thats what i heard this is beginning to make some sense i said youve got a strange idea of sense herr gunther trollmann grinned his big toothy grin me i think its crazy me too murmured mrs charalambides what i meant was that im beginning to understand a few things i said but you are right too rukelie it is crazy i lit a cigarette during the war i saw a lot of stupid things men getting killed for no good reason the sheer waste of life and quite a bit of stupidity after the war as well but this business with the jews and the gypsies is just madness how else can you explain the inexplicable i been giving this some thought said trollmann a lot of thought and from what i seen in the fight game the conclusion i come to is this sometimes if you want to win a contest at all costs it helps to hate the other guy he shrugged roma people jewish people homos and commies the nazis need someone to hate thats all i guess youre right i said but it makes me worry if theres another war i worry what will happen to all these poor bastards the nazis dont like most of the way back to the adlon i was thinking about what we had learned gypsy trollmann had promised to mail me the sparta club photograph but i didnt doubt his identification of the dead man found floating in mühlendamm lock or his information about isaac deutschs having been a construction worker on the olympic stadium site say one thing do another that was typical of the nazis all the same pichelsberg was a long way from mühlendamm the opposite end of the city and nothing i had yet learned explained how deutsch had drowned in salt water you talk too much gunther i was thinking mrs charalambides what you must think of us we seem to be the only people in the world who are actively trying to live up to everyone elses worst impression of us please call me noreen charalambides is such a long name even in germany i dont know if i can do that now that youre my employer ten marks a day demands a certain amount of professional courtesy you can hardly go on calling me mrs charalambides if youre going to kiss me am i going to kiss you this morning you mentioned something about isaac newton which certainly encourages me to think you are oh hows that newton came up with three laws to describe the relationships between two bodies id say he might also have come up with a fourth if hed ever met me and you gunther youre going to kiss me all right theres absolutely no doubt about it you mean theres algebra and stuff to prove it pages of it impulse unbalanced force equal and opposite reaction between us weve got almost enough equations to cover a bedsheet then i guess theres no point in my trying to resist the laws of planetary motion noreen absolutely none at all in fact it would be best if you gave in to the impulse right now in case you put the whole damned universe out of joint i stopped the car pulled on the hand brake and leaned toward her for a moment she turned away hermanngoeringstrasse she said didnt it used to be called something else budapester strasse thats better i want to remember where it was you first kissed me i dont want that memory to include hermann goering she turned toward me expectantly and i kissed her hard her breath was charged with cigarettes and icecold liquor and lipstick and a little something special from inside her pants she tasted better than lightly salted butter on freshly baked bread i felt her eyelashes brush my cheeks like the wings of tiny hummingbirds and after a minute or so she began to breathe like a medium who was trying to get in touch with the spirit world maybe she did at that and keen to possess her whole body i pushed my left hand underneath her fur coat and let it slide awhile up and down her thigh and torso as if id been trying to generate static electricity noreen charalambides wasnt the only one who knew physics there was a thud as her handbag slid off her lap and hit the floor of the car i opened my eyes and drew away from her mouth gravity still works then i said the way my head feels i was beginning to wonder i guess newton knew a thing or two after all he didnt know everything i bet he didnt know how to kiss a girl like that thats because he never met a girl such as you noreen if he had he might have done something useful with his life like this i kissed her again only this time i put my whole back into it like i really meant what i was doing and maybe i did a lot of time had passed since id felt this way about a woman i glanced out of the window and seeing the name of the street i was reminded of what i had told myself the first time id talked to noreen back in hedda adlons apartment at the hotel that noreen was my employers oldest friend and that i was going to sleep with hermann goering before i ever laid a finger on her the way things were going it looked as if the prussian prime minister was in for a hermannsized surprise her tongue was in my mouth now alongside my heart and the misgivings i kept trying to swallow i was losing control but mostly of my left hand which was now under her dress and making itself familiar with her garter and the cool thigh it was stretched across only when the hand slipped into the secret space between her thighs did she move to arrest the wrist commanding it i let her move my hand away and then brought my fingers up to my mouth and licked them this hand i dont know what gets into it sometimes youre a man gunther thats what gets into it she took my fingers and brushed them with her lips i like you kissing me youre a good kisser if kissing was in the olympics youd be a medal prospect but i dont like to be hurried i like to be walked around the ring for a while before being mounted and dont even think of using the whip if you want to stay in the saddle im the independent sort gunther when i run itll be because my eyes are open and because i want to and i wont be wearing any blinkers if and when we reach the wire i might not be wearing anything at all sure i said i never figured you any other way no blinkers not even a tongue strap how do you feel about me giving you an apple sometimes i like apples she said just watch out you dont get your fingers bitten i let her bite me hard it was painful but i enjoyed it pain from her felt good like something primordial something that was always meant to be besides we both knew that when our clothes were lying on the floor beside our sweating naked bodies i was going to pay her back in kind thats always how it is between a man and a woman a man takes a woman a woman gets taken it isnt always marked by a due consideration of what is fair and decent and well mannered sometimes human nature can leave you looking just a little shamefaced i drove us back to the hotel and parked the car as we went through the door and into the entrance hall we met max reles who was on his way out somewhere he was accompanied by gerhard krempel and dora bauer and they were all wearing evening clothes reles spoke to noreen first and in english which left me with the opportunity to say something to dora good evening fräulein bauer i said politely herr gunther you look lovely thank you she smiled warmly and i really mean that im very grateful to you for helping me to get this job it was my pleasure fräulein behlert tells me youre now working almost exclusively for herr reles max keeps me very busy yes i dont think ive ever done so much typing not even when i was at odol but right now were off to the opera to see what she smiled ingenuously i havent the faintest idea i dont know anything about opera me neither i expect i shall hate it but max wants me to take some dictation during the interval and what about you herr krempel what do you do during the interval murder a good tune in the absence of anything else do i know you he asked hardly looking at me his whispered growl of a voice sounded as if it had been rubbed down with sandpaper and then marinated in burning kerosene no you dont but i know you krempel was tall with flyingbuttress shoulders and dead black eyes thick yellow hair grew on top of a head that was as big as a galápagos tortoise and probably about as quick his mouth resembled an ancient scar on a footballers knees fingers like scrapyard grapples were already bunching into fists the size of wrecking balls he looked like a real thugs thug and if the german labor front included a section for employees in the field of intimidation and coercion then gerhard krempel might reasonably have expected to be elected as a workers representative you must be confusing me with someone else he said stifling a yawn my mistake i expect its those evening clothes i thought you were an sa bullyboy max reles must have caught that because he scowled at me and then at noreen is this dishwasher giving you any trouble he asked her speaking german now for my benefit no she said herr gunthers been very helpful really reles chuckled must be his birthday or something how about it gunther did you take a bath today krempel thought that was hilarious tell me did you find my chinese box yet or the girl who stole it the matter is in the hands of the police sir im sure theyre doing all they can to bring it to a satisfactory conclusion thats very reassuring tell me gunther what kind of a cop were you anyway before you started peeping through hotel keyholes you know ill bet you were one of those cops who wear that stupid leather helmet with the flat top is that because all of you kraut cops have flat heads or because some of you do a little moonlighting carrying trays of fish at friedrichshain market i think its both said krempel you know in the states some people call coppers flatfoots because a lot of them have flat feet said reles but i think i like flatheads a whole lot better we aim to please sir i said patiently ladies gentlemen as i turned to leave i even tipped my hat it seemed more diplomatic than punching max reles on the nose and a lot less likely to leave me without a job enjoy your evening fräulein bauer i strolled over behind the front desk where franz joseph the concierge was in conversation with dajos béla the leader of the hotel orchestra i checked my pigeonhole i had two messages one was from emil linthe informing me that his work was completed the other message was from otto trettin asking me to call him back urgently i picked up the phone and had the hotel operator connect me with the alex and then with otto who often worked late since he seldom worked early so whats the story in danzig i asked never mind that now he said remember that cop who got murdered august krichbaum sure i said making a fist and biting my knuckles calmly the witness is an excop seems like he reckons the killer is an excop too hes been going through the police files and has got himself a short list of suspects i heard that otto paused for a moment youre on the list bernie me i said as coolly as i was able how do you figure that maybe you did it maybe i did on the other hand maybe its a frame because i was a republican maybe admitted otto theyve framed people for less how long is the list i hear just ten men i see well thanks for the tip otto i thought youd want to know i lit a cigarette it happens i think ive got an alibi for when it happened but i hardly want to use him you see its the fellow on the jew desk at the gestapo the one who tipped me off about my grandmother if i mention him theyll want to know what i was doing at gestapo house and i might drop him in it a simple lie often saves a lot of timeconsuming truth i hardly wanted to put sand in ottos eye bath but i didnt seem to have much choice in the matter then its fortunate you were with me at the time of krichbaums murder said otto having a beer in the zum remember sure i remember we talked about you helping me with a chapter in my new book a case you once worked on gormann the strangler youd think i know all about it the number of times youve bored me with that story ill remember that thanks otto i breathed a sigh of relief trettins name and word still counted for something at the alex half a sigh anyway by the way he added your jewish stenographer ilse szrajbman had the guests chinese lacquer box all right she says she took it on an impulse because reles behaved like a shit and refused to pay what he owed for her work knowing reles i can easily believe that i tried to gather my trembling thoughts but why didnt she speak to the hotel manager about it why didnt she tell herr behlert she said its not so easy for a jew to complain about things or about a man who is as well connected as this max reles she told the danzig kripo that she was afraid of him so afraid that she was prepared to steal from him danzig is a long way from berlin bernie besides it was an impulse thing like i said and she regretted it the danzig kripo is being unusually sensitive about this otto why as a favor to me not the jewess a lot of these local cops want to come and work crime in the big city you know that im a somebody to these morons anyway i got the box back and to be frank i cant see what all the fuss was about ive seen more obviouslooking antiques in woolworths what do you want me to do with it perhaps you could drop it by the hotel sometime id rather not come by the alex unless im asked to last time i was there your old pal liebermann von sonnenberg collared me for a favor he told me although from the sound of things its me who might need to ask him for a favor its me you owe not him bernie ill try to remember that you know otto theres a lot more to this thing with max reles than some stenographer trying to get even with her boss just a few weeks ago that chinese box was in a museum here in berlin next thing reles has the box and its being used by him to bribe some ami on their olympic committee with the full knowledge of the ministry of the interior please bear in mind i have sensitive ears bernie there are things i want to know but there are just as many things i dont want to know i put the phone down and looked at franz joseph his real name was gustav but with his bald head and muttonchop whiskers the adlon concierge bore a marked resemblance to the old austrian emperor franz joseph and was so nicknamed by almost everyone in the hotel hey franz joseph did you get herr reles tickets for the opera tonight reles the american in suite yes alexander kipnis is singing gurnemanz in parsifal the tickets were hard to get even for me kipnis is a jew you see these days its not often you can hear a jew singing wagner i imagine kipnis has one of the least disagreeable voices to be heard in german right now they say hitler doesnt approve where is this opera the german opera house on bismarckstrasse can you remember the seat numbers only i need to find herr reles and give him a message the curtain goes up in an hour he has a box on the grand tier stage left you make that sound like a big deal franz it is its the same box hitler has when he goes to the opera but not tonight obviously i walked back into the entrance hall behlert was speaking to two men i hadnt ever seen them before but i knew they were cops for a start there was behlerts manner to identify them he looked like he was speaking to two of the most interesting men in the world and then there was theirs they looked indifferent to almost everything he was saying except the part about me and i knew that much because behlert pointed my way another reason i knew they were cops was their thick coats and their heavy boots and their body odor during the winter berlin cops always dressed and smelled as if they were in the trenches backed by behlerts rolling eyeballs they came toward me flashing their warrant discs and sizing me up with narrowed eyesalmost as if they hoped i was going to make their day and run for it that way they could have had a little fun trying to shoot me i could hardly blame them a lot of berlin crime gets cleaned up that way bernhard gunther yes inspectors rust and brandt from the alex sure i remember you two were the detectives liebermann von sonnenberg assigned to investigate the death of herr rubusch in werent you say what did he die of anyway i never did find out cerebral aneurysm said one aneurysm eh never can tell with that kind of thing can you one minute youre hopping around like a flea and the next youre lying on the floor of the trench looking up at the sky wed like to ask you a few questions down at the alex sure i followed them outside into the cold night air is that what this is about youll find out when we get to the alex said rust bismarckstrasse was still called bismarckstrasse and ran all the way from the western tip of the tiergarten to the eastern edge of the grunewald the german opera house formerly called the municipal opera house was about halfway along the street on the north side and was comparatively recent in its design and construction not that id ever really noticed it much before at the end of a working day i need something a little less bogus than the sight of a lot of very fat people pretending to be heroes and heroines my idea of a musical evening is the kempinski waterland chorus a revue of buxom girls in short skirts playing ukuleles and singing vulgar songs about bavarian goatherds i was hardly in the mood for anything that took itself as seriously as opera in german not after a couple of uncomfortable hours spent at the alex waiting to be asked questions about the cop i had killed and then for them to find otto trettinhe was in the zumand have him corroborate my story when finally they let me go i wondered if that was the end of it but somehow i suspected it was not with the result that i hardly felt like celebrating all in all it had been quite an experience which is often the lesson you get from life when you need it least in spite of that i was still keen to see who max reles might be sharing a box with and arriving at the opera in time for the interval i bought a standing pass that afforded me an excellent view of the stage and more important the occupants of hitlers usual box on the grand tier before the lights went down i was even able to borrow a pair of opera glasses from a woman sitting close to where i was standing so that i might take a closer look at them hes not in the house tonight said the woman observing where my attention was directed who the leader that much was obvious but it was clear that there were others in the box guests of max reles who were senior figures in the nazi party one of these was a man in his late forties with silver hair and thick dark eyebrows he wore a brown militarystyle tunic with several decorations including an iron cross and a nazi armband a white shirt a black tie brown riding breeches and leather jackboots i handed back the opera glasses i dont suppose you know who the party leader is the woman peered through the glasses and then nodded thats von tschammer und osten the reich sports leader yes and the general standing behind him von reichenau she had answered without a moments hesitation the bald one is walther funk from the propaganda ministry im impressed i said with genuine admiration the woman smiled she wore spectacles not a beauty but she looked intelligent in an attractive way its my job to know who these people are she explained im a photographic editor at the berlin illustrated news still scrutinizing the box she shook her head i dont recognize the tall one though the one with the face like a blunt instrument or for that matter the rather attractive girl who seems to be with him they seem to be the host and hostess but either shes too young for him or hes too old for her im not quite sure which it is hes an american i said his name is max reles and the girl is his stenographer you think so i borrowed the opera glasses and looked again i could see no sign that dora bauer was anything more to reles than a secretary she had a notepad in her hand and seemed to be writing something then again she was looking extremely attractive and hardly like a stenographer the necklace she was wearing glittered like the huge electric chandelier above our heads as i watched she put down the pad and picking up a bottle of champagne proceeded to fill everyones glass another woman appeared von tschammer und osten drained his glass and then held it out for another refill reles lit a large cigar the general laughed at his own joke and then leered at the second womans cleavage this was worth the cost of a set of opera glasses on its own it looks like quite a party i said it might be if this wasnt parsifal i looked at her blankly parsifal lasts for five hours the lady with the glasses looked at her watch and there are still three hours of it left to go thanks for the tip i said and left i returned to the adlon borrowed a passkey from the desk and climbed the stairs to suite the rooms smelled strongly of cigars and cologne the closets were full of tailormade suits and the drawers with neatly folded shirts even his shoes were handmade by a company in london just looking at his wardrobe i felt i was in the wrong job then again i didnt have to look at a pair of shoes owned by max reles to know that whatever the american did for a living it was obviously paying him very well the way i imagined everything did he had that look about him a selection of gold watches and rings on his bedside table only served to underline the impression of a man who was almost indifferent to his personal security or the adlons matterhornhigh room rates the torpedo on the table in the window had a cover on it but the alphabetical accordion file on the floor underneath told me it was getting plenty of use the thing was full of correspondence to and from construction companies gas companies timber companies rubber companies plumbers electricians engineers carpentersand from all over germany too everywhere from bremen to würzburg some of the letters were in english of course and several of these were addressed to the avery brundage company in chicago which seemed like it ought to have meant something to me but didnt i raked through the wastepaper basket and smoothed out a few carbon copies to read before folding these and putting them in my pocket i told myself max reles would hardly miss some correspondence from his wastepaper basket although in truth i hardly cared if on the face of it reles was helping to fix olympic contracts in a germany governed by an ill assortment of murderers and fraudsters i could see no point in trying to persuade an understandably reluctant otto trettin to take on a case that probably involved senior nazi officials i was looking for something more obviously criminal i had no real idea of just what this might amount to all the same i thought i might recognize this if ever i saw it of course i was motivated by not much more than my own dislike and distrust of the man these were feelings that had always served me well enough in the past at the alex we always said that an ordinary cops job is to suspect the man who everyone else thinks is guilty but a detectives job is to suspect the man who everyone else thinks is innocent something caught my eye the idea of max reles having such a thing as a ratchet screwdriver in a suite at the adlon seemed a little out of place it was lying on the window ledge in the bathroom i was about to conclude that it might have been left there by a maintenance man when i noticed what was written on the handle yankee no north bros mfg co phil penna usa reles must have brought the screwdriver from america but why the proximity of four screwheads in a marbletiled panel concealing the lavatory cistern seemed to command investigation and these were much easier to undo than perhaps they ought to have been with the panel removed i peered into the space underneath the cistern and saw a canvas bag i picked it up the bag was heavy i lifted it out of the cavity placed it on the lavatory seat and unlaced the neck while the ownership of firearms especially pistols was restricted in germany people with a legitimate reason to own one were permitted to do so and for a threemark fee a weapons license could easily be obtained from any magistrate a rifle a revolver even an automatic pistol could be owned quite legally by almost anyone but i didnt think there was a magistrate anywhere in the country who would have signed a permit for a thompson submachine gun with a drum magazine the bag also contained several hundred rounds of ammunition two colt semiautomatic pistols with rubberized grips and a folding switchblade inside the bag was another smaller leather bag holding five thick bundles of thousanddollar bills featuring a portrait of president cleveland and several thinner packets of german marks there was also a leather wallet containing about a hundred swiss gold francs and several dozen benzedrine inhalers still in their smith kline french boxes all of itespecially the chicago typewriterlooked like prima facie evidence that max reles was some kind of gangster i put everything back in the canvas bag returned it to the hiding place under the cistern and then replaced the tiled panel when everything was exactly as i had found it i slipped out of the suite and walked back along the corridor pausing at the foot of the stairs and wondering if i dared go up to and use the passkey to let myself into noreens suite for a moment i let my imagination throw me in the back of a fast car and run along the avus speedway as far as potsdam then i stared hard at the key for almost ten seconds before dropping it into my jacket pocket and pointing my libido downstairs steady on gunther i told myself you heard what the lady said she doesnt like to be hurried but behind the desk there was another message waiting for me it was from noreen and more than a couple of hours old i went back upstairs and pressed my ear to her door in view of what was in the note i might legitimately have used the passkey and let myself in but german good manners got the better of me and i knocked a very long minute passed before she opened the door oh its you she sounded almost disappointed were you expecting someone else noreen was wearing a brown chiffon peignoir and underneath a matching nightgown she smelled like honeysuckle and there was enough sleep still in her blue eyes to persuade me that she might want to go back to bed again only this time with me maybe she hustled me inside and closed the door what i meant was i left that note for you a couple of hours ago i thought youd come straightaway i must have fallen asleep i went out for a while to cool down where did you go parsifal the opera youre all surprises you know that i never figured you for a music lover im not i stayed for five minutes and then felt an irresistible urge to come here and search for you hmm so what does that make me a flower maiden klingsors slavewhats her name the one in parsifal i havent a clue i shrugged like i said i only stayed five minutes noreen put her arms around my neck i hope you brought parsifals holy spear with you gunther because i dont happen to have one here she backed me across the room to the bed at least not yet i dont you think i should stay with you tonight in my humble opinion yes she shrugged off the peignoir and let it fall onto the thick carpet with a whisper of chiffon i said you never held a humble opinion in your life and kissed her this time she allowed my hands to roam the contours of her body as if they belonged to an impatient masseur mostly they stayed on her bottom my fingers gathering chiffon until i could pull her into my groin my right hand seemed to be making a miraculous recovery so its true she said adlon room service is the best in europe the key to running a good hotel i said cupping one of her breasts in my hand is to eliminate boredom nearly all of our problems are caused by the innocent curiosity of our guests i dont think ive been accused of that she said innocence not in a long time she shook her head im not the innocent type gunther i grinned i guess you dont believe me she said pulling a length of hair through her mouth because im still wearing clothes she pushed me down to sit on the edge of the bed and then stepped back in order to make a performance out of taking off her nightgown nude she was worth a private room in pompeii and as far as performances go it had parsifal beat by several lewd acts looking at noreen you wondered why anyone ever bothered to draw or paint anything else but a womans naked body cubes might have done it for braque but i liked curves and noreens were good enough to satisfy apollonius of perga and probably kepler too she drew my head against her belly and pulling my hair like the coat on a favorite dog she teased me with the absence of all that made me a man why dont you touch me she said softly i want you to touch me right now she came and sat on my augmented lap and patiently permitted my impudent curiosities with eyes that were closed to anything else but her own pleasure with nostrils flared she breathed deeply like a yogi concentrating her breath so what changed your mind i asked bending to kiss her hardening nipple about tonight who says i changed my mind she said maybe i planned this all along like this is a scene in a play ive written she pushed off my jacket and started to undo my tie this is just what i want your character to do maybe youve got very little choice in the matter do you really feel you have a choice here gunther no i bit her nipple not now but i got the impression earlier on that you were playing a little hard to get i am hard to get only not to you youre the first in a long time i could say the same you could but it would be a lie youre one of the principal characters in my play remember i know all about you gunther she started to unbutton my shirt is max reles another character you do know him dont you do we have to talk about him now it can wait good because i cant wait i never could not since i was a little girl ask me about him later when the waiting is over the ceilings in the suites at the adlon were just the right distance from the floor when you lay on the bed and blew a column of cigarette smoke straight up the crystal chandelier looked like a remote and icy mountaintop surrounded with an ermine collar of cloud id never paid the ceilings much attention before previous erotic encounters with frieda bamberger had been furtive hurried affairs conducted with one eye on the clock and the other on the door handle and certainly id never felt sufficiently relaxed to fall asleep afterward but now that i was looking at the lofty heights of this room i found my soul climbing up the silky walls to sit on the picture rail like some invisible gargoyle and then to stare down with forensic fascination on the naked aftermath of what had gone before our bare limbs still entwined noreen and gunther lay side by sweating side like eros and psyche fallen from some other more heavenlike ceilingalthough it was hard to imagine anything much more heavenly than what had just occurred i felt like saint peter taking vacant possession of a smart new basilica i bet youve never even been in one of these beds said noreen taking the cigarette from my fingers and smoking it with the exaggerated gestures of a drunk or someone onstage have you no i lied it feels strange she hardly wanted to hear about my private trysts with frieda certainly not as much as i wanted to hear about max reles he doesnt seem to like you very much she said after i mentioned his name again why is that after all ive been doing a swell job of hiding how much i dislike him no really i despise the man but hes a guest of this hotel which obliges me not to punch him down six flights of stairs and then kick him out the door thats what id like to do and id do it too if i had another job to go to be careful bernie hes a dangerous man that much i already know the question is how do you know it we met on the ss manhattan she said on the voyage from new york to hamburg we were introduced at the captains table and occasionally we met up to play gin rummy she shrugged he wasnt a good player anyway it was a longish voyage and a single woman has to expect that she will become the focus of attention for single gentlemen maybe even a few married ones there was another man besides max reles a canadian lawyer called john martin i had a drink with him and he got the wrong idea about me the fact is he started to believe that he and iwell to use his words that he and i had something special going on well we didnt no really we didnt but he couldnt accept that and became something of a nuisance he told me he loved me and that he wanted to marry me and i didnt like it i tried to avoid him only thats not so easy on a boat one night off the coast of ireland i mentioned some of this to max reles over a game of gin rummy he didnt say very much and its quite possible that im completely mistaken about this but the very next day this man martin was reported missing and it was presumed he must have fallen overboard i believe they carried out a search but it was for appearances sake since there was no way he could have survived after several hours in the sea anyway soon after i formed the impression that reles had something to do with the poor mans disappearance it was something he said i cant remember the exact words he used but i do remember he was smiling when he said it noreen shook her head you must think im crazy i mean this is all completely circumstantial which is the main reason i never mentioned this to anyone not at all i said theres nothing wrong with evidence thats circumstantial in the right circumstances that is what did he say he said something like it sounds very much as if your irritating little problem has been taken care of mrs charalambides and then he asked me if id pushed him off the boat which he seemed to think was funny i told him i didnt think it was at all funny and asked him if he thought there was any chance that mr martin might still be alive to which he then replied i very much hope not well after that i kept away from him what exactly do you know about max reles not very much just what he told me over cards he said he was a businessman in that way men do when they want to give the impression that what they do isnt very interesting he speaks excellent german of course and i think some hungarian he told me he was on his way to zurich so i hardly expected to see him again and certainly not here i saw him again for the first time about a week ago in the library i had a drink with him just to be polite apparently hes been here for a while that he has you do believe me dont you she said it in a way that made me think she might not be telling the truth then again im just built that way some people like to believe in a pot of gold at the end of a rainbow im the type who thinks the pot of gold is being watched by four cops in a car you dont think i imagined it do you not at all i said although i did wonder why any man would murder another for a woman who was nothing more than a partner for a game of cards from what youve told me i think you came to a very reasonable conclusion you think i should have told the ships captain dont you or the police when we got to hamburg with no real evidence to corroborate your story reles would only have denied it and made you look a fool besides its not like it would have helped the man who drowned all the same somehow i feel responsible for what happened she rolled across the bed reaching for the ashtray on the bedside table and stabbed out the cigarette i rolled after her and caught up only an hour or two later it was a big bed i started to kiss her behind then the small of her back and then her shoulders i was just about to sink my fangs into her neck when i noticed the book next to the ashtray it was the book written by hitler she saw that i noticed it and said im reading it why its an important book but reading it doesnt make me a nazi any more than reading marx makes me a communist although as it happens i do consider myself to be a communist does that surprise you that you think youre a communist no not particularly the best people are these days george bernard shaw even trotsky i hear i like to consider myself a social democrat but since democracy no longer exists in this country that would be naive im glad youre a democrat that its something that is still important to you the fact is i wouldnt have slept with you if youd been a nazi gunther like a lot of people i might like them a bit more if it was me who was in charge and not hitler im trying to get an interview with him thats one of the reasons im reading hitlers book not that i think he will agree to meet me most likely ill have to make do with seeing the sports minister im meeting him tomorrow afternoon you wont mention our friend zak deutsch will you noreen or me for that matter no of course i wont tell me something do you think he was murdered maybe maybe not well have a much better idea after weve spoken to stefan blitz hes that geologist i was telling you about im hoping he can shed some light on how a man can drown in salt water in the center of berlin you see its one thing when it happens off the coast of ireland in the atlantic ocean its quite another when it happens in the local canal until the spring of stefan blitz had been a teacher of geology at frederick william university in berlin i knew him because sometimes he had helped kripo to identify the clay found on the shoes of murder suspects or their victims he lived in zehlendorf in berlins southwest in a modern housing development called uncle toms hut named after a local tavern and subway shop that were themselves named after the book by harriet beecher stowe noreen was intrigued i cant believe they called it that she said in the states people would never have dared give it a name like that in case people thought the houses were fit only for negroes i parked the car in front of a fourstory apartment building that was as big as a city block the smooth modern façade was very slightly curved and pockmarked with differentsized recessed windows none of which was on the same level it looked like a face recovering from a dose of smallpox there were hundreds perhaps thousands of these weimarbuilt homes in berlin and they were about as distinguished as packets of persil and yet although they despised modernism the nazis had more in common with its mostly jewish architects than they might have thought nazism and modernism were both products of the inhuman and when i looked at one of those neat standardized gray concrete buildings it wasnt hard to imagine a neat standardized detachment of gray storm troopers living in one like so many rats in a box it wasnt like that inside howeverat least not inside stefan blitzs apartment in contrast to the carefully planned modernism of the exterior his furniture was old mahogany tattered upholstery chipped wilhelmine ornaments table oilcloths and eiffel towers of books with all of the shelves given over to slices of rock blitz himself was as tattered as his upholstery and like any other jew who was forbidden his way of making a living he was as thin as a maquette in an artists garret and hardly living at all a hospitable kind and generous man he displayed character traits that made him the very opposite of the grasping bogeyman jew so often caricatured in the nazi press nevertheless that was what he looked like a lecher in the stews of damascus he offered us tea coffee cocacola alcohol something to eat a more comfortable chair chocolates and his last cigarettes before finally having refused them all we were able to come to the point of our visit is it possible that a man could drown in seawater in the center of berlin i asked i assume youve discounted the possibility of a swimming pool otherwise you wouldnt be here the admirals garden baths on alexanderplatz is a brine bath i used to swim there myself before they stopped jews from going there the victim is jewish i said and so for that reason yes youre right i think i have discounted that possibility why if you dont mind my asking is a gentile bothering to investigate the death of a jew in the new germany its my idea noreen said and told blitz about the olympiad and the failed us boycott and the newspaper she hoped would put that to rights and how she herself was a jew i suppose it would be something if an american boycott were to succeed blitz admitted although i have my doubts the nazis wont be so easy to dislodge with or without a boycott now that they have power they mean to hang on to it the reichstag will sink before they have another election and believe me i know what im talking about it was built on posts because of all the swampy spots that exist between it and the old museum noreen smiled her neon smile her glamour seemed to warm the apartment as if someone had lit a fire in the empty grate she lit a cigarette from a little gold case which she pushed toward him he took one and slid it behind his ear like a pencil could a man drown in berlin seawater he asks said blitz two hundred sixty million years ago this whole area was an ancient seathe zechstein sea berlin itself was founded on a series of islands that appeared in a river valley during the last ice age the substrata are mostly sand and salt a lot of salt from the zechstein sea the salt formed several islands on the land surface and quite a few deepwater groundwater chambers all over the city and the surrounding area seawater chambers asked noreen yes yes in my opinion there are some places in berlin where men should not be digging such a chamber might easily be ruptured with potentially disastrous consequences could such a place include pichelsberg it could happen almost anywhere in berlin said blitz for someone in a hurry who didnt carry out a proper geological surveyboreholes and that kind of thingit would not just be the old lies that the new germany obliged him to swallow but a considerable quantity of salt water also he smiled carefully like a man playing a card game whose rules he was still uncertain of including pichelsberg i persisted blitz shrugged pichelsberg what is this interest in pichelsberg im a geologist not a town planner herr gunther come on stefan you know why im asking yes and i dont like it i have enough problems without adding pichelsberg as well where exactly are you going with this you mentioned a drowned man a jew you said and a newspaper article forgive me but it seems to me that one dead jew is quite enough dr blitz said noreen i promise you nothing you say will be attributed to you i wont quote you i wont mention uncle toms cabin or that i even spoke to a geologist blitz removed the cigarette from behind his ear and studied it like a core of white rock when he lit it his satisfaction could be seen and heard american cigarettes im so used to cheap ones id forgotten how good tobacco can taste he nodded thoughtfully perhaps i should try to go to america im damned sure the meaning of life in germany doesnt include liberty and the pursuit of happiness not if youre jewish anyway noreen emptied her case on the table please she said keep them i have more back at the hotel if youre sure he said she nodded and pulled the sable coat closer to her chest a good engineering company he said carefully it would first drill not dig you understand the ice age left behind a real mixture of substrata that would make construction here very unpredictable especially somewhere like pichelsberg does that answer your question is it possible that the people building the olympic stadium dont know this she asked blitz shrugged who mentioned the olympics i know nothing about the olympics and i tell you i dont want to know were told its not for jews and i for one am very happy about this it was chilly in his apartment but he wiped some sweat off his forehead with a ragged handkerchief look if you dont mind i think ive said enough one more question i said and then well leave blitz stared momentarily at the ceiling as if calling on his maker to give him patience his hand was trembling as he put the cigarette back between his cracked lips is there any gold in berlins substrata gold yes gold but only trace amounts believe me bernie you wont get rich looking for gold in berlin he chuckled at least not unless you take it from those who already have it this is a jew telling you so you can take that to the bank even the nazis arent stupid enough to look for gold in berlin we didnt stay much longer we both knew wed unsettled blitz and in view of what hed said i didnt blame him for being circumspect and nervous the nazis would hardly have taken kindly to what he was surely saying about the construction site at pichelsberg when we left we didnt offer him money he wouldnt have taken it but when his back was turned to lead us out of the apartment noreen slipped a leaf under the coffeepot back in the car noreen let out a loud sigh and shook her head this town is beginning to get me down she said tell me you dont get used to it not me ive only just got used to the idea that we lost the war everyone says the jews were to blame for that but i always thought it was the navys fault it was them who got us into it and their mutiny that forced us to quit but for them we might have fought on to an honorable peace you sound like you regret that only the fact that the wrong people signed the armistice the army should have done it instead of the politicians which let the army off the hook rather and which is why were in the state were in dyou see not really no well thats half the problem nobody does least of all us germans most mornings i wake up and think i must have imagined the last two years the last twentyfour hours most of all what does a woman like you see in a man like me she took my left hand and squeezed it a man like you you make that sound as if theres more than one there isnt i know ive looked and in all kinds of places including the bed we slept in last night i was wondering how id feel in the morning well now i know how do you feel scared of what the way i feel of course like youre driving the car i am driving the car i wiggled the steering wheel for effect at home no one ever drives me anywhere i like to drive myself i prefer to decide when to start and when to stop but with you i really dont mind i wouldnt mind if you decided to drive us all the way to china and back china itd be enough for me just to have you stay on in berlin for a while so whats stopping me perhaps nick charalambides and your newspaper article and maybe this that its my honest opinion that isaac deutsch wasnt murdered at all that his death was an accident no one drowned him he drowned without any help from anyone else right here in the center of berlin i know its not as good a story if he wasnt murdered but what can i do damn exactly for a moment i was reminded of richard bömer and his disappointment at discovering that isaac deutsch was jewish and now here was noreen charalambides disappointed to discover the poor guy hadnt been murdered its a hell of a world are you sure heres what i think happened after his career as a boxer was outlawed by the nazis isaac deutsch and his uncle got a job on the olympic building site in spite of the official policy about hiring only aryan workers given how much there is to do before the olympiad starts in someone decided it might be best to cut a few corners and not just with the racial origins of the workforce with safety too i suspect isaac deutsch was probably involved in some kind of underground excavation when he ruptured one of those water chambers blitz told us about he had an accident and he was drowned in seawater only no one knew it was seawater someone figured it might be best if his body was found drowned a long way from pichelsberg just in case some nosy cop started asking questions about illegal jewish workers which is how the body ended up in a freshwater canal on the other side of berlin noreen searched her empty cigarette case for a smoke damn she said again i gave her mine much as im reluctant to admit it noreen this little investigation is over nothing would give me more pleasure than to spin this out and keep on driving you around berlin but i think honestys best especially since im a little out of practice in that area what with one thing and another she lit the cigarette and stared out of the window as we came into steglitz pull up she said sharply what pull up i said i stopped the car close to the town hall at the corner of schlossstrasse and started to apologize on the assumption that she had taken offense at something i had said even before i had switched off the engine she had got out of the car and was walking swiftly back down the street i followed hey im sorry i said but theres still a story you can write here maybe if you found isaac deutschs uncle joeythe guy who was his trainerthen perhaps hed talk you could get his story that would be a good angle how jews are forbidden to compete in the olympics but how one who gets an illegal job building the stadium ends up dead that could be a great story noreen didnt look like she was listening and i was more than a little horrified to see that she was heading toward a large group of sa and ss men standing around a man and woman dressed in civilian clothes the woman was blond and in her twenties the man was older and jewish i knew he was jewish because like her he had a placard around his neck the mans placard read im a dirty jew who takes german girls to his room the girls placard read i go to this dirty swines place to sleep with a jew before i could do anything to stop her noreen threw away her cigarette produced her baby brownie from her capacious leather handbag and looking down through the little viewfinder took a photograph of the somber couple and the grinning nazis i caught up with her and tried to take her by the arm she pulled it away angrily this is not a good idea i said nonsense they wouldnt have put those placards around their necks unless they wanted people to pay attention to them and thats just what im doing she wound her film and once again lined up the group one of the ss shouted at me hey bubi leave her alone shes right your girlfriend theres no point in making an example of bastards like these unless people see it and take note thats exactly what im doing said noreen taking note i waited patiently until noreen had finished until now shed photographed only antisemitic signs in the parks and some nazi flags on unter den linden and i hoped this rather more candid kind of photography wasnt about to become a habit with her i doubt my nerves could have taken it we walked back to the car in silence abandoning the miscegenating couple to their public disgrace and humiliation if youd ever seen them beat someone up i said then youd be more careful about doing something like that you want to photograph something interesting ill run you over to the bismarck monument or the charlottenburg palace noreen dropped the camera back in her bag dont treat me like some goddamn tourist she said i didnt take that picture for my album i took it for the fucking newspaper dont you get it a picture like that makes an absolute mockery of avery brundages claims that berlin is a proper place to hold an olympic games brundage yes avery brundage werent you listening i told you before hes the president of the american olympic committee i nodded what else do you know about him almost nothing beyond the fact that he must be a real asshole would it surprise you to learn that hes in correspondence with your old friend max reles and that he owns a construction company in chicago how do you know that im a detective remember im supposed to know things im not supposed to know about she smiled sonofabitch you searched his room didnt you thats why you were asking me about him last night ill bet thats when you did it too right after that little scene in the lobby when you knew hed be out for a while almost right i followed him to the opera first five minutes of parsifal i remember so thats why you went his guests included the sports leader funk from propaganda some army general called von reichenau the rest i didnt recognize but ill bet they were all nazis those you mentioned are all on the german olympic organizing committee she said and ill bet the rest were too she shook her head so you went back to the adlon and searched his room while you knew he was safely otherwise engaged what else did you find a lot of letters reles employs a stenographer i found for him and it seems he keeps her very busy writing to companies who are bidding for olympic contracts then he must be on a kickback maybe lots of kickbacks the goc too maybe i took some carbon copies from his wastepaper basket great can i see them when we were in the car once again i handed them over she started to read one nothing incriminating here she said thats what i thought at first its just a bid for a contract to supply cement to the ministry of the interior the other one is a bid for a contract to supply propane gas for the olympic flame i paused dont you get it thats a carbon it means that it was typed by the adlons own stenographer in his suite contracts are supposed to be for german companies only and max reles is an american maybe he bought these companies maybe i think hes probably got enough money probably thats why he went to zurich before he came here theres a bag in his room containing thousands of dollars and gold swiss francs not to mention a submachine gun even in germany you dont need a machine gun to run a company these days not unless you have some serious problems with your labor force i need to think about this we both do ive a feeling were getting in over our heads and im kind of attached to mine i mention that only because we have the falling ax in this country and its not just criminals who get haircuts its communists and republicans and probably anyone the government doesnt like look you really wont mention any of this to von tschammer und osten will you no of course i wont im not ready to get thrown out of germany just yet especially since last night im glad to hear it while im thinking about max reles that idea you had about looking for isaac deutschs uncle and basing my story on him its a good one i only said that to get you back in the car well im back in the car and its still a good idea im not so sure suppose you did write a story about jews helping to build the new stadium maybe all those jews will end up losing their jobs as a result of that and what happens to them then how are they going to feed their families it might even be that some of them end up in concentration camps have you thought about that of course ive thought about it what do you take me for im a jew remember the human consequences of what i might write are always on my mind look bernie the way i see it is this theres a much bigger issue at stake here than a few hundred people losing their jobs the usa is by far the most important country in any olympics in la we won fortyone gold medals more than any other country italy which was next won twelve an olympiad without america would be meaningless thats why a boycott is important because if the games are not held here it would be just about the most serious blow that nazi prestige could suffer inside germany not to mention it being one of the most effective ways that the outside world has of showing the youth of germany its true opinion of nazi doctrine that has to be more important than whether a few jews can feed their families wouldnt you agree maybe but if we go to pichelsberg looking for answers about isaac deutsch we might find ourselves asking questions of the very people who tossed him into the canal they might not take kindly to being written about even if it is in a new york newspaper looking for joey deutsch could turn out to be just as dangerous as investigating max reles youre a detective an excop id have thought a certain amount of danger is written into your job description a certain amount yes but that doesnt make me bulletproof besides when youre back in new york collecting a pulitzer prize for reporting ill still be here thats the hope at least i can float in the canal just as easily as isaac deutsch if its a question of money given what happened last night i might tell you its not a question of money at the same time i have to admit that money is always a very persuasive answer money talks huh gunther sometimes it seems you just cant shut it up im a hotel detective because i have to be noreen not because i want to be im broke angel when i quit kripo i left behind a reasonable salary and a pension not to mention what my father used to call good prospects i dont see myself rising to the rank of hotel manager do you noreen smiled not in the kind of hotel id ever want to stay in exactly how does twenty marks a day sound generous very but its a different kind of dialogue im looking for pulitzer prizes dont pay that much you know im not after a slice just a loan a business loan with interest what with the depression the banks arent lending not even to each other and i can hardly ask the adlons to stake me enough to hand in my notice to do what to do this be a private investigator of course its about the one thing im good at i figure about five hundred marks would let me set up on my own how do i know youd stay alive long enough to pay me back that would be an incentive of course id hate to lose my life and id hate to see you lose your money as a result of that of course fact is i could probably pay you a twentypercent return on your investment youve obviously given this some thought ever since the nazis came into power human tragedies like the one we just witnessed in front of the town hall back there are happening all over this city and its going to get worse before it gets better a lot of peoplejews gypsies freemasons communists homosexuals jehovahs witnessesthey already figure they cant go to the cops and get a hearing from anyone so theyre going to go somewhere else which just has to be good for someone like me so you could end up making a profit under the nazis thats always a possibility at the same time its just possible i might actually end up helping someone as well as myself you know what i like about you gunther i sure could use a bit of reminding its that you can make copernicus and kepler look so very shortsighted and impractical and yet still cut a convincingly romantic figure does that mean you still find me attractive i dont know ask me later when ive forgotten that im no longer just your employer but your banker too does that mean youre going to give me the loan noreen smiled why not but on one condition you never tell hedda that you got the money from me itll be our secret one of two it now looks like you do realize youre going to have to sleep with me again i said to guarantee my silence of course in fact as your banker i was banking on it with interest i dropped noreen off at the ministry of the interior for her interview with von tschammer und osten and drove back to the hotel and then kept on driving west again now that she was out of the way i wanted to nose around the olympic site at pichelsberg on my own the fact was i had only the one pair of gum boots and then there was the fact that i didnt want to draw any attention while i was doing the nosing which was almost impossible when noreen was on my arm she commanded attention like a nudist playing the trombone pichelsberg racecourse was at the north end of the grunewald in the center of the racecourse was the stadium laid out from a design by otto march and opened in encircling the course were running and cycling tracks while to the north was a swimming poolall built for the canceled berlin olympiad of in stands that could accommodate almost forty thousand people were sculptures including a goddess of victory and a neptune group except that none of them were there anymore nothing was everythingthe racecourse the stadium and the poolhad been demolished and replaced by an enormous earthwork a huge mass of soil had been created from the excavation of a vaguely circular pit where i assumed the new stadium was going to be built as assumptions go this one seemed unlikely the berlin olympics were less than two years away and nothing had been built indeed a perfectly serviceable and recently constructed stadium had been knocked down to make way for the battle of verdun as imagined by d w griffith as i got out of the car i half expected to see the french front lines our own line and heavy shell bursts in the air for a moment i was back in uniform and feeling fairly sick with fear at the sudden recollection of that earlier duncolored wilderness and then the shakes were on me as if i had just woken up from the same nightmare i always had which was about being back there carrying a box of ammunition through the mud and clay while shells were falling all around it took me two hours to move meters up to our front line i kept throwing myself on the ground or simply falling over until i was soaked to the skin and caked with earth like a man made of mud i had almost reached our redoubt when i stepped into a shell hole and found myself waist deep in mud and sinking i shouted for help but the noise of the barrage was too loud for anyone to hear struggling only seemed to make me sink more quickly and in less than five minutes i was up to my neck and facing the horrible fate of being drowned in a small sea of brown glue id seen horses stuck in the mud and nearly always they were shot such was the effort of pulling one out i struggled to take hold of my pistol so that i might shoot myself in the head before being drowned but that was hopeless too the mud held me tightly now i tried to lean back so that i might float on the surface but that was no use either and then just as the mud was up to my jaw there was an enormous explosion a few meters away as a shell hit the ground and miraculously i was lifted right out of the morass and high into the air to land twenty meters away winded but uninjured had it not been for the mud enveloping me the shock of the blast would certainly have killed me that was my recurring nightmare and i never had it without waking up soaked with perspiration and out of breath as if i had just sprinted across nomansland even now in broad daylight i had to drop down on my haunches and take several deep breaths in an effort to pull myself together a few spots of color in the once fertile but now devastated landscape served my mental recovery some blue thistle at the edge of the distant tree line red dead nettle close to where id left the car some yellowflowered tansy ragwort a robin redbreast picking a juicy pink worm out of the ground the empty blue sky and finally an army of workmen and a railway line conveying a small red train of earthmoving wagons from one end of the site to the other are you all right the man wore a workmans peaked cap and a quilted jacket as voluminous as a smock his black trousers ended several centimeters above boots doubled in size by several kilos of clay over a shoulder as big as jutland rested a sledgehammer his blond hair was almost white and his eyes were as blue as the thistle flowers his chin and cheekbones might have been sketched by one of those nazi artists like josef thorak im okay i stood up lit a cigarette and waved it at the landscape when i saw nomansland i went off a bit like august stramm you know yielding clod lulls iron off to sleep blood clots the patches where they oozed rust crumbles flesh is slime sucking lusts around decay to my surprise he completed the verse murder on murder blinks in childish eyes yes i know that poem me i was second royal württemburg twentyseventh division you twentysixth div then we were in the same battle i nodded amiens august i offered him a cigarette and he took a light from my own trench style not to waste a match two graduates of the university of mud he said scholars of human evolution ah yes the ascent of man i grinned remembering the old saying when someone kills you not with a bayonet but with a machine gun not with a machine gun but with a flamethrower not with a flamethrower but with poison gas what are you doing here friend just looking around well youre not allowed not anymore didnt you see the sign no i answered truthfully were way behind schedule as it is were already working three shifts so we dont have time for visitors it doesnt look too busy here most of the lads are on the other side of that earthwork he said pointing to the west of the site you sure youre not from the ministry of the interior no why do you ask because theyve threatened to replace any construction companies that arent pulling their weight thats why i thought you might be spying on us im no spy hell im not even a nazi the truth is i came out here to look for someone a fellow by the name of joey deutsch maybe you know him no maybe the site foremans heard of him that would be me the names blask heinrich blask why are you looking for this fellow anyway its not like hes in trouble or anything and im not about to tell him hes won a fortune on the lottery i was wondering exactly what i was going to tell him until i remembered the fight tickets in my pocket the ones wed bought off gypsy trollmann the fact is i manage a couple of fighters and i want joey to train them i dont know what hes like with a pick and a shovel but joeys a pretty good trainer one of the best hed be in the game right now but for the obvious reason which is with a name like deutsch hes a kike and kikes arent allowed in gyms at least not the gyms that are open to the public me ive got my own gym so no ones offended right maybe you dont know but were not allowed to employ nonaryan labor here said blask sure i know that i also know that it happens and who can blame you with the ministry breathing down your neck about getting this stadium built in time pretty tall order if you ask me listen heinrich im not here to make trouble for you i just want to find joey maybe his nephews working with him isaac he used to be a fighter himself i took two tickets out of my pocket and showed them to the foreman maybe youd like some tickets to a fight yourself scholz versus witt at the spichernsaele how about it heinrich can you help me here if there were kikes working on this site said blask and im not saying that there are but you would do best to speak to the hiring boss a man called erich goerz hes not on site very much mostly he works out of a bar on the schildhorn he took one of the tickets theres a monument there the schildhorn column sright from what i heard if you want to work no questions asked thats where you go every morning around six theres a whole crowd of illegals that waits there jews gyppos you name it goerz turns up decides who works and who doesnt mostly on account of how they each pay him a commission he calls the names gives them a work tab they report to wherever theyre needed most he shrugged theyre good workers he finds so what am i going to do me with my schedule he doesnt tell me and i dont need to be told right i just do what the bosses order me to do any idea what the bars called albert the bear or something he took the other ticket but let me give you some free advice comrade be careful erich goerz wasnt in the royal württemburg like me his idea of comradeship owes more to al capone than the prussian army you follow me hes not as big as you but hes pretty handy with his fists maybe youll like that you look like a fellow who can take care of himself but erich goerz also carries a gun and not where youd expect him to carry one its strapped to his ankle if ever he stops to tie up his shoelaces dont hesitate kick him in the teeth before he shoots you thanks for the warning friend i flicked my cigarette into nomansland you already said hes not as big as me anything else you can tell me about what he looks like let me see blask dropped the sledgehammer and stroked his anvilsized chin for one thing he smokes russian cigarettes i think theyre russian anyway flat ones that smell like a nest of burning weasels so when hes in the room youll know about it otherwise hes a pretty regular guy at least to look at aged about thirty thirtyfive pimp mustache bit swarthylooks like he should be wearing a fez owns a new hanomag with a brandenburg license plate matter of fact that might be where hes from originally the drivers from somewhere south of there wittenberg i think hes a slugger too with a reach like the palace bridge so mind you watch out for him as well to the south of pichelsberg a high road affording pretty views but now much used by construction traffic skirted the havel river and led to beelitzhof and the twokilometer peninsula of schildhorn close to the riverbank were a little group of bars and ivycovered restaurants and a series of stone steps that rose steeply up to a group of pine trees that hid the schildhorn monument and whatever else went on there at six oclock in the morning the monument was well chosen as a place for picking up illegal workers from the road it was impossible to see anything that happened around the monument albert the bear was shaped a bit like a boot or a shoe and was of such an age that it looked as if the shoe might have an old woman who lived in it with so many children she didnt know what to do outside the door was a new hanomag with an ie license plate it looked as if id arrived at the right time i drove on for about three or four hundred meters and parked in the trunk of behlerts car was a pair of overalls behlert was always messing around under the hood of the w i put on the overalls and walked back into the village stopping only to push my hands into some damp soil to give myself a workingmans manicure a cold easterly wind was blowing off the river and carried a strong hint of the coming winter not to mention a whiff of something chemical from the hohenzollerndamm gasworks on the edge of wilmersdorf outside the albert a tall man with a courtroom artists idea of a face was leaning on the hanomag reading the zeitung he was smoking a tom thumb and probably keeping an eye on the car as i pushed open the door a little bell rang above my head it didnt seem like a good idea but i went inside anyway i was greeted by a large stuffed bear the bears jaws were open and its paws were in the air and i guess a person coming through the door was supposed to feel under attack or something but to me the bear looked as if he were conducting an ursine choir to sing the teddy bears picnic otherwise the place was almost empty the floor was a checkerboard of cheap linoleum tables with neat yellow cloths were ranged around the orangecolored walls that were a picture gallery of river scenes and characters in the far corner underneath a large photograph of the river spree logjammed with sunday canoeists sat a man in a cloud of foulsmelling cigarette smoke he was reading a newspaper that was spread over the whole table and he hardly looked up as i came over and stood in front of him hey i said dont make the mistake of pulling out that chair he murmured im not the type who likes to jaw with strangers he wore a midgreen suit and a dark green shirt with a brown woolen tie on the bench next to him were a leather coat and hat and for no reason i could see a substantiallooking dog lead the flat yellowish cigarettes he was smoking were not russian however they were french i understand are you herr goerz who wants to know stefan blitz i was told you were the man to speak to about getting work on the olympic site oh who told you that fellow named trollmann johann trollmann never heard of him does he work for me no herr goerz he said he heard it from a friend of his i cant remember his name trollmann and i we used to box together i paused i say used to because now we cant not anymore not now that there are rules about nonaryans in sporting contests which is how i come to be looking for a job ive never been a sporting man myself said goerz i was too busy earning a living he looked up from his newspaper i can see the boxer in you maybe but somehow i cant see the jew im a mischling half and half but that doesnt seem to make much difference to the government goerz laughed no it certainly doesnt let me see your hands stefan blitz i held them out in front of him showing off my dirty fingernails not the backs of your hands the palms are you going to tell my fortune his eyes narrowed as he pulled on the last few centimeters of the foulsmelling cigarette maybe not touching my hands just looking he added these hands look strong enough but they dont look like theyve done much real work like i said mostly ive worked with my knuckles but i can handle a pick and a shovel during the war i did my fair share of digging trenches quite a few graves too sad he put out the cigarette tell me stefan do you know what a tithing is its in the bible it means a tenth part doesnt it sright now then im just the hiring boss i get paid by the construction company to find them men but i also get paid by you to find you a job see a tenth of what you make at the end of the day you can think of it as being like your union dues a tenth seems a little high for any union ive ever been in i agree but then beggars cant be choosers now can they jews arent allowed to be in german workingmens unions so under those circumstances a tenth is what youre asked to pay and you can take it or leave it ill take it i thought you would besides like i said its in your holy book genesis chapter fourteen verse twenty and he gave him tithes of all thats the best way to look at it i think as your holy duty and if you cant work your head around that then just remember this i only pick the men who pay me the tithing clear clear six oclock sharp at the monument outside maybe youll work maybe you wont it all depends on how many are needed ill be here as if i care goerz looked back down at his newspaper the interview was over i had arranged to meet noreen at the romanisches café on tauentzienstrasse formerly popular with berlins literati the café resembled an airship that had made an unscheduled landing on the pavement in front of a fourstory romanesque building that might have been the sibling of the kaiser wilhelm memorial church opposite or perhaps it was the modern equivalent of a hohenzollern hunting lodgesomewhere for the princes and emperors of the first german empire to get a coffee or a kummel after spending a long morning on their knees to a god who by comparison with them must have seemed rather vulgar and ill bred under the glass ceilings of the café she was easy to see like an exotic species of hothouse flower but as with any vivid tropical bloom something dangerous was close at hand a young man wearing a smart black uniform was seated at her table like miss muffets spider less than six months after the demise of the sa as a political force independent of the nazis the impeccably dressed ss had already established itself as the most feared uniformed organization in hitlers germany i was none too pleased to see him myself he was tall and blond and handsome with an easy smile and manners as polished as his bootslighting noreens cigarette as urgently as if her life had depended on it and standing up with a click of heels that was as loud as a champagne cork when i presented myself at their table the ss officers matching black labrador shifted uncertainly on his haunches and uttered a low growl master and dog looked like a warlock and his familiar and before noreen had even begun the introductions i was hoping he might disappear in a puff of black smoke this is lieutenant seetzen she said smiling politely hes been keeping me company and practicing his english i fixed a rictus smile to my jaw affecting pleasure in our new friends company but i was glad when he finally made his excuses and left thats a relief she said i thought hed never go oh you looked like you were getting on very well dont be an ass gunther what could i do i was reading through my notes and he just sat down and started speaking to me all the same it was kind of fascinating in a sort of creepy way he was telling me that hes applied to join the prussian gestapo now theres a job with prospects if only i didnt have any scruples i might just do the same right now hes on a training course in the grunewald i wonder what they teach them how to use a rubber hose on a man without killing him where do they get these bastards hes from eutin ah so thats where they get them noreen tried to stifle a yawn with the back of her elegantly gloved hand it was easy to see why the lieutenant had spoken to her she was easily the bestlooking woman in the café im sorry she said but its been a hell of an afternoon first von tschammer und osten and then that young lieutenant for a clever people you germans can be awfully dumb she glanced down at her reporters notebook your leader of german sports is so full of bullshit thats how he got the job angel i lit a cigarette she turned some of the pages of shorthand shaking her head listen to this i mean he said a lot of things that sounded sort of unhinged to me but this took the biscuit when i asked him about hitlers promise that in the selection of its olympic team germany would observe olympic statutes and recognize neither race nor color he saidand i quote but it is being observed at least in principle technically nobody is being excluded on any of those grounds and listen to this bernie this is the best bit by the time the games are held jews will probably no longer be german citizens or at least firstclass german citizens they may be admissible as guests and in view of all the international agitation on behalf of the jews it may even happen that at the last moment the government will accede to there being a small quota of jews on the team albeit in those sporting events in which germany stands only a slight chance of winning such as chess or croquet because the fact remains that there are certain sports in which it cannot be denied a germanjewish victory would present us with a political not to say philosophical question is that so i put out my cigarette it was still only half smoked but i felt something sticking in my throat as if i had swallowed the little silver deathshead badge from the lieutenants black cap depressing isnt it if ive given you the impression that im a tough guy then i should tell you now im not i appreciate a little bit of warning before anyone punches me in the stomach theres more von tschammer und osten said that all roman catholic and protestant youth organizations are like all jewish organizations to be expressly forbidden to pursue any sport as far as the nazis are concerned people are going to have to make a choice between religion and sports the point being that all sports training is to be done under nazi auspices he actually said that the nazis are conducting a cultural war against the church he said that any catholic or protestant athletes who dont join nazi sports clubs will lose their chance of representing germany i shrugged so let them who cares about a few idiots running around a track anyway youre missing the point gunther theyve purged the police now theyre purging sports if they succeed there will be no aspect of german life in which they wont be able to exert their authority in all aspects of german society nazis will be preferred if you want to get on in life you will have to become a nazi she was smiling and it annoyed me that she was smiling i knew why she was smiling she was pleased because she thought she had a scoop for her newspaper article but it still annoyed me that she was smiling to me this was more than just a story this was my country its you whos missing the point i said you think it was an accident that ss lieutenant decided to speak to you you think he was just passing the time of day i laughed the gestapo marked your card angel why else would he have told you he was joining the gestapo after your interview with the sports leader they probably followed you here oh thats nonsense bernie is it most likely lieutenant seetzen was told to charm you to find out what kind of person you are who your associates are and now they know about me i glanced around the café theyre probably watching us right now perhaps the waiter is one of theirs or that man reading the newspaper it could be anyone thats what they do noreen swallowed nervously and lit another cigarette her lovely blue eyes flicked one way and then the other examining the waiter and then the man with the newspaper for some sign that they were spying on us you really think so noreen was beginning to look convinced and i might have smiled and told her i was joking but for the fact that id also succeeded in convincing myself why wouldnt the gestapo have followed an american journalist who had just finished interviewing the sports leader it made perfect sense its what id have done if id been in the gestapo i told myself i ought to have seen this coming so now they know about you i said and they know about me ive put you in danger havent i like you said this morning a certain amount of danger is written into the job description im sorry forget it then again maybe you shouldnt forget it after all i like your feeling guilty on my part it means i can blackmail you with a clear conscience angel besides as soon as i saw you i knew you were trouble and it just so happens thats just the way i like my women with big fenders polished coachwork lots of chrome and a supercharged engine like that car hedda drives the kind of car where you find yourself in poland the moment you touch the gas id be on the bus if i was interested in sleeping with librarians all the same ive been thinking about this story and not thinking at all about the impact it might have on you i cant believe ive been so stupid as to bring you to the attention of the gestapo maybe i didnt mention it before but ive been in their sights for quite a while ever since i quit the force as a matter of fact there are several good reasons i can think of why the gestapo or for that matter kripo could arrest me if they wanted to its the reasons i cant think of that are the ones i worry about most noreen wanted to spend the night with me at my apartment but i couldnt bring myself to bring her to what was little more than a room with a tiny kitchen and an even tinier bathroom calling it an apartment at all was a bit like describing a mustard seed as a vegetable there were smaller apartments in berlin but mostly it was the families of mice that got them first it was embarrassment that prevented me from showing her how i lived but it was shame that prevented me from telling her that i was oneeighth jewish its true i had been discomfited at the discovery my socalled mixed blood had been denounced to the gestapo but i felt no shame in being who and what i was how could i it seemed so insignificant no the shame i felt related to my having asked emil linthe to airbrush from the official record the very blood that connected me with noreen albeit in a small way how could i tell her that and still nursing my secret i spent another blissful night with noreen in her suite at the adlon lying between her thighs i slept only a little we had better things to do and early in the morning when i made my nefarious exit from her room i told her only that i was going home and that i would see her later that day and nothing at all about catching the sbahn to grunewald and schildhorn i kept some working clothes in my office as soon as i had changed i went out into the predawn darkness and walked to potsdamer station about fortyfive minutes after that i was walking up the steps to the schildhorn monument with several other men most of them jewishlooking types with brown hair dark melancholy eyes bat ears and beaks that made you wonder if god had chosen his people on the basis of their having noses they might not have chosen for themselves this generalization was made easier by the certain knowledge that all these men shared a bloodline that was probably purer than my own in the moonlight one or two of them shot me a questioning look as if wondering what the nazis could possibly have against a tall burly man with blond hair blue eyes and a nose like a bakers thumb i didnt blame them in that particular company i stuck out like rameses ii there were about men gathered in the darkness under the invisible pine trees which whispered their presence in an earlymorning breeze the monument itself was supposed to be a stylized tree crowned by a cross from which a shield was hanging it probably meant something to someone who had a taste for unsightly religious monuments to me it looked like a lamppost without a muchneeded lamp or perhaps a stone stake for burning city architects that would have been a worthwhile monument especially in berlin i walked around this economysized obelisk eavesdropping on a few conversations mostly they were to do with how many days each man had worked in the recent past or not worked as seemed rather more common i got one day last week said a man and two the week before i need to work today or my family wont eat another started to excoriate goerz but was quickly silenced by someone else blame the nazis not goerz but for him none of us would work hes risking as much as us maybe more if you ask me he gets well paid for the risk its my first time i told the man standing next to me how do you get yourself picked i offered him a cigarette and he looked at me and my cigarettes strangely as if suspecting that no one who really needed to work had money for such sensuous and expensive luxuries he took it anyway and put it behind his ear theres no method in it he said ive been coming here for six months and still it seems arbitrary there are some days when he likes your face and others when he doesnt even meet your eye maybe hes just trying to spread the work around i said for the sake of fairness fairness the man snorted his derision fairness has absolutely nothing to do with it one day hell take a hundred men another day hell take seventyfive its a kind of fascism i think goerz reminding us all of the power he wields shorter than me by a head the man was redhaired and sharply featured with a face like a heavily rusted hatchet he wore a thick pea jacket and a workers cap and around his neck was tied a bright green handkerchief that matched the color of the eyes behind his wireframed glasses jutting out of his coat pocket was a book by dostoevsky and it was almost as if this young and studiouslooking jew had emerged fully formed from a space between the pages neurotic poor undernourished desperate his name was solomon feigenbaum which to my mostly aryan ears was about as jewish as a ghetto full of tailors anyway if its your first time you almost always get picked said feigenbaum goerz likes to give the new man a day so that they get the taste thats a relief if you say so only you dont look like youre in desperate need of work matter of fact you dont even look jewish thats what my mother said to my father i always figured thats why she married him it takes more than a hooked nose and a yarmulke to make a jew friend what about helene mayer whos she a jewish fencer on the german olympic team in looks like hitlers wet dream shes got more blond hair than the floor in a swedish barbershop and what about leni riefenstahl surely youve heard the rumors youre kidding not at all her mother was a polish jew feigenbaum seemed vaguely amused by that listen i said i havent worked in weeks a friend of mine told me about this plage as a matter of fact i thought id see him here as if hoping to see isaac deutsch i looked around the crowd of men standing near the monument and shook my head with disappointment did your friend tell you about the work only that its no questions asked that all what else is there like they use jewish labor for work that maybe socalled german workers dont want to do because its dangerous on account of how theyre cutting corners on safety so they can finish the stadium on time did your friend tell you that are you trying to put me off im just telling you how it is it seems to me that if your friend was really your friend he might have mentioned that much that youve got to be a bit desperate maybe to take some of the risks they expect you to take its not like anyones gonna give you a hard hat my friend a rock falls on your head or you get buried in a cavein there isnt going to be anyone looking surprised or griefstricken theres no social welfare for illegally employed jews maybe not even a headstone understand i understand that maybe youre trying to put me off increase your own chances of getting work what im trying to say is we look after each other see if we dont nobody else will when we go down the pit were like the three musketeers the pit i thought we were on the stadium site thats up top for german workers nothing to it most of us here are working on the tunnel for a new sbahn thats going to run from the stadium all the way to königgratzer strasse if you work today youll find out what its like to be a mole he glanced up at the stilldark sky we go down in the dark we work in the dark and we come up in the dark youre right my friend didnt tell me any of this i said you would think hed have mentioned it then again its been a while since ive seen him or his uncle hey maybe you know them isaac and joey deutsch i dont know them said feigenbaum but behind his glasses his eyes had narrowed and were studying me carefully as if maybe he had heard of them after all i didnt spend ten years at the alex without getting an itch for when a man is lying he pulled on his earlobe a couple of times and then glanced away nervously that was the clincher but you must i said firmly isaac used to be a boxer he was a real prospect until the nazis excluded jews from the fights and took away his license joey was his trainer surely you know them i tell you i dont know them feigenbaum spoke firmly i shrugged and lit a cigarette if you say so i mean its nothing to me i puffed the cigarette to let him get a whiff of it i could tell he was desperate for a smoke even though he still had the one id given him behind his ear i guess all that talk about the three musketeers and looking out for each other was just that talk what do you mean his nostrils flared in front of the tobacco smoke and he licked his lips nothing i said nothing at all i took another drag and dried his face with it here finish it you know you want one feigenbaum took the cigarette from my fingers and went to work on it as if id offered him an opium pipe some people are just like that with a nail they make you think that maybe theres something really harmful about a little thing like a cigarette its a little unnerving to watch an addiction at work like that sometimes i looked the other way smiling nonchalantly story of my life i guess i dont mean anything at all maybe none of us do right one minute were here and the next were gone i glanced at my wrist and then remembered id deliberately left my wristwatch back at the hotel bloody wristwatch i keep forgetting i pawned it where is this fellow goerz anyway shouldnt he be here by now hell be here when hes here said feigenbaum and then still smoking my cigarette he walked away erich goerz arrived a few minutes after that he was accompanied by his tall driver and another muscularlooking man goerz was smoking the same pungent french cigarettes and under a gray gabardine coat wearing the same green suit a hat sat on the back of his head like a felt halo and in his hand was the lead for the same invisible dog immediately after he appeared men started to crowd around him as if hed been about to deliver the sermon on the mount and his two disciples extended their thick arms to prevent goerz from being jostled i pushed a bit closer myself keen to seem like i was as needful of work as anyone else stand back you kike bastards i can see you snarled goerz what do you think this is a beauty parade stand back i said i get pushed over like last week and none of you yids will work today got that right listen to me you kikes i need just ten gangs today ten gangs a hundred men hear you wheres that money you owe me i told you not to show your face back here until you can pay me how can i pay you if i cant work said a plaintive voice you should have thought of that before said goerz i dont know how sell your whore of a sister or something what do i care the two disciples grabbed the man and pushed him out of goerzs line of sight you goerz was speaking to someone else now how much did you get for those copper pipes the man hed spoken to mumbled something back give goerz snarled and snatched some notes out of the mans hand with all this business concluded at last he started to choose men for the work gangs and as each gang was filled the men left unpicked began to look more and more desperate which only seemed to delight goerz he was like some capricious schoolboy selecting classmates for an important game of football as the last gang came to be filled one man said ill give you an extra two for my shift ill kick in three the man next to him said and was promptly rewarded with one of the tickets a disciple handed to those lucky men whom goerz had identified as those who would work that day one day left he said grinning broadly who wants it feigenbaum pushed his way to the front of the large crowd of men still encircling goerz please herr goerz he said give me a break its been a week since i had a day i need a day real bad ive got three kids thats the trouble with you jews youre like rabbits no wonder people hate your guts goerz looked at me you boxer he snatched the last ticket from the hand of his disciple and then thrust it at me heres a job i felt bad but i took the ticket all the same avoiding feigenbaums eye as i followed the rest of the men whod been picked back down the steps to the riverbank there were about thirty or forty steps and they were as steep as jacobs ladder which was perhaps the intention of the prussian emperor william iv whose romantic ideas of chivalry had brought that peculiar monument into being i was almost twothirds of the way down the steps when i caught sight of the truck that was waiting to drive erich goerzs illegal workforce to the site at the same time i heard some footsteps closing behind me this was no angel it was goerz he took a swing at me with a cosh which missed and like jacob i was obliged to wrestle with him for a moment before i lost my footing and fell down the remainder of the steps and hit my head on the stone wall i felt as if i had been lying on a concertsized harp while someone had struck it hard with a sledgehammer every part of me seemed to vibrate wildly for a moment i lay there staring up at the earlymorning sky with the certain knowledge that unlike hitler god has a sense of humor it was in the psalms after all he who sits in the heavens shall laugh how else was i to explain the fact that in order to claim for himself the shift given to me feigenbaum a jew had almost certainly informed the antisemitic goerz that i had been asking questions about isaac and joey deutsch he who sits in the heavens was laughing all right that was enough to make me split my sides i closed my eyes in prayer to ask him if there was something he had against germans but the answer was all too obvious and opening my eyes again i found there was no perceptible difference between having them open and having them closed except that my eyelids now seemed like the heaviest thing in the world so heavy they felt like they were made of stone perhaps the stone over a deep dark cold tomb the kind of stone that even jacobs angel could not have wrestled away forever and ever amen hedda adlon always said that for her to run a truly great hotel the guests needed to be asleep for sixteen hours a day during the other eight they should be resting quietly in the bar that sounded just fine with me i wanted to sleep for a long time and preferably in noreens bed i might have done too except for the fact that she was trying to put out her cigarette in the small of my back thats what it felt like anyway i tried to shift away and then something struck me hard across the head and shoulders i opened my eyes to discover that i was sitting on a wooden floor covered with sawdust and tied with my back to a freestanding faience stoveone of those ceramic heaters shaped like a public drinking fountain that sits in the corner of many a german living room like some senile relation in a rocking chair since i was seldom ever home the stove in my own living room was seldom lit and was therefore seldom ever warm but even through my jacket this one felt hotter than the smokestack on a busy steam tug i arched my back trying to minimize the point of contact with the hot ceramic and succeeded only in burning my hands hearing my cry of pain erich goerz once again set about lashing me with the dog lead at least now i knew why he carried it no doubt he saw himself as a sort of overseer like that egyptian slave driver murdered by moses in exodus i wouldnt have minded murdering goerz myself when he stopped beating me i looked up and saw that he had my identity card in his hands and cursed myself for not leaving it back at the hotel in the pocket of my suit standing a few feet behind him were goerzs tall cadaverouslooking driver and the squaresized man from the monument he had a face like an unfinished piece of marble sculpture bernhard gunther said goerz it says here youre a hotel employee but that you used to be a cop whats a hotel employee doing around here asking questions about isaac deutsch untie me and ill tell you tell me and then ill untie you maybe i saw no reason not to tell him the truth no reason at all torture will do that to you sometimes one of the guests at the hotel is an american reporter i said shes writing a newspaper article about jews in german sports and isaac deutsch in particular she wants to bring about a us boycott of the olympiad and shes paying me to help her do the research i grimaced and tried to ignore the heat in my back which was a little like trying to ignore a minor imp in hell armed with a hot pitchfork and my name on his days work sheet thats bullshit said goerz its bullshit because i read the newspapers which is how i happen to know that the american olympic committee already voted against a boycott he raised the dog lead and started to beat me again shes a jew i yelled through the blows she thinks that if she writes the truth about whats happening in this country to people like isaac deutsch then the amis will have to change their minds deutsch is the focus of her piece how he got kicked out of his local boxing association and how he ended up working here and how there was an accident i dont know what happened exactly he drowned didnt he in the sbahn tunnel was it and then someone dumped him in the canal on the other side of the city goerz stopped beating me he looked out of breath he swept his hair out of his eyes straightened his tie swung the leash around his neck and then hung on it with both hands and how did you find out about him an excolleague a bull at the alex showed me the body in the morgue and gave me the file thats all i used to work homicide see theyd run out of ideas on who the guy might be and figured i might offer a new perspective goerz looked at his driver and laughed shall i tell you what i think he said i think you used to be a cop and i think you still are a secret cop gestapo ive never seen anyone who looked less like a hotel employee than you do my friend ill bet thats just a cover story so you can go around spying on people and more important on us its the truth i tell you look i know you didnt kill deutsch it was an accident that much was clear from the autopsy you see he couldnt have drowned in the canal because his lungs were full of seawater thats what made the polenta suspicious in the first place there was an autopsy it was the squarelooking manthe living sculpturewho spoke you mean they cut him open of course there was an autopsy you dumb schmuck thats the law where do you think this is the belgian congo when a bodys found a body has to be investigated surgically and circumstantially but when they finished with him theyd have given him a proper burial right i groaned with pain and shook my head burials are for otto normals i said not unidentified bodies there s been no identification not formally no one claimed him see im only investigating it because the ami woman wanted to find out about the guy the polenta doesnt know shit about him as far as i know the body went to the charité hospital to the anatomy class the kids with the forceps and the lancets got to play with him you mean medical students i dont mean students of political economy you stupid bastard of course medical students i was beginning to see that this was a sensitive subject to the man with the jaw that looked as if it had been cut from a piece of marble but with my tongue loosened from the pain i was feeling from the heat of the stove i kept on talking regardless by now theyll have sliced him open and used his dick to make an oxtail soup his skulls probably an ashtray on some students desk what do you care hermann youre the people who dumped the poor bastard in the canal like a pail of restaurant garbage the squarelooking man with the marble chin shook his head grimly i thought at least hed get a decent burial i told you decent burials are for citizens not floaters it seems to me that the only person whos tried to treat isaac deutsch with any respect is my client i tried to twist away from the stove but it was no good i was beginning to feel like jan hus your client erich goerzs voice was full of contempt like some grand inquisitor he started to beat me again the dog lead whistled through the air like a flail i felt like a dusty rug at the adlon youre going to tell us exactly who the hell you are thats enough said the squarelooking man with the marble chin i didnt see what happened next i was too busy pressing my chin into my chest and closing my eyes trying to ride out the pain of the beating all i know is that suddenly the beating stopped and goerz hit the floor in front of me with blood pouring from the side of his mouth i looked up just in time to see marble jaw neatly sidestep a big haymaker from goerzs driver before lifting him off his toes with a fist that came flying up from the basement like an express elevator the driver went down like a tower of wooden blocks which was as satisfying to me as if i had toppled him myself marble jaw took a breath and then started to untie me im sorry i said for what for what i said about your nephew isaac i pulled the ropes away and wrestled my back clear of the stove im right arent i you are isaacs uncle joey he nodded and helped me to stand the back of your coats scorched through he said i cant see what your back looks like but it cant be too bad otherwise we could probably smell it theres a comforting thought by the way thanks for helping me i put my arm around his huge shoulder and straightened painfully hes had that coming for a long time said joey im afraid all of what i said was true but im sorry you had to hear about it like that joey deutsch shook his head i suspected as much he said goerz told me different of course but in my guts i suppose i knew different i wanted to believe him for isaacs sake i guess i had to hear it from someone else for it sink in erich goerz rolled slowly onto his stomach and groaned thats quite an uppercut youve got on you joey i said come on ill get you home he hesitated can you stand by yourself yes joey bent down over the unconscious driver and retrieved a set of car keys from the mans waistcoat pocket well take erichs car he said just in case these two bastards come after us goerz groaned again and contracted slowly into a fetal position for a brief second i thought he might be having some sort of convulsion until i remembered what blask the site foreman had told me about the gun strapped to goerzs ankle only it wasnt strapped to his ankle anymore it was in his hand look out i yelled and kicked goerz in the head id meant to kick his hand but as i raised my foot i lost control and fell onto the floor again the pistol fired harmlessly breaking a windowpane i crawled over to goerz to look at him i hardly wanted another mans death on my conscience he was unconscious but fortunately for me and more especially him erich goerz was still breathing i retrieved my id card from the floor where he had tossed it angrily a few minutes earlier and picked up the pistol it was a bayard semiautomatic millimeter french cigarettes french gun i said makes sense i suppose i made the gun safe and pointed it at the door anyone else out there do you think i asked joey you mean like him no it was just these two the three truck drivers and im sorry to say me after isaac got killed they took me on the payroll as extra muscle they said but i guess it was just as much about ensuring that i kept my mouth shut as joey helped me walk to the door i got a better look at him and saw a man who didnt look much more jewish than i did the hair on the side of a head as big as a watermelon was gray but on top it was blond and as curly as an astrakhan coat the huge face was both florid and pasty like old bacon small brown eyes sat on either side of a broken nose that was sharp and pointy the eyebrows were almost invisible as were the teeth in his gaping mouth somehow he put me in mind of a mansized baby we went downstairs and i recognized that we were in the albert the bear there was no sign of a proprietor and i didnt ask outside the fresh morning air helped revive me a little i got into the passenger seat of the hanomag and almost destroying the gears deutsch quickly drove us away he was a terrible driver and narrowly missed colliding with a water trough on the corner it turned out that he lived not so very far away from me in the southeastern part of the city we dumped what was left of the hanomag in the car park of the cemetery on baruther strasse joey wanted to take me to a hospital but i told him i thought id probably be all right how about you i asked him me im all right you dont have to worry about me son i just cost you a job joey shook his head i shouldnt ever have taken it i lit us both a cigarette feel up to talking about it how do you mean my ami friend the journalist noreen charalambides shes the one writing about isaac i imagine shed like to speak to you to get your story and isaacs joey grunted without much enthusiasm for the idea given that hes got no actual grave it could be like a kind of memorial i said to his memory while joey considered this idea he puffed at the cigarette in his malletsized fist it looked more like a safety match not a bad idea at that he said finally bring her around this evening she can get the whole story if she doesnt mind slumming it he gave me an address in britz near the meatcanning factory i jotted it down on the inside of my cigarette pack does erich goerz know this address i asked nobody does theres just me that lives there now if you can call it living since isaac died ive let myself go a bit you know there doesnt seem to be much point in looking after the place now that hes gone not much point in anything at all really i know what thats like i said been a while since i had any visitors maybe i could tidy up a bit put things in order before dont put yourself to any trouble its no trouble he said quietly no trouble at all he nodded resolutely matter of fact i should have done it a while ago he walked away i found a phone booth and telephoned the adlon i told noreen some of it but not all the part about me spilling almost the whole story to erich goerz i didnt tell her the only consolation there was that i hadnt mentioned the name of the hotel where she was staying she said shed come right over iopened the door wide but not as wide as noreens eyes she stood there wearing a red dress underneath her sable coat and looking at me with a mixture of shock and bewilderment much as lotte must have looked upon discovering she had arrived in time to find that young werther had just succeeded in blowing his brains out assuming he had any brains my god she whispered touching my face what happened to you i just read a portion of ossian i said secondrate poetry always affects me this way she pushed me gently aside and closed the door behind her you should see me when im really affected by something good like schiller im bedridden for days she shrugged off her coat and tossed it onto a chair you might not want to do that i said i was trying not to feel embarrassed about the place but it wasnt easy its been a while since that chair was properly deloused do you have any iodine no but i have a bottle of kummel matter of fact i think ill have one myself i went over to the sideboard to pour a couple of drinks i didnt ask if she wanted one id seen her drink before while she waited she glanced around the living room had a sideboard an armchair and a folding table there was a high bookcase built into the walls and it was full of books several of which id read there were a stove and a small fireplace with an even smaller fire there was also a bed since the living room happened also to be the bedroom through an open doorway was a garbage area that was also the kitchen on the other side of the frosted kitchen window was a security grille and a fire escape just to make the mice feel safe next to the front door was the door to the bathroom only the bath was hanging upside down on the ceiling right above the lavatory where a man sitting there might contemplate the inconvenience of taking a bath in front of the fire the floor was linoleum throughout with a small collection of stampsized rugs some people might have thought it a bit of a dump but to me it was a palace or to be more accurate the meanest room in a palace the one where the servants kept their junk im waiting for my interior decorator to come back with a portrait of the leader i said after that it should look nice and cozy she took the drink i offered her and stared closely at my face that weal she said you should put something on it i pulled her closer how about your mouth do you have any vaseline whats that firstaid petroleum jelly hey listen ill live i was at the battle of amiens and im still here and believe me that takes some doing she shrugged and pulled away go ahead be tough but i had the funny idea i care for you which means i dont like it that youve been whipped if anyones going to whip you it ought to be me only ill make sure i dont leave any marks thanks ill bear it in mind anyway it wasnt a whip it was a dog leash you didnt mention a dog there wasnt a dog its my impression that goerz would prefer to carry a whip but people on the tram look at you a bit strangely when you go around with one of those in your hand even in berlin do you think he hits his jewish workers with it i shouldnt be at all surprised i tossed back the kummel held it on my tonsils for moment and then let it roll enjoying the warmth as it spread through my body meanwhile noreen found some chamomile ointment and anointed my more obvious wounds with it i think it made her feel better i poured myself another kummel which made me feel better we walked to a taxi rank and took a cab to the address in britz south of another modern apartment building called the horseshoe and next to the grossmann coburg cannedmeat factory was a decayed archway that was the entrance to a series of courtyards and tenement buildings of the kind that might convince any architect that he was some kind of messiah come to save people from their squalor and poverty personally i never minded a little squalor to be honest for a long time after the war i hardly noticed it passing through another archway we came upon a tatty sign for infrared health lamps painted onto the brickwork that seemed a little optimistic to say the least we mounted a dark stairway that led up into the buildings tomblike interior somewhere a barrel organ was churning out a melancholy tune that matched our lowering spirits a german tenement building could have sucked all the light out of the second coming halfway up the stairs we passed a woman who was on her way down there was a bicycle wheel in her hand and a loaf of bread under her arm a few steps behind her was a boy of about ten or eleven wearing the uniform of the hitler youth the woman smiled and nodded a little bow in noreens direction or as seemed more likely at the sable coat she was wearing this prompted noreen to ask if we were on the right flight of stairs for herr deutsch the woman with the bicycle wheel answered respectfully that it was and we carried on up stepping carefully around a second woman who was on her knees scrubbing the stairs with a heavy brush and something noxious in a bucket she had heard us ask about joey deutsch and as we moved past she said tell that jew its his turn to clean the stairs tell him yourself said noreen i did said the woman just now but he paid no notice didnt even come to the door which is why im doing it myself perhaps hes not in said noreen oh hes in there all right he must be i saw him go up there a while ago and i havent seen him come down besides his door is open she went at the steps with the brush for several seconds i expect hes avoiding me does he normally leave his front door open i asked suddenly suspicious what around here are you joking but i think he must be expecting someone you perhaps if your name is gunther theres a note stuck on the door we quickly went up the last two flights of stairs and stopped in front of a door once painted scarlet but now hardly painted at all unless you counted the yellow star and the words jews out with which someone had thoughtfully defaced it there was a blue envelope tacked onto the door frame it was addressed to me and the door was open just as the woman cleaning the stairs had said i put the envelope in my pocket and taking out erich goerzs pistol steered noreen behind me theres something not right here i said and pushed open the door as we went into the little apartment noreen reached up and touched a small brass plate on the door frame the mezuzah she said its a passage from the torah most jewish homes have one i worked the slide on the little automatic and stepped into the small hallway the apartment comprised two largish rooms to the left was a living room that was a shrine to boxing and one boxer in particular isaac deutsch in a glass cabinet were some ten or fifteen empty wooden trophy stands and several photographs of joey and isaac i imagined the trophies had been pawned a long time ago the walls were papered with boxing posters and piles of fight magazines were heaped around the room on a table were a very stale loaf of bread and a fruit bowl containing a couple of blackened bananas that were now a worlds fair of tiny flies a pair of ancientlooking boxing gloves hung from a nail on the back of the door and a selection of rusting weights lay next to a bar that was leaning against a wall above it was a length of rope from which were hanging a shirt and a broken umbrella there were a disemboweled armchair and behind it a fulllength mirror with a crack in the glass everything else was just junk herr deutsch my voice sounded tight in my chest like i had a cuckoo nesting between my two lungs its gunther are you home we went back through the hallway and into the bedroom where the curtains were drawn there was a strong smell of carbolic soap and disinfectant or so i thought anyway a big brass bed stood opposite a wardrobe the size of a small swiss bank vault joey is that you in the curtained gloom i saw the outline of a figure on the bed and felt my hair lift the back of my hat you spend ten years as a cop sometimes you know what youre going to see before you see it and you know that its not everyone who can look it straight in the eye noreen i said i think joeys killed himself well only find out for sure when i draw the curtains and read that note maybe youre the kind of writer who feels she needs to see everything who thinks she has a duty to report everything unflinchingly i dont know but its my opinion that you need to brace yourself or leave the room ive seen enough bodies in my time to know that its never ive seen a dead body before bernie i told you about that lynching in georgia and my father he killed himself with a shotgun you dont forget that in a hurry i can tell you reflecting that it was interesting how quickly my concern to spare her feelings turned to something like sadism i yanked the curtains open with no more argument she wanted to play at being turgenev it was all right with me joey deutsch lay across his bed still wearing the same clothes i had seen him in earlier he was half twisted up off the mattress as if some of the springs had burst out of the material under the small of his back he was cleanshaven as beforeonly now it looked as if he were wearing a brown mustache and a small beard these were corrosive burns and the result of whatever he had swallowed to poison himself a bottle lay on the floor where he had dropped it and next to this was a pool of bloody vomit i picked the bottle up carefully and sniffed at the open neck lye i told her but she had already turned away and was leaving the room i followed her into the hallway he drank lye jesus what a way to kill yourself noreen had pressed her face into a corner of the entrance hall like a disobedient child her arms were folded defensively across her chest and her eyes were closed i lit a couple of cigarettes tapped her on the elbow and gave her one i didnt say anything whatever i might have said would have sounded like i told you so still smoking i went back into the living room on top of a pile of fight magazines was a small leather writing folder inside were some envelopes and notepaper that matched the note addressed to me so did the ink in the pelikan hed replaced in the little cylindrical leather sleeve there was nothing that made me suspect anyone had forced him to write the note the writing was neat and unhurried id had love letters that were much less legible although not for a long time i read it carefully as if joey deutsch had meant something to me it seemed like the least i could do for a dead man then i read it again what does it say noreen was standing in the doorway in her hand was a handkerchief and in her eyes were some tears i held the note out to her here i watched her read it wondering what was going through her mind if she actually felt anything for the poor guy whod just killed himself or if she was just relieved to have found an end for her story and a good excuse to go home if that sounds cynical maybe it was but the truth was that her leaving berlin was all i could think about now because for the first time i realized i was in love with her and when youre in love with someone you think might be about to leave you its easier to be cynical just to protect yourself from the pain you know is coming she offered the note back why dont you keep it i said although he never met you i think he really meant you to have it for your newspaper article i kind of sold him on the idea that your piece could be a kind of memorial to isaac it will be i think why not she took the letter but what about the police wont they need this its evidence isnt it what do they care i shrugged maybe youve forgotten how anxious they were to find out what happened to isaac all the same perhaps we ought to get out of here before we have to wait around and answer questions we might not want to answer like how come ive got a gun without a license and why ive got the mark of a dog leash across my face the neighbors she said that woman on the stairs suppose they tell the police about us the note she knows your name ill square her on the way out ten marks buys a lot of silence in this part of berlin besides you saw the door these neighbors dont exactly strike me as very neighborly its my impression that theyll be glad to see joey dead and out of this building and what do you think the polenta would do with a note like that print it in the newspaper i dont think so most likely theyll destroy it no its best you keep it noreen for joeys sake and isaacs too i guess youre right gunther but i wish you werent i get that i glanced around the miserable apartment and let out a sigh who knows maybe hes better off out of it you cant believe that i dont see things improving for jews in this country there are a bunch of new laws coming that will make things even tougher for anyone whos not properly german as they see it thats what ive heard anyway ahead of the olympics didnt i mention it you know you didnt i shrugged i suppose i didnt want to put a dent in your optimism angel that something can be done maybe i was hoping that some of your lefty idealism would rub off on me along with your pants and stockings and did it not this particular morning in the early evening i accompanied noreen back to the hotel she went up to her room for a bath and an early night the discovery of joey deutschs body had left noreen emotionally and physically exhausted i had a good idea how she felt i was on my way to my office when franz joseph called me over and after some polite inquiries about the marks on my face told me he had a package for me from otto trettin at the alex i knew it was the chinese box belonging to max reles just the same when i got to my desk i opened it up to see what all the fuss had been about it looked like a paperclip box for a chinese emperor i suppose it was quite attractive if you like that kind of thing i prefer something in sterling silver with a matching table lighter on a black lacquer lid outlined in gold was a brightly painted arcadian scene featuring a lake some mountains a handsome weeping willow a cherry tree a fisherman a couple of mounted archers a coolie carrying a large bag of hotel laundry and a group of fu manchu types in the local noodle house who seemed to be discussing the yellow peril and the finer points of white slavery i expect you never got tired of looking at it if you lived in seventeenthcentury china unless there was some paint you could watch getting dry it had the feel of a cheap souvenir from a day trip to luna park i opened it and inside were a number of contracttender letters from companies as far afield as würzburg and bremerhaven i glanced over them without much interest i put these in my pocket to irritate reles with their apparent loss in case they were important to him and went up to his suite i knocked on the door it was answered by dora bauer she was wearing a light brown gingham pleated dress with a matching cape collar and a large pussycat bow on the shoulder her hair had a wave as big as a tsunami that swept all the way across her forehead and down to an eyebrow as thin as a spiders leg a bow mouth that was more clara than cupid parted in a smile as wide as a welcome mat the smile turned painful as she noticed the weal on my face oooh what happened to you otherwise she seemed pleased to see me unlike reles who ambled over behind her wearing his usual expression of contempt i had the chinese box at my back and was looking forward to handing it over after the usual litany of insults i had the vain hope i might embarrass him or make him eat his words if it isnt the continental op he said i dont have much time for detective stories i said i suppose youre too busy reading the leaders book i dont have much time for his stories either you want to be careful saying disrespectful things like that you could get hurt he frowned and searched my face maybe you already did or did you just pick a fight with another hotel guest thats more your level id say somehow i dont see you as the heroic type max please dora sounded scolding but that was as far as it went youd be surprised what im called to do in the line of duty herr reles i said squeeze the eggs of a fellow who doesnt pay his bill flick the ear of some barfly slap a garter handler in the mouth hell ive even been known to recover stolen property i brought my arm around and handed him the box as if it had been a bunch of flowers a bunch of five was what i felt like giving him well ill be damned you found it you really were a cop werent you he took the box and backing away from the door waved me in come on in gunther dora get herr gunther a drink will you whatll you have detective schnapps scotch vodka he pointed out a series of bottles on the sideboard thank you schnapps would be good i closed the door behind me watching him carefully for the moment he opened the box and when he did i had the satisfaction of noticing a small wince of disappointment thats a pity he said what is sir only that there was some money and correspondence in this box and now its not there you didnt mention the contents before sir i shook my head would you like me to inform the police sir that was two sirs in a row maybe it was still possible i could hold down a career in hotel keeping after all he smiled irritably it really doesnt matter i suppose ice dora was standing over a bucket containing a piece of ice with a pick in her hand looking more than a little like lady macbeth ice in schnapps i shook my head no i dont think so dora stabbed the ice a couple of times and placed a few shards in a large tumbler glass which she handed to reles american habit said reles we put ice in everything but i kind of like it in schnapps you should try it sometime dora handed me a smaller glass of schnapps i was watching her now for some sign that she might be up to her old whores tricks but there didnt seem to be anything between them that i could see she even shied away a little when he came too close the typewriter looked like it was still as busy as always the wastepaper basket was overflowing i toasted reles down the hatch he said and took a large mouthful of icecold schnapps i sipped mine like a dowager and we faced each other in awkward silence i waited a moment then tossed back the rest well if thats all detective he said we have work to do dont we fräulein bauer i handed dora the glass and headed for the door reles was there ahead of me to open it and speed me on my way and thanks again he said for recovering my property i appreciate it for what its worth youve restored my faith in the german people ill be sure to tell them that sir he chuckled thought of a retaliatory remark appeared to think better of it and then waited patiently for me to make my exit from his suite thanks for the drink sir he nodded and closed the door behind me i hurried along the landing and down the stairs crossing the entrance hall i went into the switchboard room where under a high window four girls were sitting on high chairs in front of what looked like a doublesized upright piano behind them was a desk where hermine the switchboard supervisor sat watching the hotels hello girls as they went about the voluble business of connecting telephone calls she was a prim woman with short red hair and a complexion as pale as milk seeing me hermine stood up and then frowned that mark on your face she said it looks very much like a whip mark several of her girls looked around and laughed i went riding with hedda adlon i said listen hermine the party in herr reles i want a list of everyone he calls this evening does herr behlert know youre asking i shook my head i went a little closer to the switchboard and hermine followed attentively he wouldnt like you spying on the guests herr gunther i think youll need to get his written permission its not spying its snooping im paid to snoop remember to keep you and me and the guests safe although not necessarily in that order maybe but if he found you listening in on herr reless calls hed have our hides putting you through now herr reles said ingrid who was one of the bestlooking of the adlons hello girls herr reles hes on a call now to whom ingrid exchanged a look with hermine come on ladies this is important if hes a crookand i think he iswe need to know about it hermine nodded her approval potsdam said ingrid whos that i waited for a moment hermine nodded again thats count von helldorfs number said ingrid at the potsdam police praesidium anywhere else but the adlon i might have persuaded them to let me eavesdrop on that call but short of a spot lamp and a set of brass knuckles id had all that i was going to get out of the hello girls standards might have been compromised in other berlin institutions such as the police the courts and the churches but not at its best hotel so i went back to my office to smoke some cigarettes have a couple of drinks and take another look at the papers i had taken from the chinese box i had the curious idea these were more important to max reles than the box itself but my mind was elsewhere a telephone call made by max reles to von helldorf so soon after i had seen the american was disturbing was it possible their topic of conversation had been me and if so to what effect there were good reasons why von helldorf might be useful to a man such as max reles and vice versa formerly the leader of berlins sa count wolfheinrich graf von helldorf had been the police president of berlin for just three months when a notorious scandal interrupted his progress to higher office he had always been an enthusiastic gambler and a rumored pederast with a taste for the flagellation of young boys he was also a close friend of erik hanussen the famous clairvoyant who it was supposed had paid off the counts very substantial gambling debts in return for an introduction to the leader much of what happened thereafter was still the subject of speculation and mystery but it seemed that hitler was strongly impressed by the man berlins communists called the peoples stupefier as a result of hitlers open favor hanussens influence over senior party members including von helldorf became even greater yet all was not quite what it seemed hanussens leverage within the party was it was to be revealed the result not of good advice nor even of mesmeric power but blackmail at lavish sex parties he had hosted aboard his yacht the ursel iv hanussen had hypnotized several leading nazis and subsequently filmed them taking part in sexual orgies that was bad enough but some of these orgies were homosexual orgies it is possible berlins famous clairvoyant might have survived all of this but when goebbelss newspaper der angriff revealed that hanussen was a jew the shit really ended up on the conveyor belt with most of it headed hitlers way suddenly hanussen had become an acute embarrassment and von helldorf held largely responsible was required to clean up the mess several days after hermann goering dismissed him as berlins police president von helldorf and some of his more murderous sa friends abducted hanussen from his lavish apartment in berlins westend drove him to his yacht and tortured him there until hanussen gave them all of the compromising material he had amassed over several months debt receipts letters photographs and ciné film then they shot him and dumped the body on a field in mühlenbeck somewhere north of berlin anyway rumors persisted that von helldorf had used some of the material he had obtained from hanussen to secure himself a new position as police president of potsdaman unimportant town about an hour southwest of berlin where it is said beer goes to turn flat von helldorf now spent most of his time there breeding horses and organizing the continuing persecution of those social democrats and german communists who had most offended the nazis during the last days of the republic and it was generally supposed that in this respect von helldorf was largely motivated by the hope he might eventually manage to restore himself to hitlers full favor i knew von helldorf was also on the german olympic organizing committee of course which said something about the success of his attempt to put himself back in favor with hitler although i wasnt quite sure exactly what he did on the committee possibly that was just payback from his old sa pal von tschammer und osten possibly since goerings departure from the ministry of the interior he was in better odor there too in spite of everything von helldorf was not a man to be taken anything but seriously my attack of nerves lasted only a short while however as long as it took for the alcohol to kick in after a few drinks i persuaded myself that since there was really nothing about the letters and business estimates i had taken from the chinese box that could prove anything in a court of law then there was no need for me to feel concerned there wasnt anything i had seen that could have harmed a man like max reles besides reles couldnt know it had been i who had taken these papers and not ilse szrajbman so i put the papers and the gun in my desk drawer and decided to head home thinking like noreen to have an early night myself i was tired and i ached in every conceivable part of my body leaving behlerts car where i had parked it earlier i walked south down hermanngoeringstrasse to catch a tram on potsdamer platz it was dark and a little windy and the nazi banners hanging on the brandenburg gate were flapping around like danger flags as if our imperial past were trying to warn us about something in our nazi present even a stray dog trotting along the pavement ahead of me stopped and turned to look at me dolefully perhaps to ask if i had a solution to our countrys problems then again he might just have been trying to avoid the open door of the black w that had pulled up a few meters ahead a man wearing a brown leather coat got out of the car and walked quickly toward me instinctively i turned to walk in the opposite direction and discovered my retreat blocked by a man wearing a thick doublebreasted overcoat and a lowbrimmed hat although it was the neat little bow tie i noticed most at least until i noticed the beer token in his paw come with us please the other man in the leather coat was right behind me now so that sandwiched between them i couldnt very well have resisted like experienced window dressers moving a tailors dummy they folded me into the car and jumped in the backseat on either side of me we were moving before they had even slammed the car doors if this is about that cop i said august krichbaum wasnt it i thought wed sorted out that bullshit i mean you checked my alibi i had nothing to do with it you know that after a few moments i realized we were going west along charlottenburger strasse in completely the opposite direction from alexanderplatz i asked where we were going but neither of them spoke the drivers hat was made of leather so were his ears probably by the time we reached berlins famous radio tower and turned onto the avusberlins fastest roadi had guessed where we were driving the driver bought a ticket and we sped toward wannsee station a few years before fritz von opel had set a speed record on the avus driving a rocketpowered car at almost kilometers an hour we werent driving anything nearly as fast as that but neither did i get the impression that we were likely to stop anywhere for coffee and cake at the end of the avus we drove through some woods onto the glienecke bridge and although it was very dark i could just make out that we had passed two castles shortly after that we entered potsdam on new königstrasse surrounded by the havel and its lakes potsdam wasnt much more than an island and i couldnt have felt more lonely if id been marooned on some desert atoll with a solitary palm tree and a parrot for more than a hundred years the town had been the headquarters of the prussian army but it might as well have been the headquarters of the girl guides for all the help the army was going to give me i was about to become the prisoner of count von helldorf and there was nothing anyone could do about it one of the buildings in potsdam was the palace called sanssouci which is french for without care i was a long way from a state of mind like that as we drove past another castle and a parade ground i caught a glimpse of a street sign we were on priest strasse and i was beginning to think i might have need of one as we turned into the courtyard of the local police praesidium entering the building we went up several flights of stairs and along a cold dimly lit corridor to a handsomely appointed office with a nice view of the havel which i recognized only because there was an even more handsomely appointed motor yacht floating on it just below the leaded window and lit up like a ride at luna park in the office a tree was burning in an open fireplace where you could have roasted a whole ox there were a big hanging tapestry a portrait of hitler and a suit of armor that looked about as stiff as the man standing beside it he was wearing the uniform of a police general and an air of aristocratic superiority as if he should have preferred that my shoes had been removed before i was allowed to walk on his parksized persian rug i suppose he was about the same age as i but there the similarity ended when he spoke his tone was careworn and exasperated and he gave me the impression i had caused him to miss the beginning of an opera or more likely in his case a queerish cabaret turn on a log cabin of a desk a backgammon set was laid out for a game and in his hand was a little leather cup containing a pair of dice that every now and then he would rattle nervously like some mendicant friar please sit down he said the man in the leather coat pushed me into a seat at a meeting table and then pushed a pen and a sheet of paper toward me he seemed to be good at pushing things sign it he said what is it i asked its a d said the man an order for protective custody i used to be a cop myself i said at the alex and i never heard of a d what does it mean leather coat glanced at von helldorf who replied if you sign it it means you agree to be sent to a concentration camp i dont want to go to a concentration camp as a matter of fact i dont want to be here either no offense but its been a hell of a day signing a d doesnt mean you will be sent to a camp explained von helldorf what it means is that you agree to go forgive me sir but i dont agree von helldorf rocked on the heels of his jackboots and rattled the dice box behind his back you could say that once its signed it acts as a guarantee of your good behavior he said your future good behavior do you see yes but equally and with all due respect to yourself general it could just as easily result in my being taken from here to the nearest camp dont get me wrong i could use a holiday id like to sit around for a couple of weeks and catch up on my reading but from what ive heard theres not much concentration thats possible in a concentration camp a lot of what you say is quite true herr gunther said von helldorf however if you dont sign you will be kept here in a police cell until you agree to do so so as you can see you really dont have much choice in the matter so in other words im damned if i do and damned if i dont in a manner of speaking yes i dont suppose theres a piece of paper i have to sign before i can be kept in a police cell is there im afraid not but let me repeat signing the d doesnt mean you will go to a camp the fact is herr gunther this government is doing its best to be more sparing with the use of protective custody you may be aware that oranienburg concentration camp has recently closed for example also that the leader has signed an amnesty affecting political prisoners on august seventh this year all of which makes perfect sense given that almost everyone in the country is now inclined to favor his inspired leadership indeed it is even hoped that in time all of the concentration camps will disappear like oranienburg nevertheless continued von helldorf there may come a stage in the future when shall we say the security of the state is endangered at which time anyone subject to a d will be arrested and incarcerated without recourse to the judicial system yes i can understand how that might be useful good good which leaves us with the subject of your own d perhaps if i knew the reason you feel i need to give a guarantee of my own good behavior i said then i might be more inclined to sign such a thing von helldorf frowned and looked sternly at the three men who had brought me all the way from the adlon do you mean to tell me he hasnt been told why hes been brought here leather coat shook his head his hat was off now and i had a clearer idea of him as a human being he looked like a gorilla all i was told sir was that we should pick him up and bring him here immediately von helldorf rattled the dice box irritably as if he wished it had been leather coats skull it seems i have to do everything myself herr gunther he said and walked toward me while i waited for him to arrive i rolled my eyeballs around the room which was set up for the playboy prince of ruritania on one wall was a geometry set of foils and sabers beneath this was an oceangoing sideboard that was home to a radio as big as a tombstone and a silver tray with more bottles and decanters than the cocktail bar at the adlon a doublefront secretaire was full of leatherbound books and a few of them were about the laws of criminal evidence and procedure but mostly they were classics of german literature such as zane grey p c wren booth tarkington and anita loos police work never looked so leisured and comfortable von helldorf drew out one of the heavy dining chairs around the table sat down and leaned against a carved back that had more tracery than a window in a gothic cathedral then he laid his hands on the desk as if he had been about to play the piano either way he had my full attention as you possibly know im on the german olympic organizing committee he said its my job to ensure the security not just of all the people who will be coming to berlin in but also of all the people who are involved in making sure everything is ready in time there are several hundred contractors which presents something of a logistical nightmare if what looks like an almost impossible deadline is to be met now given the fact that we have less than two years to get everything up and ready i dont think anyone will be surprised to learn that there are times when mistakes get made or when standards have to be compromised all the same its awkward for some of these contractors when in spite of doing their very best they feel that theyve become the subject of scrutiny by elements who lack the same enthusiasm for the olympic project as everyone else indeed it could be argued that some of these elements are behaving in a way that might easily be construed as unpatriotic and ungerman do you see what i mean yes i said by the way general do you mind if i smoke he nodded and i tossed one onto my lip and lit it quickly marveling at von helldorfs talent for quietly spoken understatement but i wasnt about to mistake or underestimate him underneath the velvet glove was i felt certain a substantial fist and even if the general wasnt prepared to hit me with it himself i figured there were others in that absurdly large room who lacked his wellbred scruples about using violence to put it bluntly herr gunther a number of people are upset that you and your jewish lady friend mrs charalambides have been asking a lot of awkward questions about this dead jewish laborer herr deutsch and the unfortunate dr rubusch very upset indeed im told you actually assaulted a gang master who supplies labor for a new sbahn tunnel is that right yes thats quite correct i said i did however in my defense i should point out that he assaulted me first the mark on my face was given to me by him he says this only happened because you attempted to subvert his workforce von helldorf rattled the dice in the box impatiently im not sure that subvert is the right description of what i did sir how would you describe it i wanted to discover how isaac deutschthat jewish laborer you mentionedmet his death and if it was as i had supposed the result of his being illegally employed on the olympic site so that mrs charalambides might write about it when she gets back home to america is that right yes sir von helldorf frowned you puzzle me herr gunther dont you want your country to put on a good show in front of the rest of the world are you a patriotic german or not i like to think im as patriotic as the next man sir only it strikes me that our policy with regard to the jews isinconsistent and you want this exposed with what aim so that all those jewish workers might lose their jobs because they will if mrs charalambides writes about this in her american newspaper i can guarantee it no sir thats not what i want its just that i dont agree with our jewish policy in the first place thats neither here nor there most people in germany do agree with it even so that policy has to be tempered with what is practical and the fact remains that it simply isnt feasible to get the project finished in time without employing a few jewish workers he put it so matteroffactly i could hardly disagree i shrugged i suppose not sir you suppose right he said you simply cant go around making an issue about this its not realistic herr gunther and i simply cant allow it which is where the d comes in im afraid as a guarantee that you will put an end to this habit youve developed of sticking your nose in where it isnt wanted it all sounded so reasonable i was actually tempted to sign his d just in order to actually be able to return home and go to bed i had to hand it to von helldorf he was a smooth operator quite possibly he had learned more from erik hanussen the clairvoyant than merely his own lucky number and color perhaps he had also learned how to persuade people to do something they didnt want to do such as signing a document saying that you agreed to be sent to a concentration camp maybe that just made von helldorf a typical nazi quite a few of themgoebbels goering and hitler most of allseemed to have a flair for persuading germans to go against their own common sense reflecting that it might be a while before i got to smoke again i took a couple of hurried puffs and then stubbed out my cigarette in a smokedglass ashtray the same color as von helldorfs lying eyes and this was just enough time for me to remember the day id looked in on the reichstag fire trial and how many nazi liars id seen in court and how everyone had loudly bravod the biggest liar of them all hermann goering seldom had i found being a german so unattractive as on that particular day of lies with all of that in mind i felt obliged to tell von helldorf to go to hell except that i didnt of course i was rather more polite about it theres bravery after all and then theres downright stupidity im sorry general but i cant sign that document itd be like a goose writing someone a christmas card besides i happen to know that all of those poor fellows who were in oranienburg got sent on to a concentration camp in lichtenberg the general upended the dice box onto the table in front of him and inspected the result as if it mattered maybe it did and i simply didnt know it maybe if hed thrown a couple of sixes that might have been lucky for mehe might have let me go as it was hed thrown only a one and a two he closed his eyes and sighed take him away he told the man in the leather coat well see if a night in the cells cant change your mind herr gunther his men picked me up by the shoulders on my suit and sleepwalked me out of von helldorfs office to my surprise we went up another floor a room with a view is that it all our cells have a nice view of the havel said leather coat tomorrow if you dont sign that paper well give you a swimming lesson off the bow of the counts yacht thats all right i can swim already leather coat laughed not off the yacht you wont not after we tie you to the anchor they put me in a cell and locked the door a lock on the wrong side of the door is one of the things that remind you that its a cell youre in and not a hotel room that and a few bars on the window and a stinking mattress on a damp floor the cell had all the usual amenities like an ensuite bucket but it was the little things that reminded me i wasnt staying at the adlon little things like the cockroaches although really these were little only by the standard of the zeppelinsized roaches wed encountered in the trenches its said that human beings will never starve on this planet if they can learn how to eat a cockroach but try telling that to someone whos ever stepped on a roach or awoken in the night to find one crawling on his face freud had invented a technique used in psychology called free association somehow i knew that if i got through this i was forever after going to associate cockroaches with nazis they left me alone for several days which was better than a beating of course this gave me plenty of time to think about noreen and to worry that she would be worried about me what would she think what did anyone think when a loved one disappeared off the streets of berlin and into a concentration camp or a police jail the experience gave me a new understanding of what it was to be a jew or a communist in the new germany but mostly i worried about myself did they really intend to throw me in the havel if i refused to sign the d and if i did sign it could i trust von helldorf not to send me to a camp straightaway when i wasnt worrying about myself i reflected on how thanks to von helldorf i knew something more about the death of isaac deutsch than i had before i knew that his corpse was somehow connected with the corpse of dr heinrich rubusch so was it possible that his death in a room at the adlon hotel had been the result of something other than natural causes but what i never saw a more naturallooking corpse the two cops who had investigated the case rust and brandt had told me that the cause of death had been a cerebral aneurysm had they lied and max releswhat was his involvement in all of this since my incarceration in a potsdam police cell seemed to owe everything to a telephone call max reles had placed to count von helldorf i had to assume that the american was somehow implicated in the deaths of both men and that this had something to do with olympic bids and contracts reles had somehow been informed of my interest in deutsch and had assumed incorrectly that this was connected with my recovery of the stolen chinese lacquer boxor more accurately with the contents of that chinese box given the involvement of the notoriously corrupt von helldorf it seemed i had stumbled onto a conspiracy that involved a variety of people from the goc and the ministry of the interior how else could one explain how artifacts from berlins ethnographical museum were being given to max reles so that he might send them to avery brundage on the aoc in return for his continuing opposition to an american boycott of the berlin games if all of this was true then i was in a lot more trouble than i had realized when id been lifted off herman goering strasse by von helldorfs men and by the fourth or perhaps the fifth day of my imprisonment i was beginning to regret not taking a gamble on von helldorfs word and signing the despecially when i recalled his reasonable tone from my cell window i could see and hear the havel between the south wall of the prison was a line of trees and beyond it the sbahn line to berlin which ran along the riverbank and across a bridge into teltower sometimes the train and a steamboat traded hoots like goodnatured characters in a childrens story once i heard a military band playing somewhere to the west behind potsdams own lustgarten it rained a lot potsdam is green for a very good reason on the sixth day the door finally opened for longer than it took for me to slop out and be given a meal leather coat smiling quietly beckoned into the corridor outside my cell youre free to go he said what happened to your d he shrugged just like that i said those are my orders i rubbed my face thoughtfully i wasnt quite sure what was making it itch so much my urgent need for a razor or suspicion at this latest turn of events i had heard stories of people being shot while attempting to escape was this to be my fate a bullet in the back of the head as i walked along the corridor sensing my hesitation leather coats smile widenedas if he had guessed the reason for my hesitation in leaving but he said nothing to reassure me he looked as if he enjoyed my discomfort as if he had just watched me eat a very hot chili pepper and was now looking forward to seeing me suffer an attack of hiccups he lit a cigarette and stared at his fingernails for a moment what about my stuff youll get it downstairs thats what im worried about i picked up my jacket and put it on aw now youve hurt my feelings he said youll grow new ones when you get back under your stone he jerked his head down the corridor get moving gunther before we change our minds i walked ahead of him and it was just as well that i hadnt eaten that morningotherwise it wouldnt have been only my heart that was in my mouth my scalp was crawling as if i had one of the praesidiums cockroaches in my hair at any moment i expected to feel the cold barrel of a luger pressed against my cranium and to hear the sound of a shot abruptly curtailed as a hollowpoint gram round tunneled through my brain for a second i recalled seeing a german officer in shooting a belgian civilian suspected of leading an attack on our soldiers and the way the bullet had left his head looking like a burst football my legs felt like jelly but i forced them to march me along the corridor without stopping to look around and see if leather coat had a pistol in his hand at the top of the stairs the corridor kept on going and i paused awaiting his instructions downstairs said the voice behind me i turned and tramped down the steps my leather soles slapping against the stones like my heart on the walls of my chest it felt pleasantly cool on the stairwell a great blast of fresh air was coming up from the ground floor like a sea breeze and arriving there at last i saw a door open onto the central courtyard where several more police cars and vans were parked to my relief leather coat marched ahead of me now and led the way into a little office where my coat and hat my tie my braces and the contents of my pockets were returned to me i put a cigarette into my face and lit it before following him along another corridor and into a room the size of an abattoir the walls were covered with white bricks and on one was a large wooden crucifix for a moment i thought we were in some kind of chapel we turned a corner and i stopped in my tracks for there like a strangelooking table and chair was a shiny new falling ax constructed of dark polished oak and dullcolored steel the machine was about eight feet highjust a bit taller than an executioner wearing his customary top hat for a moment it sent such a chill through my body that i actually shivered and i had to remind myself that it was unlikely leather coat would have attempted to execute me by himself the nazis were hardly shortstaffed when it came to carrying out judicial murder i bet this is where you bring hitler youth in lieu of a bedtime story i said we thought youd like to see it leather coat uttered a dry little chuckle and stroked the wooden frame of the falling ax fondly just in case you were ever tempted to come back your hospitality overwhelms me i suppose this is what they mean when they talk about the people whove lost their heads to nazism but it might be just as well to remember the fate of almost all the french revolutionaries who were so keen on their guillotine danton desmoulins robespierre saintjust couthon they ended up going for a ride on it themselves he scraped the blade with the flat of his thumb and said as if i care what happened to a bunch of francies maybe you should i flicked my halfsmoked cigarette at the terrible machine and followed leather coat through another door and into a corridor this time i was pleased to see that it led out onto the street as a matter of idle curiosity why are you releasing me after all i never signed your d was it the thought of having to spell concentration camp or was it something else the law justice proper police procedure i know that sounds unlikely but i thought id ask anyway if i was you friend id count myself lucky just to be walking out of here oh i do only not as lucky as i count myself for the fact that youre not me that really would be depressing i tipped my hat to him and walked out of there a moment later i heard the door bang behind me it sounded a lot better than a luger but it still made me jump all the same it was raining but the rain looked good because there was only the open sky above it i took off my hat and lifted my unshaven face into the air the rain felt even better than it looked and i rubbed it across my chin and hair the same way id washed my face with it in the trenches rain it was something clean and free that fell from the sky and wasnt going to kill you but even while i celebrated the moment of my liberation i felt a tug at my sleeve and turned around to find a woman standing behind me she was wearing a long dark dress with a high belt a fawncolored raincoat and a small shelllike hat please sir she said quietly were you a prisoner in there perhaps i rubbed my chin again is it that obvious did you by chance come across another man by the name of dettmann ludwig dettmann im his wife i shook my head im sorry frau dettmann no i didnt see anyone at all but what makes you think hes in there she shook her head sadly i dont not anymore but when they arrested him this is where he was taken im sure of that at least she shrugged but afterward who knows no one thinks to tell his family anything he could be anywhere for all i know but no one thinks to tell his family anything several times ive been in that police station asking for information about my ludwig but they wont tell me whats happened to him theyve even threatened to arrest me if i go in there again might be one way of finding out i said glibly you dont understand i have three children and whats to become of them eh what is to become of them if im arrested too she shook her head nobody understands nobody wants to understand i nodded she was right of course i didnt understand no more than i understood what had persuaded von helldorf to order my release i walked through the lustgarten in front of the state castle was a bridge that led across the havel and over an island to the teltower tor station where i caught a train back to berlin washed and shaved and wearing a change of clothes i walked back into the adlon encountering both surprise and delight not to mention a certain amount of suspicion it wasnt unknown for staff to pull a sicky for a few days and then return with the same explanation as me sometimes it was even true behlert greeted me much as he might have greeted a tomcat returning home after an absence of several days and nights with a mixture of amusement and contempt where have you been he said scolding weve been worried about you herr gunther thank goodness your friend detective sergeant stahlecker has been able to take on some of your duties good im glad to hear it but even he was unable to find out what had happened to you no one at the police praesidium at alexanderplatz seemed to know anything its not at all like you to disappear like that what happened ive been staying at another hotel georg i told him the one run by the police in potsdam and i didnt enjoy it not one bit im thinking of walking around to that mer travel bureau on unter den linden and telling them not to recommend it any longer as a place to stay when youre in potsdam you can sleep much more comfortably in the river in fact i very nearly did behlert glanced uncomfortably around the mausoleumlike entrance hall please herr gunther keep your voice down or else someone will overhear and then well both be in trouble with the police i wouldnt be in trouble if it wasnt for the help of one of our guests georg who can you mean i might have mentioned the name of max reles but i saw no point in explaining exactly what had happened like the majority of lawabiding berliners behlert preferred to know as little as possible about those things that might get him into trouble and in a way i respected that given my own recent experiences it was probably the more sensible way to be so instead i said frau charalambides of course you know ive been working for her helping her write this article yes i did know and i cant say that i approved in my opinion it was wrong of frau adlon to ask you it put you in a very difficult position i shrugged that cant be helped not now is she in the hotel no he looked awkward i think perhaps you had better speak to frau adlon as a matter of fact she inquired about you only this morning i believe shes in her apartment upstairs has something happened to frau charalambides shes fine i can assure you shall i telephone frau adlon and suggest an appointment for you but sensing something was wrong i was already running upstairs outside heddas apartment i knocked and hearing her voice turned the handle and opened the door she was sitting on the sofa smoking a cigarette and reading a copy of fortune magazine which given she had one seemed only appropriate seeing me she threw fortune aside and stood up she looked relieved to see me thank goodness youre all right she said ive been worried about you i closed the door where is she gone home to new york said hedda she left on yesterdays boat from hamburg then i guess she wasnt as worried as you theres no need to be like that bernie its not how it is at all her leaving germany and promising not to write about the olympics was the price she paid to get you out of jail and quite possibly to keep you out of jail as well i see i walked over to the sideboard and picked up one of her decanters do you mind its been one of thoseweeks please help yourself hedda went over to her desk and opened the lid i poured one outquite a large one of whatever it was i didnt much careand sucked it down like it was a medicine id prescribed for myself it tasted horrible so i prescribed myself another and brought it back to the sofa she left you this hedda handed me an adlon envelope i slipped it into my pocket its my fault for getting you into this in the first place i shook my head i knew what i was doing even when i knew that what i was doing was perhaps ill advised noreen always did have that effect on people said hedda when we were both girls it was nearly always i who got caught for some infraction of the school rules and noreen who got away with it but i was never deterred by that i was always up for our next escapade perhaps i should have warned you about her i dont know maybe even now it feels like im the one who has to stay behind and make up her grades and offer an apology i knew what i was doing i repeated dully she drinks too much said hedda by way of an explanation she and nick her husband i assume she told you all about him some she drinks and it doesnt seem to affect her in the least everyone whos around her drinks and it affects them a great deal thats what happened to poor nick goodness he never drank at all until he met noreen shes very intoxicating i tried a smile but it didnt come out right i expect ill have a hangover before i get over it hedda nodded take a few days off why dont you the rest of the week if you like after five nights in jail you could probably use a break your friend herr stahlecker will cover for you she nodded its worked out very well with him he doesnt have your experience but perhaps i will take some time off thanks i finished my second drink it didnt taste any better than the first incidentally is max reles still staying in the hotel yes i think so why no reason he told me you got his property back for him he was very pleased i nodded maybe ill go away somewhere würzburg perhaps have you got family in würzburg no but ive always wanted to go there its the capital of franconia you know besides its the opposite end of germany from hamburg i didnt mention dr rubusch or the fact that the only reason i was going there was that he was from würzburg stay at the palace hotel russia house she said i believe its the best hotel in the state have a rest catch up on some sleep you look tired put your feet up if you like ill telephone the hotel manager and get you a special rate thanks i will but i didnt tell her that the last thing i intended to do was put my feet up not now that noreen was gone out of my life for good leaving the adlon i walked east to the alex the railway station was bristling with ss and yet another military band was getting ready to welcome some selfimportant government bonzo there are times when i swear i think we have more military bands than the french and the english put together maybe its just a lot of germans playing it safe no one ever accused you of being unpatriotic when you were playing a flugelhorn or a tuba not in germany tearing myself away from the palpable excitement in the air around the station i walked into the alex seldte the smart young fellow from schupo was still on duty at the front desk i see your career is leaping ahead isnt it he said if i stay here for much longer ill turn into one of these freaks myself if youre looking for herr trettin i saw him head out of here about twenty minutes ago thanks but i was hoping to see liebermann von sonnenberg would you like me to call his office fifteen minutes later i was sitting opposite the berlin chief of kripo and smoking one of the black wisdom cigars bernhard weiss had been obliged to leave behind when he left if this is about that unfortunate business involving august krichbaum said von sonnenberg then you neednt worry bernie you and the other cops who were in the frame as possible suspects are in the clear everything has been brought to a sort of conclusion it was a lot of nonsense of course oh hows that i tried to contain the relief i felt but after noreens departure i hardly cared nearly as much at the same time i hoped they hadnt framed someone for the killing that would really have given my conscience something indigestible to chew on for a while because we no longer have a reliable witness the hotel doorman who saw the culprit was an expoliceman as you probably know well it turns out that he is also a queer and a communist it seems that this was why he left the police in the first place indeed we now think his evidence may even have been motivated by malice against the police in general anyway all of thats irrelevant since the gestapo has had him on an arrest list for several months not that he knew of course so where is he now in the concentration camp at lichtenberg i nodded wondering if theyd made him sign a d im sorry you had to go through all of that bernie i shrugged im sorry i wasnt able to do a bit more for your protégé bömer you did all you could under the circumstances id be glad to help out again these young men today said von sonnenberg theyre in too much of a hurry if you ask me i got that impression you know theres a bright young fellow wearing green on the desk in the entrance hall downstairs name of heinz seldte you might give him a lick fellows too smart to be left with his balls in a desk drawer like that thanks bernie ill have a look at him he lit a cigarette so are you here to play the accordion or is there some business you and i can do that all depends on what on your opinion of count von helldorf you might as well ask if i hate stalin i hear the counts trying to rehabilitate himself by tracking down anyone the sa ever had a grudge against that would certainly look commendably loyal wouldnt it maybe he still wants to be your boss here in berlin have you got a way of making sure that couldnt happen i might have i puffed the strong cigar and aimed the smoke at the high ceiling you remember that stiff we had in the adlon a while ago the one you gave to rust and brandt sure natural causes i remember suppose it wasnt what makes you think different something von helldorf said i didnt know you were cozy with that queer bernie for the last six days ive been his houseguest at the police praesidium in potsdam id like to repay his hospitality if i can they say hes still holding on to some of hanussens dirt as an insurance policy against arrest the films he shot on that boat of his the ursel ive also heard that some of the dirt comes from underneath some very important fingernails like whose for instance ever ask yourself how he managed to get on that olympic committee its not his love of riding i can tell you that much von tschammer und osten small fry no it was goebbels who got him the job but he was the one who broke hanussen and it was goebbels who saved von helldorf but for joey von helldorf would have been shot alongside his warm friend ernst röhm when hitler settled the sas hash in other words von helldorf is still connected so ill help you get him if you can but youll have to find someone else to put the stake through his heart all right ill leave your name out of it what do you need from me the case file on heinrich rubusch id like to check a few things out go and see the fellows widow in würzburg würzburg its near regensburg i believe i know where the hell it is im just trying to remember why i know where the hell it is liebermann von sonnenberg flicked a switch on his desk intercom to speak to his secretary ida why does würzburg mean something to me you had a request from the gestapo in würzburg said a womans voice in your capacity as interpol liaison officer requesting that you contact the fbi in america about a suspect living here in germany and did i yes we sent them what we got from the fbi a week or so ago wait a minute erich i said im beginning to think this bone might make a lot more than just soup ida this is bernie gunther can you remember the name of that suspect the gestapo in würzburg wanted to know about wait a minute i think i still have the gestapos letter in my tray i havent filed it yet yes here we are the suspects name is max reles von sonnenberg flicked off the intercom and nodded youre smiling like that name means something bernie he observed max reles is a guest at the adlon and a good friend of the counts is that so he shrugged maybe its just a small world sure it is if it was any bigger wed have to hunt for clues like they do in the stories youd have a magnifying glass and a hunting hat and a definitive collection of cigarette ends von sonnenberg stubbed out his cigarette in the overflowing ashtray who says i dont this information you had from the fbi any chance you kept a copy let me tell you about being the interpol liaison officer bernie its extra sauerkraut ive got plenty of meat and potatoes on my plate already and what i dont need is extra sauerkraut i know its on the table because ida tells me it is but mostly its her that eats it see and the fact is that she wouldnt keep a copy of luthers ninetyfive theses unless i told her to so so now ive got two reasons to go to würzburg three if you include the wine i never did before franconian wines are good said von sonnenberg if you like your wines sweet that is some of these provincial gestapo officers i said they can be anything but sweet i havent noticed their bigcity counterparts assisting old ladies to cross the road look erich i hate to give you more sauerkraut but a letter of introduction from you or even a telephone call would straighten this gestapo mans tie for him and keep it straight while i was squeezing his eggs von sonnenberg grinned itll be a pleasure theres nothing i like better than clipping the tails on some of these young pups in the gestapo i think thats a job id be good at maybe youll be the first person who ever enjoyed going to würzburg thats always a possibility i read her letter on the train to würzburg adlon hotel no unter den linden berlin my dearest bernie it grieves me more than words can tell you that i cannot be there to say goodbye in person but ive been told by someone from the police chiefs office in potsdam that you wont be released from prison until i have left germany it looks as if this has to be for good im afraidat least for as long as the nazis are in government anywayas ive also been informed by someone in the foreign ministry that i wont be given a visa again and if all that wasnt bad enough ive been told by an official in the propaganda ministry that if i publish the newspaper article i was planning to write and call upon the aoc to boycott the german olympiad then you could find yourself in a concentration camp and since i have no wish to expose you to this kind of threat you can rest assured my dear bernie that no such article will now appear perhaps you will consider that this will be a tragedy to me but while i lament that i am now forbidden the chance to oppose the evil of national socialism in the way i know best the greater tragedy according to my understanding of that word is the obligation i now have to give you up and the utter improbability of seeing you at any time in the near future perhaps ever given more time i should have spoken to you of love and perhaps you would have done the same tempting as it is for a writer to put words in someone elses mouth this is my letter and i must limit myself to what i myself can say which is this i love you right enough and if i now seem to draw a line under that its only because the elation that i once might have felt at being in love with someone againits not easy for me to love anyoneis alloyed with the acute pain of our parting and separation there is a painting by caspar david friedrich that encapsulates the way im feeling right now its called the wanderer above the sea of fog and if youre ever in hamburg you should go to the local art gallery and take a look at it if you dont know this painting it depicts a solitary man standing on a mountaintop staring out over a landscape of distant peaks and jagged rocks and you should picture me similarly positioned on the stern of the ss manhattan carrying me back to new york and all the while staring back at a rocky jagged increasingly remote germany that contains you my love you might equally think of another friedrich painting when you try to visualize my heart this picture is called the sea of ice and it shows a ship hardly visible crushed by great shards of ice upon a landscape more bleak than the surface of the moon im not sure where this picture can be seen as i only ever saw it myself in a book nevertheless it represents very well the cold devastation that is my current situation it seems to me i might very easily curse the fortune that made me love you and yet i know in spite of everything that i dont regret it one little bit because in the future every time i read of some dreadful deed or criminal policy carried out by that bigtalking man in his silly uniform i will think of you bernie and remember that there are many good germans who have courageous good hearts although none i think could ever have a heart as courageous and good as yours and this is good for if hitler teaches us anything it is the stupidity of judging a whole race as one there are bad jews and there are good jews just as there are bad germans and there are good germans you are a good german bernie you protect yourself with a thick coat of cynicism but at heart i know that you are a good man but i fear for all good men in germany and i wonder what terrible choices now lie ahead of them and you i wonder what awful compromises you will be called upon to make which is why i want to help you to help others in the only way now open to me by now you will have found the enclosed check and your first inclination on seeing that it is much more than you asked to borrow may be not to cash it at all that would be a mistake it seems to me that you should take it as my gift to you and start the private detective business you told me about and for this good reason in a society founded upon lies the discovery of truth will become more and more important probably it will land you in trouble but knowing you i suspect you can handle that in your own way most of all i hope that you can come to the aid of others in need of your help as you tried to help me and that you will do what because it is dangerous you ought not to do because it is also right im not sure i expressed that correctly while i speak german well enough i find i am out of practice writing it i hope this letter does not seem too formal emperor charles v said he spoke spanish to god italian to women french to men and german to his horse but you know i think that horse might just have been the creature he loved best in the world and that like you his horse was very bold and full of spirit and i cannot think of any other language that suits your temperament bernie certainly not english with its many shades of meaning i never met a more straightforward man than you which is one of the reasons why i love you so much these are ugly times and you will have to go to ugly places and deal with people who have made themselves ugly but you are my knight of heaven my galahad and i feel certain you can endure all these tests without becoming ugly yourself and you must always tell yourself that you are not just sweeping leaves on a windy day although there will be times when that is what it will feel like i kiss you noreen xx würzburg wasnt an ugly place although the franconians had done their best to make their state capital a virtual shrine to nazism and had effectively uglified what was a pleasantly situated medieval redroofed town in an open part of a river valley in almost every shop window there was a photograph of hitler or a sign advising jews to keep out or risk the consequencessometimes both the town made berlin look like a model of true representative democracy dominating the landscape from the left bank of the river was the old castle of marienberg built by the princebishops of würzburg who had been champions of the counterreformation during another ugly time in german history but it was just as easy to imagine the imposing white castle inhabited by some evil scientist who exercised a powerful and malign influence on würzburg unleashing an elemental force to make monsters of the towns unsuspecting peasants these were mostly ordinarylooking folk although there were one or two with boxy foreheads vivid surgical scars and illfitting coats who might have given even the most committed galvanist some pause for thought i felt kind of inhuman myself and walked south from the railway station and onto adolfhitlerstrasse with awkward stiff legs which might easily have belonged to a dead man although that might have been the lingering effect of noreens letter checking into the palace hotel russia house helped to lift my spirits a little after a week in police custody i had the taste for a good hotel then again i had the taste anyway and now that id decided to overcome my scruples and cash noreens check i also had the money after a light supper in the hotels königs café i walked three quarters of a kilometer east on rottendorfer strasse to a quiet suburb near a reservoir to see the widow rubusch it was a substantial twostory housethree if you counted the dormer window in the high mansard roofwith a curving bayfront door and a long white picket fence atop a substantial granite wall it was painted the same color of yellowish beige that had been used to paint a small star of david on the similar garden wall of the house on the opposite side of the street there were one or two cars parked in front both new and both made by daimlerbenz the trees had been recently pruned it was a nice german neighborhood quiet well kept solidly respectable even that yellow star looked as if it had been painted there by a professional decorator i mounted the front steps and tugged on a bell pull as big as a ships cannon and almost as loud a light came on and a maid appeared in the doora big pigstrotter of a girl with red braids and a stubborn almost belligerent cast to her jaw yes bernhard gunther i said frau rubusch is expecting me i wasnt told about it perhaps hitlers telegram hasnt arrived yet im sure he would have wanted to let you know theres no need to be sarcastic she said and taking a large step backward opened the curved door if you only knew how much im expected to do around here i put down my briefcase and took off my hat and coat while she closed the front door and then locked it carefully it sounds to me like you need a servant i said she shot me a highvelocity look you had better wait in here she opened a door with the side of her foot and chopped at an electric light switch with the side of her hand make yourself comfortable while i go and fetch her then seeing my hat and coat she sighed loudly and took them shaking her head at the inconvenience of finding herself with yet another duty to perform i went over to the fireplace where a blackened piece of log was almost burning and picked up a long poker want me to bring this back to life im good with fire show me a shelf of decadent literature and ill have you a blaze going in no time the maid smiled back at me bleakly although it could just as easily have been a sneer it crossed her mind to say something tart until she thought better of it i had a poker in my hand after all and she looked just the type who gets hit by one i probably would have done it too if id been married to her not that being struck about the head with a poker would have troubled that girl very much especially when she was hungry ive seen hippos that looked more vulnerable i turned the halfburned log heaped some embers next to it and fetched another log from the basket by the hearth i even bent down and blew on it for a while a flame reached around the little pile of wood id made and then took hold with a snap as loud as a christmas cracker youre good at that i turned to see a small birdlike woman wearing a shawl and an uncomfortable smile on a freshly lipsticked mouth i stood up wiped my hands and made the same lame joke id made earlier about decadent books which didnt sound any funnier the second time around not in that house in the corner of the room was a table with a radio and a small photograph of hitler and a glass bowl of fruit were not really like that around here she said with arms folded watching the fire they did burn some books in front of the bishops palace about eighteen months ago but not here not in east würzburg she made it sound like we were in paris and i suppose that yellow star painted on the house opposite is just mischievous children i said frau rubusch laughed but covered her mouth politely while she did so that i wouldnt have to look at her teeth which were perfect and porcelain white like a dolls and indeed a doll was what she most reminded me of with her penciled eyebrows her fine features her dainty red cheeks and her even finer hair thats not a star of david she said through her fingers the man who lives in that house is a director of würzburger hofbrau the town brewery and that star is the companys trademark maybe he should sue the nazis for infringing his copyright which reminds me would you care for some schnapps next to the table was a threetier wooden drinks trolley with bottles i was fond of she poured a couple of large schooners handed me one with her bony little hand sat down on the sofa kicked off her shoes and tucked her feet under her skinny little backside id seen folded laundry that looked less neat than she did so your telegram said that you wanted to see me about my late husband yes im sorry for your loss frau rubusch it must have been a terrible shock to you it was i lit a cigarette doubleinhaled the smoke and then swallowed half of my drink i was nervous about telling this woman that i believed her husband might have been murdered especially when she had only just buried him with the belief that hed died in his sleep of a cerebral aneurysm i swallowed the other half she recognized my nervousness help yourself to another she said perhaps then youll feel up to telling me whats brought the adlon hotel detective all the way from berlin i went over to the drinks trolley and refilled my glass next to the picture of hitler was a photograph of a younger thinner heinrich rubusch i really dont know why heinrich put that photograph there hitlers i mean we were never very political and its not like we used to entertain very much and try to impress people i suppose he put it there in case anyone did visit so that they would go away with the impression that we were good germans you dont have to be a nazi to be that i said although it does help when youre a cop before i was a house detective at the adlon i was a homicide cop at berlin alexanderplatz and you think my husband might have been murdered is that it i think its a possibility yes well thats a relief im sorry heinrich always stayed at the adlon when he was in berlin i thought maybe you thought hed stolen some towels she waited for a moment and then smiled i was joking good i hoped you were only your being a widow i assumed your sense of humor might have gone missing for a while before i met my husband i ran a sisal farm in east africa herr gunther i shot my first lion when i was fourteen and i was fifteen when i helped my father put down a native rebellion during the maji maji war im a lot tougher than i look good did you stop being a policeman because you werent a nazi i quit before i was pushed maybe im not as tough as i look but id rather talk about your husband i was reading the case notes on the train and was reminded that he had a heart condition he had an enlarged heart yes it sort of makes you wonder why he didnt die of that instead of a cerebral aneurysm did he ever suffer from headaches no she shook her head but his death wasnt exactly a surprise he ate too much and drank too much he loved his sausage and his beer lots of cream cigars chocolate he was a very german sort of german she sighed he enjoyed life in every way and i do mean every way you mean besides his food and his drink and his cigars thats precisely what i mean i havent ever been to berlin but i hear its changed quite a bit since the nazis came into government im told its not the den of iniquity it used to be during the weimar years thats correct its not nevertheless its hard to believe that its difficult to find the company of a certain kind of woman if that is what one wants one imagines that the nazis can only do so much to change things after all its not called the oldest profession for nothing i smiled did i say something amusing no not at all frau rubusch its just that after i found your husband dead i went to a lot of trouble to persuade the police to spare you some of the details when they informed you that he was dead to leave out the fact that he had been in bed with another woman i had the quaint idea that it might upset you unnecessarily that was very thoughtful of you perhaps youre right youre not as tough as you look she sipped some of her schnapps and put the glass down on a flame birch coffee table the xshaped base made it look like something from roman antiquity frau rubusch had a sort of roman air herself maybe it was just the way she was sitting half reclined on her sofa but it was easy to imagine her as the influential and steely wife of some fat senator who had perhaps outlived his usefulness tell me herr gunther is it normal for expolicemen to be in possession of a police file no ive been helping out a friend in homicide and to tell the truth i miss the work your husbands case gave me an itch i simply had to scratch yes i can see how that might happen you said you were reading my husbands case file on the train is it inside that briefcase yes i would very much like to look at that file forgive me but i dont think that would be a good idea the file contains photographs of your husbands body as he was found in his hotel room i was hoping it did those pictures are what id like to see oh you neednt worry about me did you not think i would look at him before we buried him i could see there was no point in arguing with her besides as far as i was concerned there were other things i wanted to discuss with her more important than the happy smile on her dead husbands face so i opened my briefcase took out the kripo file and handed it over as soon as she saw the photograph she started to cry and for a moment i cursed myself for taking frau rubusch at her word but then she let out a breath fanned herself with the flat of her hand and swallowing an almost visible lump in her throat said and this is how you found him yes exactly as we found him then i fear you are right to be suspicious herr gunther you see my husband is wearing his pajama jacket in bed he never wore a jacket when he was in bed i used to pack him two pairs of pajamas but he only ever wore the trousers someone else must have put the jacket on him you see he used to sweat a lot at night fat men often do which is why he never wore the jacket which reminds me when the police returned his belongings i received only one pajama jacket two pairs of pajama trousers but only one jacket at the time i thought the police must have kept it or that perhaps they had lost it not that it seemed of any great importance but now that ive seen this photograph i rather think it must be important dont you yes i do i lit another cigarette and stood up to help myself to a third drink if you dont mind she shook her head and carried on staring at the photograph all right i said someone must have put the jacket on him after he was dead in order to make his death seem as natural as possible but what prostitute would do such a thing if he died while or immediately after having sex any sensible party girl would have ripped a hole in the wall to get out of there also my husband was very heavy so its hard to imagine a girl able to lift him up and put a jacket on him by herself i know i couldnt have done that once when he was drunk i tried to get his shirt off him and it was almost impossible and yet theres the evidence of the autopsy the cause of death appeared to be natural what else but a strenuous bout of lovemaking could bring about a cerebral aneurysm all lovemaking was strenuous for heinrich i can assure you of that but what was it that first made you think his death might be a murder herr gunther something someone said tell me do you know a man named max reles no i dont well he knew your husband and you think he might have had something to do with my husbands death its not much more than a slight breeze i have but yes i do let me tell you why wait have you eaten dinner i had a light supper at the hotel she smiled kindly this is franconia youre in now herr gunther we dont do light suppers in this state what was it that you ate just a plate of cold ham and cheese and a beer i thought as much youll stay for dinner then magda always cooks far too much anyway itll be nice to have someone eat properly in this house again now that i come to think of it i am rather hungry ive missed quite a few meals of late the house was too big for one it would have been too big for a basketball team her two sons were grown up and gone away to university she said but my money was on magdas cooking not that there was anything wrong with it but any man there for any length of time was taking a big risk with his arteries i was in that house for only a couple of hours and i felt as fat as hermann goering every time i laid my knife and fork together i was persuaded to have another helping and if i wasnt eating food i was looking at it all over the place there were paintings of dead game and cornucopias and bulging fruit bowls just in case anyone got peckish even the furniture looked like they fed it extra beeswax it was big and heavy and whenever she sat or leaned on any of it angelika rubusch resembled alice down the rabbit hole i guessed she was in her midforties but she might have been older she was a handsome woman which is just a way of saying that she was aging better than a pretty one and there were several reasons for suspecting she found me attractive which is just a way of saying i had probably drunk too much after dinner i tried to gather my thoughts on what i knew about her husband your husband owned a quarry didnt he thats right we supplied a wide range of natural stone to builders all over europe but mainly limestone this part of germany is famous for it we call it beige limestone on account of the honey color most of the public buildings in würzburg are made of beige limestone its uniquely german which makes it popular with the nazis since hitler came to power business has been booming they cant get enough of it every new public building in germany seems to require beige jura limestone before he died paul troost hitlers architect actually came down here to look at our limestone for the new chancellery building what about the olympics no we didnt get that contract not that it matters now you see im selling the business my sons dont have any interest in limestone they are studying to become lawyers i cant run the business by myself ive had a very good offer from another company here in würzburg so im going to take the money and become a rich widow but you did bid for an olympic contract of course thats why heinrich went to berlin he went several times as a matter of fact to discuss our tender with werner march the olympic architect and some other people from the ministry of the interior the day before heinrich died he telephoned me from the adlon to say wed lost it he was very agitated about losing it and said he was going to take the matter up with walter march who was keen on our stone at the time i remember telling him to watch his blood pressure his face got very red when he was cross about something so when he died naturally i already suspected it must have something to do with his health can you think why max reles should have been in possession of a contract tender from your company is he someone at the ministry actually no hes a germanamerican businessman she shook her head i took the letter id found in the chinese box and unfolded it on the dinner table id half suspected max reles was taking something off the top of supplier contracts like a finders fee or a commission but since your husbands company didnt actually get a contract then im not so sure what the connection was or why max reles should have been worried that i was asking questions about your husband not that i ever was you understand not until now not until someone else made a connection between heinrich rubusch and isaac deutsch and assumed that i had already connected the two i let out a yawn when i hadnt sorry none of that is going to make any sense to you im tired i guess and probably a little drunk angelika rubusch wasnt listening and i didnt blame her she didnt know anything about isaac deutsch and probably didnt care i was making less sense than a blind football team bernie gunther stumbling around in the dark and kicking at a ball that wasnt even there she was shaking her head and i was about to apologize again when i saw that she was looking at her own letter of tender i dont understand she said that makes two of us i havent understood anything for a while now im just a guy to whom things happen and i dont know why some detective huh where did you get this max reles had it he seems to have his fingers in a lot of olympic pies i found that paper in something else that belonged to him an antique chinese box that was lost for a while while it was missing i formed the distinct impression that he was very keen to have it returned to him i think i can understand why said angelika rubusch this isnt our tender its on our notepaper but these arent our figures this is way above the price we put in to supply this quantity of limestone about twice as much im looking at this and thinking that its no wonder we didnt get the contract are you sure of course im sure i was my husbands secretary that was to stop him from you know well thats not important now i used to type all our correspondence including the original letter of tender to the german olympic organizing committee and i can tell you that i certainly didnt type this for one thing theres a spelling mistake there is no e in würzburg there isnt not if you come from würzburg there isnt also the letter g on this typewriter is riding a little higher than the other letters she put the tender letter in front of me and placed a wellmanicured fingernail under the offending g dyou see in truth my eyesight was feeling a little blurred but i nodded all the same she held the notepaper up to the light and you know what this isnt even our notepaper it looks like it only the watermark is different i see and now i really did of course i said max reles must have been rigging bids and i think that works like this you put in a bid for something yourself and then make sure that competing bids are priced at an unreasonably high level either that or you chase off the other bidders by whatever means necessary if this is a fake bid max reles must have an interest in the company that was awarded the contract to supply the limestone probably that was a high bid too but crucially not as high as your husbands bid as a matter of fact who did win the contract würzburg jura limestone she said dully our major competitor the same company ive agreed to sell to all right perhaps reles had already asked heinrich to put in a high bid so that your competitor would get the contract if hed agreed to do it hed have been paid a commission and maybe even ended up supplying würzburg jura himself the advantage being that he could have been paid twice heinrich may have been cheating on me as a husband she said but he wasnt like that in business in which case max reles must have tried and failed to put the thumbscrews on him or simply faked the bid from your husbands company perhaps both either way heinrich found out about it so max reles got rid of him quickly discreetly but permanently this all makes sense now the first night i ever saw your husband was at a dinner hosted by reles for a lot of businessmen where there was an argument one of the other businessmen stormed out perhaps he was asked to supply an inflated bid for something else what are we going to do now tomorrow morning i have an appointment with the local gestapo it seems im not the only one whos interested in max reles perhaps theyll tell me what they know and perhaps ill tell them what i know and maybe well figure out a way forward from there but im afraid all of that might mean another autopsy obviously the berlin pathologist missed something these days they often do forensic standards are no longer as rigorous as they used to be nothing is you walk up to a door that is guarded by two steelhelmeted men wearing black uniforms and white gloves im not sure about the purpose of the white gloves are they meant to persuade the rest of us that the ss is pure in heart and deed if so then im not convinced this is the militia that murdered ernst röhm and god knows how many other sa men inside a heavy woodandglass door is a large hallway with a stone floor and a marble staircase next to the desk are a nazi flag and a fulllength portrait of adolf hitler behind the desk is another man wearing a black uniform and the same unhelpful expression you see all over germany it is the face of totalitarian bureaucracy and officialdom this face does not seek to please it is not there to serve you it cares not if you live or die it regards you not as a citizen but as an object to be processed up the stairs or out the door it is how a man looks when he stops behaving like a human being and becomes a kind of robot unquestioning obedience orders to be carried out without a second thought this is what they want ranks upon serried ranks of steelhelmeted automatons my appointment is checked off on a neatly typed list that lies on the wellpolished desk i am early i should not be early any more than i should be late now i will have to wait and the robot does not know what to do with someone who is early and has to wait there is an empty wooden chair beside the elevator cage normally there is a guard sitting there i am told but until the appointed time i may sit there i sit a few minutes pass i smoke at precisely ten oclock the robot lifts the telephone receiver dials a number and announces my arrival i am ordered into the elevator and up to the fourth floor where another robot will meet me i enter the elevator the robot operating the machinery has heard the order and assumes temporary responsibility for my movement within the building on the fourth floor a group of people are waiting to take the elevator down one of these is a man whose arms are supported by two more robots he is manacled and half conscious and there is blood streaming from his nose and onto his clothes no one looks at all ashamed or embarrassed at my being there or seeing any of this this would be to admit the possibility that what has been done is wrong and since what has been done to him has been done in the name of the leader this simply cannot be the case the man is dragged into the elevator and the third robot who remains standing on the fourthfloor landing now leads me down a long wide corridor he stops in front of a door numbered knocks and then opens it without waiting when i enter he closes the door behind me the room is furnished but empty the window is wide open but there is a smell in the air that makes me think that perhaps this is the place where the man with the bloody nose has just been interrogated and when i see a couple of spots of blood on the brown linoleum i know i am right about this i go over to the window and look out onto ludwigstrasse my hotel is just around the corner and although it is foggy outside i can see its roof from here on the other side of the street from würzburgs gestapo hq is the office building of the local nazi party through an upper window i can see a man with his feet up on a desk and i wonder what gets done in there in the name of the party that doesnt get done in here a bell starts to toll the sound drifts across the red rooftops from the cathedral i presume only it sounds more like something out at sea something to warn ships approaching rocks in the fog and i think of noreen somewhere on the north atlantic standing in the stern of the ss manhattan staring back at me through the thick fog the door opens behind me and a strong smell of soap is carried into the room i turn as a smallish man closes the door and rolls down the sleeves of his shirt i guess that he has just washed his hands perhaps there was some blood on them he says nothing until he has fetched his black ss tunic from a hanger in the closet and puts it on as if the uniform will help to compensate for his lack of centimeters youre gunther he said in a voice that sounded folksy and franconian thats right and you must be captain weinberger he carried on buttoning his tunic without bothering to answer then he pointed at the chair in front of his desk sit down please no thanks i said sitting down on the windowsill im a bit like a cat im very particular where i sit what ever do you mean theres blood on the floor underneath that chair and for all i know theres some on it as well i dont make enough money to risk spoiling a good suit weinberger colored a little please yourself he sat down behind the desk his forehead was the only tall thing about him on top of it was a shock of thick brown curly hair his eyes were green and penetrating his mouth was insolent he looked like a defiant schoolboy and it was hard to imagine him being rough with anything other than a collection of toy soldiers or a fairground coconut toss so how can i help you herr gunther i didnt like the look of him but that hardly mattered a display of good manners would have struck the wrong note clipping the tails of young pups in the gestapo was as liebermann von sonnenberg had said almost a sport among senior police officers an american called max reles what do you know about him and youre asking in what capacity weinberger put his boots up onto the desk like the man in the office across the street and clasped his hands behind his head youre not gestapo and youre not kripo and i think we can take it youre not ss im conducting an undercover investigation for berlins assistant police commissioner liebermann von sonnenberg yes i got his letter and his telephone call its not often that berlin pays much attention to a place like this but you still havent answered my question i lit a cigarette and flicked the match out of the window dont piss me around are you going to help me or am i going back to my hotel to call the alex oh i wouldnt dream of pissing you off herr gunther he smiled affably since this doesnt appear to be an official matter i just want to know why im going to help you that is right isnt it i mean if this was an official matter the assistant commissioners request would have come down through my superiors wouldnt it we can do it that way if youd prefer i said but then youd be wasting my time and yours so why dont you just count this as a favor to the head of berlin kripo im glad you mentioned that a favor because id like a favor in return thats fair isnt it so what do you want weinberger shook his head not here eh lets go for a coffee your hotel is not far lets go there all right if thats how you want this i think it might be best given what youre asking about he stood up and grabbed his belts and his cap besides im already doing you a favor the coffee here is terrible he said nothing more until we were out of the building but then i could hardly stop him this isnt a bad town i should know i went to university here i studied law and when i graduated i joined the gestapo its a very catholic town of course which meant that in the beginning it wasnt particularly nazi i can see that surprises you but its truewhen i first joined the party this town had one of the smallest party memberships in the whole of germany it just shows you what can be achieved in a short period of time eh most of the cases we get in the würzburg gestapo office are denunciations germans having sexual relations with jews that kind of thing but heres the anomaly the majority of denunciations come not from party members but from good catholics of course there is no actual law against germans and jews conducting their sordid love affairs not yet but that doesnt stop the denunciations and were obliged to investigate them if only to prove that the party disapproves of these obscene relationships occasionally we parade a couple accused of race defilement around the town square but it seldom goes much further than that once or twice we have run a jew out of town for profiteering but thats it and it goes almost without saying that most of the denunciations are groundless and the product of stupidity and ignorance naturally most of the people who live here are not much more than peasants this place is not berlin would that it were my own situation is a case in point herr gunther weinberger is not necessaily a jewish name i am not a jew none of my grandparents is a jew and yet i myself have been denounced as a jew and on more than one occasion i might add which is not exactly helping my career here in würzburg i can imagine i allowed myself a smile but that was all i hadnt yet got the information i needed and until then i hardly wanted to upset the young gestapo man walking along the street beside me we turned onto adolfhitlerstrasse and walked north toward my hotel well yes its funny of course it is even i can see that but somehow i feel it wouldnt be happening in a more sophisticated place such as berlin after all there are people there with jewishsounding names who are nazis arent there liebermann von sonnenberg i ask you well im sure he would understand my predicament i hardly liked to tell him that berlins assistant police commissioner might have been a party member but he also despised the gestapo and all that it stood for what i feel is this he said earnestly that my name wouldnt hold me back in a place like berlin here in würzburg there will always be the faintest suspicion that im not completely aryan well who is i mean you go far enough back and if the bibles right were all jewish tower of babel right hmm yes he nodded uncertainly besides all that most of my caseload is so petty its hardly worth the effort of my investigating it thats why i became interested in max reles in the first place and you want lets be a bit more specific here captain nothing more than a chance a chance to prove myself thats all a word from the assistant commissioner to the gestapo in berlin would surely smooth my transfer dont you think so it might i admitted it might at that we walked through the hotel entrance and made our way to the café where i ordered us both coffee and cake when i get back to berlin i told him ill see what can be done as a matter of fact i know someone in the gestapo myself he runs his own department in prinzalbrechtstrasse he might be able to help you yes its possible he might always supposing that you can help me these days that was how everything in germany worked for rats like othman weinberger it was probably the only way to get on and while personally i regarded him as something to be scraped carefully off the sole of my salamanders i could hardly blame him for wanting to get out of würzburg id been there for just twentyfour hours and already i felt as keen to leave the place as the wandering jews stray dog but you know i said this case together we might yet make something out of it something a man might base a career on you might not need anyones kind word if this impresses your superiors weinberger smiled wryly and gave the pretty waitress a slow upanddown as she stooped to serve our coffee and cake you think so i doubt it no one here seemed very much interested in what i had to tell them about max reles im not here to pour coffee in my ears captain lets hear it ignoring his coffee and the excellent cake weinberger leaned forward excitedly this man is a real gangster he said just like al capone and those other chicago hoodlums the fbi hold up i want you to begin at the beginning well then you might know that würzburg is the capital of the german quarrying business our limestone is highly prized by architects all over the country but there are really only four companies that sell the stuff one of them is a company called würzburg jura limestone and its owned by a prominent local citizen called roland rothenberger he shrugged ruefully does that sound any less jewish than my name you tell me get on with it rothenberger is a friend of my fathers my fathers a local doctor and a town councillor a few months ago rothenberger came to see him in his capacity as a councillor and told him that he was being intimidated by a man named krempel gerhard krempel he used to be an sa man but now hes a heavy for max reles anyway rothenbergers story was that someone called max reles had offered to buy a share in his company and that this krempel character started to get rough when rothenberger told him he didnt want to sell so i started to check it out but id hardly finished opening the file when rothenberger contacted me to say that he wished to withdraw the complaint he said that reles had substantially improved his offer and that there had been a simple misunderstanding and that max reles was now a shareholder in würzburg jura limestone that i should forget all about it thats what he told me but im afraid boredom got the better of me and i thought id see what else i could find out about reles right away i discovered he was an american citizen and on the face of it an offense had been committed right there as you probably know only germanowned companies are allowed to tender for olympic contracts and it transpired würzburg jura limestone had just outbid the local competition to supply stone for berlins new stadium i also found out that reles seemed to have important connections here in germany so i resolved to see what was known about him in america which is why i contacted liebermann von sonnenberg what did the fbi tell you a lot more than i bargained for to be honest enough to persuade me to check him out with the vienna kripo the picture ive built of reles is based on two separate sets of information and what ive managed to work out for myself you have been busy max reles is from brownsville new york and hes a hungariangerman jew that would be bad enough but theres a lot more his father theodor reles left vienna for america at the turn of the century most likely to escape a murder charge he was strongly suspected by the vienna kripo of murdering someoneperhaps several peoplewith an ice pick it was apparently a secret technique taught to him by a viennese jewish doctor by the name of arnstein when theodor settled in america he married and had two sons max and his younger brother abraham now max has no convictions although he was involved in the prohibition rackets as well as in loansharking and gambling since the end of prohibition in march of last year hes built connections with the chicago underworld little brother abraham has a conviction for juvenile crime and is similarly involved in organized crime hes also believed to be one of the most coldblooded killers in the brooklyn mob and is reputed to use an ice pick for his murders like his father so skilled is he with this weapon that in some cases he leaves no trace how does that work i asked you stab a man with an ice pick you figure it leaves more than just a bruise weinberger was grinning thats what i thought anyway there was nothing about this technique in the information i had from the fbi but the vienna kripo still have an old case file on theodor reles you know the father apparently what he used to do was ram the ice pick through the victims ear right into his brain and he was so good at it that many of his victims were thought to have died of a cerebral hemorrhage something natural anyway jesus i muttered that must be how reles killed rubusch whats that i told weinberger what i knew about the murder of heinrich rubusch and how würzburg jura limestone was now the new owner of the rubusch stone company you said max reles has built connections with the chicago underworld i said such as what until recently chicago was run by capone himself who also came from brooklyn but capone is now in jail and the chicago organization has branched out into other areas including construction and labor racketeering the fbi suspects that the chicago mob was involved in fixing construction contracts for the los angeles olympics that figures max reles has a close friend on the american olympic committee who also owns a chicago construction company a fellow named brundage hes getting some sort of kickback from our own committee in return for chasing off an american boycott money no hes being dripfed east asian art treasures that were part of a collection donated to berlins ethnographical museum by some old jew i nodded appreciatively like i said you have been busy captain im impressed at how much youve been able to find out frankly i think the assistant commissioner is going to be as impressed as i am with your talents perhaps you ought to consider a career in the real police in kripo kripo weinberger shook his head no thanks he said the gestapo is the police force of the future the way i see it the gestapo and the ss will have to absorb kripo in the long run no no i appreciate your compliment but from the point of view of my career i have to stay in the gestapo but preferably the berlin gestapo of course of course tell me herr gunther you dont think were eggs trying to be smarter than the hen do you i mean this reles may be a jew and a gangster but hes got some important friends in berlin ive already spoken to frau rubusch about exhuming her husbands body which will prove he was murdered i think i can even lay my hands on the murder weapon like most amis reles likes a lot of ice in his liquor theres a lethallooking ice pick on the sideboard of his hotel room and if all thats not enough then theres his being a jew like you said id like to see what all of his important friends in the party think about that i dont much like playing that domino but in the end there might be no other way to nail the bastard liebermann von sonnenberg was appointed by hermann goering himself and possibly well have to present all the salient facts to him and since goering isnt on any olympic committee its hard to imagine him choosing to ignore corruption among the committees members even if some others might youd better be certain of all your evidence before you do that whats the saying the cock that crows too early gets the twisted neck i suppose they teach you that at gestapo training school no i wont do anything until i have all the evidence i can walk just as well as i can run weinberger nodded ill need to see the widow to get her written permission to exhume the body probably ill have to involve the würzburg kripo too such as it is and a magistrate all of that could take a little time at least a week perhaps longer heinrich rubusch has plenty of time captain but he needs to rise up from the dead and start talking if this case is going to get anywhere its one thing ignoring a construction racket its quite another ignoring the murder of a prominent german citizen especially when hes properly aryan youre a little folksy for my taste weinberger but well make a firstrate policeman out of you yet back at the alex when i was police we had a saying of our own the bone wont come to the dog its the dog that goes to the bone it was three hours to frankfurt on the passenger train we stopped at almost every town along the main valley and when i wasnt looking out of the window and admiring the scenery i was writing a letter i wrote it several different ways it wasnt the kind of letter i had written before or which made me feel happy but all the same it needed to be written and somehow i managed to persuade myself that it was a way to protect myself i shouldnt have been thinking of other women but i was at frankfurt i followed along the platform a woman who was built like a stradivarius cello and then felt a bow stroke of disappointment when she climbed up into the ladies compartment leaving me in a firstclass smoker beside a professional type with a pipe the shape of a tenor saxophone and an sa leader who favored zeppelinsized cigars that smelled more lethal than the locomotive in the eight hours it took the train to reach berlin we generated a lot of smokealmost as much as the borsigbuilt steam r itself it was raining from a bucket when finally i arrived back in berlin and with a hole in the sole of my shoe i had to wait awhile for a taxi at the rank in front of the station the rain hit the big glass roof like stair rods and leaked onto the head of the line the cabdrivers couldnt see it which meant they always pulled up to exactly the same spot so that the next in line would have to take a shower before he or she could climb inside like something out of a fat and stupid movie when it was my turn i pulled my coat over my head and ducked into the cab i was able to wash one whole sleeve of my shirt without a trip to the laundry but at least it was too early in the winter for snow whenever it snows in berlin it reminds you that its nearer to moscow than madrid by more than two hundred kilometers the shops were closed there was no booze at home and i didnt want to go to a bar i told the driver to take me to the adlon remembering that there was half a bottle of bismarck in my desk at workthe same bottle id confiscated from fritz muller i figured id use just enough of it to warm myself up and if max reles was out somewhere to put enough blood and iron in my belly to check out my own typing skills on the torpedo in his suite the hotel was busy there was a party in the raphael room and undoubtedly the many patrons in the dining room were staring up at the tiepolo panegyric ceiling if only to remind themselves of what a blue and cloudless sky actually looks like pouches of thick white tobacco smoke gently rolled out of the door of the reading room like a quilt from freyjas bed in asgard a drunk wearing a white tie and tails was holding on to the front desk while he complained loudly to pieck the assistant manager that the phonograph in his suite wasnt working i could taste his breath from the other side of the entrance hall but even as i went to lend a hand the man fell backward as if hed been sawn off at the ankles luckily for him he hit a carpet that was even thicker than his head his head bounced a bit and then he lay still it was a nearperfect impersonation of a fight id seen on the newsreels when madcap maxie baer laid out frankie campbell one night in san francisco pieck rushed around the desk to help so did a couple of bellboys and in the confusion i managed to lift the key for and drop it into my pocket before kneeling down by the unconscious man i checked his pulse thank goodness youre here herr gunther said pieck wheres stahlecker i asked the guy whos supposed to be filling in for me there was an incident in the kitchens earlier two members of the brigade were involved in a fight the rotisseur tried to stab the pastry chef herr stahlecker went to break it up the brigade was what we called the kitchen staff at the adlon hell live i said letting go of the drunks neck passed out is all he smells like the schnapps academy in oberkirch thats probably what stopped him from hurting himself when he fell you could stick a hat pin in this rumrunner and he wouldnt feel a thing here give me some space here and ill take him back to his room and let him sleep it off i grabbed the man by the back of his coat collar and dragged him to the elevator dont you think you should take the service elevator protested pieck one of the guests might see you you want to carry him there er no perhaps not a page boy came after me with the guests room key in return i handed him the letter id written on the train post that will you kid and not in the hotel use the box at the post office around the corner on dorotheenstrasse i reached into my pocket and gave him fifty pfennigs here youd better take this its raining i dragged the stillunconscious man into the elevator car and glanced at the number on the key fob three twenty i told wolfgang yes sir he said and closed the door i bent down pulled the man forward onto my shoulder and then lifted him up a few minutes later the guest was lying on his bed and i was wiping the sweat off my face and then helping myself from an open bottle of good korn that was standing on the floor it didnt burn didnt even catch my collar stud it was the smooth expensive stuff that you drank to savor while reading a good book or listening to an impromptu by schubert not to help you handle an unhappy love affair but it got the job done all the same it went down like a clear conscience or as near to the feeling of a clear conscience as i was going to get after posting that letter i picked up the telephone and disguising my voice asked one of the hello girls to connect me with suite she let it ring for a while before coming back on the line to tell me what i now knew that there was no reply i asked her to put me through to the concierge and franz joseph came on the line hey franz its me gunther hey i heard you were back i thought you were on holiday i was but you know i couldnt keep away do you happen to know where herr reles is tonight hes having dinner at habel i booked the table myself habel on unter den linden with its historic wine room and even more historic prices was one of berlins oldest and finest restaurants just the kind of place reles would have chosen thanks i pulled the shirt collar from the neck of the man now sleeping it off on the bed and then thoughtfully turned him onto his side then i capped his bottle and took it with me slipping it into my coat pocket on the way out it was twothirds full and i figured the guest owed me that much at least more than either of us would ever know if he happened to throw up in his sleep i let myself into suite and closed the door behind me before switching on the light the french window was open and the room was cold the net curtains were billowing across the back of the sofa like a couple of comedy ghosts and the heavy rain had soaked the edge of the expensive carpet i closed the windows that wouldnt bother reles hed only expect the maid to have done the same several packages lay open on the floor each contained some sort of east asian objet dart packed inside a birds nest of straw i took a closer look at one it was a bronze or possibly gold statuette of some oriental god with twelve arms and four heads about thirty centimeters high the figure appeared to be dancing a tango with a rather scantily clad girl who reminded me a lot of anita berber anita had been the queen of berlins nude dancers at the white mouse club on jägerstrasse until the night shed laid out one of the patrons with an empty champagne bottle the story was hed objected to her pissing on his table which used to be her shtick i missed the old berlin i stuffed the statuette back into its nest and glanced around the suite the bedroom beyond the halfopen door was in darkness the bathroom door was closed i wondered if the tommy gun and the money and the gold coins were still behind the lavatory cisterns tiled panel at the same time my eye was caught by the ice bucket next to the drinks tray on the sideboard beside the ice bucket was an ice pick i picked it up the thing was about twentyfive centimeters long and as sharp as a bodkin the heavy steel rectangular handle was embossed with citizens ice pure on one side and citizens on the other it seemed a curious thing to have brought from america until you remembered that it was possibly a favorite murder weapon certainly it looked like an effective one id seen less lethallooking switchblades sticking out of a mans back but there seemed to be little point in borrowing the ice pick in the hope that someone at the alex might run some tests on it not as long as max reles was also using it to break the ice for his drinks i put down the ice pick and turned to examine the typewriter a halffinished letter was still on the platen of the shiny torpedo portable i turned the platen knob until the paper was clear of the type guide and the paper fingers the letter was addressed to avery brundage in chicago and was written in english but that didnt stop me from seeing that the letter g on the torpedo was riding one millimeter higher than the other keys i had the probable murder weapon i had the typewriter on which reles had written false bids for olympic contracts i had a copy of the report from the fbi and a sheet from the vienna kripo now all i had to do was check that the machine gun was still where i thought it was explaining that would be a tall order even for a man like max reles i looked around for his screwdriver and not seeing it began to search the drawers looking for something in particular it was dora bauer she was standing in the doorway of the bedroom naked although she might as easily have covered herself with the object in her hands it was big enough a mauser bolo is a lot of gun i wondered how long she would be able to hold it at arms length before her arms got tired i thought no one was at home i said i certainly didnt expect to see you dora dear and so much of you too ive been eyeballed before polyp whatever gave you that idea me a polyp tsktsk dont tell me youre searching the drawers to steal something not you youre not the type who says im not no she shook her head you got me this job and you didnt even ask for a cut what thief would have done that it proves you owe me something surely you already collected that debt i did sure a man with a bottle in his pocket lets himself in here and starts raking through the drawers i could have shot you five minutes ago and just because i havent pulled the trigger yet dont think i wont cop or not from what i already know about you gunther your old colleagues over at the alex might think i was doing them a favor its me youre doing a favor fräulein i havent seen so much of a pretty girl since the eldorado got closed down is this how you normally dress for some shorthand and typing or is being naked just the way you end up when max reles finishes giving you dictation either way im not complaining even with a gun in your hand dora youre still a sight for sore eyes i was asleep she said at least i was until the telephone started ringing i suppose that was you seeing if the coast was clear its a pity you didnt answer i could have spared your blushes you can stare at my mouse all you want polyp but you wont see me blushing look why dont you put down the gun and then find a dressing gown after that we can talk theres a perfectly simple explanation for why im here and dont think i dont know what that is gunther weve been expecting you max and me ever since your little excursion to würzburg pretty little town i didnt like it at first mind did you know they have one of the finest baroque cathedrals in germany the local princebishops built it to make up for the fact that the citizens of the town murdered some poor irish priest back in the year saint kilian max reles would fit right in if he ever went there but then he probably does go now that he owns a quarry or two supplying stone to the goc he murdered someone too of course lets not forget that fact using that ice pick on the sideboard you should be on the radio listen to me dora right now its just max whos staring at the inside of a headsmans basket remember myra scheidemann the black forest murderess in case youd forgotten we execute women too in this great country of ours be a shame for you to end up the same way as her so be sensible and put the gun away i can help you the same way i helped you before shut up she jerked the long barrel of the mauser at me and then the bathroom in there she said fiercely i did what i was told id seen what a bullet from a mauser can do to a man it wasnt the hole it makes going in that gave me pause for thought but the hole it makes going out its the difference between a peanut and an orange i opened the bathroom door and switched on the light take the key out of the door she said and put it back in the lock on this side of the door besides dora was an exwhore probably still was a whore and whores are less particular about shooting people especially men myra scheidemann was a whore who had shot three of her clients in the head with a thirtytwo while they were having sex in a forest sometimes i get the feeling that a lot of whores dont much like men this one was giving every impression that she didnt mind putting a bullet in me so i took the key and put it in the lock on the other side of the door just as shed told me to do now close the door and miss the show dont make me prove i can handle a gun perhaps you should try for the olympic shooting team i dont think youd have any problem impressing the selectors dressed like that of course pinning a medal on your chest might prove to be difficult although you could always use an ice pick dora lengthened her arm took very deliberate aim at my head and steadied the mauser all right all right i kicked the door shut angry with myself for not thinking to bring the little automatic id taken from erich goerz hearing the key turn in the lock i pressed my ear to the door and tried to continue the conversation i thought we were friends dora after all it was me who got you the job with max reles remember it was me who gave you the chance to climb off the sledge by the time you and i met gunther max was already a client you just gave me a chance to be here with him legitimately i told you before i love being in big hotels like this one i remember you like the big bathrooms and whoever said i wanted to get off the sledge you did and i believed you then youre a pretty poor judge of character arent you max thinks youre all over him like fleas but i think youve just been pinning the tail on the donkey and got lucky max thinks that because you went to würzburg you must know everything but i dont think so how could you as a matter of interest how did he find out that id gone to würzburg frau adlon told him after your trip to potsdam he was wondering where you were and so he asked her he told her he wanted to give you a reward for finding that chinese box of course as soon as he knew you were there he guessed you were on your way to check up on him with the widow rubusch or the gestapo maybe both the gestapo didnt seem particularly interested in reles and his activities i said i suppose thats why they asked the fbi for information about max dora laughed yes i thought that would shut you up max got a telegram from his brother in america passing on a tip from someone in the fbi saying that the fbi had received a request for information about him from the gestapo in würzburg you see max has friends in the fbi just like hes got a lot of useful friends here hes clever like that is that right i glanced around the bathroom i might have kicked out the window and climbed down to the street but for the fact that the bathroom didnt have a window i needed the gun behind the panel i glanced around for the screwdriver and then opened the four bathroom cabinets you know max is not going to be very happy when he comes back here and finds me in his bathroom i said for one thing hes not going to be able to use his own toilet there wasnt much in the cabinets most of the mans toiletries were on the bathroom shelf or on the side of the sink in one cabinet were a bottle of elizabeth arden blue grass and some charbert grand prix mens cologne they looked like a perfect couple in another i found a bag containing some rather vulgarlooking dildos a blond wig some expensivelooking lingerie and a diamond tiara that was obviously paste no one leaves a real one in a bathroom cabinet not when the hotel has a perfectly good safe of a screwdriver however there was no sign it gives max a real problem about what to do with me i mean he can hardly kill me here in the adlon can he im not the type to sit still and have my ears syringed with an ice pick and the noise of a gunshot is going to attract some attention and require some explaining but make no mistake dora hes going to have to kill me and youll be an accessory to murder of course by now i had realized the significance of the wig and the tiara and the blue grass perfume i was reluctant to mention this to dora as i still hoped she might be persuaded to cooperate with me but with each passing minute it was becoming clear that i had little choice now but to scare her into cooperation with what i now knew about her except that youve got no problem with being an accessory to murder have you dora because youve already helped out with one murder havent you it was you that heinrich rubusch was with the night max killed him with that ice pick you were the blond in the tiara werent you didnt the guy mind when you showed him your mouse that you werent a natural blond he was like any other fritz when he sees a bit of mouse all he cared about was that it squeaked when he stroked it please tell me that max didnt kill him while you were doing it whats it to you anyway he made no noise there wasnt even any blood well maybe just a bit max blotted it up with the guys pajama jacket but you couldnt even see a mark incredible really and believe me he didnt feel a thing couldnt have which is more than i can say rubusch wanted a racehorse not a girl i had the marks of his hairbrush on my backside for days afterward if you ask me the fat pervert had it coming but the door was locked from the inside when we found him the key was still in the door you opened it didnt you i locked it the same way lots of hotel whores carry passkeys or key turners or know how to get hold of one sometimes a client pays you off without a tip sometimes they peel some leaves off a bush thats too tempting to leave behind so you wait outside for a while and then go back in and help yourself to more money some hotel detective you are gunther the other bull what was his name the drunk muller he knew the score it was him that sold me a key turner and a good passkey and in return well you can imagine what he wanted the first time anyway on the night max killed rubusch i bumped into him and was obliged to pin some notes on his coat which were some of the same notes youd been given by rubusch of course by now i had given up looking for the screwdriver and i was scrutinizing my change to see if i had a coin thin enough to fit the screw head on the cistern panel i didnt i did have a sterlingsilver money clipa wedding present from my late wifeand i spent several minutes using that to try to loosen one of the screws but i succeeded only in mangling the clips corner the way things were looking very soon i was going to have a chance to apologize to my wife if not in person then something vaguely similar dora bauer had stopped talking which was fine every time she said something it reminded me of how stupid id been i picked up the tooth glass washed it out poured myself a generous measure of korn and sat down on the toilet things always look a little better over a drink and a cigarette youre in a spot gunther i told myself in a short while a man is going to come through that door with a gun and hes going to either shoot you or try to walk you out of the hotel and shoot you somewhere else of course he might try to hit you over the head and then kill you with that ice pick and take you out of here in a laundry basket hes been staying here for quite a while he should know where everything is by now how things work here or he could just dump your body in the elevator shaft it might be a while before anyone finds you down there or maybe hell just telephone his friends in potsdam and have them come and arrest me again its not like anyones going to object everyone in berlin looks the other way whenever someone gets arrested these days its nobodys business no one wants to see anything then again they can hardly take the risk that i wont say something in front of everyone when they try to sleepwalk me out the front door von helldorf wouldnt like that nor would our honored sports leader von tschammer und osten i drank some more of the korn it didnt make me feel any better but it did give me an idea it wasnt much of an idea then again i wasnt much of a detective that much was already evident a couple of hours passed so did a couple more drinks what else was i going to do i heard the sound of the key in the lock and rose to my feet the door opened instead of max reles i found myself facetoface with gerhard krempel which put a big dent in my idea krempel wasnt very bright and it was hard to see how i was going to talk myself out of anything if it was his cauliflower ears that were doing the listening he had a thirtytwo in one hand and a cushion in the other i see youve been entertaining yourself he said i need to speak to max reles thats too bad because hes not here ive got a deal for him hell want to hear it i can guarantee that he will krempel smiled bleakly so what is it and spoil the surprise lets just say the police are involved yeah but which police the noaccount police you used to be gunther or the ones my boss knows who make problems disappear you dropped three cards and now youre trying to raise well im calling your bluff i dont care what youve got to say heres what im saying youve got two ways out of this bathroom dead or dead drunk its your choice both are inconvenient to me but one choice looks less inconvenient to you especially as youve so thoughtfully provided a bottle and by the look of things made a head start on what im talking about what happens then thats up to reles but theres no way im walking you out of this hotel unless youre incapacitated somehow if youre drunk you can shoot your mouth off all you like and no one is going to pay a crumb like you much attention not even here in fact especially here they dont like drunks at the adlon they frighten the ladies if we see anyone who knows you then youll be just another excop who couldnt hold his liquor the same as that other sot who used to work here fritz muller krempel shrugged then again i could shoot you right now right here snooper with a cushion wrapped around this little thirtytwo the noise will pass for a car backfiring then ill push you out the french window shouldnt make too much of a splash down there its only one floor by the time anyone notices you in all this rain and in the dark ill have you safely folded up in the back of my car next stop the river the voice was calm and assured as if killing me werent going to give him any sleepless nights he folded the cushion over the gun with meaning better drink up he said im done talking here i poured a glass and emptied it in one swallow krempel shook his head lets forget were in the adlon shall we from the bottle if you dont mind i dont have all night care to join me he took a short step forward and hit me hard across the face it wasnt hard enough to knock me off my feet just off my vocal cords cut the dialogue and drink i put the neck of the tall stoneware bottle to my lips and gulped at it like it was water some of it tried to come back up but i gritted my teeth and didnt let it krempel didnt look like he had the tolerance to wait for me to puke i sat down on the edge of the bath took a deep breath and drank some more and then some more as i lifted the bottle a third time my hat fell into the empty bath but it might as easily have been my head it rolled under the dripping tap and remained on its crown like a large brown beetle on its back i reached down to get it misjudged the depth of the bath and fell in but without dropping the schnapps bottle i think if i had broken it krempel would have shot me then and there i took another swig from the bottle to reassure him there was plenty of alcohol left in it grabbed my hat and crushed it back on top of my already swimming head krempel regarded me with no more feeling than if id been a driedup loofah and sat down on the toilet lid his eyes were two puffy slits as if theyd been bitten by a snake he lit a cigarette crossed his long legs and let out a long tobaccoflavored sigh several minutes passed they were idle ones for him but for me they were increasingly hazardous and intoxicated the booze was strongarming me into spineless submission gerhard how would you like to make a lot of money and i mean a lot of money thousands of marks thousands is it his body twitched as it expelled a derisive laugh and this from you gunther a man with a hole in his shoe who gets the bus home when youve got the fare you have got that right my friend with my backside on the floor of the canyondeep bath and my salamanders in the air i felt like bobby leach going over niagara in a barrel every so often my stomach seemed to fall away beneath me i turned the tap and splashed some cold water onto my sweatcovered face but there is money to be had my friend a lot of money behind you theres a panel that is screwed on top of the lavatory cistern hidden in there is a bag a bag containing banknotes in several currencies a thompson submachine gun and enough swiss gold coins to start a chocolate shop its a little early for christmas said krempel he tutted loudly and i didnt even leave a boot by the fireplace last year mine was full of twigs but its there all right the money i mean i figure reles must have hidden it there i mean a thompsons not the kind of thing you can leave in the hotel safe even here dont let me stop you drinking krempel growled and leaning forward on the lavatory seat he tapped the sole of my shoethe one with the hole in itwith the barrel of the gun i filled my cheeks with the obnoxious liquid swallowed uncomfortably and let out a deep nauseated breath i found it when i searched this suite a little while ago and you just left it there im a lot of things gerhard but im not a thief you have the advantage of me there theres a screwdriver old max keeps in this suite somewhere to remove said panel im sure of it i was looking for it a bit earlier on so that i could greet you with it when you showed up with the mauser in your mitt nothing personal you understand but a thompson gets a click of the heels and a salute in any language i closed my eyes for a moment raised the sausagelike bottle in a silent toast and swallowed some more when i opened them again krempel was examining the screws on the panel with interest theres enough there to buy several companies or to bribe whoever needs bribing yes theres a lot of coal in that bag a lot more than hes paying you gerhard shut up gunther cant i always was a gabby drunk last time i got tripped like this was when my wife died spanish flu have you ever wondered why they call it spanish flu gerhard it started in kansas you know but the amis censored that because of the war censorship still in force and it didnt make the newspapers until it reached spain where they didnt have any wartime censorship ever had the flu gerhard thats what i feel like now like i got a oneman epidemic of the stuff jesus i think i even wet myself you turned the tap thickhead remember i yawned did i drink up heres to her she was a good woman too good for me do you have a wife he shook his head with the money in that bag you could afford several and none of them would mind that youre such an ugly bastard a woman can overlook almost any shortcoming in a man when theres a big bag of money on her dinner table ill bet that bitch next door dora doesnt know about the bag either otherwise shed have had it for sure mercenary little nannygoat mind you i will say this for her ive seen her naked and shes a peach of course you have to remember that every peach has a stone inside it doras got a bigger one than most too but shes a peach all right my head felt as heavy as a stone a giant peach stone and when my head dropped onto my chest it seemed to fall such a long way that for a moment i thought it had dropped into the leather basket beneath the falling ax and i cried out thinking i was dead opening my eyes i took a deep spasmodic breath and struggled to remain vaguely vertical but now it was a losing battle all right said krempel youve had enough lets try to get up shall we he stood up and gathered my coat collars in his pomegranatesized fists and hauled me roughly out of the bath he was a strong mantoo strong for me to try anything stupid but i took a swing at him anyway and missed before losing my balance and falling onto the bathroom floor where krempel kicked me in the ribs for my trouble what about the money i asked hardly feeling the pain youre forgetting the money i guess ill just have to come back for it later he hauled me onto my feet again and maneuvered me out of the bathroom dora was sitting on the sofa reading a magazine she was wearing a fur coat i wondered if reles had bought it for her oh its you i said raising my hat i didnt recognize you with your clothes on then again i expect a lot of people say that to you sweetheart she stood up slapped my face and was going to slap it again only krempel caught her wrist and twisted it go and fetch the car he told her yes i said go and fetch the car and hurry up i want to fall down and pass out krempel had me propped against the wall like a steamer trunk i closed my eyes for a moment and when i opened them again she was gone he shifted me out of the suite and along to the top of the stairs its all the same to me how you go down these stairs gunther i can help you down or i can push you down but if you try anything i can promise that youll be holding on to thin air grateful to you i heard myself mumble thickly we arrived at the bottom of the stairs but i dont know how my legs belonged to charlie chaplin i recognized the wilhelmstrasse door and thought it was sensible of him to choose this way out of the hotel at that time of night the wilhelmstrasse door was always quieter than the one on unter den linden the lobby was smaller too but if krempel had hoped to avoid our meeting anyone i knew he failed most of the waiters at the adlon had a mustache or were cleanshaven and only one abd elkrim wore a beard his name wasnt abd elkrim i didnt know his real name but he was moroccan and people called him that because he looked like the rebel leader who had surrendered to the french in and was now exiled to some shithole of an island i cant answer for the talents of the rebel but our abd elkrim was an excellent waiter being a mohammedan he didnt drink and eyed me with a mixture of shock and concern as with one arm draped around the lintel that was krempels shoulders i lurched toward the exit herr gunther he said in a voice full of solicitude is everything all right sir you dont look well words emptied out of my slack mouth like saliva perhaps saliva is all they were i dont know whatever i said didnt make any sense to me so i doubt that it would have made any sense to abd elkrim hes had too much to drink im afraid krempel told the waiter im taking him home before behlert or either of the adlons sees him like this abd elkrim dressed to go home nodded gravely yes that is best i think do you need any assistance sir no thanks ive a car waiting for us outside i think ill manage the waiter bowed gravely and opened the door for my kidnapper as he waltzed me outside as soon as the cold air and rain hit my lungs i started to retch into the gutter the stuff i was retching you could have bottled and sold as it tasted like pure korn a car immediately pulled up in front of me and the spray from the tires splashed the cuffs of my trousers my hat fell off again the car door opened and krempel launched me onto the floor with the sole of his shoe a moment later the car door slammed and then we were movingforward i imagined but it felt like we were going around and around in circles on a ride at luna park i didnt know where we were going and i ceased to care very much i couldnt have felt any worse if id been laid out naked in an undertakers window there was a storm at sea the deck shifted like an accelerating elevator car and then a wave of cold water hit me full in the face i shook my head painfully and opened eyes that felt like two scoopedout oyster shells that were still swimming with tabasco sauce another wave of water hit me except the water wasnt from a wave but from a bucket in the hands of gerhard krempel but we were on the deck of a ship or at least a largish boat behind him stood max reles dressed like a rich man playing ships captain he wore a blue blazer white trousers a white shirt and tie and a white softpeaked cap everything around us was white too and it took me several moments to appreciate that it was daytime and we were probably surrounded with mist reless mouth started moving and white mist came out of that too it was cold very cold for a second i thought he was speaking norwegian something cold anyway then it seemed a little closer to homedanish perhaps only when a third bucket of water gathered on a rope from over the side of the boat was flung into my face was i able to grasp that he actually was speaking german good morning reles said and welcome back we were beginning to get a little worried about you gunther you know i thought you krauts could hold your liquor but youve been passed out for quite a while at considerable inconvenience to myself i might add i was sitting on a polished wooden deck looking up at him i tried to get up and found my hands were tied on my lap but worse given that the boat appeared to be on the water was that my feet also were tied to a stack of gray concrete blocks lying beside me on the deck i leaned to one side and retched for almost a minute and i marveled that such a sound could come from my body it was the sound of a living creature turning itself inside out while this was going on reles walked away with a look of distaste on his knuckle of a face when he returned dora was beside him she was wearing her fur coat and a matching fur hat carrying a glass of water she carried it to my lips and helped me to swallow when the glass was empty i nodded genuine thanks and tried to appreciate my situation i didnt appreciate it very much my hat coat and jacket were gone and my head felt as if it had been used for the mitropa cup final and the pungent smell of reless large cigar was turning my stomach i was in a tight spot i had the awful feeling in a whole crowd of awful feelings that max reles was planning to give me a practical demonstration of exactly how erich goerz had disposed of isaac deutschs dead body i couldnt have been in a tighter spot if id been a starving dog chained to a highspeed railway line feeling any better he sat down on the pile of concrete blocks its a little early for that you might think but im afraid that the way you are feeling now is likely to be as good as it gets for the rest of your life in fact i can guarantee it he relit his cigar and chuckled dora leaned on the rail of the boat and looked out into what appeared as a limbo in which we were floating like lost souls standing with his fists on his hips krempel looked ready to hit me anytime he was asked you should have listened to count von helldorf i mean he couldnt have been more explicit but no you had to be sam fucking spade and stick your cornet where it wasnt wanted i just dont get that really i dont you must have appreciated that there was just too much money involved and too many important people getting a big fat slice of the black forest cherry cake called the olympic games for anything to be allowed to spoil that certainly anything as easily disposable as you gunther i closed my eyes for a minute you know youre not a bad fellow at all i almost like you no really i even thought of cutting you in and offering you a job a proper job not that joke job you have at the adlon but theres something about you that makes me think i just couldnt trust you i think its that you were once a cop he shook his head no that cant be right ive bought plenty of cops in my time i guess it must be that you were an honest cop and a good one from what i hear i admire integrity but ive got no use for it right now i dont think anyone has not in germany not this year really you wouldnt believe how many fucking pigs there are who want to feed at this trough of course they needed someone like me to show them how its done i mean weby which i mean the people i represent in the stateswe made a lot back in thirtytwo with the los angeles olympics but the nazis really know how to do business brundage couldnt believe it when he first turned up here it was him who tipped us off in chicago about all the money that was to be made out here and the east asian artifacts are some payback for that right a few bits and pieces of the kind he collects and appreciates but which no one here is going to miss hes also going to pick up a nice contract to build a new german embassy in washington which is the real treasure if you ask me you see with hitler the sky is the limit im delighted to say that the man has absolutely no idea of economy if he wants something he gets it and to hell with the cost in the beginning the olympic budget was what twenty million marks now its probably four or five times that and i guess the skim must be fifteen or twenty percent can you imagine of course its not always straightforward dealing with hitler the man is capricious you know you see id already bought a company that makes readymixed concrete and done a deal with the architect werner march only to discover that hitler doesnt like fucking concrete in fact he hates it he hates anything thats in any way modern it doesnt matter a damn to him that half of all the new buildings in europe are made of fucking concrete that isnt what he wants and he wont budge when werner march showed him the plans and specifications for the new stadium hitler went nuts only limestone would be good enough and not any goddamn limestone you understand it had to be german limestone so i had to buy a limestone company in a hurry and then make sure my new companywürzburg jura limestonewas awarded the contract too much of a hurry if the truth be told given more time i could have smoothed things over but well you know all about that part you sonofabitch its left me with a lot of concrete but youre going to help me to get rid of some of that gunther these three breeze blocks im sitting on are going to the bottom of lake tegel and youre going with them just like isaac deutsch i croaked i take it erich goerz works for you thats right he does hes a good man erich but he lacks experience in this kind of work so this time im doing it myself to make sure the job gets done properly we dont want you rising up from the bottom like deutsch i always say if you want someone disposed of properly youd better do it yourself he sighed these things happen eh even to the best of us he puffed the cigar for a moment and then blew out a funnel of smoke that might have come from the funnel above my head the boat was maybe thirty feet long and i thought maybe id seen it somewhere before i figure it was a mistake to dump that sonofabitch isaac in the canal nine meters not deep enough but out here the water is sixteen meters deep thats not lake michigan or the hudson river but itll do yes theres that and the fact that im not exactly a stranger to this shit so relax youre in good hands the one remaining question i have for you guntherand its an important one from your point of view so i advise you to pay attentionis whether we deepsix you dead or alive ive seen both and its my considered opinion that its best you go down dead drownings not quick i dont think me id prefer a bullet in the head beforehand ill try to remember that but dont let me sway you this is your decision only i need to know what you know gunther everything who youve told about me and what think it over for a minute i have to take a leak and put a coat on its a little chilly out here on the water dont you think dora give him another glass of water it might help to make him talk he turned and walked away krempel followed and in the absence of a personal cuspidor i spat after them dora gave me some more water i drank it down greedily guess ill have all the water i can drink in a little while i said thats not even funny she wiped my mouth with my tie id forgotten how beautiful you are thanks nope youre still not laughing i guess that wasnt funny either she glared at me like i was dermatitis you know in grand hotel joan crawfords not supposed to fall for wallace beery i said max hes not so bad ill try to remember that when i reach the bottom of the lake i suppose you think youre like john barrymore not with this profile but i do think id like a cigarette if you have one you can call it one last request since ive already seen you naked at least now i can be sure when youre wearing a wig a regular curt valentin arent you under the fur she was wearing a lavendercolored knitted dress that hugged her figure like a coat of emulsion and over her wrist was a drawstring pouch bag that contained a handsome gold cigarette case and lighter it looks as if saint nicholas has been here already i said as she pushed a cigarette between my cracked lips and lit it at least someone thinks youve been a good girl by now anyone would think youd learned to keep your nose out of other peoples business she said oh ive learned that all right perhaps youd like to tell him that maybe a good word from you has a better chance of success than one from me better still perhaps you still have that gun id say that where max reles is concerned a mauser has an even better chance than any amount of good words she took the cigarette from me drew in smoke and then put it back in my mouth with cool fingers that were almost as heavily perfumed as they were ringed what makes you think id ever betray a man like max for a dog like you gunther the same thing that makes a man like him attractive to a girl like you money lots of it you see its my opinion dora that if there was enough money involved youd betray the infant jesus as it happens theres even more money than that hidden in max reless bathroom at the adlon theres a bag full of money behind a panel thats screwed in front of the lavatory cistern thousands of marks dollars gold swiss francs you name it angel all you need is a screwdriver reles has one somewhere in his drawers thats what i was looking for when you and your mouse came and disturbed me she leaned toward me close enough for me to taste the coffee that was still on her breath youll have to do better than that polyp if im going to help you no i dont you see angel im not telling you so that youll help me im telling you so that maybe youll help yourself and in the process youll have to shoot him or maybe hell shoot you it certainly wont make any difference to me at the bottom of lake tegel she stood up abruptly you bastard true but then again at least this way you can be sure im on the level about the money because its there all right enough to start a new life in paris to buy a nice apartment in a smart part of london hell theres enough there to buy the whole of bremerhaven she laughed and looked away dont believe me if you dont want to it makes no odds to me but ask yourself this dora dear a guy like max reles and the kind of people he needs to pay off to stay in business theyre not the kind who take a personal check graft is a cash racket dora you know it and a whole sack full of cash is what it takes to keep a racket like this one afloat she stayed quiet for a moment looking preoccupied with something probably she was picturing herself walking up bond street with a new hat and a thick wad of pound notes underneath her garter i didnt mind contemplating that picture myself it was certainly preferable to contemplating my own situation max reles came up on deck again followed closely by krempel reles was wearing a thick fur coat and carrying a big colt automatic attached to a lanyard around his neck as if he didnt trust himself not to lose it i always say you cant be too careful with your firearm when youre planning to shoot an unarmed man i said those are the only kind i ever shoot he chuckled do you take me for a fool who would go up against a man with a gun im a businessman gunther not tom mix he dropped the colt on the lanyard and put his arm around dora and pressed her fingers between her legs the other hand still held his cigar dora let reless hand remain where it was as he started to rub her mouse she looked like she was even trying to enjoy it but i could see her mind was somewhere else underneath the cistern in suite probably the little rico kind of businessman i said sure i can see that it looks like we have a movie fan gerhard how about twenty thousand leagues under the sea did you see that one no matter you can catch the real thing in just a few minutes its you whos going to get caught reles not me you see i have an insurance policy its not germania life but itll do and it kicks in the minute im dead youre not the only one with connections my american friend ive got connections and i can guarantee theyre not the same ones youve been getting chummy with reles shook his head and pushed dora away its strange but no one ever thinks theyre going to die yet no matter how crowded most cemeteries look somehow there always seems to be room for one more i dont see any cemetery reles in fact now that im out here on water you make me glad i never paid up front for my own funeral i really do like you he said you remind me of me reles took the cigarette from my mouth and flicked it over the side he thumbed the hammer back on the colt and pointed it at the middle of my face it was close enough to see down the barrel to feel the stopping power and smell the gun oil with a colt automatic in his hand tom mix could have held up the arrival of talking pictures all right gunther lets see your cards in my coat pocket theres an envelope it contains a couple of drafts of a letter addressed to a friend of mine a fellow named otto schuchardt he works under assistant commissioner volk for the gestapo in prinzalbrechtstrasse you can easily check these names out when i go missing from the adlon another friend of mine at the alex a detective commissar is going to post the final draft of that letter to schuchardt and then your meat will be fried in butter and why would the gestapo be interested in me an american citizen like you said a captain weinberger showed me what the fbi sent to the gestapo in würzburg it was pretty thin stuff youre suspected of this youre suspected of that big deal you say but about your homicidal brother abe the fbi knows plenty about him and your father theodor hes an interesting man too it seems that he was wanted by the vienna police when he went to live in america for murdering people with an ice pick of course its always possible they framed him the austrians are even worse than we are here in berlin in the way they treat their jews but thats what i wanted to tell my friend otto schuchardt you see he works on what the gestapo calls the jew desk i think you can imagine the sort of people hes interested in reles turned to krempel go and fetch his coat he said then he looked at me grimly if i find youre lying about this guntherhe pressed the colt against my kneecapim going to give you one in each leg before i push you over the side im not lying you know im not well see wont we i wonder how all your smart nazi friends will react when they find out who and what you are reles von helldorf for instance you remember what happened when he found out about erik hanussen the clairvoyant why of course you do after all this is hanussens boat isnt it i nodded at one of the life preservers attached to the guardrail on it was painted the name of the boat ursel iv it was the boat id seen outside von helldorfs office window in the potsdam police praesidium that put a smile on my face you know its kind of ironic when you think about it reles that you of all people should be using the ursel did von helldorf sell you this tub or is it just a loan from an aristocratic friend whos going to feel terribly let down when he discovers the sad truth about you max that youre a jew badly let down i should say betrayed even i knew some cops who found erik hanussens body and they told me he was tortured before he was killed i even heard tell they did it on this boat so people wouldnt hear the man screaming von helldorf is an unforgiving man max unforgiving and unbalanced he likes to whip people did you know that then again maybe you could be his pet jew they say even goering has one these days krempel returned with my crumpled coat in one hand and in the other the envelope containing drafts of the letter i had asked the page boy at the adlon to post the previous evening i watched max reles read it with a mixture of keen anticipation and shame you know its surprising what a man will find he is capable of doing when it comes right down to it i said i never thought i could write a letter denouncing someone to the gestapo to say nothing of basing that denunciation on a mans race ordinarily id feel pretty disgusted with myself max but in your case it was a real pleasure i almost hope you do kill me itd be worth it just to imagine the look on all their faces avery brundage included reles crushed the letters in an angrylooking fist and threw them over the side thats all right i said i kept a copy the colt was still in his other hand it looked as big as a four iron youre a clever man gunther he chuckled but the lack of color in his face told me he wasnt laughing you played those cards well ill say that for you however even if i spare your life it still leaves me with a hell of a problem yes sir a hell of a problem he puffed the cigar and then threw that over the side too but you know i think i have the solution yes i really think i know but you my dear he turned to look at dora she had opened her bag and removed her powder compact and was now checking the perimeters of her lipstick you know too much dora dropped the compact this wasnt a surprise to anyone as max reles was now pointing the colt not at me but at her max she smilednervously perhapsthinking for half a moment that he was joking what are you talking about i iove you darling id never betray you max surely you know that we both know thats not true and while i think i have a way to guarantee that gunther here wont actually denounce me to the gestapo i dont have a way of ensuring the same thing from you i wish i could think of some other way really i do but you are what you are max this time dora screamed his name then she turned and ran as if there had been someplace else for her to go reles uttered a profound sigh that almost made me feel sorry for him i could see he regretted having to kill her but id given him no choice that much was now obvious he leveled the gun and fired after her it sounded like a cannon on a pirate ship the shot took her down like a cheetah tripping a gazelle and her head seemed to explode with a pinkish thought made entirely of blood and brains he fired again but this time he wasnt aiming the gun at dora bauer facing me she was lying in a pool of thick dark red that was already spreading across the deck twitching slightly but probably dead the second shot hit gerhard krempel it took him by surprise and lifted the crown of his head like the top of a hardboiled egg the impact was such that it flipped him over the rail of the boat and into the water a strong smell of cordite filled the air and mixed neatly with the acrid scent of my own mortal fear aw shit moaned reles staring over the side and i was going to weigh them down together like something from an opera one of those fucking german operas that go on forever he made the gun safe and dropped it on its lanyard i guess ill have to leave him be cant be helped dora on the other hand dora he walked fastidiously around the pool of blood and kicked the back of her head softly with the toe of his white shoe and then kicked it a little harder as if making quite certain she was dead her eyes still wide with fear remained motionless staring at me accusingly as if she held me entirely responsible for what had happened to her and she was right of course reles could never have trusted her he came over and inspected my ankles and then untied the rope that was attached to the three concrete blocks then he tied it tightly around her shapely ankles i dont know why youre looking like that gunther im not going to kill you of course that makes it your fault shes dead what makes you think you can afford to let me live i asked trying to contain my very real fear that in spite of what id said by way of a threat and what hed said by way of an answer he was going to kill me anyway you mean whats to stop you from sending that letter to the gestapo anyway if you manage to come out of this alive i nodded he chuckled his sadistic chuckle and pulled hard on the knot securing doras ankles to the concrete blocks thats a very good question gunther and i will answer it just as soon as ive sent this little lady on her last and most important voyage you can depend on that the concrete blocks were attached to the rope like a series of fishermans weights one after the other he carried them grunting loudly to the side of the boat and then opened a gate in the rail and then one after the other he pushed the blocks over the side with the sole of his shoe the weight of the blocks turned doras body and started to drag her toward the side it was probably the sensation of being moved that brought her back to consciousness first she moaned then she inhaled loudly the breasts on her chest lifting up like two tiny lavendercolored circus tents at the same time she flung out an arm turned onto her stomach lifted up what was left of her head and spoke to me gunther help me max reles laughed at the surprise of it and fumbled for his automatic to shoot dora again before the three weights could drag her through the gate in the rail but by the time he had worked the slide on the colt it was too late whatever she had tried to say to me was lost in a scream as she realized what was happening the next second she was dragged over the side of the boat i closed my eyes i could do nothing to help there was a loud splash and then another the screaming mouth filled with water and then there was a terrible silence jesus said reles staring down at the water did you see that i could have sworn the bitch was dead i mean you saw me give her a kick to make sure and id have shot her again to spare her that if thered been time jesus he shook his head and let out a nervous breath how about that once more he made the gun safe and dropped it on the lanyard from the coat he took out a hip flask and took a large pull on it before offering it to me hair of the dog i shook my head no i guess not thats the thing about alcohol poisoning be a while before you can even tolerate the smell of schnapps let alone drink any you bastard me it was you that killed her gunther him too once youd said what you said there was no alternative they had to die theyd have had me over a barrel with my pants down and fucked me from now until christmas and theres nothing i could have done about it he took another swig of liquor you on the other hand i know exactly whats to stop you from doing that very same thing can you think what it is i sighed honestly no he chuckled and i wanted to kill him for it then its lucky im here to tell you asshole noreen charalambides thats what she was is in love with you he frowned and shook his head christ only knows why i mean youre a loser gunther a liberal in a country full of nazis if that doesnt make you a loser then theres that hole in your fucking shoe i mean how could a dame like that fall for a schmuck with a hole in his fucking shoe just as important however he continued you are in love with her no point in denying it you see we had a talk she and i before she left berlin to go back to the states and she told me how you two felt about each other which i have to say was a disappointment to me on account of the fact that she and i had a thing ourselves on the boat from new york did she tell you that no it doesnt matter now all that does matter is that you care enough about noreen to stop her from being killed because heres whats going to happen as soon as im off this boat im going to send a telegram to my kid brother in new york to be honest hes my half brother but blood is blood right kid twist they call him because its fair to say hes a little bit fucking twisted in the head well theres that and the fact that he used to like twisting the necks of guys he didnt like until they broke that was before he developed his real skill with an ice pick anyway the fact is he likes killing people me i do it because i have to like just now but he enjoys his work so what im going to tell him in this telegram im going to send is this see that if anything happens to me while im in germany like me getting arrested by the gestapo anything then he should track down mrs charalambides and kill her with a name like that believe me she wont be hard to find he can rape her too if hes got half a mind which he has and if hes in the mood and quite often he is he grinned you can think of it as my own denunciation if you like except that unlike yours gunther her being jewish has got nothing to do with anything anyway im sure you can grasp the general idea of what im talking about my leaving you alone is guaranteed by the letter youve addressed to the jew desk at the gestapo and your leaving me alone is similarly guaranteed by the telegram im going to send to my kid brother just as soon as im back in my suite we hold each other in check just like stalemate in a chess game or what the political scientists call a balance of power your insurance canceled out by mine what do you say a sudden wave of nausea hit me i leaned to the side and retched again im going to take that as a yes said reles because lets face it what other choice do you have i like to think i can read a man like a newspaper gunther that was easier during prohibition the guys i dealt with were blackandwhite and mostly you knew where you were with them just by looking in their eyes then after the repeal of the volstead act my organization had to diversify find some new rackets gunther i virtually started labor and union rackets in the states but a lot of these guys are harder to read you know guys in business it was hard to find out what they fucking wanted because unlike the guys running booze they themselves didnt know what that was most people dont and thats their problem you on the other hand my friend you are a little bit of both you think youre a blackandwhite kind of guy you think you know what you fucking want but really youre not and you dont when i first met you i thought you were just another dumb excopper looking to make a quick bill i expect there are times when thats even the way you think of yourself but youre more than that i expect thats what noreen saw something else something complicated whatever it was she wasnt the type to fall for a guy who didnt fall for her in the same way he shrugged with her and me it was just because she was bored with you i think it was the real thing reles spoke calmly even reasonably and listening to him speak i found it was hard to believe that he had just murdered two people if id felt any better i might have argued with him but with the stomach i had and the talking id already done i was more or less exhausted all i wanted to do was sleep and stay asleep for a very long time and maybe puke a bit more if and when the need hit me at least then i would know i was alive as i see it he said theres just one remaining problem i imagine its not a problem you can fix with that colt not directly no i mean you could do it for me but i bet youre the picky type well you are now id like to meet you in ten years time to see how picky you are then if you mean im picky about murdering people in cold blood then youre right although i could make an exception in your case at least i could until youve sent that telegram which is why im going to leave you on the boat until ive had time to go to the palace hotel in potsdam and send the message to abe thats a nice hotel by the way i have a suite there too for when im in potsdam he shook his head no my problem is this what am i going to do about that gestapo captain in würzburg what was his name weinberger i nodded he knows too much about me i nodded again tell me gunther is he married does he have any kids anyone he loves who i can threaten if he gets out of line i shook my head i can honestly say that the only person he really cares about is himself to that extent at least hes fairly typical of anyone working for the gestapo all weinberger cares about is his career and getting on at any price reles nodded and walked around the deck for a moment to that extent at least you said in what way is he atypical i shook my head and realized i had a blinding headache the kind that feels likely to leave you blind im not sure that i understand what youre driving at is he queer does he like little girls can he be bribed whats his achilles heel does he have one he shrugged look i could have him killed probably but it makes waves when a cop gets killed like that cop who got killed outside the excelsior in the summer the berlin polenta made all sorts of heat about that didnt they tell me about it i dont want to have him killed but everyones got a weakness yours is noreen charalambides mine is that fucking letter thats in some cops desk drawer right so whats this captain weinbergers weakness now you come to mention it there is something he snapped his fingers at me all right lets hear it i said nothing fuck you gunther this isnt about your conscience this is about noreen this is about her opening the door one night and finding my kid brother abe on her doorstep in truth hes not as skilled with an ice pick as i am few people are except maybe my old man and the doctor who taught him me im just as happy to use a gun gets the job done but abe max reles shook his head and smiled one time back in brooklyn when we were both working the shapiro brotherslocal underworld figuresthe kid murdered this guy in a car wash because he didnt clean his car right he left the wheels dirty so abe told me anyway broad daylight and the kid knocks him out and then stabs him in the fucking ear with an ice pick not a mark the coppers thought the guy had a heart attack as it happens the shapiros theyre dead too me and abe buried bill alive in a sandpit last may thats one of the reasons i came to berlin in the first place gunther to wait for the heat on that murder to die down a little he paused so am i making myself clear you want that i should tell the kid to bury the bitch alive like bill shapiro i shook my head all right i said ill tell you part two havana february when the wind blows from the north the sea smashes into the wall on the malecón as if it has been unleashed by a besieging army intent on the revolutionary overthrow of havana gallons of water are launched into the air and then rain down upon the broad oceanfront highway washing some of the dust from the big american cars heading west or drenching those pedestrians who are daring or foolish enough to walk along the wall during winter weather for a few minutes i watched the crashing moonlit waves with real hope they were near but not quite near enough to reach the windup gramophone belonging to the cuban youths who had spent most of the night grouped in front of my apartment building keeping me and probably several others awake with the rumba music that is everywhere on the island there were times when i found myself longing for the hobnailed juggernaut rhythms of a german brass band not to mention the streetcleaning properties of a model twentyfourstick grenade unable to sleep i considered going to the casa marina and then rejected the idea certain that at this late hour the particular chica i favored would no longer be free besides yara was asleep in my bed and while she would never have questioned my leaving the apartment in the small hours of the morning the ten dollars payable to doña marina would probably have been money wasted since i was no longer equal to the task of making love twice in as many days let alone in the space of one evening so i sat down and finished the book i was reading instead it was a book in english for some time now id been learning english in an effort to persuade an englishman named robert freeman to give me a job freeman worked for the british tobacco giant gallaher running a subsidiary company called j frankau which had been the uk distributor for all havana cigars since i had been cultivating freeman in the hope that i might talk him into sending me back to germanyat my own expense i might addto see if i couldnt open up the new west german market a covering letter of introduction and several boxes of samples would i supposed be enough to smooth the arrival of carlos hausner an argentine of german descent back to germany and enable me to blend in it wasnt that i disliked cuba far from it i had left argentina with a hundred thousand american dollars and i lived very comfortably in havana but i yearned for somewhere without biting insects and where people went to bed at a sensible time of night and where none of the drinks was made of ice i was tired of getting a freezing headache every time i went into a bar another reason i wanted to return to germany was that my argentine passport would not last forever but once i was safely back in germany i could disappear again going back to berlin was out of the question of course for one thing it was now landlocked in the communistcontrolled german democratic republic and for another the berlin police were probably looking for me in connection with the murders of two women in vienna in not that i had murdered them ive done a lot of things in my life of which im less than proud but i havent ever murdered a woman not unless you counted the soviet woman id shot during the long hot summer of one of an nkvd death squad whod just murdered several thousand unarmed prisoners in their cells i expect the russians would have counted that as murder which was another good reason to stay out of berlin hamburg looked like a better bet hamburg was in the federal republic and i didnt know anyone in hamburg more important no one there knew me meanwhile my life was good i had what most habaneros wanted a large apartment on malecón a big american car a woman to provide sex and a woman to cook my meals sometimes it was the same woman who cooked the food and also provided the sex but my vedado apartment was only a few tantalizing blocks from the corner of twentyfifth street and long before yara became my devoted housekeeper id got into the habit of paying regular visits to havanas most famous and luxurious casa de putas i liked yara but it wasnt anything more than that she stayed when she felt like staying not because i asked her but because she wanted to i think yara was a negress but its a little hard to be sure about things like that in cuba she was tall and slim and about twenty years younger than i with a face like a muchloved pony she wasnt a whore because she didnt take money for it she only looked like a whore most of the women in havana looked like whores most of the whores looked like your little sister yara wasnt a whore because she made a better living as a thief stealing from me i didnt mind that it saved me from having to pay her besides she stole only what she thought i could afford to lose which as it happened was a lot less than guilt would have obliged me to pay her yara didnt spit and she didnt smoke cigars and she was a devotee of the santería religion which it seemed to me was a bit like voodoo i liked that she prayed about me to some african gods they had to work better than the ones id been praying to as soon as the rest of havana was awake i drove along to the prado in my chevrolet styline the styline was probably the commonest car in cuba and very possibly one of the largest it took more metal to make a styline than there was in bethlehem steel i parked in front of the gran teatro it was a neobaroque building with so many angels crowded onto its lavish exterior it was clear the architect must have thought being a playwright or an actor was more important than being an apostle these days anything is more important than being an apostle especially in cuba i had arranged to meet freeman in the smoking room at the nearby partagas cigar factory but i was early so i went to the hotel inglaterra and ordered some breakfast on the terrace there i encountered the usual cast of havana characters minus the prostitutes it was still a little early for the prostitutes there were american naval officers on furlough from the warship in the harbor some matronly tourists a few chinese businessmen from the nearby barrio chino a couple of underworld types wearing sharkskin suits and small stetson hats and a trio of government officials in pinstriped jackets with faces as dark as tobacco leaves and even darker glasses i ate an english breakfast and then crossed the busy palmshrouded parque central to visit my favorite shop in havana hobby center on the corner of obispo and berniz sold model ships toy cars and most important for my purposes electric train sets my own layout was a tabletop threerail dublo it wasnt anything on the scale of the train set id once seen in hermann goerings house but it gave me a lot of pleasure in the shop i collected a new locomotive and tender id ordered from england i got a lot of models from england but there were several things on my layout id made myself in the workshop at home yara disliked the workshop almost as much as she feared the train set to her there was something devilish about it nothing to do with the movement of the actual trains she wasnt entirely primitive no it was the fascination a train set held for a grown man that she held to be somehow hypnotic and devilish the shop was only a few meters from la moderna poesia this was havanas largest bookstore only it looked more like a concrete airraid shelter safely inside i chose a book of montaignes essays in english not because i had a burning desire to read montaigne whom id only vaguely heard of but because i thought it looked improving and almost anyone at the casa marina could have told me that i needed a bit of improving at the very least i thought i needed to start wearing my glasses more often for a moment i was convinced i was seeing things there in the bookshop was someone i had last seen in another life twenty years before it was noreen charalambides except that she wasnt noreen charalambides not any longer no more than i was bernhard gunther a long time ago shed left her husband nick and gone back to being noreen eisner and as the author of more than ten successful novels and several celebrated plays this was how the reading world now knew her under the fawning gaze of some oleaginous american tourist noreen was signing a book at the till where i was about to pay for montaigne which meant that she and i saw each other simultaneously but for that i would probably have crept away i would have crept away because i was living in cuba under a false name and the fewer people who knew about that the better another reason was that i was hardly looking my best i hadnt looked my best since the spring of noreen on the other hand looked much the same there were a few flecks of gray in her brown hair and a line or two on her forehead but she was still a beauty she wore a nice sapphire brooch and a gold wristwatch in her hand was a silver fountain pen and over her arm was an expensive crocodile handbag when noreen saw me she put her hand over her mouth as if shed seen a ghost maybe she had at that the older i get the easier it is to believe that my own past is someone elses life and that im just a soul in limbo or some kind of flying dutchman figure doomed to sail the seas for all eternity i touched the brim of my hat just to check that my head was still working and said hello i spoke in english too which probably left her even more confused thinking she must have forgotten my name i was on the point of removing my hat and thought better of it perhaps after all it was better she didnt remember my name not until id told her the new one is it really you she whispered yes i had a lump in my throat as big as my fist i thought you were probably dead in fact i was sure of it i cant believe its really you i have the same problem when i get up in the morning and limp toward the bathroom it always feels like someone must have stolen my real body in the night and replaced it with my fathers noreen shook her head there were tears in her eyes she opened her handbag and took out a handkerchief that wouldnt have dried the eyes of a mouse perhaps youre the answer to my prayer she said then it must have been a santería prayer i said a prayer to a catholic saint whos really just a disguise for some kind of voodoo spirit or something worse for a moment i held my tongue wondering what ancient demons what infernal powers would have claimed bernie gunther as one of theirs and nominated him as the dark mischievous answer to someones idle prayer i glanced around awkwardly the fawning american tourist was an overweight lady of around sixty wearing thin gloves and a summer hat with a veil that made her look like a beekeeper she was watching noreen and me carefully like we were all in a theater and when she wasnt watching noreen and me perform our touching little reunion scene she was glancing at the signature in her book as if she couldnt quite believe that the author had inscribed it look i said we cant talk here the bar on the corner the floridita meet me there in five minutes then i looked at the book clerk and said id like to charge this to my account the name is hausner carlos hausner i spoke in spanish but i was sure noreen understood she always had been quick to understand what was going on i shot her a look and nodded she nodded back as if to reassure me that my secret was safe for now actually im done here said noreen she looked at the tourist and smiled and the tourist smiled back and thanked noreen profusely as if shed been given not an inscribed book but a signed check for a thousand dollars so why dont i just come with you now noreen said and threaded her arm through mine she escorted me to the door of the bookshop after all i wouldnt want you to disappear now that ive found you again why would i do that oh i can think of any number of reasons she said señor hausner i am an author after all we came out of the shop and walked up a gentle slope toward the floridita bar i know i even read one of your books the one about the spanish civil war the worst turns the best to the brave and what did you think honestly you can give it a try i suppose carlos i enjoyed it so its not just your name thats false no really i did we were outside the bar a man jackknifed off the hood of an oldsmobile and bowed into our path taxi señor taxi i waved the man away and let noreen go into the bar first ive time for a quick one and then i have to go i have an appointment in fifteen minutes at the cigar factory its business a job maybe so i cant break it if thats the way you want it after all its only been half a lifetime there was a mahogany bar the size of a velodrome and behind it a dingylooking mural of an old sailing ship entering the port of havana it might have been a slave ship but another cargo of tourists or american sailors seemed a more likely bet the floridita was full of americans most of them fresh off the cruise ship parked next to the destroyer in havana harbor inside the door a trio of musicians was setting up to play we found a table and i quickly ordered some drinks while the waiter could still hear me noreen was busy checking out my shopping montaigne huh im impressed she was speaking german now probably getting ready to ask me some awkward questions without our being overheard and understood dont be i havent read it yet whats this hobby center do you have children no thats for me seeing her smile i shrugged i like train sets i like the way they just keep on going around and around like one single simple innocent thought in my head that way i can ignore all the other thoughts that are in there i know youre like the governess in the turn of the screw am i its a novel by henry james i wouldnt know so any kids yourself i have a daughter dinah shes just finished school the waiter arrived and neatly set out the drinks in front of us like a chess grand master castling a king and a rook when he was gone noreen said whats the story carlos are you wanted or something its a long story we toasted each other silently ill bet i glanced at my watch too long to tell now another time what about you what are you doing in cuba last i heard you were up before that stupid kangaroo court the house committee on unamerican activities the huac when was that may i was accused of being a communist and blacklisted by several hollywood movie studios she stirred her drink with a cocktail stick thats why im here a good friend of mine who lives in cuba read about the huac hearings and invited me to come and live in his house for a while thats a good friend to have hes ernest hemingway now thats a friend i have heard of as a matter of fact this is one of his favorite bars are you and he no ernest is married anyway hes away right now in africa killing things himself mostly is he a communist too good grief no ernest isnt political at all its people that interest him not ideologies wise man not so youd notice the band started to play and i groaned it was the kind of band that made you feel seasick as they swayed one way and then the other one of the men played a witch doctors flute and another tapped a monotonous cowbell that left you feeling sorry for cows their sung harmonies were like a freight locomotives horn the girl yelled solos and played guitar i never yet saw a guitar that i didnt want to use to drive a nail into a piece of wood or into the head of the idiot strumming it now i really do have to go i said whats the matter dont you like music not since i came to cuba i finished my drink and glanced at my watch again look i said my meetings only going to take an hour or so why dont we meet for lunch i cant i have to get back i have people coming to dinner tonight and there are things i have to get for the cook id love you to come if you could all right i will its the finca vigía in san francisco de paula noreen opened her bag took out a notepad and scribbled down an address and telephone number why dont you come earlysay around five oclock before the rest of my guests arrive well catch up then id like that i took the notepad and wrote out my own address and phone number here i said just in case you think im going to run out on you its good to see you again gunther you too noreen i went to the door and glanced back at the people in the floridita bar no one was listening to the band or even intending to listen not while there was drinking to be done the barman was making daiquiris like they were on special offer about a dozen at a time from everything id heard and read about ernest hemingway that was the way he liked drinking them too i bought some petit robustos in the cigar factory shop and took them into the smoking room where a number of men including robert freeman inhabited an almost infernal world of swirling smoke and igniting matches and glowing tobacco embers every time i went into that room the smell reminded me of the library at the adlon hotel and for a moment i could almost see poor louis adlon standing in front of me with a favorite upmann in his white gloved fingers freeman was a large bluff man who looked more south american than british he spoke good spanish for an englishmanabout as good as my ownwhich perhaps was hardly surprising given his family history his greatgrandfather james freeman had started selling cuban cigars as long ago as he listened politely to the details of my proposal and then told me of his own plans to expand the family business until recently i owned a cigar factory in jamaica but like the jamaicans themselves the product is inconsistent so ive sold that and decided to concentrate on selling cuban cigars in britain i have plans to buy a couple of other companies that will give me about twenty percent of the british market but the german market i dont know is there such a thing you tell me old boy i told him about germanys membership in the european coal and steel community and how the country benefiting from the currency reform of had seen the fastest growth of any nation in european history i told him how industrial production had increased by thirtyfive percent and how agricultural production had already surpassed prewar levels its amazing these days how much real information you can get from a german newspaper the question is not i said can you afford to try to gain a share of the west german market but can you afford not to try freeman looked impressed i was impressed myself it made a pleasant change to be discussing an export market instead of a pathologists report and yet all i could think about was noreen eisner and seeing her again after such a long time twenty years it seemed almost miraculous after all that we had been throughshe driving an ambulance in the spanish civil war and me in nazi germany and soviet russia in truth i had no romantic intentions toward her twenty years was too long for any feelings to have survived besides our affair had lasted only a few weeks but i did hope that she and i might become friends again i didnt have many friends in havana and i was looking forward to sharing a few memories with someone in whose company i might be myself again my real self instead of the person i was supposed to be it was four years since id done anything as straightforward as that and i wondered what a man like robert freeman would have said if id told him about bernie gunthers life probably hed have swallowed his cigar as it was we parted amicably with his declaring that we should meet again just as soon as he had bought the two competing companies which would give him the rights to sell the brands montecristo and ramon allones do you know something carlos he said as we went out of the smoking room youre the first german ive spoken to since before the war argentinegerman i said correcting him yes of course not that ive anything against the germans you understand were all on the same side now arent we against the communists and all that you know sometimes i wonder what to make of it all what happened between our two countries the war i mean the nazis and hitler what do you think about it i try not to think about it at all i said but when i do i think this that for a short period of time the german language was a series of very large german words formed from very small german thinking freeman chuckled and puffed his cigar at the same time quite he said oh quite its the fate of every race to think itself chosen by god i added but its the fate of only a very few races that theyre sufficiently stupid as to try to put that into practice in the sales hall i passed a photograph of the british prime minister with a cigar in his mouth and nodded ill tell you another thing hitler didnt drink and he didnt smoke and he was healthy right up until the day he shot himself quite said freeman oh quite finca vigía was about twelve kilometers southeast of central havanaa onestory spanish colonial house set in a twentyacre estate and boasting a fine view of the bay to the north i parked next to a lemon pontiac chieftain convertiblethe one with the chiefs head on the hood that glows when the headlights are switched on there was something vaguely african about the white house and its situation and as i climbed out of my car and glanced around at all the mango trees and enormous jacarandas i thought i could almost have been visiting the home of some district high commissioner in kenya this was an impression strongly enhanced by the interior the house was a museum to hemingways love of hunting each of the many large airy rooms including the master bedroombut not the bathroomcontained the trophy heads of kudu water buffalo and ibex anything with horns in fact i wouldnt have been surprised to have found the head of the last unicorn in that house or maybe a couple of exwives as well as these trophies there were a great many books even in the bathroom and unlike in my own house most of them looked as if they had been read the tiled floors were largely uncarpeted which must have been tough on the feet of the several cats who gave the impression of owning the place there were very few pictures on the whitewashed walls just a few bullfighting posters furniture had been chosen for comfort rather than elegance in the living room the sofa and armchairs were covered with a flowery material that struck a discordant feminine touch in the midst of all that masculine love of death at the very center of the living room like the twentyfourcarat diamond that was set into the floor of the entrance hall of havanas national capitol building and which pinpoints zero for all distance measurements in cuba was a drinks table with more bottles than a beer truck noreen poured us a couple of large bourbons and we carried them out onto a long terrace where she told me about her life since last id seen her in return i described a version of my ownone that carefully left out my having been in the ss not to mention my active service with a police battalion in the ukraine but i told her about how id been a private detective and a regular cop again and erich gruen and how he and the cia had managed to frame me as a nazi war criminal and how id been obliged to seek the help of the old comrades to escape europe and start a new life in argentina thats how i ended up with a false name and an argentine passport i explained glibly id probably still be there but for the fact that the perónists discovered i wasnt really a nazi at all but why come to cuba oh i dont know the same reasons as everyone else i suppose the climate the cigars the women the casinos i play backgammon in some of the casinos i sipped the bourbon enjoying the sweet and sour taste of the famous writers liquor ernest came because of the biggame fishing i glanced around looking for a fish but there werent any when hes here he spends most of his time at cojimar its a crummy little fishing village on the crust of a shoreline where he keeps his boat ernest loves fishing but theres a nice bar in cojimar and i have the sneaking suspicion he likes the bar more than he likes the boat or fishing for that matter on the whole i suspect ernest likes bars more than just about anything cojimar i used to go there a lot until i heard that the militia were using it for target practice and that sometimes the targets were still breathing noreen nodded ive heard that story and im sure its true i could believe almost anything about fulgencio batista just along from that beach hes built a village of exclusive villas behind a wire fence for all his top generals i drove past it just the other day theyre all pink not the generalsthat would be too much to hope for the villas pink yes it looks like a holiday camp in a dream described by samuel taylor coleridge hes someone else i havent read one of these days im going to have to learn how its strange i can buy any amount of books but ive found its no substitute for reading them hearing footsteps on the terrace i turned around and saw a pretty young woman approaching i stood up and trying to wipe some of the wolfman from my face i smiled carlos this is my daughter dinah she was taller than her mother and not just because of the stiletto heels on her feet she wore a polkadot halter dress that only just covered her knees and left most of her back and a bit beyond exposed which made the little net gloves look unnecessary over her muscular sunburned forearm was a mohair handbag that was the shape size and color of karl marxs best beard her own hair was almost blond but not quite which suited her better and all shallow layers and soft waves and the string of pearls around her slender young neck must have been hung there as tribute from some admiring sea god certainly her figure was worth a whole basketful of golden apples her mouth was as full as a sail on an oceangoing schooner and lipsticked signal red by a skilled and steady hand that might have been school of rubens the eyes were large and blue and twinkling with an intelligence made to look more determined by her square and slightly dimpled chin there are beautiful girls and there are beautiful girls who know it dinah charalambides was a beautiful girl who knew how to solve a quadratic equation hey she said coolly i nodded back but id already lost her attention can i have the car mom youre not going out i wont be late i dont like you going out at night said noreen suppose you get stopped at an army checkpoint do i look like a revolutionary asked dinah sadly no well then my daughter is nineteen carlos said noreen but she behaves like shes thirty everything i know i learned from you mother dear where are you going anyway the barracuda club i wish you wouldnt go there weve been through this before dinah sighed look all my friends are going to be there thats what im talking about why cant you mix with some friends of your own age perhaps i would dinah said pointedly if we werent exiled from our home in los angeles were not exiled insisted noreen i just needed to get away from the states for a while i understand that of course i do but please try to understand what its like for me i want to go out and have some fun not sit around the dinner table and talk about politics with a lot of boring people dinah glanced at me and flashed me a quick apologetic smile oh i dont mean you señor gunther from what mothers told me im sure youre a very interesting person but most of noreens friends are leftwing writers and lawyers intellectuals and friends of ernests who drink too much i flinched a bit when she called me gunther it meant noreen had already revealed my secret to her daughter that irritated me dinah put a cigarette in her mouth and lit it as if it were a firecracker and i do wish you wouldnt smoke said noreen dinah rolled her eyes and held out one gloved hand keys on the desk by the telephone dinah stalked off in a cloud of scent cigarette smoke and exasperation like the ruthless bitchbeauty in one of her mothers gothicamerican plays i hadnt seen any of them onstage only the movies that had been made of them these were stories full of unscrupulous mothers mad fathers flighty wives dishonest and sadistic sons and drunken homosexual husbandsthe kind of stories that almost made me glad i didnt have a family myself i lit a cigar and tried to contain my amusement noreen poured us both another bourbon from a bottle of old forester shed brought from the living room and helped herself to ice from a bucket fashioned from an elephants foot little bitch she said tonelessly she has a place at brown university and yet she still maintains this fucking fiction that shes obliged to live here in havana with me i didnt ask her to come i havent written a damn thing since i got here she sits around and plays records all day i cant work when someone plays records especially the kind of fucking records she listens to frank sinatra and tommy dorsey i ask you god i hate those smug bastards and i cant work at night when shes out because im worried something will happen to her a second or two later the pontiac chieftain started up and moved off down the drive with the hoods indian head scouting out the way forward in the encroaching darkness you dont want her here with you noreen gave me a narroweyed stare over the rim of her glass you used to be a little quicker on the uptake gunther what happened something hit you on the head during the war just the odd bit of shrapnel now and then id show you the scars but id have to take my wig off but she wasnt ready to be amused again not yet she lit a cigarette and flicked the match into the bushes if you had a nineteenyearold daughter would you want her to live in havana that would depend on whether or not she had any goodlooking friends noreen grimaced its precisely that kind of remark that made me think shed be better off in rhode island there are too many bad influences in havana too much easy sex too much cheap booze thats why i live here and shes in with the wrong crowd continued noreen ignoring me as a matter of fact thats one of the reasons i asked you here tonight and there i was naively thinking that you asked me down here for purely sentimental reasons you can still pack a punch noreen i didnt mean it like that no i let that one go i sniffed my drink for a moment enjoying the combusted aroma the bourbon smelled like the devils coffee cup take it from me angel there are many worse places to live than cuba i know ive tried living in them berlin after the war was no ivy league dormitory and neither was vienna especially if you were a girl russian soldiers have got pimps and beachboy gigolos beat for bad influences noreen and thats not anticommunist rightwing propaganda sweetheart thats the truth and speaking of that delicate subject how much did you tell her about me not much until a few minutes ago i didnt know how much there was to tell all you said to me this morningand by the way you were speaking not directly to me but to the book clerk in la moderna poesia was that your name was carlos hausner and why the hell did you pick carlos as your nom de plume carlos is a name for a fat mexican peasant in a john wayne movie no i dont see you as a carlos at all i expect thats why i used your real name berniewell it just sort of slipped out when i was telling her about berlin in thats unfortunate given how much trouble i went to in order to get a new name to be quite frank with you if the authorities found out about me noreen i could be deported back to germany which would be awkward to say the least like i told you there are peoplerussian peoplewhod probably like to hold a knot under my ear she gave me a look that was full of suspicion maybe thats what you deserve maybe i put my drink down on a glass table and weighed her remark in my mind for a moment then again in most cases its only in books that people get whats coming to them but if you really think thats what i deserve then perhaps ill be running along i went into the house and then out again through the front door she was standing by the railing on the terrace above the steps that led down to my car im sorry she said i dont think you deserve it at all okay i was just teasing you please come back i stood there and looked up at her without much pleasure i was angry and i didnt care that she knew it and not just about the remark shed made about me deserving to hang i was angry with her and with myself that id not made it clearer that bernie gunther no longer existed and that carlos hausner had taken his place i was so excited to see you again after all these years her voice seemed to catch on something like a cashmere sweater snagging on a nail im sorry i let your secret out of the bag ill speak to dinah when she gets home and tell her to keep what i told her in confidence okay im afraid i didnt think about the possible implications of telling her about you but you see she and i have been very close since nick her father died we always tell each other everything most women have a vulnerability dial they can turn it up pretty much whenever they want and it works on men like catnip noreen was turning the dial now first the catch in her voice and then a big unsteady sigh it was working too and she was operating only at level three or four there was plenty of what makes the weaker sex seem like the weaker sex still in the tank a moment later her shoulders dropped and she turned away please she said please dont go level five i stood on the step looking at my cigar and then down the long winding drive that led onto the main road into san francisco de paula finca vigía it meant lookout farm and it was well named because there was a sort of tower to the left of the main building where someone might sit in a room on the top story and write a book and look out on the world below and think himself a sort of god that was probably why people became writers in the first place a cat came along and rubbed its gray body along my shins as if it too were trying to persuade me to stay on the other hand it might just have been looking to get rid of a lot of unwanted cat hair on my best trousers another cat was sitting like an erect bedspring beside my car ready to disrupt my departure if its feline colleague failed to do it first finca vigía something told me to look out for myself and leave that if i stayed i might end up like a character in someones stupid novel without any will of my own that one of themnoreen or hemingwaymight make me do something i didnt want to do all right my voice sounded like an animals in the darkness or perhaps an orisha of the forest from the world of santería i threw away the cigar and went back inside noreen met me halfway which was generous and we embraced fondly her body still felt good in my arms and reminded me of everything it was supposed to remind me of level six she still knew how to affect me that much was certain she laid her head on my shoulder but with her face turned away and let me inhale her beauty for a while we didnt kiss that wasnt yet required not while we were still on level six not while her face was turned away after a moment or two she broke away and sat down again you said something about dinahs being in with the wrong crowd i said that it was one of the reasons you asked me here im sorry i put it so badly thats not like me after all im supposed to be good with words but i do need your help with dinah its been a long time since i knew anything about nineteenyearold girls noreen and even then what i knew was probably hopelessly wrong short of spanking her i dont see what i can do i wonder if that might work she said i dont think it would help her very much of course theres always the possibility i might enjoy it which is another reason to pack her off to rhode island but i agree with you the barracuda club is no place for a nineteenyearold girl although there are much worse places in havana oh shes been to them all i can assure you the shanghai theater the cabaret kursaal the hotel chic and those are just the matchbooks ive found in her bedroom it might be even worse than that i shook my head no it doesnt get any worse than them even in havana i fetched my drink off the glass table and poured it safely away in my mouth all right shes wild if the movies are right then most kids are these days but at least theyre not beating up jews and i still dont see what i can do about it noreen found the old forester and refilled my glass well maybe we can think of something together like in the old days remember in berlin if things had worked out differently we might even have made a difference if ever id written that article we might even have put a stop to hitlers olympiad im kind of glad you didnt write it if you had id probably be dead she nodded for a while we made quite an investigative team gunther you were my galahad my knight of heaven sure i remember your letter id like to tell you i still had it but the americans reorganized my filing system when they bombed berlin you want my advice about dinah i reckon you should fix a lock on her door and put her under a nine oclock curfew that used to work back in vienna when the four powers were in charge of the city also you might think about not lending her the car whenever she asks for it if it was me wearing those heels she had on i might think twice about walking nine miles into the center of havana id like to see that me wearing high heels sure im a regular at the palette club although they know me better there as rita you know its not a bad thing that children should frequently disobey their parents especially when you consider the mistakes the parents made especially when theyre as grown up as dinah obviously is perhaps if i gave you all the facts she said you might understand the problem you can try but im not a detective anymore noreen but you were werent you she smiled a cunning smile it was me who got you started as a private detective or maybe you need reminding so thats your angle she curled her lip with displeasure i certainly didnt mean it to be an angle as you put it not in the least but im a mother whos running out of options here ill send you a check with interest oh stop it for petes sake i dont want your money ive got plenty of money but you might at least shut up for a minute and do me the courtesy of hearing me out before opening fire with both cannons i figure you owe me that much thats fair isnt it all right i cant promise to hear anything but ill listen noreen shook her head you know gunther it beats me how you ever survived the war ive only just met you again and already i want to shoot you she laughed scornfully you want to be careful you know this house has more guns than the cuban militia there are nights when ive sat here drinking with hem and he had a shotgun on his lap for taking potshots at the birds in the trees sounds dangerous for the cats not just the fucking cats still laughing she shook her head people too my head would look good in your bathroom what a horrid thought you looking at me every time i took a bath i was thinking of your daughter thats enough noreen stood up abruptly damn you get out she said get the fuck out of here i went into the house again wait she snapped wait please i waited why are you such a hardass i guess im not used to human society i said please listen you could help her youre about the one person who can i think more than you know i really dont know who else to ask is she in a jam not exactly no at least not yet theres a man you see whom shes involved with whos much older than her im worried shes going to end up likelike gloria grahame in that movie the big heat you know where that sick bastard throws boiling hot coffee in her face didnt see it last film i saw was peter pan we both turned around as a white oldsmobile came up the drive it had a sun visor and whitewall tires and sounded like the motor bus to santiago damn said noreen thats alfredo the white olds was followed by a twodoor red buick and it looks like the rest of my guests there were eight of us for dinner dinner was prepared and served by ramón hemingways chinese cook and rené his negro butler which only i seemed to find amusing it certainly wasnt because i had anything against the chinese or negroes but it struck me as ironic that noreen and her guests were all solemnly prepared to avow their communism while other men did all the work there was no denying what cuba and its people had suffered first at the hands of the spanish then the americans and then the spanish again but as bad as any of these perhaps had been the cuban governments of ramón grau san martín and now fulgencio batista formerly a sergeant in the cuban army fbas most of the europeans and americans in cuba called himwasnt much more than an american puppet so long as he danced to washingtons tune american support seemed likely to continue no matter how brutishly his regime behaved yet i couldnt bring myself to believe that a totalitarian system of government in which a single authoritarian party controls the stateowned means of production was or ever could be the answer and i said as much to noreens leftleaning guests i think communisms a much greater evil to inflict upon this country than anything that could be conceived and administered by a minor despot like fb a smalltime thug like him might inflict a few individual tragedies perhaps several but it hardly begins to compare with the rule of genuine tyrants like stalin and mao tsetung theyve been the manufacturers of national tragedies i cant speak for all the iron curtain countries but i know germany pretty well and you can take it from me that the working classes of the gdr would love to change places with the oppressed peoples of cuba guillermo infante was a young student who had just been kicked out of the havana university school of journalism he had also served a short sentence for writing something in a popular opposition magazine called bohemia this prompted me to point out that there were no opposition magazines in the soviet union and that even the mildest criticism of the government would have earned him a very long sentence in some forgotten corner of siberia montecristo cigar in hand infante proceeded to call me a bourgeois reactionary and several other phrases beloved of the ivans and their acolytes that i hadnt heard in a long time names that almost made me feel nostalgic for russia like some wet character in chekhov i fought in my corner for a while but when two earnest unattractive women started to call me an apologist for fascism i began to feel beleaguered it can be fun being insulted by a goodlooking woman if you look at it from the point of view that shes bothered to notice you at all but its no fun at all to be insulted by her two ugly sisters finding not much conversational assistance from noreen who had perhaps drunk a little too much to come to my aid i went to the lavatory and while i was there decided to cut my evenings losses and leave when i got back to my car i found one of the other guests already there he had come to offer an apology of sorts his name was alfredo lópez and he was a lawyerone of twentytwo lawyers it seemed who had defended the surviving rebels responsible for the attack on the moncada barracks in july following the inevitable guilty verdict the judge in the santiago palace of justice had sentenced the rebels to what i considered to be fairly modest terms of imprisonment even the leader of the rebels fidel castro ruz had been sentenced to just fifteen years it was true fifteen years was not exactly a light sentence but for a man who had led an armed insurrection against a powerful dictator it compared very well with a short walk to the guillotine at plötzensee lópez was in his midthirties goodlooking in a grinning swarthy sort of way with piercing blue eyes a thin mustache and a rubber swimming cap of shiny black hair he wore white linen trousers and a dark blue openneck guayabera shirt that helped to hide the beginnings of a potbelly he smoked long cigarillos that were the color and shape of his womanly fingers he looked like a very large cat that had been handed the creamcolored keys of the caribbeans largest dairy i am very sorry about that my friend he said lola and carmen shouldnt have been so rude putting politics ahead of simple politeness is unforgivable especially at the dinner table if one cannot be civilized over a meal what hope can there be for proper debate elsewhere forget it im thickskinned enough not to care very much besides ive never been all that interested in politics especially not interested in talking about them it always seems to me that by browbeating others we hope to be able to convince ourselves yes theres something in that i think he allowed but you have to remember that cubans are a very passionate people some of us are already convinced are you i wonder take my word for it there are many of us who are willing to sacrifice everything for freedom in cuba tyranny is tyranny no matter what the tyrants name perhaps ill have the chance to remind you of that one day when your man is in charge of the tyranny fidel oh hes not at all a bad fellow perhaps if you knew a little more about him you might be a little more sympathetic to our cause i doubt it todays freedom fighters are tomorrows dictators no really castros very different hes not out for himself did he tell you that or have you actually seen his bank statement no but ive seen this lópez opened the door of his car and fetched a briefcase from which he took a small pamphletsized booklet he had dozens more in the briefcase as well as a large automatic pistol i supposed he kept it handy for the occasions when proper civilized political debate just wasnt working he held out the booklet in both his hands as if it were something precious like an auctioneers assistant showing a rare object to a roomful of potential buyers on the front of the pamphlet was the picture of a rather stoutlooking young man not unlike lópez himself with a thin mustache and hooded dark eyes the man on the pamphlet looked more like a bandleader than the revolutionary i had read about in the newspapers this is a copy of the statement fidel castro made at his trial last november said lópez the tyranny allowed him the opportunity to speak then i said pointedly as i recall judge roland freislerraving roland they used to call himhe just screamed abuse at the men who had tried to blow up hitler before sending them to the gallows oddly enough i dont remember any of them writing a pamphlet either lópez ignored me its called history will absolve me and weve only just finished printing it so you can have the honor of being one of the first to read it in the coming months were planning to distribute this pamphlet all over the city please señor at least read it eh if only because the man who wrote it is currently languishing in the model prison of the isle of pines hitler wrote a rather longer book in landsberg prison in i didnt read that one either dont joke about this please fidel is a friend to the people so am i cats and dogs seem to like me too but i dont expect them to put me in charge of the government promise me youll at least look at it all right i said taking it keen to get rid of him if it means that much to you ill read it just dont ask me questions about it afterward id hate to forget anything that might lose me the chance to gain a share of a collective farm or the opportunity to denounce someone for sabotaging the fiveyear plan i climbed back into my car and quickly drove away hardly satisfied at the way the evening had turned out at the bottom of the drive i wound down the window and tossed castros stupid pamphlet into the bushes before turning onto the main road north to san miguel del padrón i had a different plan in mind than the cuban rebel leader although it did involve the girls at the casa marina from each according to her abilities to each according to his needs that was the sort of cuban marxian dialectic with which i was in complete sympathy it was just as well that i had thrown away castros pamphlet because in front of the gas station around the next bend in the highway was a military roadblock an armed militiaman flagged me down and ordered me to step out of the car with my hands in the air i meekly stood at the side of the road while two other soldiers searched me and then my car under the steady gaze of the rest of the platoon and their boyish officer i didnt even look at him my eyes were fixed on the two bodies lying facedown on the grass shoulder with most of their brains spilling out from under their hairlines for a moment it was june and i was back with my reserve police battalion the th on the road to smolensk at a place called goloby in the ukraine holstering my pistol i was the officer in charge of a firing squad that had just executed a security unit of nkvd this particular unit had recently finished murdering three thousand ukrainian prisoners in the cells of the nkvd prison at lutsk when our panzer wagons caught up with them we shot them all all thirty of them over the years i had tried to justify this execution to myself but without much success and many were the times when i woke up thinking about those twentyeight men and two women the majority of whom just happened to be jews two of them id shot myself delivering the socalled coup de grâce but there was no grace in it you could tell yourself it was war you could even tell yourself that the people of lutsk had begged us to go after the unit that had murdered their relatives you could tell yourself that a bullet in the head was a quick merciful death compared to what these people had meted out to their prisonersmost of them burned to death when the nkvd deliberately set fire to the prison but it still felt like murder and when i wasnt looking at the two bodies lying by the side of the road i was watching the police van parked a few meters away and the several frightenedlooking occupants of its brightly lit interior their faces were bruised and bloodied and full of fear it was like staring into a tank full of lobsters you had the impression that at any moment one of them might be taken out and killed like the two on the grass shoulder then the officer checked my identity card and asked me several questions in a nasal cartoonish voice that might have made me smile had the situation seemed less lethal a few minutes later i was free to proceed with my journey back to vedado i drove on for about half a kilometer and then stopped at a little pink stone café by the roadside where i asked the owner if i might use the telephone thinking to call finca vigía and warn noreenand in particular alfredo lópezabout the roadblock it wasnt that i liked the lawyer so much i never yet met a lawyer i didnt want to slap but i didnt think he deserved a bullet in the back of the headwhich almost certainly was what would happen to him if the militia found him in possession of those pamphlets and a pistol nobody deserved that kind of ignominious fate not even the nkvd the café owner was bald and cleanshaven with thick lips and a broken nose the man told me the phone had been out of order for days and blamed it on pequeños rebeldes who liked to demonstrate their devotion to the revolution by shooting their catapultas at the ceramic conductors on the telephone poles if i wanted to warn lópez it wasnt going to be by telephone experience told me that the militia seldom allowed anyone to drive back through a roadblock they would assume rightly that i intended to warn someone i would have to find another route back to finca vigíaone that took me through the little side streets and avenues of san francisco de paula but it was not an area i knew well especially in the dark do you know finca vigíathe american writers house i asked the café owner of course everyone knows the house of ernesto hemingway how would a man get there who didnt want to drive down the main road south to cotorro i held up a fivepeso note to help him think the café owner grinned do you perhaps mean a man who didnt want to drive through the roadblock near the gas station i nodded keep your money señor i would not take money from a man who merely wished to avoid our beloved militia he led me out of the café such a man as yourself would drive north past the gas station in diezmero and turn left onto varona then go across the river in mantilla at the junction he would go south on managua and follow the road until he came upon the main highway going west toward santa maría del rosario at which point you would cross the main road north again and find finca vigía from there this series of directions was accompanied by much pointing and like almost everything in cuba we had soon attracted a small crowd of café patrons small boys and stray dogs it will take you fifteen minutes perhaps said the man assuming you dont end up in the río hondo or shot by the militia a couple of minutes later i was bouncing through the poorly lit leafy backstreets of mantilla and el calvario like the crew of a stricken dornier and wearily regretting the consumption of too much bourbon and red wine and probably a brandy or two i steered the chevrolet west south and then east again off the twolane blacktop the roads werent much more than dirt tracks and the chevys rear end held its line with less grip than a recently sharpened ice skate unnerved by the sight of the two bodies i was probably driving too fast suddenly there was a flock of goats in the road and i twisted the wheel hard to the left so that the car spun around in a cloud of dust narrowly missing a tree and then the fence around a tennis court something gave way under the car as i braked and brought the car to a halt and thinking i might have a flat or worse a broken axle i flung the door open and leaned out of the car to inspect the damage this is what you get for trying to do someone a favor i told myself irritably i saw that the car was undamaged and that the front left tire seemed to have broken through several planks of wood that were buried in the ground i sat up straight and carefully reversed back onto the road then i got out to take another closer look at what was buried but because it was dark i couldnt see very clearly even in the car headlights and i had to fetch a flashlight from the trunk to shine through the broken planks lifting one of the boards i shone the flashlight through the hole and peered inside what appeared to be a buried crate the size was difficult to determine but inside the crate were several smaller wooden boxes stenciled on the lid of one of these boxes was mark fhgs and on another was browning m i had stumbled onto a hidden weapons cache immediately i switched off the flashlight and then the headlights of the car and looked around in case anyone had seen me the tennis court was clay and in a poor state of repair with some of the white plastic rails missing or broken and the net hanging slackly like an old womans nylon stocking beyond the court was a dilapidated villa with a veranda and a big heavy gate that was badly rusted stucco was peeling off the villas façade and there were no lights visible anywhere no one had lived there for some time after a while i lifted one of the broken planks and used it like a snowplow to move some dirt back on top of the weapons cache enough to conceal it then i quickly marked the site with three stones i took from the other side of the road all this took less than five minutes it wasnt a place i wanted to linger not with militia in the area they were hardly likely to accept my explanation for how it was i came to be burying a weapons cache at midnight on a lonely road in el calvario no more than the people who had buried it there would have believed that i wasnt going to inform the police i had to get away from there as quickly as possible so i jumped back in my car and drove off i arrived back at finca vigía just as alfredo lópez was getting back into the white oldsmobile to drive himself home i reversed up next to him then i wound down my window lópez did the same something wrong he asked it could be if you were a man with a thirtyeight and a briefcase full of rebel pamphlets you know i am lópez my friend you might care to think about getting out of the pamphleteering business for a while theres a militia roadblock on the main road north just next to the gas station in diezmero thanks for the warning i guess ill have to find another route home i shook my head i drove back here through mantilla and el calvario there was another truckload of them getting ready to deploy down there as well i said nothing about the weapons cache id found i thought it was best that i forget all about that for now it would seem that theyre looking to catch some fish tonight he observed the keep net was full its true i said but it looked to me as if they were planning to do a little more than just catch fish shoot them in a barrel perhaps i saw two on the side of the road and they looked as dead as a couple of smoked mackerel these were individual tragedies i suppose he said of course a couple of deaths are hardly comparable with the rule of genuine tyrants like stalin and mao tsetung think what you like i didnt come here to make a convert just to save your stupid neck yes of course im sorry lópez pursed his lips for a moment and then bit one of them hard enough to hurt they dont usually bother coming as far south of havana as this noreen came out of the house and down the front steps a glass was in her hand and it wasnt empty she didnt look drunk she didnt even sound drunk but since i was probably drunk myself none of that counted for anything whats the matter she asked me change your mind about leaving did you there was a note of sarcasm in her voice thats right i said i came back to see if anyone had an unwanted copy of the communist manifesto you could have said something when you left she said stiffly its a funny thing but i didnt think anyone would mind so why did you come back the militia are setting up roadblocks in the area lópez explained your friend was kind enough to come back here to warn me of the danger why would they do that she asked him there arent any targets the rebels would want to attack around here are there lópez said nothing what hes trying to say i said is that it depends on what you mean by a target on the way back here i saw a sign for an electricitygenerating station thats just the kind of target the rebels might pick after all theres a lot more to fighting a revolution than assassinating government officials and hiding weapons cutting the electricity supply helps to demoralize the population at large makes them believe the government is losing control its also a lot safer than an attack on an army garrison isnt that right lópez lópez was looking bemused i dont get it youre not at all sympathetic to our cause and yet you took a risk coming back here to warn me why the phone lines are down i said otherwise id have called lópez grinned and shook his head no i still dont get it i shrugged its true i dont like communism but sometimes it pays to back the underdog like braddock versus baer in besides i thought it would embarrass you allme a bourgeois reactionary and an apologist for fascism coming back here to pull your bolshevik nuts out of the fire noreen shook her head and smiled with you thats just bloodyminded enough to be true i grinned and bowed slightly in her direction i knew youd see the funny side bastard you know it might not be safe for you to go back through the roadblock said lópez they might remember you and put two and two together even the militia arent so stupid that they cant make four fredos right said noreen its not safe for you to go back into havana tonight gunther it might be better if you stayed here tonight i wouldnt want to put you to any trouble i said its no trouble she said ill go and tell ramón to fix you up a bed she turned and walked away humming quietly to herself scooping up a cat and placing her empty glass on the terrace as she went lópez watched her behind in retreat for longer than i did i had time to observe him doing it he watched her with the eyes of an admirer and possibly the mouth as well he licked his lips while he was doing it which made me wonder if their common ground wasnt just political but sexual too and thinking i might prompt him to reveal something of his feelings for her i said quite a woman isnt she yes he said absently she is smiling he added quickly a wonderful writer i wasnt looking at her backlist lópez chuckled im not quite so ready to believe the worst of you despite what noreen said back there did she say something i shrugged i wasnt listening when she insulted me what i mean to say is thank you my friend thank you indeed tonight you have undoubtedly saved my life he fetched the briefcase off the seat of the oldsmobile if i had been caught with this they would certainly have murdered me will you be safe driving home without this yes im a lawyer after all a respectable lawyer too in spite of what you might think of me no really i have lots of famous and wealthy clients here in havana including noreen i drew up her will and ernest hemingways it was he who introduced the two of us if you ever have need of a good lawyer i would be happy to act for you señor thanks ill bear that in mind tell me im curious in cuba that might not be healthy the pamphlet i gave you the militia didnt find it i threw it away in the bushes at the bottom of the drive i said like i told you before im not interested in local politics i can see noreen was correct about you señor hausner you have a great instinct for survival has she been talking about me again only a little despite any earlier evidence to the contrary she has a high opinion of you i laughed that was maybe true twenty years ago she wanted something then you underestimate yourself he said quite considerably its been a while since anyone said that to me he glanced down at the briefcase in his arms perhaps perhaps i could prevail on your kindness and courage one more time you can give it a try perhaps you would be good enough to bring this briefcase to my office its in the bacardi building i know it theres a café there i go to sometimes you like it too coffees the best in havana i dont think theres any great risk in your doing this being a foreigner but there might be some thats honest at any rate all right ill do that for you señor lópez please call me fredo okay fredo shall we say eleven oclock tomorrow morning if you like you know it may be that theres something i can do for you you can buy me a cup of coffee i dont want a will any more than i want a pamphlet but you will come i said ill be there and ill be there good lópez nodded patiently tell me have you met noreens daughter dinah i nodded what did you think of her im still thinking quite a girl isnt she he raised his eyebrows suggestively if you say so the only thing i know about young women in havana is that most of them are more efficient marxists than you and your friends they know more about the redistribution of wealth than anyone ive ever met dinah strikes me as the type of girl who knows just what she wants dinah wants to be an actress in hollywood in spite of everything thats happened to noreen with the house committee on unamerican activities the blacklist the hate mail i mean you can see how all that might upset dinah i got the impression that wasnt whats worrying her theres any number of things to worry about when you have a daughter as headstrong as dinah believe me it sounded like just the one thing to me she mentioned something about dinahs being in with the wrong crowd anything in that friend this is cuba lópez grinned weve got wrong crowds like some countries have different religions he shook his head tomorrow well talk some more in private come on give i just saved you from a late night out with the militia the militias not the only dangerous dog in town meaning there was a squeal of tires at the bottom of the drive i looked around as yet another car purred up to the house i say a car but the cadillac with its wraparound windshield was more like something from marsa red convertible from the red planet the sort of car on which the builtin fog lamps might easily have been heat rays for the methodical extermination of earthlings it was as long as a fire truck and probably as well equipped meaning i think youre about to find out said lópez the cadillacs big fiveliter engine took a last breath from the fourbarrel carburetor and then exhaled loudly through dual exhausts that were built into the bumpers one of the rakish cutdown doors opened and out stepped dinah she looked great the drive had stirred her hair a little and made her look more natural than before sexier too if such a thing was possible there was a stole over her shoulders that could have been honeyranch mink but i wasnt looking anymore i was too busy noticing the driver stepping out on the other side of the red eldorado he was wearing a wellcut lightweight gray suit with a white shirt and a pair of flashing gem cuff links that matched the car he stared straight at me with a mixture of amusement and deliberation as if noting the changes in my face and wondering how i might have come by them dinah reached his side after a long pilgrimage around the farthest point of the car and eloquently threaded one arm through his hello gunther said the man speaking german he had a mustache now but he still looked like a pit bull in a bucket it was max reles surprised to see me he chuckled his familiar chuckle i guess were both surprised max as soon as dinah told me about you i started thinking it couldnt be him and then she described you and well christ almighty noreen wont like my being here but i just had to come down to take a look for myself and see if it really was the same fucking painintheass guy i shrugged who believes in miracles anymore jesus gunther i thought you must be dead for sure what with the nazis and the russians and that smart fucking mouth of yours these days im a little more closelipped only bullshit shoots its mouth off said reles whats genuine in a man stays silent jesus how long has it been must be a thousand years thats how long hitler said his reich would last that long huh reles shook his head what the hell brings you to cuba oh you know getting away from it all i shrugged and by the way my name is hausner carlos hausner at least thats what it says on my argentine passport like that huh i like the car i guess you must be doing all right whats the ransom for a oneman motorcade like that oh about seven thousand dollars the labor rackets must be good in cuba im out of that shit now these days im in the hotel and entertainment business seven thousand dollars is a lot of bed and breakfast thats just your coppers nose twitching it does that sometimes but i dont pay it any mind these days im just a citizen reles grinned that covers a lot in cuba especially at this house there are citizens here who make joseph stalin look like theodore roosevelt while he spoke reles was looking coldly at alfredo lópez who nodded a farewell at me and then slowly drove away you two know each other i asked you could say that dinah interrupted us speaking in english i didnt know you spoke german max theres a lot you dont know about me honey i sure as hell wont tell her anything i told him in german not that ill have to i expect noreen has done that already you must be the bad crowd of people in havana that she was telling me about the one dinahs got herself involved with i cant say i blame her max if she was my daughter id be worried myself reles smiled wryly im not like that anymore he said ive changed small world another car came up the drive it was getting to be like the front door at the national hotel someone was driving noreens pontiac no really insisted reles these days im a respectable businessman the man driving the pontiac stepped out of the car and silently got into the passenger seat of the car reles had been driving suddenly the cadillac looked very small the mans eyes were dark and his face pale and puffy he was wearing a loose white suit with big black buttons his hair was curly and black and gray and plentiful as if there had been a sale of wire wool at the dollar store on obispo he looked sad perhaps because it was probably several minutes since hed eaten anything he looked like he ate a lot roadkill probably he was smoking a cigar the size and shape of an armorpiercing shell but in his mouth it was like a sty on an eyelid you looked at him and thought of pagliacci with two tenors in the part of canio instead of one a tenor down each trouser leg he looked about as respectable as a roll of quarters in a boxing glove respectable yeah i eyeballed the big man in the cadillac i let reles see me doing it and said i suppose that ogre is really your bookkeeper waxey hes a babke a real sweet cake besides i have some very big books dinah sighed and rolled her eyes like a petulant schoolgirl max she complained its rude to carry on a conversation in german when you know i dont speak the language i cant understand that reles spoke in english really i cant when your mother speaks such excellent german dinah pulled a face who wants to learn german the germans murdered ninety percent of the jews in europe nobody wants to learn german these days she looked at me and shrugged ruefully sorry but thats how it is i guess thats okay im sorry too it was my fault for speaking german to max i mean not for the other thing although obviously im sorry for that as well you krauts are going to be sorry for a long time max laughed we jews are going to make sure of that very sorry believe me i was only obeying orders dinah wasnt listening she wasnt listening because it wasnt something she was good at although to be fair max had his nose in her ear and then his lips on her cheek which could have distracted anyone who hadnt had all their shots forgive me honik he murmured to her but you know its been twenty years since i saw this fershtinkiner he left off tasting her face for a moment and looked at me again isnt she beautiful that she is max that she is whats more she has her whole life ahead of her too unlike you and me reles bit his lip i sort of fancied hed preferred it to have been my neck then he smiled and wagged his finger at me i smiled back like it was a game of tennis we were playing i was hitting the ball at him hard harder than he was used to i imagined still the same awkward bastard he said shaking his head the big face on the front of it had always been square and pugnacious but now it was tanned and leathery and there was a scar on his cheek as big as a luggage label i wondered what dinah could see in a man like him still the same old gunther now there you and noreen seem to be in agreement i said youre right of course i am an awkward old bastard and getting worse all the time mind you its the old part that really pisses down my trouser leg the fascination i once felt at the contemplation of my own physical excellence is now matched by the horror i find in the evidence of my own advancing middle age my belly bowlegs thinning hair shortsightedness and receding gums by anyones reckoning im past it still there is one consolation i suppose im not as old as you max reles kept on grinning only this time he had to take a breath to keep on doing it then he shook his head and looked at dinah and said jesus christ will you listen to this guy in front of you he insults me to my face he let out a laugh of amazement isnt he beautiful thats what i like about this bum nobody has ever talked to me the way this guy talks to me i love that about him i dont know max she said sometimes youre a very weird kind of guy you should listen to her max i said shes not just beautiful shes very smart too enough already said reles you know lets you and me talk again come and see me tomorrow i stared at him politely come and see me at my hotel he put his hands together like he was praying please where are you staying the saratoga in old havana opposite the capitolio i own it right i get it the hotel and entertainment business the saratoga sure i know it will you come for old times sake you mean our old times max sure why not all that stuff was over and done with twenty years ago twenty years but it feels like a thousand just like you said come for lunch i thought for a moment i was going to the offices of alfredo lópez in the bacardi building at eleven and the bacardi was just a few blocks from the saratoga hotel suddenly i was a man with two appointments in one day maybe id have to buy a diary soon maybe id have to get my hair and nails done i was almost feeling relevant again although in what sense i could ever be relevant i wasnt quite sure not yet anyway i guessed it would take no time at all to return the briefcase with the gun and the pamphlets to alfredo lópez lunch at the saratoga sounded all right even if it was with max reles the saratoga was a good hotel with an excellent restaurant and lepers cant be choosers in havana especially lepers like me all right i said ill come around twelve the saratoga was at the south end of the prado and just across the street from the capitolio it was a finelooking eightstory white colonial that reminded me of a hotel id once seen in genoa i went inside it was just after one oclock the girl at the desk in the lobby directed me to the elevators and told me to go up to the eighth floor i walked into a colonnaded courtyard which brought to mind a monastery and waited for the car in the center of the courtyard was a fountain and the marble figure of a horse by the cuban sculptress rita longa i knew it was by her because the car took a while and because there was an easel next to the horse with some useful information about the artist the information wasnt particularly useful beyond what i had already worked out for myself which was that rita knew nothing about horses and very little about sculpture and i was more interested in peering through a set of smokedglass doors that led into the hotels gaming rooms with their magnificent chandeliers tall gilt mirrors and marble floors the gaming rooms evoked belle époque paris somewhere classier than havana anyway there were no slot machines only roulette tables blackjack craps poker baccarat and punto banco clearly no expense had been spared and perhaps with some justification the saratogas casino described itselfon another easel inside the glass doorsas the monte carlo of the americas since dollar controls had only just started to be lifted it seemed less than likely this claim would be put to the test anytime soon by any of the american salesmen and their wives who went gambling in havana myself i disliked nearly all forms of gambling ever since i had been obliged to drop a small fortune at a casino in vienna during the winter of luckily the small fortune did not belong to me but there was something about losing moneyeven other peoples moneythat i didnt like it was one of the reasons that when i gambled at all i preferred to play backgammon its a game that very few people play which means you can never lose very much and besides i was good at it i rode the car up to the eighth floor and the rooftop pool which was the only one in havana i say rooftop but there was another higher level set back from the pool terrace and according to my new friend alfredo lópez this was the exclusive penthouse where max reles lived in considerable luxury the only way up there was to have a special key to the elevatoragain according to lópez but glancing around the deserted pool terracethe weather was too blowy for anyone to be sunbathingi filled my idle mind with thoughts of how a man with a head for heights might climb up onto that penthouse terrace from the outside such a man would have had to clamber out onto the parapet encircling the pool walk precariously around the corner and then climb up on some scaffolding being used to repair the hotels neon sign that adorned the curved corner façade there were some people who went on a rooftop and enjoyed the view and there were others like me who remembered crime scenes and snipers and above all the war on the eastern front in minsk a red army marksman had sat on the roof of the citys only hotel for three whole days picking off german army officers before being nailed with an antitank gun such a man would have appreciated the rooftop terrace of the saratoga then again max reles probably had that possibility covered according to alfredo lópez reles wasnt the kind of man who took any chances with his personal security he had too many friends to do something like that havana friends that is the kind who make enthusiastic understudies of deadly enemies i thought maybe youd changed your mind max said emerging from a doorway that led along to the elevators that you werent going to show up his tone was reproachful and a little puzzled as if he were annoyed that he couldnt work out any good reason why i might have been late for our lunch im sorry i got a little held up you see last night i told lópez about that roadblock on the road north out of san francisco de paula what the hell did you do that for he had a briefcase full of rebel pamphlets and i dont know why but i agreed to take them for him and then deliver them back to him this morning there was a police truck outside the bacardi building when i arrived and i had to wait until it was gone you shouldnt get involved with a man like that said reles really you shouldnt that shits dangerous you want to keep away from the politics on this island youre right of course i shouldnt and i dont know why i said id do it probably id drunk too much i do a lot of that theres nothing much else to do in cuba except drink too much that figures everyone at that damn house drinks too much but i said id do it and when i say ill do something i generally see it through i was always kind of stupid like that true max reles grinned very true did he say anything about me lópez only that you and he used to be business associates thats almost true let me tell you about our pal fredo fbs brotherinlaw is a man named roberto miranda miranda owns every one of the traganiqueles in havana you know the slot machines you want some in your place then you rent them from him plus he gets fifty percent of the take which let me tell you can be a lot in a havana casino anyway fredo lópez used to come and empty the slots for me at the saratoga i thought that having a lawyer do it was the best way of preventing any dishonesty but very early on i discovered that only a quarter of the money was going to miranda the rest lópez was skimming to help feed the families of those men who attacked the moncada barracks last year for a while i turned a blind eye to it he knew that i was turning a blind eye to it too i figured to hedge my bets with the rebels but then miranda figured out that he was being cheated and wouldnt you know it he blamed yours truly which left me with a choice keep the slots but get rid of lópez and risk being made a target by the rebels or get rid of the slots and put up with mirandas displeasure i chose to get rid of the slots and as a result of that once a week i now have to go through my books with fb himself on account of the fact that he owns a substantial stake in this place the whole thing cost me a lot of fucking money and inconvenience and the way i see it that bastard fredo lópez is a very lucky fuck lucky to be alive that is youre right max you have changed the old max reles would have stuck an ice pick in his ear he grinned at the memory of his former self wouldnt i just wouldnt i things were more straightforward then id have killed him without a second thought he shrugged but this is cuba and we try to do things a little differently here i figured that maybe when he thought about it the little prick would realize it and act like hes just a little grateful but not a bit of it he goes behind my back and pours poison in noreens ear about me when im trying to build some bridges with her because of my relationship with dinah so you were giving money to batista and the rebels i said indirectly he said frankly i give them a snowballs chance in hell but you never know with these bastards but you do give them a chance before the incident with the slots i saw something interesting one day i was looking out of a downstairs window of the hotel not thinking anything in particular like you do sometimes and i saw this young habañero who was walking along the street outsidejust a kid you know and as i watched him pass by my cadillac i saw him kick the fender that cute little ragtop where was the ogre waxey hes not nearly quick enough on his toes to have stood half a chance of catching this fucking kid anyway it bothered me not the mark on the car that was nothing really no it was something else i thought about it a lot see at first i thought the kid did it to amuse his girlfriend then i thought maybe he had something against cadillacs finally it hit me bernie i realized it wasnt fucking cadillacs he didnt like it was americans which made me think about this revolution i mean like most people i thought it was all over after last july after moncada barracks you know but seeing that fucking kid kick my car i thought that maybe it isnt over at all and maybe they hate americans as much as they hate batista in which case if they ever get rid of him they might get rid of us too i was fresh out of insightful incidents of my own so i stayed silent besides i didnt have a particularly warm opinion of americans myself they werent as bad as the russians or the french but then they didnt expect to be liked and they didnt much care when they werent americans were different even after theyd dropped a couple of atom bombs on the japs they still wanted to be liked which struck me as just a little naive so i stayed silent and almost like two old friends together we enjoyed the view from the rooftop for a while it was a great view beneath us were the treetops of campo de marte and to the right like an enormous wedding cake was the capitol building behind that you could see the partagas cigar factory and the barrio chino i could see as far south as the american warship in the harbor and west as far as the rooftops of miramar but only with my glasses on the glasses made me look older of course older than max reles then again he probably had some glasses of his own somewhere and just didnt want to let me see him wearing them he was trying without success to light a large cigar in the stiffening rooftop breeze one of the parasols which were all closed blew over which seemed to irritate him i always say he said that the best way to see havana is from the rooftop of a good hotel he gave up with the cigar the national has a view but its just the fucking sea or the rooftops of vedado and in my humble opinion that view doesnt begin to compare with this one i agree for the moment i was through needling him i was just beginning to have my reasons for that of course it does get a bit windy up here sometimes and when i catch up with the sonofabitch who persuaded me to buy all these fucking parasols im going to give him a lesson in what its like when the wind catches one of these things and carries it over the side he grinned in a way that made me think he meant every word of it its a great view i said isnt it you know ill bet hedda adlon would have given her eyeteeth for a view like this one i nodded hardly wanting to tell him that the adlons rooftop had afforded the hotel patrons with one of the best views in berlin id watched the reichstag burning from that particular hotel rooftop and you dont get much better views than that what ever happened to her anyway hedda used to say that a good hotelier always hopes for the best but expects the worst the worst is what happened she and louis kept the hotel going all through the war somehow it always escaped the bombing maybe someone in the raf had stayed there once but then during the battle for berlin the ivans subjected the city to a barrage that destroyed almost everything that hadnt been destroyed by the raf the hotel caught fire and was all but destroyed hedda and louis retreated to their country estate near potsdam and waited when the ivans turned up they looted the house and mistaking louis for an escaping german general they put him in front of a firing squad and shot him hedda was raped many times like most of the women in berlin i dont know what happened to her after that jesus christ said reles what a story pity i liked them both a lot jesus i didnt know he sighed and made another attempt to light his cigar and this time he succeeded you know its funny you turning up like this gunther i told you before max its hausner now carlos hausner hey dont worry about it you and me we dont have to worry about that shit this islands got more aliases than a filing cabinet in the fbi if you ever get any problems with the militia about your passport your visa anything like that you come to me i can fix it all right thanks like i was saying its funny you turning up like this you see the adlons one of the reasons i got into the hotel business here in havana i loved that hotel i wanted to own a classy place like the adlon here in old havana instead of in vedado like lansky and all those other connected guys i always had the idea that this is the kind of place hedda would have picked herself dont you agree maybe why not i was just the house peeper so what do i know but she used to say that a good hotel is like a car what it looks like is only half as important as how it drives how fast it can go and if the brakes work all right and if its comfortable are what really matters everything else is just bullshit she was right of course said reles god i could use some of her old european experience right now im after the same highend crowd here you see the senators and the diplomats im trying to run a quality hotel and an honest casino the truth is you hardly need to run a crooked one the odds always favor the house and the money floods in its as simple as that almost true in a city like havana you gotta watch out for the sharks and the grifters not to mention the faggots and the female impersonators hell i dont even allow hookers to operate in this place not unless theyre on the arm of someone important i leave that kind of vice to the cubans theyre a degenerate lot those guys would pimp their own grandmothers for five bucks and believe me i should know ive had more than my fair share of mochaflavored flesh in this city at the same time he continued you shouldnt ever underestimate these people they think nothing of putting a bullet in your head if theyre connected or tossing a grenade in your john if theyre into politics a man in my position needs to get eyes in the back of his head or pretty soon the back of his head will be lying on a floor which is where you come in gunther me i dont see how i can help you max lets have some lunch and ill tell you how we rode the elevator up to the penthouse where we were met by waxey seen from up close his face was like that of a mexican wrestlerthe kind that usually wears a mask come to think of it the rest of him looked like a mexican wrestler too each of his shoulders resembled the yucatán peninsula he didnt say anything he just frisked me with hands like esaus blacksheep uncle the penthouse was modern and about as comfortable as a spaceship we sat at a glass table and watched each others shoes while we ate mine were locally sourced and none too clean my hosts shoes were shinier than a brass bell and every bit as loud to my surprise the food was kosher or at least jewish since the tall goodlooking woman who served it was also black then again maybe she was a convert to judaism she was a good cook the older i get the more i like jewish cooking max explained i guess it reminds me of when i was a kid all the food the other kids had but never me because my bitch of a mother ran off with a tailor and abe and i never saw her again when we got to the coffee he relit his halfsmoked cigar while i fetched one from his cemeterysized humidor so let me tell you how you can help me gunther for one thing youre not jewish i let that one go a quarterjew seemed hardly worth mentioning these days youre not italian youre not cuban youre not even american and you dont owe me a damn thing hell gunther you dont even like me that much i didnt contradict him we were big boys now but i didnt underline it either twenty years was a long time to forget a lot but i had more reason to dislike him than he would ever know or remember all of this makes you independent which is a very valuable quality to possess in havana because it means you owe no one allegiance none of that would matter if you were a potchka but youre not a potchka youre a mensch and the plain fact of the matter is that i could use a mensch who has grand hotel experienceto say nothing of your years with the berlin police why to help me keep things straight here thats why i want you to take on the role of general manager in the hotel and in the casino someone i can trust someone who doesnt give me any shit someone who shoots straight from the hip who better than you look max im flattered dont think im not but i dont need a job right now dont think of it as a job this is not a job theres no ninetofive with this business its an occupation every man needs an occupation right a place to go every day some days youre around more than others which is good because thatll keep the bastards who work for me guessing look i hate to sound like a noodge but youd be doing me a favor here a big favor which is why im prepared to pay you top dollar how does twenty thousand dollars a year sound i bet you never made that kind of money at the adlon a car an office a secretary who crosses her legs a lot and doesnt wear any panties you name it i dont know max if i did it id have to do it my way straight or not at all didnt you hear me saying thats what i want theres no other way but straight for a business like this im serious no interference i report to you and no one else you got it what would i do give me an example one of the things i want you to do right away is take charge of the hirings and the firings theres a pit boss i want you to fire hes a faggot and i dont like faggots working in my hotel also i want you to handle all the interviews for any positions in the hotel and casino that come up you got a nose for these things gunther a cynical bastard like you will want to make certain that were hiring honest straight people thats not always so easy you can get a lot of smoke blown in your eyes for instance i pay top money here better than any other hotel in havana which means that most of the girls who want to work hereand its mainly girls i hire because thats what the customers want to seewell they will do anything for a job and i mean anything only thats not always so good for business see and its not always so good for me im only human and that amount of major fucking temptation is not what i want in my life right now im through with all of that fucking around you know why because im going to marry dinah thats why congratulations thanks does she know of course she knows you nudnik the girls meshugge about me and i feel the same way about her yeah yeah i know what youre going to sayim old enough to be her father dont start with the gray hair and false teeth again like last night because this is the real thing im going to marry her and then im going to use all my showbusiness connections to help make that girl a movie star what about brown brown whats brown thats the university noreen wants her to go to reles grimaced thats what noreen wants for noreen not for dinah dinah wants to be in motion pictures i already introduced her to sinatra george raft nat king cole did noreen tell you the girl can sing no with her talent and my connections dinah can be pretty much anything she wants does that include being happy reles winced including being happy yeah god damn it gunther youre a hard fucking bastard why is that ive had a lot of practice more than you perhaps and i guess thats saying something im not going to give you the whole lousy résumé max but by the time the war ended id already seen and done a few things that would have given jiminy cricket a heart attack the conscience id started out in with life grew a couple of extra layers like the skin on my feet then i was a houseguest of the soviets for two years in one of their rest homes for exhausted german pows i learned a lot from the ivans about good hospitality but only what it isnt when i escaped i killed two people that was a pleasure like it never was before and you can take that to mean whatever you want after that i ran a hotel of my own until my second wife died in a lunatic asylum i wasnt cut out for that i might as well have tried running a finishing school in switzerland for young english ladies come to think of it i wish i had i could have finished quite a few forever good manners german courtesy charm hospitalityi come up short on all of those max i make hard bastards feel good about themselves they meet me and then go home and read their bibles and thank god theyre not me so what makes you think im up to this you really want to know he shrugged all those years ago the boat on lake tegel you remember that how could i forget i told you then i liked you gunther i told you then that id thought of offering you a job only i had no use for an honest man i remember the whole evening is still etched on my eyeballs well now i have a use for one its as simple as that pal i need a man of character pure and simple a person of character he said a mensch he said i had my doubts would a mensch have helped max reles to silence othman weinberger by handing the american the means to destroy weinbergers career and possibly his life too after all it was i who had told reles about weinbergers achilles heel that the little gestapo man from würzburg was suspected wrongly of being a jew and it was i who had told max reles about emil linthe the forger and how a man like linthe might bribe his way in the public records office and give another man like weinberger a jewish transfusion just as easily as hed given me an aryan one in my own defense i could argue that id done all of that to protect noreen charalambides from being murdered by maxs brother but what character was left to a man whod done something like that a mensch no i was anything but that all right i said ill take the job you will max reles sounded surprised he stared at me for a while with narrowing eyes so now im curious what was it persuaded you maybe were more alike than i care to admit maybe it was the thought of that brother of yours and what he might do to me with an ice pick if i said no how is the kid dead sorry dont be the kid turned rat on some friends of mine to save his own skin he sent six guys to the electric chair including someone i went to school with but he was a canary who couldnt fly abe was about to finger a boss when he got himself thrown out of a high window of the half moon hotel on coney island in november you know who did it he was in protective custody at the time so sure i know and one day ill take my revenge on these guys blood is blood after all and there never was any permission asked or given but right now it wouldnt be good for business sorry i asked reles nodded grimly and id appreciate it if you never asked me about it again i already forgot the question listen we germans are good at forgetting all kinds of things weve spent the last nine years trying to forget there ever was a man called adolf hitler believe me if you can forget him you can forget anything reles grunted one name i do remember i said avery brundage what ever happened to him avery we kind of fell out after he got himself on the america first committee to keep the us out of the war it made a change from trying to keep jews out of chicago country clubs but that slippery bastards done all right for himself hes made millions of dollars his construction company built a large chunk of chicagos gold coast lake shore drive at one stage he was going to run as a candidate for governor of illinois until certain people in chicago told him to stick to sports administration you might say were competitors these days he owns the la salle hotel in chicago the cosmopolitan in denver the hollywood plaza in california and a large chunk of nevada reles nodded lifes been kind to avery recently he got himself elected as president of the international olympic committee i suppose you made a fortune in sure but so did avery after the olympics were over he got himself a contract from the nazis to build the new german embassy in washington that was payback from a grateful führer for heading off an american boycott he must have made millions and i didnt see a cent of it reles grinned but it was all a long time ago dinahs the best thing thats happened to me since then shes a hell of a girl just like her mother wants to try everything i guess you must be the one who took her to the shanghai theater i wouldnt have done it said reles taken her there but she insisted and the girl gets what she wants dinahs got a hell of a temper and how was the show how do you think he shrugged to tell the truth i dont think it bothered her much that little girl is game for anything right now she wants me to take her to an opium den opium you should try it yourself sometime opiums great for keeping down the weight he slapped his belly with the flat of his hand and in truth he did look slimmer than i remembered him in berlin theres a little joint on cuchillo where you can smoke a few pipes and forget everything even hitler then perhaps ill have to try it after all im glad youre on board gunther tell you what come back tomorrow night and ill introduce you to some of the boys theyll all be here wednesday nights my cards night you play cards no just backgammon backgammon thats dice for queers isnt it not really im just kidding you i had a friend who used to play you any good depends on the dice come to think of it garcía plays backgammon josé orozco garcía the sleazeball who owns the shanghai hes always looking for a game reles grinned jesus id love it if you could beat that fat bastard want me to fix you up to play him tomorrow night maybe itll have to be early because he likes to keep an eye on the theater after eleven you know that could work out well play him at eight come up here around ten fortyfive meet the boys maybe with some extra money in your pocket sounds good i can always use a little extra money speaking of which he took me into his office there was a modern teakwood writing desk with an offwhite veneered top and some leather chairs that looked as if theyd come off a sportfishing boat he opened a drawer and took out an envelope which he handed to me theres a thousand pesos he said just to show you my offer is a serious one i always take you seriously max i told him ever since that night on the lake on the walls were several big frameless paintings that were either extremely good representations of vomit or modern abstracts i couldnt decide one wall was given over entirely to some dark wood bookshelves that were filled with records and magazines art objects and even some books on the far wall was a big sliding glass door and through it i could see a smaller private version of the pool that existed on the floor below there was a buttonbacked leather daybed and beside it a tulip table on which stood a bright red telephone reles pointed at the phone see that phone its a special line to the presidential palace and it makes just the one call a week the one i told you about every wednesday at a quarter to midnight without fail i use that phone to call fb and take him through the figures i never knew a guy who was so interested in money as fb sometimes we speak for as long as half an hour which is one reason wednesday night is my card night i play a few hands with the boys and then throw them out at exactly eleventhirty no broads i make my phone call and go straight to bed you work for me you might as well know you also work for fb he owns thirty percent of this hotel but you can leave that spic to me for now reles went over to the bookcase tugged open a drawer and took out an expensivelooking leather attaché case which he handed to me i want you to have this gunther to celebrate our new business association i brandished the envelope of pesos i thought you already gave me something for that something extra i glanced at the combination locks go ahead he said its not locked incidentally the combinations are sixsixsix on each side but if you like you can change it with a little key thats hidden in the carrying handle i snapped open the case and saw that it was a handsome backgammon set custommade the checkers were made of ivory and ebony and the dice and doubling cube had pips made of diamonds i cant take this i said sure you can that set used to belong to a friend of mine called ben siegel ben siegel the gangster naw ben was a gambler and a businessman same as me his girlfriend virginia had that backgammon set especially made for his fo rtyfirst birthday by asprey of london three months later he was dead he was shot wasnt he mmmhmm didnt she want it she gave it to me as a keepsake and now id like you to have it lets hope its luckier for you than it was for him lets hope from the saratoga i drove down to finca vigía the chieftain was exactly where waxey had parked it except there was now a cat on the roof i got out of my car and walked up to the front door and rang the ships bell hanging on the porch another cat was watching me from the bough of a giant ceiba tree a third on the terrace poked its head through the white railings as if waiting for the firemen to come and get it out i stroked the cats head as footsteps came slowly to the door the door opened and the slight figure of hemingways negro servant rené was standing there he was wearing a white cotton waiters jacket sunlight shining through the house behind him gave him the air of a santería priest he said good afternoon señor is señora eisner at home yes but she is sleeping how about the señorita miss dinah i believe shes in the swimming pool señor do you think shell mind me seeing her i dont think she minds anyone seeing her said rené i didnt pay much attention to that and made my way along the path to the pool which was surrounded with royal palms flamboyán trees and several almond trees as well as flower beds filled with ixoraa hardy red indian flower better known as jungle flame it was a nicelooking pool but even with all that water it was easy to see how any jungle might have caught fire my own eyeballs felt scorched just looking at it dinah was doing a graceful leisurely backstroke up and down the steaming water i supposed it was steaming for the same reason my eyeballs were scorched and the jungle was in flames her bathing suit was an appropriatelooking leopard print only at that particular moment it seemed slightly less appropriate given that she wasnt actually wearing it the suit lay on the path to the pool alongside my jaw she had a beautiful body long athletic shapely in the water her nude figure was the color of honey being german i wasnt exactly shocked by her nakedness naked culture societies had existed in berlin since before the great war and until the nazis it had been impossible to visit certain berlin parks and swimming pools without seeing lots of nudists besides dinah herself hardly seemed to mind she even managed to perform a couple of tumble turns that left little to my imagination come on in she said the waters lovely no thanks i said besides i hardly think your mother would approve maybe not but shes drunk or at least shes sleeping it off she was drinking all last night noreen always drinks too much after weve had an argument what was it about what do you think it was about max i suppose check so how did you and he get along we got along just fine he and i dinah executed another perfect tumble turn by now i was beginning to know her better than her doctor i might even have enjoyed the show but for the fact of who she was and why i was there turning my back on the pool i said perhaps id better wait in the house do i embarrass you señor gunther im sorry i mean señor hausner she stopped swimming and i heard her climb out of the pool behind me youre nice to look at but im your mothers friend remember and there are certain things that men dont do to the daughters of their friends i imagine she sort of trusts me not to press my nose up against your windowpane thats an interesting way of putting it i could hear the water dripping off her naked body if i had licked her from top to bottom she wouldnt have sounded any different why dont you be a good girl and put your bathing suit back on and then we can talk all right a few moments passed then she said you can relax now i turned around and nodded my thanks curtly she made me feel as awkward as hell even now that she was wearing her costume again avoiding the sight of beautiful young women when they were naked that was a new thing for me as a matter of fact im glad youre here she said this morning she was kind of suicidal kind of kind of yeah what i mean is that she threatened to shoot herself if i didnt promise her that i wouldnt see max anymore and did you did i what promise not to see him anymore no of course i didnt i mean thats just emotional blackmail mmmhmm does she have a gun silly question in this house theres a gun cupboard in the tower with enough weaponry to start another revolution but as it happens she has her own gun ernest gave it to her i guess he thought he could spare her one think shed ever do it i dont know thats why i mentioned it just now i suppose i really dont know she and ernest used to talk about suicide all the time and she wonders why i want to go out with max instead of hanging around here when exactly is hemingway coming back here july i think hed be back here now except for the fact that hes in a hospital in nairobi i guess one of those animals must have fought back no it was a plane crash or a bush fire maybe both i dont know but he was pretty bad for a while what happens when he does come back are he and your mother involved christ no ernest has a wife mary although i dont think something like that would stop them besides shes seeing someone i think noreen i mean anyway shes bought a house in marianao and were supposed to move into it sometime in the next month or two dinah found a pack of cigarettes lit one and blew smoke down at the ground and away from me im going to marry him and theres nothing she or anyone else can do about it except shoot herself people have shot themselves for less dinah made a face it matched the one i might have made when she told me that noreen was seeing someone and what do you think she asked about me and max would it make the slightest difference if i told you she shook her head so what did you and he talk about he offered me a job are you going to take it i dont know ive said i would but im kind of squeamish about working for a gangster is that what you think he is i told you it doesnt matter what i think and all he offered me was a job angel not a proposal of marriage if i dont like working for him i can quit and he wont lose any sleep over it but somehow i have the romantic idea that he feels differently about you any man would youre not making a pass at me are you if i was going to do that id be in the swimming pool max is going to help me become a movie actress so i heard is that why youre going to marry him as a matter of fact it isnt she colored a little and her voice became more petulant it just so happens that we love each other it was my turn to pull a face whats the matter gunther werent you ever in love with someone oh sure your mother for instance but that was twenty years ago in those days i could still tell someone i was in love with her and mean it with every fiber of my being these days theyre just words a man gets to my age and its not about love he can persuade himself its love but its not that at all its always about something else you think he just wants to marry me for sex is that it no its more complicated than that its about wanting to feel young again thats why a lot of older men marry younger women because they think youth is infectious and it isnt of course old age on the other hand now that is infectious i mean i can more or less guarantee that in time youll catch it too i shrugged but like i keep telling you angel it doesnt matter what i think im just some slob who used to be in love with your mother thats not such an exclusive club i dont doubt it your mothers a beautiful woman everything you got you got from her i guess i nodded what you were saying about her being suicidal ill look in on her before i go i quickly went away from her and back to the house before i said anything nasty which was what i felt like saying at the rear of the house the french doors were open and just an antelope was on guard so i went inside and took a squint in noreens bedroom she was sleeping naked on the top sheet and i stood there looking for all of a minute two naked women in one afternoon it was like going to the casa marina except for the fact that now i realized i was in love with noreen again or maybe they were the same feelings id always had and perhaps id just forgotten where id buried them i dont know but in spite of what id told dinah there were plenty of feelings i could have tossed noreens way if shed been awake and probably id have meant a few of them too her thighs yawned open and courtesy obliged me to look away which was when i noticed the gun on the bookshelves next to some photographs and a jar containing a frog preserved in formaldehyde it looked like any old frog but it wasnt just any old gun it might have been designed and produced by a belgian who had given the revolver his name but the nagant had been the standardissue sidearm for all russian officers in the red army and nkvd it was an odd heavy weapon to have found in that house i picked it up curious to find myself reacquainted with it this one had an embossed red star on the handle which seemed to put its origins beyond any doubt thats her gun said dinah i looked around as she came into the bedroom and drew the sheet across her mother not exactly a ladies gun i said youre telling me then she went into the bathroom ill leave my number on the desk by the telephone i called after her you can give me a ring if you really think shes serious about harming herself it doesnt matter what time i buttoned my jacket and walked out of the bedroom momentarily i caught sight of dinah sitting on the lavatory and hearing the sound of her peeing i hurried on through to the study i dont think she meant it said dinah she says a lot of things she doesnt mean we all do there was a threedrawer wooden desk covered with carved animals and differentsized shotgun cartridges and rifle bullets that someone had stood on their ends like so many lethal lipsticks i found a piece of paper and a pen and scribbled out my telephone number in large writing so that it wouldnt be missed unlike me and then i left i drove home and spent the rest of the day and half the night in my little workshop while i worked i thought about noreen and max reles and dinah nobody called me on the phone but there was nothing unusual about that havanas chinese quarterthe barrio chinowas the largest in latin america and since it was chinese new year the streets off zanja and cuchillo were decorated with paper lanterns and given over to openair markets and liondance troupes at the intersection of amistad and dragones was a gateway as big as the forbidden city later that evening it would be the center of a tremendous fireworks barrage which was the climax of the celebrations yara loved any kind of noisy parade and this was the reason why unusually i had chosen to take her out for the afternoon the streets of chinatown were full of laundries noodle houses driedgoods shops herbalists acupuncturists sex clubs opium dens and brothels but above all the streets were full of people chinese people mostly so many that you wondered where they had been hiding themselves i bought yara some small giftsfruit and candieswhich delighted her in return she insisted on buying me a cup of macerated medicinal liquor at a traditional medicine market which she assured me would make me very virile and it was only after drinking it that i found out that it contained wolfberry iguana and ginseng it was the iguana ingredient i objected to and for several minutes after drinking this horrible beverage i was convinced i had been poisoned so much so that i was firmly of the opinion that i must be hallucinating when right on the edge of chinatown on the corner of manrique and simón bolívar i came across a shop i had never seen before not even in buenos aires where the existence of such a business might perhaps more easily have been explained it was a shop selling nazi memorabilia after a moment or two i realized yara had seen the shop too and leaving her on the street i went inside as curious to know what kind of person might sell this kind of stuff as i was about who might buy it inside the shop were glass cases containing luger pistols walther ps iron crosses nazi party armbands gestapo identity tokens and ss daggers several copies of der stürmer newspapers were laid out in cellophane like freshly laundered shirts a mannequin was wearing the dress uniform of an ss captain which somehow seemed only appropriate behind a counter and between two nazi banners stood a youngish man with a black beard who couldnt have looked less german he was tall and thin and cadaverous like someone from a painting by el greco looking for something in particular he asked me an iron cross perhaps i told him i asked to see an iron cross not because i was interested in it but because i was interested in him he opened one the glass cases and laid the medal on the counter as if it had been a ladies diamond brooch or a handsome watch i looked at it for a while turning it over in my fingers what do you think of it he asked its a fake i said and not a very good fake and another thing the cross belt on the ss captains uniform is over the wrong shoulder a fake is one thing but an elementary mistake like that is something else you know about this stuff i thought it was illegal in cuba i answered hardly answering at all the law forbids only the promotion of nazi ideology he said selling historic mementos is permitted who buys this stuff americans mostly a lot of sailors then there are also tourists who saw military service in europe and want to obtain the souvenir they never managed to get when they were over there mostly its ss stuff they want i guess theres a certain gruesome fascination with the ss for obvious reasons i could sell any amount of ss stuff for example ss daggers are very popular as paper knives of course collecting this sort of memorabilia doesnt mean you sympathize with nazism or condone what happened it happened and its a part of history and i dont see anything wrong with being interested in that to the extent of owning something thats an almost living part of that history how could i see anything wrong with it i mean im polish my names szymon woytak he held out his hand and i took it limply and without much enthusiasm for him or his peculiar trade through the shop window i could see a troupe of chinese dancers theyd removed their lion heads and paused for a cigarette as if hardly aware of the evil spirits that dwelled within otherwise they might have come through the door woytak picked up the iron cross i had asked to see how can you tell its a fake he asked examining it closely simple the fakes are made from one piece of metal the originals were made of at least three pieces and soldered together another way to tell is to get a magnet and see if the cross really is made of iron fakes are made from a cheap alloy how do you know that how do i know i grinned at him i had one of these iron baubles myself once in the great war i said but you know all of its fake all of this everything in here i waved my hand at the shop and the creed that made all of these ridiculous objects that too was just a cheap alloy meant to fool people a stupid fake that shouldnt have tricked anyone except for the fact that people wanted to believe in it everyone knew it was a lie of course they did but they wanted desperately to believe that it wasnt and they forgot to remember that just because adolf hitler liked kissing little children it didnt mean he wasnt a big bad wolf he was that and much much worse thats history for you señor woytak real german history not thisthis ridiculous souvenir shop i took yara home and spent the rest of the day in my workshop feeling a little depressed but it wasnt because of anything i had seen in szymon woytaks shop that was just havana you could always buy anything in havana provided you had the money to pay for it anything and everything it was something else getting me down something closer to home or at least the home of ernest hemingway noreens daughter dinah i wanted to like her but found i couldnt not by a long way dinah struck me as willful and spoiled the willfulness was okay shed probably grow out of it most people did but she was going to need a pair of hard slaps to stop her from being such a spoiled brat it was too bad that nick and noreen charalambides had divorced when dinah was still a child probably her young life had lacked a fathers discipline maybe that was the real reason dinah was planning to marry a man more than twice her age lots of girls married father substitutes or maybe she was simply trying to get even with her mother for leaving her father lots of girls did that too maybe it was both of these things or maybe i didnt know what i was talking about never having raised a child myself it was fortunate that i was in the workshop maybe is not a word you use in there when youre operating a lathe to cut a length of metal exactly is a better word i had the patience for metalworking that was easy being a parent looked much more difficult later on i had a bath and put on a good suit before i went out i bowed my head for a few moments in front of the santería shrine yara had built in her room it was really just a dolls house covered with white lace and candles but on each floor of the dolls house were little animals crucifixes nuts shells and blackfaced figurines in white dresses there were also several pictures of the virgin mary and one picture of a woman with a knife through her tongue yara told me this was to stop gossip about her and me but i hadnt a clue about what any of the other stuff meant with the possible exception of the virgin mary i dont know why i bowed my head to her shrine i could say that i wanted to believe in something but in my heart of hearts i knew yaras souvenir shop was just another stupid lie just like nazism on my way to the door i picked up ben siegels backgammon set and then yara took me by the shoulders and looked into my eyes as if searching for some effect that her peculiar shrine had worked in my soul always supposing i had such a thing as that and finding something she took a step back and crossed herself several times you look like the lord eleggua she said he is the owner of the crossroads and who guards the home against all dangers he is always justified in all that he does and it is he who knows what nobody else knows and who always acts according to his perfect judgment she took off the necklace she was wearing and tucked this into the breast pocket of my jacket for good luck in your game she said thank you i said but it is only a game not this time she said not for you not for you master i parked my car on zulueta in sight of the local police station and walked back to the saratoga where there were already plenty of taxis and cars including a couple of the black cadillac seventyfives which were beloved to all senior government officials i walked through the hotel and into the monastery courtyard where a series of lights was turning the water in the fountain into several pastel shades of color and left the marble horse looking somewhat bemusedas if it hardly dared to take a drink of the exoticlooking water for fear that it might be poisoned it was i reflected a perfect metaphor for the experience of being in a havana casino a doorman dressed like a wealthy french impressionist opened the door for me and i entered the casino it was early but the place was busy like a bus station during rush hour only with chandeliers and noisy with the clack of chips and dice the taprunningintoasteelsink sound of metal balls rolling around wooden roulette wheels the squeals of winners the groans of losers the clink of glasses and always the clear unexcited declarative voices of the croupiers jostling the bets and calling the cards and the numbers i glanced around and noticed that some local celebrities were already in the place desi arnaz the musician celia cruz the singer george raft the movie actor and major esteban venturaone of the most feared police officials in havana gamblers in white tuxedoes drifted about shuffling plaques and prevaricating about where their luck might lie that night on the roulette wheel or at the craps table glamorous women with high hairdos and plunging necklines patrolled the edges of the room like cheetahs trying to identify the weakest men to hunt and bring down one stalked toward me but i flicked her off with a toss of my head i spotted what looked like the casino manager i figured he was the one with the folded arms and the tennis umpires eyes also he wasnt smoking or holding chips like most habañeros he wore a schoolboys doodle of a mustache and more grease on his head than a cuban hamburger he caught my eye and then my nod unfolded his arms and walked my way can i help you señor my name is carlos hausner i said i have a meeting upstairs with señor reles just before eleven tonight but before then im supposed to meet señor garcía to play backgammon some of the grease off the managers hair must have been on his fingertips because he started to wring his hands like pontius pilate señor garcía is already here he said leading the way señor reles asked me to find you both a quiet corner in our lounge between the salon privé and the main gaming room i shall endeavor to make sure you are not disturbed we went over to a spot next to a palm tree garcía was seated on a fancy french dining chair facing the room there was a gilt marbletopped table in front of him on which a backgammon set had already been laid out behind him on the canaryyellow wall was a fragonardstyle mural of a naked odalisque lying with her hand on the lap of a rather boredlooking man wearing a red turban considering where her hand was youd have thought he might have looked more interested garcías ownership of the shanghai made it seem like an entirely appropriate spot to have chosen for our game the shanghai on zanja was havanas most obscene and as a result most notorious and popular burlesque house even with seats there was always a long line of excited men outside the placemostly juvenile american sailorswaiting to pay to get in and see a show that made anything i had seen in weimar berlin look tame tame and by comparison rather tasteful too there was nothing in the least bit tasteful about the show at the shanghai mostly this was thanks to the presence on the bill of a tall mulatto called superman whose erect member was as big as a cattle prod and which he used to rather similar effect the climax of the show involved the mulatto outraging a succession of innocentlooking blondes to the vociferous encouragement of uncle sam it wasnt a place to take a liberalminded satyr let alone a nineteenyearold girl garcía stood up politely but i disliked him on sight in the same way i would have disliked a pimp or for that matter a gorilla in a tuxedo which is what he looked like he moved with the economy of a robot his thick arms held stiffly at his sides until equally stiffly one of them came my way extending a hand the size and color of a falconers glove the bald head with its enormous ears and thick lips might have been looted from some egyptian archaeological siteif not the valley of the kings then perhaps the gully of the slimylooking satraps i felt the strength in his hand before he took it away and slipped it into the pocket of his tuxedo the hand came out with a bundle of money which he tossed onto the table beside the board a cash game would be best dont you agree he said sure i said and laid the envelope of money reles had given me earlier beside garcías but we can settle up at the end of the evening surely or do you want to do it at the end of every game at the end of the evening is fine he said in which case i said pocketing my envelope theres no real need for this now that we both know the other is carrying a substantial amount of cash he nodded and took back the bundle of money i have to leave for a while at around eleven he said i have to be back to supervise the door at the shanghai for the eleventhirty show and what about the ninethirty show i asked or does that just run itself you know my theater he made it sound like the abbey theatre in dublin the voice was what i expected too many cigars and not enough exercise a wallowing hippos voice muddy and full of yellowing teeth and gas dangerous too probably i know it i said but i can always come back afterward he said to give you a chance to win back your money and i can always extend you the same courtesy to answer your earlier question the thick lips stretched like a cheap pink garter the eleventhirty show is always the more difficult one to handle people have had more to drink by that time of the evening and sometimes theres trouble if they cant get in the police station on zanja is conveniently close but its not unknown that they need a cash incentive to put in an appearance money talks it does in this city i glanced down at the backgammon board if only to avoid looking at his ugly face and inhaling the even uglier stink of his breath from almost a meter away i could smell it to my surprise i found myself staring at a backgammon set of a design that was remarkable in its obscenity the points on the board black or white and shaped like spearheads on any ordinary set were here each shaped like erect phalluses between phalluses or perhaps draped over them like artists models were naked figures of girls the checkers were painted to look like the bare behinds of black and white women while the two cups from which each player would throw his dice were the shape of a female breast these slotted together to form a chest that would have been the envy of any oktoberfest waitress only the four dice and the doubling cube met the eye with any kind of decorum you like my set he asked chuckling like a foulsmelling mud bath i like mine better i said but my set is locked and i cant remember the combination so if it amuses you to play with this one thats fine by me im quite broadminded have to be if you live in havana right play on pips or just the cube im feeling lazy all that math lets stick to the cube shall we say ten pesos a game i lit a cigar and settled into my chair as the game progressed i forgot about the boards pornographic design and my opponents breath we were more or less even until garcía threw two more doubles in a row and turning the four to an eight pushed the doubling cube my way i hesitated his two doubles in a row were enough to make me cautious to accept the new stake id never been the kind of percentage player who could look at the positions of all the checkers on the board and calculate the difference in pips between myself and the other player i preferred to base my game on the look of things and my remembering the run of the dice deciding i had to be due a double soon to make up for his three i picked up the cube and immediately threw a double five which at that particular moment was exactly what i needed and left both of us bearing off neck and neck we were each down to the last few checkers in our home boardstwelve in his and ten in minewhen he offered me the cube again the math was on my side so long as he didnt throw a fourth double and since this seemed improbable i took it any other decision would have demonstrated a lack of what the cubans called cojones and would certainly have had a disastrous effect on the rest of the evenings play the stake was now pesos he threw a double four which now left him even with me and likely to win the game unless i threw a double myself his eyes hardly flickered as once again i threw a one and a two when i needed it least and managed to bring off only one checker he threw a six and a five bearing off two i threw a five and a three bearing off two then he threw another double and took off four morehis two against my five not even a double could save me now garcía didnt smile he just picked up his cup and emptied the dice with no more feeling than if it had been the first throw of the game meaningless everything still to play for except that the first game was now over and i had lost he bore off his last two checkers and slipped the big paw into the pocket of his tuxedo again this time it came out with a little black leather notebook and a silver mechanical pencil with which he wrote the number onto the first page it was eightthirty twenty minutes had passed an expensive twenty minutes garcía might have been a pornographer and a pig but there wasnt much wrong with his luck or his ability to play the game i realized this was going to be harder than id thought i had started playing backgammon in uruguay in the café of the hotel alhambra in montevideo i had been taught to play by a former champion but uruguay was expensivemuch more expensive than cubawhich was the main reason i had come to the island usually i played with a couple of secondhand booksellers in a café on havanas plaza de armas and only for a few centavos i liked backgammon i liked the neatness of itthe arrangement of checkers on points and the tidying of them all away that was required to finish the game the neatness and order of it always struck me as very german i also liked the mixture of skill and luck more luck than was needed for bridge and more skill than was needed for a game like blackjack above all i liked the idea of taking risks against the celestial bank of competing against fate itself i liked the feeling of cosmic justice that could be invoked with every roll of the dice in a sense my whole life had been lived like that against the grain it wasnt garcía i was playinghe was merely the ugly face of chanceit was life itself so i relit my cigar rolled it around in my mouth and waved a waiter toward me ill have a small carafe of peach schnapps chilled but no ice i told the man i didnt ask if garcía wanted a drink i hardly cared all i cared about now was beating him isnt that a womans drink he asked i hardly think so i said its eighty proof but you may believe what you like i picked up my dice cup and for you señor the waiter was still there a lime daiquiri we continued with the game garcía lost the next game on pips and the one after that when he declined my double and gradually he became a little more reckless hitting blots when he should have left them alone and then accepting doubles when he should have refused he began to lose heavily and by tenfifteen i was up by more than a thousand pesos and feeling quite pleased with myself there was still no trace of emotion on the argument in favor of darwinism my opponent called his face but i knew he was rattled by the way he was throwing his dice in backgammon its customary to throw your dice in your home board and both dice have to come to rest there completely flat but several times during the last game garcías hand had got a little overexcited and his dice had crossed the bar or not landed flat in each case the rules required him to throw again and on one occasion this meant he had missed out on a useful double there was another reason i knew i had rattled him he suggested that we should increase our tenpeso game stake when a man does that you can be certain he thinks hes already lost too much and is keen to win it back and as quickly as possible but this is to ignore the central principle of backgammon which is that its the dice that dictate how you play the game not the cube or the money i sat back and sipped my schnapps how much were you thinking of lets say a hundred pesos a game all right but on one condition that we also play the beaver rule he grinned almost as if he had wanted to suggest it himself agreed he picked up the cup and although it wasnt his turn to throw first he rolled a six i rolled a one garcía won the throw and simultaneously made his bar point he pushed himself close to the table as if eager to win back his money a little sheen of sweat appeared on his elephantine head and seeing it i doubled immediately garcía took the double and tried to double back until i reminded him that i hadnt yet taken my turn i rolled a double four which took both of my runners past his bar point for the moment rendering it redundant garcía winced a little at this but doubled all the same and then threw a two and a one which disappointed him i had the doubling cube now and sensing i had the psychological advantage turned the cube and said beaver effectively doubling the cube without the requirement of his consent i then paused and offered him a double on top of my beaver he bit his lip at this and already facing a potential loss of eight hundred pesoson top of what he had already losthe ought to have declined my double instead he accepted now i rolled a double six which left me able to make my bar point and the ten point the game had already turned my way with a stake of sixteen hundred pesos his throwing became more agitated first he cocked his dice then he threw a double four which might have dug him out of the hole he was in but for the fact that one of the fours was in his outer board and therefore could not count angrily he snatched up both dice dropped them into the cup and threw them again with considerably less success a two and a three things deteriorated rapidly for him after that and it wasnt long before he was locked out of my home board with two checkers sitting on the bar i started to bear off with him still locked out now there was a real danger that he might not get any of his checkers back to his own home board before i finished bearing off this was called a gammon and would have cost him double the stake on the cube garcía was throwing like a madman now and there was no sign of his earlier sangfroid with each roll of the dice he remained locked out the game was lost with nothing left to play for but the possibility of saving the gammon finally he was back on the board and racing for home with me left with only six checkers to bear off but low throws continued to dog his progress a few seconds later the game and gammon were mine thats gammon i said quietly that makes double whats on the cube i make that thirtytwo hundred pesos plus the eleven hundred forty you already owe me and that makes i can add he said brusquely theres nothing wrong with my math i resisted the temptation to point out that it was his skill at backgammon that was at fault not his math garcía looked at his watch and so did i it was tenforty i have to leave he said closing the board abruptly are you coming back i asked after youve been to your club i dont know well ill be here for a while to give you a chance to win it back but we both knew he wouldnt be returning he counted out fortythree hundredpeso notes from a fiftynote bundle and handed them over i nodded and said plus ten percent for the house thats two hundred each i riffled my fingers at his remaining cash ill pay for the drinks myself sullenly he thumbed another couple of bills at me then he closed the catches on top of the ugly backgammon set tucked it under his arm and quickly walked away shouldering his way through the other gamblers like a character in a horror movie i pocketed my winnings and went to find the casino manager again he looked as if hed hardly moved since id last spoken to him is the game over he asked for the moment señor garcía has to visit his club and i have a meeting upstairs with señor reles after that we may resume i said id wait here to give him a chance to win back his money so well see ill keep the table free said the manager thank you and perhaps youd be kind enough to let señor reles know that im on my way up to see him now yes of course i handed him four hundred pesos ten percent of the table stakes i believe thats normal the manager shook his head that wont be necessary thank you for beating him for a long time now ive been hoping that someone could humiliate that pig and from the look of things you must have beat him good i nodded perhaps after you have finished your meeting with señor reles you could come to my office i should like to buy you a drink to celebrate your victory still carrying ben siegels backgammon set i caught the elevator car up to the eighth floor and the hotel pool terrace where i found waxey and another elevator car already waiting for me maxs bodyguard was a little friendlier this time but not so as youd have noticed unless you were a lipreader for a big man he had a very quiet voice and it was only later on i discovered that waxeys vocal cords had been damaged as a result of being shot in the throat sorry he whispered but i gotta frisk you before you go upstairs i put down the case and lifted my arms and looked past him while he went about his job in the distance the barrio chino was lit up like a christmas tree whats in the case he asked ben siegels backgammon set it was a gift from max only he didnt tell me the correct combination for the locks he said it was sixsixsix which would seem appropriate if it was only its not waxey nodded and stood back he was wearing loose black slacks and a gray guayabera that matched the color of his hair when his jacket was off i could see his bare arms and i got a better idea of his probable strength his forearms were like bowling pins the loose shirt was probably supposed to conceal the holstered weapon on the back of his hip except that the hem had got caught under the polishedwood grip of a colt detective specialprobably the finest snubbie ever made he reached down into his trouser pocket and took out a key on a silver chain stuck it into the elevator panel and turned it he didnt have to press any other button the car went straight up the doors opened again theyre on the terrace waxey said i smelled them first the powerful scent of a small forest fire several large havana cigars then i heard them loud american voices raucous male laughter relentless profanity the odd yiddish and italian word or phrase more raucous laughter i came past the detritus of a card game in the living room a big table covered with chips and empty glasses now that the card game was over they were all out on the little pool terrace men in sharp suits with blunt faces but maybe not so tough anymore some of them wore glasses and sports coats with neat handkerchiefs in their breast pockets all of them looked exactly like what they claimed to be businessmen hoteliers club owners restaurateurs and perhaps only a policeman or fbi agent would have recognized these men for what they really wereall of them with reputations earned on the streets of chicago boston miami and new york during the volstead years the minute i walked onto that terrace i knew i was among the big beasts of havanas underworldthe highprofile mafia bosses senator estes kefauver was so keen to talk to id watched some of the senate committee testimonies on the newsreels the hearings had made household names out of a lot of the bosses including the little man with the big nose and neat dark hair he was wearing a brown sports coat with an open shirt it was meyer lansky oh here he is said reles his voice was a little louder than usual but he was a model of sartorial rectitude he wore gray flannel trousers neat brown shoes with oxford toe caps a blue buttondown shirt a blue silk cravat and a cashmere navy blue blazer he looked like the membership secretary of the havana yacht club gentlemen he said this is the guy i was telling you about this is bernie gunther this is the guy whos going to be my new general manager like always i flinched at the sound of my own name put down the attaché case and took maxs hand relax will you he said theres not one of us here that doesnt have as much fucking history as you do bernie maybe more nearly all of the guys here have seen the inside of a prison cell at one time or another including myself he chuckled the old max reles chuckle you didnt know that did you i shook my head like i say we all of us got plenty of fucking history bernie say hello to meyer lansky his brother jake moe dalitz norman rothman morris kleinman and eddie levinson i bet you didnt know there were so many heebs on this island naturally were the brains of the outfit for everything else we got wops and micks so say hello to santo trafficante vincent alo tom mcginty sam tucker the cellini brothers and wilbur clark hello i said havanas underworld stared back at me with modest enthusiasm it must have been some card game i observed waxey get bernie a drink what are you drinking bernie a beers fine some of us play gin some of us play poker said max some of us dont know a game of cards from a sorting office in a post office but the important thing is that we meet and we talk in the spirit of healthy competition like jesus and the fucking disciples you ever read adam smiths wealth of nations bernie cant say that i have smith talks about something he calls the invisible hand he said that in a free market an individual pursuing his selfinterest tends to promote the good of his community as a whole through a principle that he called the invisible hand he shrugged what we do thats all it is an invisible hand and weve been doing it for years that we have growled lansky reles chuckled meyer thinks hes the clever one on account of how he reads a lot he wagged his finger at lansky but i read too meyer i read too reading its a jew thing said alo he was a tall man with a long sharp nose that might have made me think he was one of the jews but he was one of the italians and they wonder why the jews do well said a man with an easy grin and a nose like a speed bag this man was moe dalitz i read two books in my life said one of the micks hoyle on gambling and the cadillac handbook waxey returned with my beer it was cold and dark like his eyes fbs thinking of resurrecting his old rural education program said lansky sounds like some of you guys should try to get in on it you could use a bit of education is that the same one he ran in thirtysix said his brother jake meyer lansky nodded only hes worried that some of the kids hes teaching to read that theyre going to be tomorrows rebels like this last lot thats now doing a stretch on the isle of pines hes right to worry said alo they get weaned on communism some of these bastards then again said lansky when the economy of this country takes off really takes off then were going to need educated people to work in our hotels to be tomorrows croupiers you gotta be smart to be a croupier math smart you read much bernie more and more i admitted and for me its like the french foreign legion i do it to forget myself i think max reles was looking at his wristwatch talking of books its time i threw you guys out i got my call with fb to go through the books how does that work asked someone on the telephone reles shrugged i read out the numbers and he writes them down we both know that one day hes gonna check so why the fuck would i cheat him lansky nodded that is definitely verboten we moved off the terrace toward the elevators as i stepped into one of the cars reles took my arm and said start work tomorrow come around ten and ill show you around all right i went back down to the casino i felt a certain amount of awe at the company i was keeping these days i felt like id just been up to the berghof for an audience with hitler and the other nazi leaders when i returned to the saratoga the following morning at ten oclock as arranged a very different scene presented itself there were police everywhereoutside the main entrance of the hotel and in the lobby when i asked the receptionist to announce my arrival to max reles she told me that no one was being allowed up to the penthouse except the hotel owners and the police whats happened i asked i dont know said the receptionist they wont tell us anything but theres a rumor that one of the hotel guests has been murdered by the rebels i turned and walked back to the front door and met the diminutive figure of meyer lansky you leaving he asked why they wont let me upstairs i said come with me i followed lansky to the elevator car where a policeman was about to prevent our using it until his officer recognized the gangster and saluted inside the car lansky produced a key from his pocketone like waxeysand used it to take us up to the penthouse i noticed that his hand was shaking whats happened i asked lansky shook his head the elevator doors parted to reveal yet more police and in the living room we found a captain of militia waxey jake lansky and moe dalitz is it true meyer lansky asked his brother jake lansky was a little taller and more coarsefeatured than his brother he had thick bottleglass spectacles and eyebrows like a pair of mating badgers he wore a creamcolored suit a white shirt and a bow tie his face had laugh lines only he wasnt using them right now he nodded gravely its true where in his office i followed the two lanskys into the office of max reles a uniformed police captain brought up the rear someone had been redecorating the walls they looked as if jackson pollock had come in and actively expressed himself with a ceiling brush and a large pot of red paint only it wasnt red paint that was splashed all over the office it was blood and lots of it max reles was going to need a new chinchilla rug too except that it wasnt going to be he who would go to a store to buy a replacement he was never going to buy anything againnot even a funeral casket which was what he now needed most he lay on the floor still in what seemed to be the same clothes hed been in the night before but the blue shirt now had some dark brown spots he was staring at the corktiled ceiling with only one eye the other eye appeared to be missing from the look of him two shots had hit him in the head but there was a strong case for thinking that at least two or three more had ended up in his back and chest it seemed like a real gangsterstyle murder in that the gunman had done a very thorough job of making sure he was dead and yet apart from the police captain who had followed us into the officemore out of curiosity than anything else it seemedthere were no police in there no one taking photographs of the body no one with a measuring tape nothing of what might normally have been expected well this was cuba after all i told myself where everything took just that little bit longer to get done including perhaps the dispatching of forensic scientists to the scene of a homicide max reles was already dead so where was the hurry waxey appeared behind us in the doorway of his dead masters office there were tears in his eyes and in his encyclopediasized hand a white handkerchief that looked as if it might have been tugged off one of the double beds he sniffed for a moment and then blew his nose loudly sounding like a passenger ship making port meyer lansky looked at him with irritation so where the hell were you when he got his brains blown out he said where were you waxey i was right here whispered waxey like i always am i thought the boss had gone to bed after his phone call to fb he always had an early night after that regular as clockwork first thing i knew about it was when i came in here at seven oclock this morning and found him like this dead he added the word dead as if there had been some doubt about that fact he wasnt shot with a bb gun waxey said lansky didnt you hear nothing waxey shook his head miserably nothing like i said the police captain finished lighting a little cigarillo and said its possible señor reles was shot during last nights fireworks he said for chinese new year that would certainly have covered up the sound of any gunshots he was a smallish handsome cleanshaven man his neat olivegreen uniform seemed to complement the light brown color of his smooth face he spoke english with only a trace of a spanish accent and all the time he was speaking he leaned casually on the doorjamb as if doing nothing more pressing than offering a halfhearted solution for fixing a brokendown car almost as if he didnt really care who had murdered max reles and perhaps he didnt even in batistas militia there were plenty of people who didnt much care for the presence of american gangsters in cuba the fireworks started at midnight continued the captain they lasted approximately thirty minutes he moved through the open sliding glass door and out onto the terrace my guess is that during the noise which was considerable the assassin shot señor reles from out here on the terrace we followed the captain outside possibly he climbed up from the eighth floor using the scaffolding erected around the hotel sign meyer lansky glanced over the wall thats a hell of a climb he murmured what do you think jake jake lansky nodded the captain is right the killer had to come up here either that or he had a key in which case he would have to have gotten past waxey which doesnt seem likely not likely said his brother but all the same it is possible waxey shook his head no fucking way he said suddenly his normally whispering voice sounded angry maybe you were asleep said the police captain waxey looked very indignant at this suggestion which was enough to have jake lansky stand between him and the police captain and try to defuse a situation that threatened to get ugly anything involving waxey would have threatened that much with one hand placed firmly on waxeys chest jake lansky said i should introduce you meyer this is captain sánchez hes from the police station around the corner on zulueta captain sánchez this is my brother meyer and thishe looked at methis is he hesitated for a moment as though trying to remember not my real namei could see that he knew what that wasbut my false one carlos hausner i said captain sánchez nodded and then addressed all of his remarks to meyer lansky i spoke to his excellency the president just a few minutes ago he said first of all he wishes me to express his sympathies to you señor lansky for the terrible loss of your friend he also wishes me to reassure you that the havana police will do everything in its power to catch the perpetrator of this heinous crime thank you said lansky his excellency tells me he spoke with señor reles on the telephone last night as was his custom every wednesday evening the call commenced at exactly eleven fortyfive pm and terminated at eleven fiftyfive which would also seem to suggest that the time of death was during the fireworks between twelve and twelvethirty in fact i am convinced of it let me show you why he held out a mangledlooking bullet in the palm of his hand this is a bullet that i dug out of the wall in the study it looks like a thirtyeightcaliber round a thirtyeight would be a lot of gun to keep quiet at any time but during the fireworks six shots might easily be fired without anyone hearing meyer lansky looked at me what do you think of that idea he asked me yeah you max said you used to be a cop kind of cop were you anyway the honest kind fuck that i mean what was your area of investigation homicide so what do you think of what the captain says i shrugged i think weve been jumping over one guess after another i think it might be an idea to let a doctor examine the body and see if we can pin down the time of death maybe that will tie in with the fireworks i dont know but that would make sense i think i glanced over the floor of the terrace i dont see any shell casings so either the killer used an automatic and picked them up in the dark which seems unlikely or the gun was a revolver either way it would seem best to find the murder weapon as a matter of priority lansky looked at captain sánchez we already looked for it said the captain looked i said looked where the terrace the penthouse the eighth floor maybe he threw it into that park i said indicating the campo de marte a gun might land there in the dark and nobody would notice then again maybe he took it with him said the captain maybe on the other hand major ventura was in the casino last night which meant there were plenty of police in and around the hotel i cant see that anyone who had just shot someone dead would risk running into a cop with a gun that had just been fired six or seven times especially if this was a professional killer frankly it looks professional it takes a cool head to fire that many shots and hit the target several times and expect to get away with it an amateur would probably have panicked and missed more maybe even dropped the gun here my guess is that he just dumped the gun somewhere on his way out of the hotel in my experience all sorts of stuff can get smuggled in and out of a hotel as big as this waiters walk around with covered trays porters carry bags maybe the killer just dropped the gun in a laundry basket captain sánchez called one of his men and ordered a search to be made of the campo de marte and the hotel laundry baskets i went back into the office and tiptoeing around the bloodstains stared down at max reles there was something covered with a handkerchief something bloody that had leaked through the cotton whats that i asked the captain when he had finished giving orders to his men his eyeball it must have popped out when one of the bullets exited the victims head i nodded then thats a hell of a thirtyeight you might expect that with a fortyfive but not a thirtyeight may i see the bullet you found captain sánchez handed over the bullet i looked at it and nodded no i think youre right it does look like a thirtyeight but something must have given this bullet an extra velocity such as i have no idea you were a detective señor it was a very long time ago and i didnt mean to suggest that you dont know your job captain im sure that you have your own way of handling an investigation but mr lansky here asked me what i thought and i told him captain sánchez sucked the little cigarillo and then dropped it on the floor of the crime scene he said you said major ventura was in the casino last night does that mean you were here also yes i played backgammon in the casino last night until around ten fortyfive when i came up here to join señor reles and his guests for a drink mr lansky and his brother were among those other guests and the gentleman in the living room mr dalitz waxey too i stayed until about eleventhirty when we all left so that reles could prepare for his phone call with the president id arranged for my backgammon opponentseñor garcía who owns the shanghai theaterto return to the casino and continue our game well i waited but he didnt come back meanwhile i had a drink with señor núñez the casino manager then i went home at what time was that just after twelvethirty i remember the time because im sure the fireworks ended a few minutes before i got in my car i see the captain lit another cigarillo and allowed some of the smoke to escape from between his extremely white teeth so it could have been you who killed señor reles could it not it could have been yes it could have been me who led the attack on the moncada barracks too but it wasnt max reles had just given me an extremely well paid job a job i no longer have so my motive for killing him looks less than convincing thats quite correct captain said meyer lansky max had made señor hausner here his general manager captain sánchez nodded as if accepting lanskys corroboration of my story but he wasnt quite finished with me and now i was cursing myself for being rash enough to have answered lanskys earlier question to me concerning the murder of max reles how long did you know the deceased asked the captain we first met in berlin about twenty years ago until a couple of nights ago i hadnt seen him since then and straightaway he offers you a job he must have thought very highly of you señor hausner he had his reasons i suppose perhaps you were holding something over his head something from the past you mean like blackmail captain i most certainly do mean that yes that might have been true twenty years ago as a matter of fact we both had something on each other but it certainly wasnt enough to give me any power over the man not anymore and him did he hold any power over you sure you could put it that way why not he offered me money to work for him thats about the most powerful thing there is on this island that i know of the captain pushed his peaked cap onto the back of his head and scratched his forehead but im still puzzled why why did he offer you this job like i said he had his reasons but if you want me to speculate captain i suppose he liked it that i kept my mouth shut for twenty years that i kept my word to him that i wasnt afraid to tell him to go and fuck himself and maybe you were not afraid to kill him either i smiled and shook my head no hear me out said the captain max reles has lived in havana for many years he is a lawabiding taxpaying upstanding citizen hes a friend of the president then one day he meets you someone he hasnt seen for twenty years two or three days later hes murdered thats quite a coincidence isnt it when you put it like that i wonder why the hell you dont arrest me it would certainly save you the time and trouble of conducting a proper murder investigation with forensic evidence and witnesses who saw me do the shooting the usual stuff run me down to the station why dont you maybe you can strongarm a confession out of me before you finish your shift i cant imagine it would be the first time youve done something like that you mustnt believe everything you read in bohemia señor no do you really think we torture suspects mostly i dont give the matter any thought at all captain but maybe ill go and visit some prisoners on the isle of pines and see what they have to say about it and then get back to you itll make a change from picking my feet at home but sánchez wasnt listening he was looking at the revolver one of his men was presenting to him on a towel like a crown of laurel or wild olive i heard the man say that the gun had been found in a laundry basket on the eighth floor there was a red star on the handle and it certainly looked like the murder weapon for one thing it was wearing a silencer it looks like señor hausner was right wouldnt you say captain said meyer lansky sánchez and the cop turned and went into the living room and not a moment too soon i told lansky that stupid cop liked me for it didnt he just me i liked you for the way you spoke to him it reminded me of me i suppose that was the murder weapon id bet the hard way on it thats a sevenshot nagant my guess is theyll dig seven out of maxs body and the walls a nagant ive never heard of it designed by a belgian but the red star on the handle means that ones russian made i said russian huh are you telling me max was killed by communists no mr lansky i was telling you about the gun soviet murder squads used that type of gun to murder polish officers in they shot them in the back of the head and then buried the bodies in the katyn forest and later blamed the germans for it there were plenty of guns like that in europe at the end of the war but oddly not that many on this side of the atlantic especially not with a bramit silencer that alone makes this killing look professional you see sir even with a silencer all pistols will still make a noise maybe enough noise to alert waxey but a nagants the only kind of pistol you can silence completely you see theres no gap between the cylinder and the barrel its what they call a closed firing system which means you can suppress whatever noise comes out of the barrel one hundred percentprovided that is you have a bramit silencer frankly its the perfect weapon for a clandestine killing the nagant would also account for the higher velocity of the thirtyeightcaliber bullet too enough to knock out an eyeball that got in the way so what im saying is this whoever shot max reles didnt need to do it during last nights fireworks they could have shot him at any time between midnight and when waxey found the body this morning and nobody would have heard a damn thing oh and by the way this isnt exactly the kind of gun you can buy in your local gun store least of all with a silencer these days the ivans prefer the much lighter tokarev tt thats an automatic in case you didnt know i didnt know agreed lansky but as it happens im not as ignorant about the russians as you might think gunther my family was from grodno on the russianpolish border me and my brother jake we left when we were kids to get away from the russians jake here knew one of those polish officers who got themselves killed people today talk about german antisemitism but for my family the russians were just as bad maybe worse jake lansky nodded i think so he said and so did pop so how come you know so much about this stuff during the war i was in german military intelligence i said and for a short while afterward i was in a soviet pow camp if im cagey about my name its because i killed a couple of ivans while making my escape from a train bound for a uranium mine in the urals i doubt id have come back from there very few german pows have ever come back from the soviet union they ever catch up with me im soap on a rope mr lansky i figured it was something like that lansky shook his head and glanced down at the dead body someone should cover him up i wouldnt do that mr lansky i said not yet its just possible that captain sánchez will get wise to the proper procedures here dont you worry none about him said lansky he gives you any trouble ill call his boss and have him lay off maybe ill do that anyway come on lets get out of this room i cant bear to be here any longer max was like a second brother to me i knew him since i was fifteen years old in brownsville he was the smartest kid i ever knew with the proper education max could have been anything he wanted maybe even the president of the united states we went into the living room sánchez was there with waxey and dalitz the gun was lying in a plastic bag on the table where max and i had eaten lunch less than forty hours before so what happens now asked waxey we bury him said meyer lansky like a good jew thats what max would have wanted when the cops have finished with the body we got three days to make the arrangements and everything leave it to me said jake itd be an honor someone ought to tell that girl of his said dalitz dinah whispered waxey her name is dinah they were going to get married with a rabbi and the whole broken wineglass everything shes jewish too you know i didnt know that said dalitz shell be all right said meyer lansky someone ought to tell her sure but shell be all right the young always are nineteen years old shes got her whole life ahead of her god rest maxs soul i thought she was too young for him but what do i know you cant blame a guy for wanting a little piece of happiness for a guy like max dinah was as good as it gets but youre right moe someone ought to tell her tell me what has something happened wheres max why are the police here it was dinah well isnt anyone going to say anything is max all right is he sick god damn it what the hell is happening here then she saw the gun on the table i suppose she must have guessed the rest because she started to scream loudly it was a sound that could have raised the dead but not this time waxey drove dinah back to finca vigía in the red cadillac eldorado under the circumstances perhaps it ought to have been me who took her home i might have been able to offer noreen some support in dealing with her daughters grief but waxey was eager to get out from under meyer lanskys shrewd searching eye as if he felt the jewish gangster suspected him of some involvement in the murder of max reles besides it was much more likely that id only have been in the way i wasnt much of a shoulder to cry on not anymore not since the war when so many german women had of necessity learned to cry by themselves grief i no longer had the patience for it what did it matter if you grieved for people when they died it certainly couldnt bring them back and they werent even particularly grateful for your grief the living always get over the dead thats what the dead never realize if ever the dead did come back theyd only have been sore that somehow you managed to get over their dying at all it was about four oclock in the afternoon when i felt equal to the task of driving down to the hemingway house to offer my sympathies despite the fact that maxs death had done me out of a salary worth twentythousand dollars a year i wasnt sorry he was dead but for dinahs sake i was willing to pretend the pontiac wasnt there just a white oldsmobile with a sun visor i seemed to recognize ramón admitted me to the house and i found dinah in her room she was seated in an armchair smoking a cigarette watched closely by a glumlooking water buffalo the buffalo reminded me of myself and it was perhaps easy to see why he was looking glum dinahs suitcase was open on her bed it was packed neatly with her clothes as if she were preparing to leave the country on a table by the arm of her chair were a drink and a hardwood ashtray her eyes were red but she seemed to be all cried out i came to see how you are i said as you can see she said calmly going somewhere so you were a detective i smiled thats what max used to say when he wanted to needle me and did it at the time yes it did but theres not much that gets to me now im rather more impervious these days well thats a lot more than max can say i let that one go what would you say if i told you that my mother killed him she said id say that it might be best to keep a wild thought like that to yourself not all of maxs friends are as forgetful as me but i saw the gun she said the murder weapon in the penthouse at the saratoga it was my mothers gun the one ernest gave her its a common enough gun i said i saw plenty of guns like that during the war her gun is missing said dinah i already looked for it i was shaking my head do you remember the other day when you said you thought she was suicidal i took the gun away just in case she decided to use it on herself i should have mentioned it at the time im sorry youre lying she said she was right but i wasnt about to admit it no im not i said the gun is missing and so is she im sure theres a perfectly simple explanation for why shes not here which is that she murdered him she did it or alfredo lópez thats his car out there neither of them liked max one time noreen as good as told me that she wanted to kill him to stop me from marrying him just how much do you really know about your late boyfriend i know he wasnt exactly a saint if thats what you mean he never professed to be she flushed what are you driving at just this max was a very long way from being a saint you wont like this but youre going to hear it anyway max reles was a gangster during prohibition he was a ruthless bootlegger maxs brother abe was a hit man for the mob before someone tossed him out of a hotel window im not listening to this dinah shook her head and stood up but i pushed her back down onto the chair again yes you are i said youre listening to it because somehow youve never heard it before or if you did then maybe you just buried your head in the sand like some stupid ostrich youre going to listen to it because its the truth every damned word max reles was into every dirty racket that there is more recently he was part of an organized crime syndicate started in the s by charlie luciano and meyer lansky he stayed in business because he didnt mind murdering his rivals shut up she said its not true he told me himself that he and his brother murdered two men the shapiro brothers in one of them he buried alive after prohibition ended he went into labor racketeering some of it was in berlin which was where i first met him while he was there he murdered a german businessman called rubusch who refused to be intimidated by him i myself witnessed him murder two other people one of them was a prostitute dora with whom he had been conducting a relationship he shot her in the head and dumped her body in a lake she was still breathing when she hit the water get out she snapped get out of here and maybe your mother already told you about the man he murdered on a passenger ship between new york and hamburg i didnt believe her and i dont believe you now sure you do you believe all of it because youre not stupid dinah youve always known what kind of a man he was maybe you liked that maybe it gave you a cheap little thrill to be near someone like that it can happen like that sometimes theres a fascination all of us feel for the kind of people who inhabit the shadows maybe thats it i dont know and i really dont care but if you didnt know max reles was a gangster then you certainly suspected as much strongly suspected because of the company he kept meyer and jake lansky santo trafficante norman rothman vincent alo every one a gangster with lansky the most notorious gangster of them all just four years ago lansky was facing a congressional committee investigating organized crime in the united states so was max thats why they came to cuba i know of six people that max has murdered but im certain there are plenty more people who crossed him people who owed him money people who were just inconveniently in his way hed have killed me too but i had something on him something he couldnt afford to let be known max was shot but his own weapon of choice was an ice pick with which he stabbed people in the ear thats the kind of man he was dinah a rotten murdering gangster one of many rotten murdering gangsters who run the hotels and casinos here in havana any one of whom probably had his own very good reasons for wanting max reles out of the way so keep your stupid mouth shut about your mother im telling you now that she had nothing to do with it you keep your mouth shut or shell wind up dead on account of you you too if you happen to get in the way you dont tell anyone what you told me got that dinah nodded sullenly i pointed at the glass by her arm you drinking that she looked at it and then shook her head no i dont even like whiskey i reached forward and picked it up do you mind go ahead i poured the contents into my mouth and sucked on them for a while before letting the whiskey drip down my throat i talk too much i said but this certainly helps she shook her head all right youre right i did suspect what he was like but i was afraid to leave him afraid of what he might do in the beginning it was just a bit of fun i was bored here max introduced me to people id only ever read about frank sinatra nat king cole can you imagine it she nodded youre right and what you said i had it coming we all make mistakes god knows ive made a few myself there was a pack of cigarettes on top of her clothes in the suitcase i picked them up do you mind ive given up but i could use a smoke help yourself i lit it quickly and sent some smoke down my hatch to go after the whiskey where will you go the states to rhode island and brown university like my mother wanted i suppose what about the singing i suppose max told you that did he as a matter of fact he did he seemed to think very highly of your talents dinah smiled sadly i cant sing she said although max seemed to think i could i dont know why i suppose he thought the best of me in all respects including that one but i cant sing and i cant act for a while it was fun pretending that any of that might be possible but in my heart of hearts i knew it was all pie in the sky a car came up the drive i looked out of the open window and saw the pontiac pull up next to the oldsmobile the doors opened and a man and a woman got out they werent dressed for the beach but that was where they had been all right and you didnt need to be a detective to know it with alfredo lópez the sand was mostly on his knees and on his elbows with noreen it was almost everywhere else they didnt see me they were too busy grinning at each other and dusting themselves off as they sauntered up the steps to the front door her smile faltered a little as she caught sight of me in the window perhaps she blushed maybe i went into the hall and met them as they came through the front door by now the grins on their faces had turned to guilt but it had nothing to do with the death of max reles of that much i was certain bernie she said awkwardly what a lovely surprise if you say so noreen went to the drinks trolley and began fixing herself a large one lópez was smoking a cigarette and looking sheepish while pretending to read a magazine from a rack as big as a newspaper kiosk what brings you down here she asked so far she had done a great job of not meeting my eye not that i was trying to put it in her way exactly but both of us knew that i knew what she and lópez had been doing you could actually smell it on them like fried food i decided to offer a swift explanation and then make myself scarce i came to see if dinah was all right i said why shouldnt she be all right has something happened noreen was looking at me her embarrassment now temporarily overcome by concern for her daughter where is she is dinah all right shes fine i said but max reles isnt looking his best right now on account of how someone pumped seven bullets into him late last night as a matter of fact hes dead noreen stopped making her drink for a moment i see she said poor max then she pulled a face listen to me what a damn hypocrite i am as if im actually sorry hes dead and its not like im in the least bit surprised given who and what he was she shook her head im sorry to sound callous hows dinah taken it oh lordshe wasnt there was she when he no she wasnt i said dinahs just fine already getting over it wouldnt you know do the police have any idea who killed max asked lópez now thats a question isnt it i said i formed the impression that this is one crime the police are hoping will solve itself either that or someone else will solve it for them lópez nodded yes youre probably right of course the havana militia can hardly start asking too many questions without the risk of upsetting the whole rotten apple cart in case it turns out that one of havanas other gangsters should prove to be responsible for maxs murder theres never been a gangland murder in cuba not of a boss anyway the last thing i imagine batista needs is a gangland war on his doorstep he smiled yes i think im pleased to say that the politics of this thing look fiendishly complicated as it turned out things were a lot more complicated than that i got back around seven and ate the cold dinner that yara had left for me on a covered plate while i ate i looked through the evening newspaper there was a nice picture of the presidents wife marta opening a new school in boyeros and something about the forthcoming visit to havana of the us senator from florida george smathers but max reles didnt get a mention not even in the obituaries column after dinner i fixed myself a drink there wasnt much to that i just poured some vodka from the refrigerator into a clean glass and drank it i was settling down to take the place of montaignes dead friend it seemed a pretty good definition of a reader then the telephone rang which reminded me that there are times when a dead friend is your best friend but it wasnt a friend it was meyer lansky and he sounded annoyed gunther yes where the hell have you been ive been ringing all afternoon i went to see maxs girl dinah oh how is she like you said shell be all right listen gunther i want to talk to you only not on the telephone i dont like telephones never have liked them this number youre on thats a vedado number right yes i live on malecón then were practically neighbors im in a suite at the national hotel could you come here at nine i turned over a few polite rebuffs in my mind but none of them sounded polite enough for a gangster like meyer lansky so i said sure why not i could use a stroll along the seafront do me a favor will you i thought thats what i was doing on your way over here get me a couple of packs of parliament will you the hotels run out i walked west along malecón bought lanskys smokes and went into havanas largest hotel this was more like a cathedral than havanas cathedral on empedrado the lobby was easily bigger than san cristóbals nave with a fine painted wooden ceiling that would have been the envy of many a medieval palacio it smelled a lot better than the cathedral too since the hotel lobby was swarming with wellwashed or even scented human traffic although to my tutored eye the hotel itself looked badly understaffed with long lines of guests in front of the reception desk the cashier and the concierge like so many people queuing for tickets in a railway station somewhere someone was playing a tinny piano that brought to mind a dance class in a girls ballet school four longcase clocks were arranged along the length of the lobby they were not synchronized and they struck the hour consecutively one after the other as if time itself was an elastic concept in havana near the elevator doors was a wall adorned with a fulllength picture of the president and his wife both dressed in whiteshe in a twopiece tailored suit and he in a tropicalweight military uniform they looked like a cutrate version of the peróns i rode the elevator to the top of the building in contrast with the railwaystation atmosphere of the lobby the executive floor was sepulchrally quiet very possibly it was even quieter than that since most sepulchers dont have carpets that run to ten dollars a square meter the doors to the executive suites were all louvered which may have been meant to help the free flow of air or cigar smoke the whole floor smelled like a tobacco growers humidor lanskys suite was the only one with its own doorman he was a tall man wearing square sleeves and with a chest like a housekeeping cart he turned to face me as i walked as silently as hiawatha along the corridor and i let him pat me down as if he were looking for his matches in my pockets he didnt find them then he opened the door admitting me to a suite the size of an empty billiard hall the atmosphere was every bit as hushed but instead of another jew with an overactive pituitary gland i was met by a petite greeneyed redhead in her forties who looked and sounded like a new york hairdresser she smiled pleasantly told me her name was teddy and that she was meyer lanskys wife and ushered me through a living room and a set of sliding windows onto a wraparound balcony lansky was seated on a wicker chair staring out into darkness over the sea like canute you cant see it he said the sea but you can sure smell it and you can hear it listen listen to that sound he held up his forefinger as if drawing my attention to the song of a nightingale on berkeley square i listened carefully in my unreliable ears it sounded very much like the sea the way the sea draws back and off the beach and then begins again everything in this lousy world changes but not that sound for thousands of years that sound has always been exactly the same thats a sound i never get tired of he sighed and there are times when i get very tired of almost everything do you ever get like that gunther do you ever get tired tired mr lansky there are times when i get so tired of things that i think maybe i must be dead if it wasnt for the fact that im sleeping all right life might be almost intolerable i gave him his cigarettes he started to get out his wallet until i stopped him keep it i told him i like the idea of you owing me money it feels safer than the other way round lansky smiled drink no thanks i like to keep a clear head when im talking business with lucifer is that what i am i shrugged it takes one to know one i watched him light one of the cigarettes and added i mean that is why im here isnt it business i cant imagine you want to reminisce about what a great guy max was lansky gave me a narrow look before he died max told me all about you or at least as much as he knew gunther ill come straight to the point there were three reasons max wanted you to work for him youre an excop you know hotels and youre not affiliated with any of the families whove got business here in havana ive got two of those reasons and one of my own that make me think youre the man to find out who killed max hear me out please the one thing we cant have here in havana is a gang war its bad enough weve got the rebels more trouble we dont need we cant rely on the cops to investigate this thing properly you must have gathered that yourself from your conversation with captain sánchez this morning actually hes not a bad cop at all but i liked the way you spoke to him and it strikes me that youre not someone whos easily intimidated not by cops not by me not by my associates anyway i spoke to some of the other gentlemen you met last night and were all of us of the opinion that we dont want you managing the saratoga like you agreed with max instead we want you to investigate maxs murder captain sánchez will give you any assistance you require but you can have carte blanche so to speak all we want is to avoid any possible dispute among ourselves you do this gunther you investigate this murder and ill owe you more than the price of two packs of cigarettes for one thing ill pay you what max was going to pay you and for another ill be your friend you think about that before you say no i can be a good friend to people whove done me a service anyway my associates and myself were all agreed you can go anywhere you can speak to anyone the bosses the soldiers wherever the evidence takes you sánchez wont interfere you say jump hell ask how high its been a long time since i investigated a murder mr lansky i dont doubt it im not as diplomatic as i used to be either dag hammarskjöld i am not and just suppose i do find out who killed max what then have you considered that you let me worry about that gunther just make sure you speak to everyone and that everyone can give you an alibi norman rothman and lefty clark at the sans souci santo trafficante at the tropicana my own people the cellini brothers at the montmartre joe stassi tom mcginty charlie white joe rivers eddie levinson moe dalitz sam tucker vincent alo not forgetting the cubans of course amedeo barletta and amleto battisti at the hotel sevilla relax ill supply you with a list to work from a list of suspects if you like with my name at the top that could take a while naturally youll want to be thorough and just so as everyone knows its fair you shouldnt leave anyone out justice being seen to be done so to speak he tossed the cigarette over the balcony youll do it then i nodded i still hadnt thought of any rebuffs that were polite enough to give the little man especially after hed offered to be my friend plus there was a flip side to that you can start right away that would probably be best what will you do first i shrugged go back to the saratoga find out if anyone saw anything review the crime scene speak to waxey i guess youll have to find him first said lansky waxeys gone missing he drove the broad to her house this morning and no ones seen him since he shrugged maybe hell turn up at the funeral whens that day after tomorrow at the jewish cemetery in guanabacoa i know it my route back home from the national took me right past the casa marina again and this time i went in the following morning was bright but windy and half the winter sea was crashing down on the malecón like a deluge sent by a god saddened at the wickedness of mankind i woke early thinking that i would have liked to sleep longer and probably would have done so except for the fact that the phone was ringing suddenly everyone in havana seemed to want to speak to me it was captain sánchez hows the great detective this morning he sounded like he didnt much like the idea of my playing the sleuth for lansky i wasnt too happy about it myself still in bed i said i had a late night interviewing suspects i thought of the girls at the casa marina and the way doña marina who also ran a chain of lingerie stores across havana liked it when you asked her girls lots of questions before deciding which one to take up to the third floor you could say that think youre going to find the killer today probably not today i said wrong kind of weather for it youre right said sánchez its a day for finding bodies not the people who killed them suddenly weve got corpses all over havana theres one in the harbor at the petrochemical works in regla am i an undertaker why tell me because he was driving a car when he went into the water not just any car mind you this is a big red cadillac eldorado a convertible i closed my eyes for a second then i said waxey we wouldnt have found him at all but for the fact that a fishing boat dragging its anchor snagged the cars bumper and pulled it up to the surface im just on my way over to regla now i was thinking that maybe youd like to come along why not its been a while since i went fishing be outside your apartment building in fifteen minutes well drive over there together on the way maybe i can pick up a few tips from you on how to be a detective it wouldnt be the first time ive done that i was joking he said stiffly then youre off to a great start captain youll need a sense of humor if youre going to be a good detective thats my first tip twenty minutes later we were driving south east and then north around the harbor into regla it was a small industrial town that was easily identified from a distance by the plumes of smoke emanating from the petrochemical plant although historically it was better known as a center of santería and as the place where havanas corridas had been fought until spain lost control of the island sánchez drove the large black police sedan like a fighting bull charging red lights braking at the last moment or turning suddenly and without warning to the left or the right by the time we skidded to a halt at the end of a long pier i was ready to stick a sword in his muscular neck a small group of policemen and dockworkers had gathered to view the arrival of a barge and the drowned car it had taken from the fishing boats anchor and then hoisted on top of a large heap of coal the car itself looked like a fantastic variety of sport fish a red marlinif there was such a thingor a gigantic species of crustacean i followed sánchez down a series of stone steps made slippery from the recent high tide and as one of the men on the barge grabbed hold of a mooring ring we jumped onto the moving deck the barge captain came forward and spoke to sánchez but i didnt understand his very broad cuban accent which was not uncommon whenever i moved outside havana he was a badtempered sort with an expensivelooking cigar which was the cleanest and most respectable thing about him the rest of the crew stood around chewing gum and awaiting an order finally one came and a crewman jumped down onto the coal mountain and drew a tarpaulin over it so that sánchez and i might climb up to the car without becoming as dirty as he was sánchez and i clambered down onto the tarpaulin and picked our way up the shifting slope of coal to look over the car the white hoodwhich was upwas dirty but largely intact the front bumper where the fishing boat had hooked it was badly out of shape the interior was more like an aquarium but somehow the red cadillac still managed to look like the handsomest car in havana the crewman still mindful of sánchezs wellpressed uniform had gone ahead of us to open the driver door on the captains sayso when the word came and the door opened water flooded out of the car soaking the crewmans legs and amusing his chattering colleagues the driver of the car slowly leaned out like a man falling asleep in the bath for a moment i thought the steering wheel would check his exit but the barge wallowed in the choppy undulating sea then came up again tipping the dead man onto the tarpaulin like a dirty dishcloth it was waxey all right and while he looked like a drowned man it wasnt the sea that had killed him nor was it loud music although his ears or what was left of them were encrusted with what resembled dark red coral pity said sánchez i didnt really know him i said the car i mean said sánchez the cadillac eldorado is just about my favorite car in the world he shook his head in admiration beautiful i like the red reds nice but me i think id have had a black one with whitewall tires and a white hood black has much more class i think red seems to be the color of the moment i said you mean his ears i wasnt talking about his manicure a bullet in each ear it looks like thats a message right like it was cable and wireless captain he heard something he wasnt supposed to hear flip the coin again he didnt hear something he was supposed to hear you mean like someone shooting his employer seven times in the adjoining room i nodded think he was involved in the shooting he asked go ahead and ask him i guess well never know for sure sánchez took off his peaked cap and scratched his head too bad he said the car again that i couldnt have interviewed him first jews had been arriving in cuba since the time of columbus many who had been forbidden entry to the united states of america more recently than that had been given sanctuary by the cubans who with reference to the jews most common country of origin called them polacos judging from the number of graves in the jewish cemetery in guanabacoa there were a lot more polacos in cuba than might have been thought the cemetery was on the road to santa fé behind an impressive gated entrance it wasnt exactly the mount of olives but the graves all white marble were set on a pleasant hill overlooking a mango plantation there was even a small monument to the jewish victims of the second world war in which it was said several bars of soap had been buried as a symbolic reminder of their supposed fate i might have told anyone who was interested that while it was now widely believed that nazi scientists had made soap from the corpses of murdered jews this had never actually happened the practice of calling jews soap had simply been a very unpleasant joke among members of the ss and merely another way of dehumanizingand sometimes threateningtheir most numerous victims since human hair from concentration camp inmates had commonly been used on an industrial scale describing jews as feltfelt for clothes roofing materials carpeting and in the german car industrymight have been a more accurate epithet but this wasnt what people arriving for max reless funeral wanted to hear about myself i was little surprised when i was offered a yarmulke outside the gate of guanabacoa not that i didnt expect to cover my head at a jewish funeral i was already wearing a hat what surprised me about being offered a yarmulke was the person handing them out this was szymon woytak the cadaverous pole who owned the nazi memorabilia store on manrique he was wearing a yarmulke himself and i took this and his presence at the funeral to be a strong clue that he was also a jew whos minding the store i asked him he shrugged i always close the shop for a couple of hours when im helping out my brother hes the rabbi reading kaddish for your friend max reles and who are you the program seller im the cantor i sing the psalms and whatever else the deceaseds family requests how about the horst wessel song woytak smiled patiently and handed the person behind me a yarmulke look he said everyone has to make a living right there was no family not unless you counted havanas jewish mob the chief mourners seemed to be the lansky brothers meyers wife teddy moe dalitz norman rothman eddie levinson morris kleinman and sam tucker but there were plenty of gentiles other than myself present santo trafficante vincent alo tom mcginty and the cellini brothers to name just a few what was interesting to meand might have been of interest to the racial theorists of the third reich such as alfred rosenbergwas how jewish everyone looked when he was wearing a yarmulke also present were several government officials and policemen including captain sánchez batista did not attend the funeral of his former partner for fear of being assassinated or so sánchez told me afterward noreen and dinah didnt come either not that i had expected them to come noreen didnt come for the simple reason that she had feared and detested max reles in equal measure dinah didnt come because she had already returned to the united states since this was exactly what noreen had always wanted her daughter to do i imagined she was now feeling too happy to come to a funeral for all i knew she had gone to the beach with lópez again which wasnt any of my business or so i kept telling myself as the pallbearers carried the casket haltingly to the graveside captain sánchez appeared at my elbow we still werent friends but i was beginning to like him whats the german opera where the murderer gets fingered by the victim he asked götterdämmerung i said the twilight of the gods maybe well get lucky maybe reles will point him out to us i wonder how that would play out in court this is cuba my friend said sánchez in this country people still believe in baron samedi he lowered his voice and talking of the voodoo master of death we have our own creature of the invisible world here with us today he who escorts souls from the land of the living to the graveyard not to mention two of his most sinister avatars the man in the beige uniform who looks like a younger general franco thats colonel antonio blanco rico head of the cuban military intelligence service take my word for it señor that man has made more souls disappear in cuba than any voodoo spirit the man to his left is colonel mariano faget of the militia during the war faget was in charge of a counterespionage unit that successfully targeted several nazi agents who were reporting on the movements of cuban and american to german submarines what happened to them they were shot by firing squad interesting and the third man thats fagets cia liaison officer lieutenant josé castaño quevedo a very nasty piece of work and why are they here exactly to pay their respects its certain that from time to time the president would ask your friend max to pay off these men by making sure they won in his casino actually most of the time they dont even have to take the trouble to gamble they just go into the salon privé at the saratoga or for that matter any of the other casinos collect several handfuls of chips and cash them in of course señor reles knew exactly how to look after men such as these and it is certain they will have taken his death very personally so they too are very interested in the progress of your inquiry they are for sure you may not know it but its not just meyer lansky youre working for its them too thats a comforting thought you should be especially careful of lieutenant quevedo he is very ambitious and thats a bad thing to be if youre a policeman here in cuba arent you ambitious captain sánchez i intend to be but not right now i will be ambitious after the election in october until i see who wins i will be very happy to achieve very little in my career incidentally the lieutenant has asked me to spy on you that seems rather presumptuous you being a captain in cuba ones rank is not an indicator of ones importance for example the head of the national police is general canizares but everyone knows that the power lies with blanco rico and with colonel piedra the head of our bureau of investigation similarly before he was president batista was the most powerful man in cuba now that he is he isnt if you follow me these days all power lies with the army and the police which is why batista always thinks he is a target for assassination in a sense that is his job to draw attention away from others sometimes it is best to appear to be what you are not wouldnt you agree captain that has been the story of my life a couple of days later i was at the tropicana watching the show while i waited to speak to the cellini brothers bare flesh was the order of the day for the performers and lots of it they tried to make it seem more glamorous by wearing some thoughtfully placed sequins and triangles but the result was much the same it was bacon with cheese on top however you cooked it most of the chorus boys looked as if theyd have been a lot happier wearing a cocktail dress most of the chorus girls didnt look happy at all all of them smiled but the smiles on their rigid little faces had been molded on back at the doll factory meanwhile they danced with all the joie de vivre of kids who knew that one fluffed pirouette or illtimed lift would earn them a oneway ticket back to matanzas or whatever crummy peasant town they came from on truffin avenue in the havana suburb of marianao the tropicana occupied the lushly landscaped gardens of a mansionnow demolishedformerly owned by the us ambassador to cuba the mansion had been replaced by a building of striking modernity with five reinforced concrete semicircular vaults connecting a series of glass ceilings which created the illusion of a semiferal show staged under the stars and the trees next to this amphitheater which seemed like something out of a pornographic sciencefiction movie was a smaller glass ceiling that housed a casino and here there was even a salon privé with an armorplated door behind which government officials could gamble without fear of assassination i wasnt interested in any of that any more than i was interested in the show or listening to the band mostly i just watched the ash on the end of my cigar or the faces of the suckers at the other tables women with bare shoulders and too much makeup and men with vaselined hair clipon ties and cricketeer suits a couple of times the showgirls came parading around the tables just so that you could get a closer look at their costumes and wonder how something so small could keep a girl decent my eyes were still brimful of wonder when to my surprise i saw noreen eisner coming through the club in my direction and sidestepping a girl who was all breasts and feathers she sat down opposite me noreen was probably the one woman at the tropicana who wasnt displaying either some cleavage or the whole toy shop she wore a twopiece lavendercolored suit with tailored pockets high shoes and a couple of strings of pearls the band was too loud for her to say anything or for me to hear it and until the number finished we just sat looking at each other dumbly and tapping our fingers impatiently on the table it gave me plenty of time to wonder what was so urgent that she had driven all the way from finca vigía i certainly didnt think her being there was a coincidence i supposed she had gone to my apartment first and yara had told her where i was maybe yara would have let off some steam about how i hadnt allowed her to come with me to the tropicana which meant that noreens arrival wouldnt have helped persuade her that my visit to the nightclub was for the strictly business reasons i had claimed there probably would be some kind of scene when i got home i hoped noreen was there to tell me what i wanted to hear certainly she looked grave enough and sober too which made a change she was carrying a navy blue beaded evening bag with a petitpoint floral chintz decoration opening the silver metal clasp she took out a pack of old gold and lit one with a pearl gray lacquer cigarette lighter with little rhinestones on it the only thing about her that was at all in keeping with the tropicana like most bands in havana this one took a while longer than was tolerable i didnt own a gun in cuba but if i had i might have enjoyed using a set of maracas or a conga drum for a little target practicereally any latin american instrument as long as it was actually in use at the time finally i could stand it no longer i stood up and taking noreens hand led her out in the foyer she said this is where you spend your spare time is it out of habit she spoke german to me so much for montaigne as a matter of fact he already wrote an essay about this place and the custom of wearing clothes or not wearing them if we were born with the need for wearing petticoats and trousers nature he says would no doubt have equipped us with a thicker skin to withstand the rigors of the seasons on the whole i think hes pretty good gets it right most of the time about the only thing that man doesnt explain is why you came all the way over here to see me ive got my own ideas about that lets take a walk in the garden she said quietly we went outside the tropicanas garden was a jungle paradise of royal palms and towering mamoncillo trees according to caribbean wisdom girls learn the art of kissing by eating the sweet flesh of the mamoncillo fruit somehow i had the feeling that kissing me was the last thing on noreens mind in the center of the sweeping driveway was a large marble fountain that had once graced the entrance of the national hotel the fountain was a round basin surrounded by eight lifesized naked nymphs it was rumored that the tropicanas owners had paid thirty thousand pesos for the fountain but it reminded me of one of those berlin culture schools once run by adolf koch at lake motzen for overweight german matrons who liked to throw medicine balls at each other in the nude and in spite of what montaigne has to say about the matter it made me glad that mankind had invented the needle and thread so i said what did you want to tell me this isnt easy for me to say youre a writer youll think of something she puffed silently on her cigarette considered this idea for a moment and then shrugged as if shed thought of a way after all her voice was soft in the moonlight she looked as lovely as ever seeing her i was filled with a dull ache of longing as if the scent of the mamoncillos greenishwhite flowers contained some sort of magical juice that made fools like me fall in love with queens like her dinahs gone back to the states she said still not quite coming to the point but you knew about that didnt you i nodded is this about dinah im worried about her bernie i shook my head shes left the island shes going to brown i dont see what you could possibly have to worry about i mean isnt that what you wanted oh sure no its the way she suddenly changed her mind about everything max reles was murdered i think that might have had something to do with her decision those gangsters he associated with you know some of them dont you yes do they have any idea who killed max yet none at all good she threw away her cigarette and quickly lit another youll probably think me crazy but you see it crossed my mind that perhaps dinah might have had something to do with his murder what makes you say that for one thing my gunthe one ernest gave meits gone it was a russian revolver i had it lying around the house somewhere and now i cant find it fredoalfredo lópez my lawyer friend has a friend in the police who told him that reles had been shot with a russian revolver it sort of made me wonder if dinah could have done it i was shaking my head i hardly liked to tell her that dinah had suspected that her own mother might be the murderer theres all that and theres the fact that she seemed to get over it so quickly like she wasnt in love with him at all i mean didnt it make any of those mafia guys suspicious that she wasnt at the funeral like she didnt care i think people thought she was probably too upset to go thats my point bernie she wasnt and this is why im worried if the mafia comes around to the opinion that she did have something to do with maxs murder then maybe theyll do something about it maybe theyll send someone after her i dont think it works like that noreen right now all theyre really concerned about is the possibility that max reles was killed by one of their own you see if it turns out that one of the other hotel and casino owners was behind the killing then there could be a gang war that would be very bad for business which is the last thing they want besides its me theyve asked to help find out who killed max the mob has asked you to investigate maxs murder in my capacity as a former homicide detective noreen shook her head why you i guess they think i can be objective independent more objective than the cuban militia dinahs nineteen years old noreen she strikes me as a lot of things as a selfish little bitch for one but shes not a murderer besides it takes a certain kind of person to climb over a wall eight floors up and shoot a man seven times in cold blood wouldnt you say noreen nodded and stared off into the distance she dropped her second cigarette on the ground half smoked and then lit a third something was still troubling her so you can rest assured im not about to lay the blame at dinahs door thanks i appreciate it she is a bitch youre right but shes mine and id do absolutely anything to keep her safe i know that i flicked my cigar at the fountain it hit one of the nymphs on her bare behind and fell into the water is that really what you wanted to tell me yes she said she thought for a moment but it wasnt everything youre right damn you she bit her knuckle i dont know why i ever try to deceive you there are times when i think you know me better than i know myself its always a possibility she threw the third cigarette away opened her bag took out a little matching handkerchief and blew her nose with it the other day she said when you were at the house and you saw fredo and me coming back from the beach at playa mayor i suppose you must have guessed that he and i have been seeing each other that weve become well intimate i try not to do too much guessing these days especially concerning things i know absolutely nothing about fredo likes you bernie he was very grateful to you the night of the pamphlets oh i know he told me himself you saved his life i didnt really appreciate it at the time or thank you properly what you did was very courageous she closed her eyes for a moment i didnt come to see you about dinah oh perhaps i just wanted to hear you reassure me that she couldnt have done it but id have known a mother knows that kind of thing she couldnt have hid that from me so what did you come to see me about its fredo hes been arrested by the simthe secret policeand accused of helping the former minister of education in the prío government aureliano sánchez arango to enter the country illegally and did he no of course not when he was arrested however he was with someone who is in the aaa thats the association of friends of aureliano its one of the leading opposition groups in cuba but fredos loyalty is to castro and the rebels on the isle of pines well im sure when he explains that theyll be happy to send him home noreen didnt share the joke this isnt funny she said they could still torture him in the hope that hell tell them where aureliano is hiding that would be doubly unfortunate because of course he doesnt know anything i agree but i really dont see what i can do you saved his life once bernie maybe you can do it again so lópez can have you instead of me is that what you want bernie what do you think i shrugged why not under the circumstances thats not so very strange or have you forgotten bernie it was twenty years ago im not the same woman i used to be surely you can see that life will do that to you sometimes can you do anything for him what makes you think thats even a possibility because you know captain sánchez people say that you and he are friends what people i shook my head exasperated look even if he was my friendand i am not at all sure about thatsánchez is militia and you said yourself that lópez has been arrested by the sim that means its nothing to do with the militia the man who arrested fredo was at the funeral of max reles said noreen lieutenant quevedo perhaps if you asked him captain sánchez would speak to lieutenant quevedo he could intercede and say what i dont know but you might think of something noreen its a hopeless case arent they the ones you used to be good at i shook my head and turned away you remember that letter i wrote to you when i left berlin not really it was a very long time ago like you said yes you do i called you my knight of heaven thats the plot of tannhäuser noreen not me i asked you always to seek the truth and to go to the aid of the people who needed your help because its the right thing to do and in spite of the fact that its dangerous im asking that now youve no right to ask it cant be done ive changed too in case you hadnt noticed i dont think so more than you could ever know knight of heaven you say i laughed more like knight of hell during the war i got drafted into the ss because i was a policeman did i tell you that my armors very dirty noreen you dont know how dirty you did what you had to do i expect but inside i think youre probably the same man you always were tell me this why should i look out for lópez ive got enough on my plate i cant help him and thats the truth so why should i even bother to try because thats what life is about noreen took my hand and searched my facefor what i dont know thats what life is about isnt it looking for the truth going to the aid of the people we dont think we can help but trying all the same i felt myself flush with anger youve got me confused with some kind of saint noreen the kind whos okay with being martyred as long as his halos straight in the photograph if im going to throw myself to the lions i want it to mean a lot more than just being remembered in some milkmaids prayers on a sunday morning i never was a man for a useless gesture thats how i stayed alive this long angel only theres more to it than that you talk about the truth like it means something but when you throw the truth in my face its just a couple of handfuls of sand its not the truth at all not the truth i want to hear anyway not from you so lets not fool ourselves eh i wont play the sucker for you noreen not until youre prepared to stop treating me like one noreen did an impersonation of a tropical fish that was all popping eyes and open mouth and then shook her head im sure i dont have the least idea of what youre talking about then she laughed an offkey laugh in my face and before i could say another word turned on her heel and walked quickly toward the parking lot i went back inside the tropicana the cellinis didnt give me much giving wasnt exactly their strong suit nor was answering questions old habits die hard i suppose they kept on telling me how sorry they were about the death of a great guy like max and how keen they were to cooperate with lanskys investigation and at the same time not having the first clue about anything i asked them if they had been asked capones christian name they would probably have shrugged and said they didnt know it probably even denied he had one it was late when i got home and captain sánchez was waiting for me hed helped himself to a drink and a cigar and was reading a book in my favorite armchair it seems im popular with all kinds of people these days i said people just drop in like this is some kind of club dont be like that said sánchez were friends you and i besides the lady let me in yara isnt it i glanced around the apartment for her but it was plain that shed already gone he shrugged apologetically i think i scared her off i expect youre used to that captain i should be at home myself but you know what they say crime doesnt keep office hours is that what they say another body has been found a man called irving goldstein at an apartment in vedado i never heard of him he was an employee of the hotel saratoga a pit boss in the casino i see i was hoping you might accompany me to the apartment you being a famous detective not to mention his employer in a manner of speaking sure why not i was only planning to go to bed and sleep for twelve hours excellent give me a minute to change will you i will wait for you downstairs señor the next morning i was awakened by the telephone it was robert freeman hed telephoned to offer me a sixmonth contract to open up the west german havana cigar market for j frankau however i dont think that hamburgs the right place to base yourself carlos he told me its my opinion that bonn would be better theres the fact that its the west german capital of course both houses of parliament are situated there not to mention all the government institutions and foreign embassies which is the kind of wellheeled market were looking for after all then theres the fact that its in the british zone of occupation were a british company so that should make things easier for us too plus bonn is only twenty miles from cologne one of the largest cities in germany all i knew about bonn was that it was the birthplace of beethoven and before the war that it had been the home of konrad adenauer the first chancellor of the federal republic of germany when berlin ceased being the capital of anything except the cold war and west germany needed a new capital adenauer had very conveniently for himself chosen the quiet little town where he had lived quietly throughout the years of the third reich as it happened id been to bonn just once by mistake but before few people had ever heard of bonn let alone known where it was and even today it was jokingly known as the federal village bonn was small bonn was insignificant and bonn was above all things a backwater and i wondered why i hadnt considered living there before for a man like me intent on living a life of complete anonymity it seemed perfect quickly i told freeman that bonn was fine by me and that i would begin to make travel arrangements to go there as soon as possible and freeman told me he would go about drawing up my allimportant business credentials i was going home after almost five years of exile i was going back to germany with money in my pocket i could hardly believe my luck there was that and the events of the previous evening at an apartment in vedado as soon as i was washed and dressed i drove to the national and went up to that big spacious suite on the executive floor to inform the lansky brothers that i had solved the reles case not that you could ever have really called it a case publicrelations exercise might have been a more accurate way of describing my investigation provided your idea of a public was all of the mobbedup casinos and hotels in havana you mean youve got a name meyers voice had the deepfried rich tone of an indian chief in a western jeff chandler maybe the little man had the same sort of inscrutable face too certainly the nose was exactly the same as before we sat on the balcony with the same ocean view except that now i could see the ocean as well as hear and smell it i was going to miss the grating roar of that ocean meyer wore a pair of gray gabardine trousers a matching cardigan a plain white sports shirt and thickframed sunglasses that made him look more like an accountant than a gangster jake was similarly informal he wore a loose terrycloth shirt and a bookmakers little straw stetson with a hatband that was as tight and narrow as his mouth and hovering in the background was the tall angular figure of vincent alo whom i now knew better as jimmy blue eyes alo wore gray flannels a white mohair cardigan with a wide collar and a patterned silk cravat the cardigan was bulky but not enough to hide the spare rib he was wearing under his arm he looked like anyones idea of an italian playboy as long as the play was a roman revenge tragedy written by seneca for the amusement of the emperor nero we were drinking coffee from little cups italian style pinkies out ive got a name i told them lets hear it irving goldstein the guy who killed himself goldstein had been a pit boss at the saratoga occupying a high chair over the craps table originally from miami he had trained as a croupier in several illegal gambling houses in tampa before his arrival in havana in april this followed the deportation from cuba of thirteen americanborn card dealers who were employees of the saratoga the sans souci the montmartre and tropicana casinos with the help of captain sánchez i searched his apartment in vedado last night and we found this i handed lansky a technical drawing and let him stare at it awhile goldstein had become involved with a man who was a female impersonator at the palette club its my information that before he died max had found out about it and not at all comfortable with goldsteins homosexuality he subsequently told him to look for a job at another casino the saratoga casino manager núñez confirmed that the two men argued about something not long before max died its my belief that this is what they argued about and that goldstein murdered max in revenge for his dismissal so he probably had the motive he almost certainly had the opportunity núñez told me that goldstein went on his break at around two am on the night of the murder and that he was away from the craps tables for about thirty minutes and your proof is this lansky brandished the sheet of paper i had given him im looking at it and i still dont know what the hell it is jake lansky handed the paper to his brother who stared at it uncomprehendingly as if it were the blueprint of a new missileguidance system thats a very accurate and precise drawing for a bramit silencer i said a custommade sound suppressor for the nagant revolver like i said before because of the nagants closed firing system what does that mean asked jake closed firing system all i know about guns is how to shoot them and even then they make me nervous especially then said meyer he shook his head i dont like guns what does it mean just this the nagant has a mechanism which as the hammer is cocked first turns the cylinder and then moves it forward closing the gap between the cylinder and the barrel that exists with every other model of revolver with this gap sealed the velocity is increased more important it makes the nagant the only weapon you can effectively silence during the war goldstein was in the army and afterward he was stationed in germany i imagine he must have swapped revolvers with a red army soldier a lot of men did and you think this faygele made the silencer himself is that what youre saying he was a homosexual mr lansky i said that doesnt mean he couldnt handle precision metalworking tools got that right muttered alo i shook my head the drawing was hidden in his bureau and to be honest i dont think im going to find any better proof than that meyer lansky nodded he fetched a pack of parliaments off the coffee table and lit one with a silver table lighter what do you think jake jake pulled a face bernies right proof is always hard to come by in these situations but that drawing sure looks like the next best thing as you yourself know only too well meyer the feds have made a case with a lot less besides if this guy goldstein did whack max then its one of ours and theres no debt to settle with anyone else hes a jew from the saratoga it keeps everything neat and tidy just the way we wanted frankly i dont see how we could have ended up with a better result business can proceed without any interruptions nothing is more important said meyer lansky howd he kill himself anyway asked vincent alo he opened his veins in a hot tub i said roman style i guess that makes a change from doggy style said alo meyer lansky winced it was plain he didnt much like that kind of joke yes but why he asked why kill himself with all due respect to you bernie hed got away with the murder hadnt he more or less so why do himself in his secret was safe i shrugged i spoke to some people at the palette club the whole point of the club is that some of the girls are real and some are cutjobs the clubs shtick is that you cant tell the difference it seems that in the beginning irving goldstein might have had the same problem that the girl he thought he fell in love with was in fact a man when he discovered the truth he tried to live with it which is when max found out about it some of the people at the palette think that the shame finally got to him i think that maybe he planned to kill himself but before he did he decided to get even with max who knows whats in the mind of a guy like that said alo confused or what meyer lansky nodded all right ill buy it youve done a good job gunther a nice quick result with no one offended i couldnt have ordered it better if i was in la zaragozana this was the name of a famous restaurant in old havana jimmy get this man his money he earned it vincent alo said sure meyer and went out of the suite you know gunther said lansky next year things are really going to take off for us here in havana we got this sweet new law coming the hotel law all new hotels are going to be granted taxexempt status which means theres going to be more money to be made on this island than anyone ever dreamed of im planning a new casino hotel myself which is going to be the biggest in the world outside of las vegas the riviera and i could use a man like you in a place like that until then id like you to come over to the montmartre and work for me there you can do the same thing you were going to do at the saratoga ill certainly give it some thought mr lansky vincents going to run the saratoga now vincent alo had returned to the balcony he was holding out a gamblers chip bag for high rollers he smiled but his blue eyes remained without emotion it was easy to see how hed earned his nickname jimmy blue eyes his eyes were as blue as the sea on the other side of the malecón and just as cold that doesnt look like twenty thousand dollars i said looks can be deceptive said alo he loosened the neck of the drawstring bag and took out a purple thousanddollar plaque there are nineteen more like this one in the bag you take this to the cash desk at the montmartre and theyll give you your money simple as that my kraut friend the neoclassical montmartre on p street and twentythird was just a short walk from the national formerly a dog track it occupied a whole block and was the only casino in havana open twentyfour hours a day it wasnt even lunchtime and the montmartre was already doing a brisk business at that early hour most of the gamblers were chinese but they usually are at any hour of the day and they couldnt have looked less interested in the evenings big midnight in paris stage show being announced on the casinos publicaddress system for me on the other hand europe already seemed a little nearer and more attractive as i walked away from the cash window with forty pictures of president william mckinley and the only reason i hadnt turned lanskys offer of a fulltime job down flat was that i hardly wanted to tell him i was leaving the country that might have made him suspicious instead i was hoping to deposit my money with the rest of what id saved in the royal bank of canada and then armed with my new credentials leave cuba as soon as possible i felt a spring in my step as i went back through the gates of the national hotel to get the car i was planning to give yara as my leavingher present i hadnt felt quite so optimistic about my prospects since being reunited with my late wife kirsten in vienna during september of so optimistic that i felt i might even go see captain sánchez and discover if there wasnt something i could do for noreen eisner and alfredo lópez after all at the end of the day optimism is nothing more than a naive and i llinformed hope the capitolio was built in the style of the united states capitol in washington dc by the dictator machado but it was too big for an island the size of cuba it would have been too big for an island the size of australia inside the rotunda was a seventeenmeterhigh statue of jupiter which looked a lot like an academy award and certainly most of the tourists who visited the capitolio seemed to think it was a good picture now that i was planning to leave cuba i was thinking i might have to take a few photographs of my own so that i could remind myself of what i was missing when i was living in bonn and going to bed at nine oclock at night what else is there to do in bonn at nine oclock at night if beethoven had lived in havanaespecially if hed lived around the corner from the casa marinaits almost certain hed have been lucky to write just one string quartet let alone sixteen of them but you could live all your life in bonn and not even notice that you were deaf the police station on zulueta was a few minutes walk from the capitolio but i didnt mind the walk only a few months before outside the police station in vedado a havana university professor had been killed by a car bomb when rebels had mistaken his black hudson for an identical model driven by the deputy head of the cuban bureau of investigations ever since i had been careful never to leave my chevrolet styleline outside a police station the station itself was an old colonial building with a peeling white stucco facade and louvered green shutters on the windows a cuban flag hung limply over the square portico like a brightly decorated beach towel that had fallen from one of the upperfloor windows on the outside the drains didnt smell so good on the inside you barely noticed it as long as you didnt breathe in sánchez was on the second floor in an office overlooking a small park there was a flag on a pole in the corner and on the wall a picture of batista facing a cabinet full of rifles in case the paradeground patriotism of the flag and the picture didnt pay off there was a small cheap wooden desk and a lot of space around it if you had a tapeworm the walls and ceiling were dustbowl beige and the brown linoleum on the warped floor resembled the shell of a dead tortoise an expensive rosewood humidor that belonged on a presidential sideboard sat on the desk like a fabergé egg in a plastic picnic set you know it was quite a stroke of luck me finding that drawing said sánchez theres an element of luck in most police work not to mention your murderer being dead already any objections how could there be you solve the case and at the same time you take the loose ends and make a bow now thats what i call detective work yes indeed i can see why lansky thought you were the man for the case a real nero wolfe you say all that like you think i chalked him up for it like a tailor now youre being cruel ive never been to a tailor in my life not on my salary i own a nice linen guayabera and thats about it for anything more formal i usually wear my best uniform is that the one without the bloodstains now youre confusing me with lieutenant quevedo im glad you mentioned him captain sánchez shook his head such a thing is not possible no one with ears is ever glad to hear the name of lieutenant quevedo where might i find him you do not find lieutenant quevedo not if you had any sense he finds you surely he cant be that elusive i saw him at the funeral remember its his natural habitat a tall man buzzcut hair with a sort of cleancut face for a cuban what i mean is there was something vaguely american about his face its as well we only see the faces of men and not their hearts dont you think anyway you said that i was working not just for lansky but also for quevedo and so did i say that perhaps how shall we describe someone like meyer lansky the man is as slippery as chopped pineapple but quevedo is something else we have a saying here in the militia god made us and we wonder at it but more especially in the case of lieutenant quevedo mentioning him to you as i did at the funeral i intended only to make you aware of him as i would perhaps draw your attention to a venomous snake so that you could avoid him your warning is noted im relieved to hear it but id still like to speak to him about what i wonder he shrugged and ignoring the expensive humidor lit a cigarette thats my business in point of fact no its not sánchez smiled certainly it is the business of señor lópez perhaps in the circumstances it is also the business of señora eisner but your business señor hausner no i dont think so now its you who looks like chopped pineapple captain perhaps thats only to be expected you see i graduated from law school in september two of my contemporaries at university were fidel castro ruz and alfredo lópez unlike fidel alfredo and i were politically illiterate in those days the university was closely tied to the government of grau san martín and i was convinced that i might help to effect democratic change in our police force by becoming a policeman myself of course fidel thought differently but after batistas coup in march i decided i was probably wasting my time and resolved to be less strenuous in my defense of the regime and its institutions i would try to be a good policeman only and not an instrument of dictatorship does that make sense señor strangely enough it does to me anyway of course this isnt as easy as it might sound i know that too i have had to make compromises with myself on more than one occasion i have even thought of leaving the militia but it was alfredo who persuaded me that perhaps i might do more good by remaining a policeman i nodded it was i he continued who informed noreen eisner that alfredo had been arrested and by whom she asked me what was to be done and i told her i could think of nothing but as im sure you know she is not a woman who gives up easily and aware that you and she were old friends i suggested that she ask you to help her me why on earth would you say that the suggestion was not entirely serious i was exasperated with her its true i must confess i was also exasperated with you exasperated and yes a little jealous of you too jealous of me why on earth should you be jealous of me captain sánchez shifted on his chair and smiled sheepishly a number of reasons he said the way you solved this case the faith that meyer lansky seems to have in your abilities the nice apartment on malecón your car your money lets not forget that yes i freely admit it i was jealous of you but i am not so very jealous that i would let you do this thing that you are thinking of because i must also freely admit that i like you hausner and i couldnt in all conscience allow you to put your head into the lions mouth he shook his head i told her i was not serious about this suggestion but evidently she did not believe me and spoke to you herself maybe ive put my head in a lions mouth before i said maybe but this isnt the same lion all lions are different were friends right yes i think so but fidel used to say you shouldnt trust someone merely because he is a friend its good advice you should remember that i nodded oh sure and believe me i know looking out for number one is usually what i do best im an expert in survival but from time to time i get this stupid urge to do a good turn for someone someone like your friend alfredo lópez its been a while since i did anything as selfless as something like that i see at least i begin to think i do you think that by helping him youll be helping her is that it something like that perhaps and what do you think you can tell a man like quevedo that might persuade him to release lópez thats between me and him and what i rather quaintly used to call my conscience sánchez sighed i did not take you for a romantic but that is what you are i think you forgot the word fool didnt you but its more what the french call existential than that after all these years i still havent quite admitted my own insignificance i still believe what i do makes a difference absurd isnt it ive known alfredo lópez since said sánchez hes a decent enough fellow but i fail to see how noreen eisner prefers him to a man like you maybe thats what i want to prove to her anything is possible i suppose i dont know maybe he is a better man than me no just a younger one the sim building in the center of marianao looked like something out of beau gestea white twostory comicbook fort wherein you might have discovered a company of dead legionnaires propped up along the blue castellated rooftop it was a strange building to find in an area otherwise given over to schools and hospitals and comfortablelooking bungalows i parked a few streets away and walked along to the entrance where a dog was lying on the grass shoulder dogs sleeping on the streets of havana were neater and tidier about the way they did this than any dogs i had seen before as if they were keen not to get in anyones way some were so neat and tidy about how they slept on the street that they looked dead but you stroked any of them at your peril cuba was the very welldeserved home of the expression let sleeping dogs lie it was good advice for everyone and everything if only i had taken it inside the heavy wooden door i gave my name to an equally sleepylooking soldier and having delivered my request to see lieutenant quevedo i waited in front of another portrait of fb the one with him wearing the uniform with the lampshade epaulettes and a catthathadallthecream smile knowing what i now knew about his share of casino money i thought he probably had a lot to smile about when i had tired of being inspired by the selfsatisfied face of the cuban president i went to a big window and stared out at a parade ground where several armored cars were parked looking at them i found it hard to see how castro and his rebels had ever thought they stood a chance against the cuban army finally i was greeted by a tall man in a beige uniform with gleaming leather buttons teeth and sunglasses he looked dressed up for a portrait of his own señor hausner im lieutenant quevedo would you come this way please i followed him upstairs and while we walked lieutenant quevedo talked he had an easy way about him and seemed different from the picture captain sánchez had painted of the man we came along a corridor that looked as if it could be a life magazine pictorial biography of the little president fb in sergeants uniform fb with president grau fb wearing a trench coat and accompanied by a trio of afrocuban bodyguards fb and several of his top generals fb wearing a hilariously outsized officers cap making a speech fb sitting in a car with franklin d roosevelt fb gracing the cover of time magazine fb with harry truman and finally fb with dwight d eisenhower as if the armored cars werent enough for the rebels to deal with there were the americans too not to mention three american presidents we call this our wall of heroes quevedo said jokingly as you can see we have only the one hero some people call him a dictator but if he is then hes a very popular one it seems to me i halted momentarily in front of the time magazine cover i had a copy of the same magazine somewhere in my apartment there was a critical remark about batista on my copy that was absent from this one but i couldnt remember what it was youre wondering where the title went perhaps observed quevedo and what it said was i of course you were quevedo smiled benignly it said cubas batista he got past democracys sentries which is something of an exaggeration for example in cuba there are no restrictions on freedom of speech or freedom of the press or freedom of religion the congress can override any legislation or refuse to pass what he wants passed there arent any generals in his cabinet is this really what dictatorship means can one really compare our president to a stalin or a hitler i dont think so i didnt reply what he said reminded me of something i myself had said at noreens dinner party and yet in quevedos mouth it sounded somehow less than convincing he opened the door to an enormous office there was a big mahogany desk a radio with a vase on top another smaller desk with a typewriter on it and a television set that was switched on but had the sound turned down a baseball game was in progress and on the walls were pictures not of batista but ballplayers such as antonio castaño and guillermo willie miranda there wasnt much on the desk a pack of trend a taperecording machine a couple of highball glasses with american flags embossed on their outsides a magazine with a picture of mambo dance star ana gloria varona on the cover quevedo waved me to a seat in front of the desk and folding his arms sat on the edge and looked down at me as if i were some kind of student who had brought him a problem naturally i know who you are he said and i believe im right in thinking that the unfortunate murder of señor reles has now been satisfactorily explained yes thats right and are you here on señor lanskys account or on your own my own i know youre a busy man lieutenant so ill come straight to the point you have a prisoner named alfredo lópez here is that correct yes i was hoping i might persuade you to let him go his friends assure me that he has had nothing to do with arango and your interest in lópez is what exactly hes a lawyer as you know as a lawyer he did me a good service thats all i was hoping to be able to return the favor very commendable even lawyers need representation you were talking about democracy and freedom of speech i feel much the same way as you lieutenant so im just here to help prevent a miscarriage of justice im certainly not a supporter of dr castro and his rebels quevedo nodded castro is a natural criminal some of the newspapers compare him to robin hood but i myself dont see it the man is quite ruthless and dangerous like all communists probably he has been a communist since when he was still a student but in his heart hes worse than a communist hes a communist and a natural autocrat hes a stalinist im sure i agree with you lieutenant i certainly have no desire to see this country collapse into communism i despise all communists im pleased to hear it as i said im hoping to do lópez a good turn is all it just happens that i might be able to do you a good turn too a quid pro quo so to speak maybe quevedo grinned well now im intrigued he collected the pack of trend off the desk and lit one of the little cigars it seemed almost unpatriotic to smoke such a diminutive cigar please do go on according to what i read in the newspapers the moncada barracks rebels were poorly armed shotguns a few m rifles a thompson a boltaction springfield thats quite correct most of our efforts are directed toward preventing expresident prío from getting arms to the rebels so far weve been very successful in the last couple of years weve seized over one million dollars worth of arms what if i was to tell you the location of an arms cache that contains everything from grenades to a beltfed machine gun i should say that it was your duty as a guest in my country to tell me where those arms can be found he sucked on the little cigar for a moment then i should also say that i could certainly arrange for your friend to be freed immediately once the arms cache is found but might i inquire how it is you come to know about these weapons a while ago i was driving my car in el calvario it was late the road was dark id probably had a little too much to drink and i was certainly driving too fast i lost control of my car and skidded off the road at first i thought i had a flat or a broken axle and i got out to take a look with a flashlight in fact my tires had churned up a lot of dirt and broken through some wooden planks that were covering up something buried underneath i lifted one plank shone the flashlight inside and saw a box of mark fhgs and a browning m probably there was a whole lot more only i didnt figure it was safe to stay there for very long so i covered the boards with earth again and marked the spot with some stones so that i could find it anyway last night i went to check and the stones hadnt been moved which leads me to suppose that the cache is still there why didnt you report this at the time i certainly intended to lieutenant but by the time i got back home i decided that if i told the authorities someone might get the idea that there was a lot more to tell than ive told you and i lost my nerve quevedo shrugged there doesnt seem to be much thats wrong with your nerves now dont be too sure of that inside my stomach is turning over like a washing machine but as i told you i owe lópez a favor hes a lucky man to have a friend like you thats for him to say true well do we have a trade youll take us to where this arms cache is hidden i nodded then yes we have a trade but how shall we do this he stood up and walked around his office thoughtfully lets see now i know well take lópez with us and if the weapons are where you say they are then you can take him with you as simple as that do you agree yes all right ill need a little time to organize everything why dont you wait in here and watch the television while i go and set things up do you like baseball not particularly i cant relate to it in real life there are no third chances quevedo shook his head its a cops game believe me ive thought about it you see when you hit something with a club it changes everything then he went out i picked up the magazine on the desk and got a little better acquainted with ana gloria varona she was a little bombshell type with a backside for cracking walnuts and a large chest that was crying out for a childsized sweater when i had finished admiring her i tried to watch the baseball but i figured it was one of those curious sports in which the history is obviously more important than the game after a while i closed my eyes which usually takes some doing in a police station quevedo came back about twenty minutes later alone and carrying a briefcase he raised his eyebrows and looked at me expectantly shall we go i followed him downstairs alfredo lópez was standing between two soldiers in the entrance hall but only just he was filthy and unshaven and had two black eyes except that wasnt the worst of it both his hands were freshly bandaged which made the manacles on his wrists look pointless seeing me he tried to smile only the effort was probably too much for him and he almost fainted the two soldiers grabbed him by the elbows and held him up like the accused at some sort of show trial i wanted to ask quevedo about his hands and then changed my mind anxious not to say or do anything that might prevent me from achieving what i had set out to do but i had little doubt that lópez had been tortured quevedo was still being pleasant do you have a car its a gray chevrolet styline i said im parked just down the street ill drive back here and then you can follow me quevedo looked pleased excellent to el calvario you say i nodded havana traffic being what it is if we are separated we shall meet at the local post office very well one more thing the smile turned wintry if this is some kind of trap if this has been an elaborate hoax to lure me out into the open and have me assassinated its not a trap i said then the first person to be shot will be our friend here he tapped the holster on his belt with meaning in any event i shall shoot you both if the weapons cache is not where you say it is the weapons are there all right i said and youre not going to be assassinated lieutenant people like you and me are never assassinated were murdered pure and simple its the batistas and trumans and king abdullahs of this world who get themselves assassinated so take it easy relax because this is your lucky day youre about to do something thatll make you a captain so maybe you should ride that luck and buy a lottery ticket or a number on the bolita if it comes to that maybe we should both buy a number it was probably just as well that i didnt with one eye on my rearview mirror and the army car tailing me i drove east through the new tunnel underneath the almendares river and then south through santa catalina and vibora along the central divider of the boulevard city gardeners were trimming trees into the shape of bells only none of them was going off in my head i was still telling myself that i could get away with making a deal with the devil id done it before after all and with many worse devils than lieutenant quevedo heydrich for one goering for another they didnt come any more devilish than them but no matter how smart you think you are theres always something unexpected that you have to be prepared for i thought i was prepared for anything except the one thing that happened it got a little warmer warmer than on the north coast and most of the houses here were owned by people with money you could tell they were people with money because they were also people with big gates on their big houses you could tell how much money a man had by the height of the white walls and the amount of iron on his black gates a set of imposing gates was an advertisement for a ready supply of wealth for confiscation and redistribution if the communists ever reached havana they wouldnt have to look hard for the best people to steal money from you didnt have to be clever to be a communist not when the rich made it as easy as this when i reached mantilla i turned south on managua which was a poorer more downatheel district and followed the road until i came upon the main highway going west toward santa maría del rosario you could tell the neighborhood was poorer and more downatheel because children and goats wandered freely by the side of the road and men were carrying machetes with which to work in the surrounding plantations when i saw the disused tennis court and the dilapidated villa with the rusted gate i held the steering wheel tight and rode the bump as i turned the chevrolet off the road and through the trees as i hit the brakes the car bucked like a rodeo bull and made more dust than an exodus from egypt i switched off the engine and sat there doing nothing my hands clasped behind my head just in case the lieutenant was the nervous type i hardly wanted to get shot reaching for my pocket humidor the army car pulled up behind me and the two soldiers got out followed by quevedo lópez stayed put in the rear seat he wasnt going anywhere except maybe the hospital i leaned out of my window and closing my eyes pushed my face into the sun for a moment and listened to the engine block cool when i opened them again the two soldiers had fetched shovels from the trunk of the car and were awaiting instructions i pointed in front of us see those three white rocks i said dig in the center i closed my eyes again momentarily but this time i was praying that everything was going to work out the way i had hoped quevedo came toward the chevrolet he was carrying his briefcase he opened the front passenger door and slid in beside me then he wound down the window but it wasnt enough to spare me the smell of his pungent cologne for a moment we sat watching the two soldiers shoveling dirt not saying anything at all mind if i turn on the radio i said reaching for the knob i think youll find i have more than enough conversation to keep your attention he said ominously he took off his cap and rubbed his buzzcut head it sounded like someone polishing a shoe then he grinned and there was humor in his grin but i didnt like the look of it did i tell you i trained with the cia in miami we both knew that it wasnt really a question few of his questions were most of the time they were meant to be unsettling or he already knew the answers yes i was there for six months last summer have you ever been to miami its probably the least interesting place you could ever hope to see its like havana without a soul anyway thats neither here nor there and now that im back here one of my functions is to liaise with the agencys chief of station here in havana as you can probably imagine us foreign policy is driven by a fear of communism a justifiable fear i might add given the political loyalties of lópez and his friends on the isle of pines so the agency is planning to help us set up a new anticommunist intelligence bureau next year just what the island needs i said more secret police tell me how will the new anticommunist intelligence bureau differ from the current one good question well well have more money from the americans of course lots more money thats always a good start the new bureau will also be trained equipped and tasked directly by the cia to identify and repress only communist activities as opposed to the sim which exists to eliminate all forms of political opposition this is the democracy you were talking about right no youre quite wrong to be sarcastic about this insisted quevedo the new bureau will be commanded directly by the greatest democracy in the world so that ought to count for something surely and of course it goes without saying that international communism isnt exactly known for its own toleration of opposition to some extent you have to fight like with like id have thought you of all people would understand and appreciate that señor hausner lieutenant i meant what i said when i told you i have no desire to see this country turn red but thats all i meant my name is not senator joseph mccarthy its carlos hausner quevedos smile widened i imagine he could have done a pretty good imitation of a snake at a childrens party if ever any children had been allowed near a man like quevedo yes lets talk about that shall we your name i mean it isnt carlos hausner any more than you are or ever were a citizen of argentina is it i started to speak but he closed his eyes as if he wouldnt hear of being contradicted and patted the briefcase on his lap no really i know quite a bit about you its all in here i have a copy of the cias file on you gunther you see its not just cuba where theres a new spirit of cooperation with the united states its argentina too the cia is just as keen to prevent the growth of communism in that country as it is here in cuba because the argentines have their own rebels just as we do why only last year the communists exploded two bombs in the main square of buenos aires killing seven people but im getting ahead of myself here when meyer lansky told me about your background in german intelligence fighting russian communism during the war i must confess i was fascinated and decided to find out more selfishly i wondered if we might be able to make use of you in our own war on communism so i contacted the agency chief and asked him to check with his opposite number in buenos aires to see what they could tell us about you and they told us a great deal it appears that your real name is bernhard gunther and that you were born in berlin there you were first a policeman then something in the ss and finally something in german military intelligencethe abwehr the cia checked you out with the central registry of war criminals and security suspectscrowcassand also the berlin document center and while theres no record of your being wanted for any war crimes it does seem that theres a warrant out on you from the police in vienna for the murders of those two unfortunate women there seemed little point in denying what hed said even though i hadnt murdered anyone in vienna but i thought i might explain it away to his political satisfaction after the war i said and because of my experience fighting the russians i was recruited by american counterintelligence first by the th cic in germany and then the th in austria as im sure youre aware the cic was the forerunner of the cia anyway i was instrumental in uncovering a traitor in their organization a man named john belinsky who turned out to have been working for the russian mvd this would have been in september the two women were much later on that was in one of them i killed because she was the wife of a notorious war criminal the other was a russian agent the americans will probably deny it now of course but they were the ones who got me out of austria on the ratline they provided for escaping nazis they provided me with a red cross passport in the name of carlos hausner and got me on the boat to argentina where for a while i worked for the secret police the side at least i did until the job i was on turned into an embarrassment for the government and i became persona non grata they fixed me up with an argie passport and some visas which is how i fetched up here since then ive been trying to keep out of troubles way theres no doubt about it youve had an interesting life i nodded confucius used to think so i said whats that nothing ive been living here quietly since but recently i bumped into an old acquaintance max reles who knowing my background with the berlin criminal police offered me a job i was going to take it too until he got himself killed by now lansky knew something of my background as well and when max got himself killed he asked me to look over the shoulder of the local militia well you dont say no to meyer lansky not in this town and now here we are but i really dont see how i can help you lieutenant quevedo there was a shout from one of the soldiers digging in front of us the man threw down his shovel knelt down for a moment peered into the ground straightened and then gave us a sign that he had found what they were looking for i pointed at them i mean beyond the help ive already given you with this arms cache for which i am very grateful as soon ill prove to your satisfaction señor gunther i may call you that may i not it is your name after all no i want something else something quite different dont get me wrong this is good this is very good but i want something more enduring let me explain its my understanding that lansky has offered you a job working for him no thats not quite the truth its rather more than an understanding as a matter of fact it was my ideathat he offer you a job thanks dont mention it i imagine hell pay well lansky is a generous man for him this is simply good business you get what you pay for hes a gambler of course and like most intelligent gamblers he dislikes uncertainty if he cant have certainty hell do the next best thing and hedge his bet which is where you come in you see my employers would like to know if and when he tries to hedge his bet on batista by offering the reds financial support you want me to spy on him is that it exactly so how difficult can this be for a man such as yourself lansky is a jew after all spying on a jew should be second nature to a nazi there seemed to be no point in arguing with that and in return in return we agree not to deport you to austria to face those murder charges you also get to keep whatever lansky pays you you know i had been planning a short trip home to germany to take care of some family business i regret that will no longer be possible after all if you left what guarantee could we have that you would ever return and we would have lost this excellent chance to spy on lansky incidentally for your sake it might be best if you didnt report our conversation to your new employer with this man people whose loyalties are in any way questionable have a dreadful habit of disappearing señor waxman for example almost certainly lansky had this man killed it would be no different for you i think he is the kind of man for whom the saying better safe than sorry is a way of life and who can blame him for being so cautious after all he has millions invested in havana and its certain he wont allow anything to get in the way of that not you not me not even the president himself all he wants to do is keep on making money and it makes little or no difference to him and his friends if he does it under one regime or another this is fantasy i insisted surely lanskys not going to help the communists why not quevedo shrugged now youre just being stupid gunther and youre not a stupid man look here it might interest you to know that according to the cia in the last american presidential election lansky gave a substantial donation to both the republicans who won and the democrats who lost that way whoever won would be sure to be grateful to him thats what im getting do you see you cant put a price on political influence lansky knows this only too well as i say its just good business id do the same in his shoes besides i already know that max reles secretly paid money to the families of some of the moncada rebels how do i know this lópez volunteered the information i looked back at the other car lópez was asleep in the backseat then again maybe he wasnt asleep at all the sun was shining directly on his unshaven face he looked like a dead christ volunteered you think i believe that eventually i could not stop him from telling me things you see i had already pulled out every one of his fingernails you bastard come now thats my job and perhaps a long time ago it was yours too in the ss who can say not you ill bet im sure that with a bit more digging we could find some dirty secrets of your own my nazi friend but thats of no interest to me what i should like to know now is if reles gave this money with the knowledge of lansky and i should very much like to know if ever he does the same thing himself youre crazy i said castro got fifteen years the revolutions a toothless lion with him behind bars and if it comes to that so am i youre wrong on both counts about castro that is he has plenty of friends powerful friends in the police in our judicial system even in government you doubt me i can tell but did you know that the army officer who captured castro after the moncada barracks attack also saved his life that the court which tried him in santiago allowed the man to make a twohour speech in his own defense that ramón hermida our present minister of justice made sure that instead of keeping castro separate from all the other prisoners as was the armys recommendation they were all sent to the isle of pines where theyve been allowed books and writing materials and hermida is not the only one in government who is a friend to this criminal there are already those in the senate and the house of representatives who speak of amnesty tellaheche rodríguez agüero amnesty i ask you in almost any other country such a man as this would have been shot and deservedly so i tell you this quite frankly my friend that i will be surprised if dr castro serves more than five years in jail yes hes a lucky man but you need more than good fortune to be as lucky as him you need friends and this leopard does not change his spots the day castro is released from prison is the day that the revolution begins in earnest but i for one hope to prevent this from ever happening he lit a little cigar what nothing to say i thought you would need more persuasion i thought you would need documentary evidence that i know your real identity but now i can see i neednt have bothered bringing the briefcase i know who i am lieutenant i dont need anyone to prove it not even you cheer up its not like youll be spying for nothing and there are worse places to be than havana especially for a man as comfortably off as you but youre mine now is that quite clear lansky will think you are his but youll report to me once a week well arrange to meet somewhere nice and quiet the casa marina perhaps you like it there i believe we can choose a room where we wont be disturbed and everyone will think that we are spending time with some obliging little whore yes youll jump when i tell you to jump and squeak when i tell you to squeak and maybe when youre old and graythat is to say older and grayer than you are nowill let you crawl back under your stone like the nasty little nazi you are but listen you cross me just once and i promise that youll be on the first plane back to vienna with a rope under your ear which is very probably what you deserve i took all of that without a word he had me cold like i was a billfish hanging by my tail over the pier at barloventos having my photograph taken and not just any billfish a billfish that had been heading home when it got itself hauled out of the gulf on a rod and reel i hadnt even managed to put up much of a fight but i wanted to more than that i badly wanted to kill quevedo now even assassinate himyes i was more than happy to give him an operasized death just as long as i could pull the trigger on that smug bastard and his smugbastard smile i glanced across at the army car and saw that lópez had recovered a little and was staring straight back at me probably wondering what kind of a lousy deal i had made to save his lousy skin or maybe it was quevedo he was looking at possibly lópez was hoping he might get a chance to pull a trigger on the lieutenant himself just as soon as he had grown some new fingernails he had more right to do it than i did too my hatred of the young lieutenant was only getting started lópez had a good head start on me in that respect lópez closed his eyes again and laid his head on the seat the two soldiers were pulling a box out of a hole in the ground it was time to leave if we were allowed quevedo was just the type to break a deal just because he could and there would be nothing that i could do about it either i had always known that was a possibility and had figured it was worth the risk after all it wasnt my weapons cache but i hadnt figured on quevedo turning me into his pet informer already i hated myself more than i already hated myself i bit my lip for a moment and then said all right i kept my end of the deal this deal the arms cache for lópez so how about it are you going to let him go like you agreed ill be your dirty little spy quevedo but only if you keep your end of this dyou hear you keep your word or you can send me back to vienna and be damned that was a brave speech he said i admire you for it no really i do one day in the future when youre feeling a little less emotional about this you can tell me all about being a policeman in hitlers germany im sure id be fascinated to find out more and understand what it must have been like ive always been interested in history who knows maybe well discover that we have something in common he raised a forefinger as if hed only just thought of something one thing i really dont understand why you ever wanted to stick your neck out for a man like alfredo lópez believe me im asking myself the same question quevedo smiled a smile of disbelief i dont buy that not for a moment when we were driving over here from marianao just now i asked him about you and he told me that before today hed only met you three times in his life twice at the home of ernest hemingway and once at his office and he said it was you who did him a good turn not the other way around before today that is that you got him out of a tight spot once before he didnt say what that was and frankly ive already asked him so many questions i didnt feel like pursuing the matter besides he has no more fingernails to lose he shook his head so why why help him again not that its any of your damn business but lópez gave me a reason to believe in myself again what reason nothing you would understand i hardly understand it myself but it was enough to make me want to carry on in the hope that my life might mean something i must have misjudged him i took him for a deluded fool but you make him sound like some kind of saint every man finds his redemption where and when he can one day perhaps when youre where i am now youll remember that i drove alfredo lópez back to finca vigía he was in bad shape but i didnt know where the nearest hospital was and neither did he i owe you my life gunther he said and a great deal of thanks forget it you dont owe me anything but please dont ask me why im through explaining myself for one day that bastard quevedo has an annoying habit of asking questions youd rather not answer lópez smiled dont i know it of course im sorry it was nothing compared to what you must have been through i could use a cigarette i kept a pack of luckies in the glove box at the junction of the road north into san francisco de paula i pulled up and put one in his mouth here i said finding a match and lighting it he puffed for a moment and nodded his thanks let me do that for you i fetched the cigarette from his lips just dont expect me to come into the bathroom with you i put the cigarette back in his mouth and drove on we reached the house there had been a strong wind the previous night and some of the ceiba trees leaves and branches were strewn across the steps in front of the house a tall negro was picking them up and putting them in a wheelbarrow but he might just as easily have been putting them on the ground as if someone had ordered the man to honor lópezs return with a carpet of palms either way he was making slow work of it like hed just got two numbers on the bolita whos that asked lópez the gardener i said i pulled up next to the pontiac and switched off the engine yes of course for a moment he grunted the previous gardener committed suicide you know drowned himself in the well i guess that explains why no one here seems to drink water very much noreen thinks theres a ghost no that would be me i looked at him and frowned can you make it up the steps i might need a bit of help you should be in a hospital thats what i kept on telling quevedo but by then hed stopped listening to me that was after he gave me the free manicure i got out of the car and slammed the door around there that was like ringing the doorbell i went around to the passengers side and opened the door for him he was going to need a lot of that in the coming days and i was already imagining myself driving away again leaving her to it id done enough if he wanted to scratch the back of his head noreen could do it she came out of the front door as lópez stepped out of the car and swayed like a drunk who still had room for more gingerly he held on to the window pillar for a moment with the inside of his wrists and then put his spine into a smile for noreen as she hurried down the steps his lips parted and the cigarette he was still smoking fell onto his shirtfront i grabbed the cigarette like the shirt actually mattered it was a sure thing he wouldnt be wearing it to the office again lots of blood on sweatstained white cotton was hardly fashionable that year fredo she said anxiously are you all right my god what has happened to your hands the cops were expecting horowitz at their annual fundraiser i said lópez smiled but noreen wasnt amused i dont see what there is to joke about bernie she said really i dont you had to be there i guess look when youve finished getting stiff with me your legal friend here deserves to be in a hospital id have driven him to one myself but fredo insisted we drive here first and convince you that hes all right i guess he rates you a higher priority than playing the piano again thats quite understandable of course i feel much the same way noreen wasnt listening to most of that she retuned her wavelength the moment i said hospital she said theres one in cotorro ill take him there myself hop in and ill drive you no youve done enough was it very difficult getting him out of police custody a little more difficult than putting a request in the suggestion box and it was the army that had him not the police look why dont you wait in the house make yourself at home fix yourself a drink ask ramón to make you something to eat if you want i wont be long i really ought to be running along after the events of this morning i feel a pressing need to renew all my insurance policies bernie please i want to thank you properly and speak to you about something all right i can put up with that i watched her drive him away and then went inside and flirted with the drinks trolley but i was in no mood to play hardtoget with hemingways bourbon and swallowed a glass of old forester in less time than it took to pour with another large one waiting in my hand i took a tour of the house and tried to ignore the obvious comparison between my own situation and that of a trophy on hemingways wall id been bagged by lieutenant quevedo just as surely as if id been shot with an express rifle and germany now looked about as far away to me as the snows of kilimanjaro or the green hills of africa one of the rooms was full of packing cases and suitcases and for one stomachchurning moment i thought she might be leaving cuba until i realized that noreen was probably getting ready to move into her new house in marianao after a while and another drink i walked outside and climbed the fourstory tower it wasnt difficult a halfcovered staircase on the outside went right up to the top there was a bath on the first floor and some cats playing cards on the second the third floor was where all the rifles were kept in locked glass cabinets and the way i was feeling it was probably just as well i hadnt brought any keys the uppermost story was furnished with a small desk and a large library full of military books i stayed there for a long while i didnt much care for hemingways taste in literature but there was no arguing with the view max reles would have liked it a lot from each of the windows the view was all you could see for miles around right up until the moment that the light began to fade and then some when just a ribbon of orange was left over the trees i heard a car and saw the pontiacs headlights and the little chieftains head coming back up the drive when noreen got out of the car she was alone by the time i had descended the tower she was in the house and fixing herself a drink with a bottle of cinzano vermouth and some tonic water hearing my footsteps she said freshen your glass ill help myself i said coming over to the little table she turned away as i came alongside her i heard a little peal of ice cubes as she upended the tall glass and swallowed the frozen contents theyre keeping him in for observation she said good idea those fucking bastards pulled out all his fingernails without lópez around to see the funny side of that i was through making jokes about it i hardly wanted noreen getting sharp with me again id had enough of that for one day i just wanted to sit down in an armchair and have her stroke my head if only to remind me that it was still on my shoulders and not hanging on anyones wall i know they told me the army it certainly wasnt the red cross that did it she was wearing navy blue slacks and a matching bouclé cardigan the slacks werent particularly slack in the only place it counted and the cardigan seemed to be short a couple of little plaited leather buttons on the lower slopes of her bosom her hand sported a sapphire that was the bigger sister of the two in her earlobes the shoes were dark brown leather as were the belt around her waist and the handbag she had tossed onto an armchair noreen had always been good at matching things it was only me that seemed to clash with the rest of her she looked awkward and ill at ease thanks she said for what you did i didnt do it for you no and i think i can understand why but thank you anyway im sure its the most courageous thing ive heard of since i came to cuba dont tell me that i feel bad enough already she shook her head why i dont understand you at all because it makes me sound like what im not in spite of what you once thought angel i was never cut out to be a hero if i was anything like the person you think i am i wouldnt have lasted half as long as i have id be dead in some ukrainian field or forgotten forever in some stinking russian prison camp not to mention what happened before all that in those comparatively innocent times when people thought the nazis were the last word in true evil you tell yourself you can put aside your principles and make a pact with the devil just to keep out of trouble and remain alive but you do it often enough and it gets so that youve forgotten what those principles were i used to think i could stand apart from it all that i could somehow inhabit a nasty rotten world and not become like that myself but i found out that you cant not if you want to see another year well im still alive im still alive because if the truth be told im just as bad as the rest of them im alive because other people are dead and some of them were killed by me thats not courage thats just this i pointed at the antelope head on the wall he understands what im talking about even if you dont the law of the jungle kill or be killed noreen shook her head nonsense she said youre talking nonsense that was war it was kill or be killed thats what war is and it was ten years ago lots of men feel the way you do about what they did in the war youre being much too hard on yourself she took hold of me and put her head on my chest i wont let you say those things about yourself bernie youre a good man i know it she looked up at me wanting me to kiss her i stood there letting her hold me tight i didnt pull away or push her off i didnt kiss her either although i badly wanted to instead i grinned at her tauntingly what about fredo lets not talk about him right now ive been stupid bernie i can see that now i should have been honest with you from the beginning youre not really a killer she hesitated her eyes were filling with tears are you i love you noreen even after all these years i didnt know it myself until quite recently i love you but i cant lie to you a man who really wanted to have you would do that i think lie to you i mean hed say anything to get you back at all costs im certain of it well i cant do it there has to be someone in this world you can tell the truth to i took hold of her elbows and looked her squarely in the eye ive read your books angel i know what kind of a person you are its all there between the covers hidden under the surface like an iceberg youre a decent person noreen well im not im a killer and im not just talking about the war as a matter of fact i killed someone only last week and it certainly wasnt a case of kill or be killed i killed a man because he had it coming and because i was afraid of what he might do but mostly i killed him because i wanted to kill him it wasnt dinah who killed max reles angel it wasnt even any of his mafia friends in the casino either it was me i killed him i shot max reles as you know reles had offered me a job at the saratoga and id accepted it but only with the intention of finding an opportunity to kill him how to do this looked more difficult max was heavily protected he lived in a penthouse at the saratoga that could only be accessed by a keyoperated elevator and the elevator doors in the penthouse were watched closely by maxs bodyguard waxey who searched everyone going into the penthouse but i had the idea how i might do it almost as soon as i saw the type of revolver that your friend hemingway had given you the nagant i came across that type of pistol a lot during the war it was the standardissue sidearm for all russian army and police officers and with one important modificationa bramit silencerit was the execution weapon of choice for the russian special services between january and february i worked for the wehrmacht war crimes bureau investigating both allied and german atrocities one of the crimes we investigated was the katyn forest massacre this would have been in april after an army group intelligence staff officer had found a mass grave containing the bodies of four thousand poles some twenty kilometers west of smolensk all of the men were officers of the polish army and had been executed with a single shot in the back of the head by nkvd death squads and all using the same type of revolver the nagant the russians were devious and methodical in the way they had gone about things the way they are about everything sorry but thats just the truth it would have been impossible to execute four thousand men unless certain precautions were first taken to conceal the sound of these executions from those who were yet to die otherwise theyd have rioted and overrun their captors so the murders themselves took place at night in windowless cells that had been soundinsulated with several mattresses and using silenced nagant revolvers one of these silencers came into my possession during the investigation and i was able to study its design and to test a silenced weapon on a firing range which meant that as soon as i saw your revolver i knew that i could manufacture a bramit silencer in my metal shop at home my next problem was this how was i going to get into the penthouse carrying the revolver it so happened that max had given me a gifta custommade backgammon set in an attaché case that contained all the checkers and the dice and the dice cups but there was also room for a revolver and its newly made silencer and i thought there was little chance of waxey searching it especially as the case had combination locks max had told me that he used to play cards once a week with some of the havana underworld he also told me that the game always ended at eleventhirty exactly fifteen minutes before he retired to his office and took a phone call from the president who owns a piece of the saratoga he asked me to come along and when i went i took with me the attaché case containing the silenced revolver and placed it on his pool terrace when i left the penthouse with everyone else at eleventhirty i went back down to the casino and waited a few minutes it was chinese new year the night when they set off a lot of fireworks at the barrio chino its pretty deafening of course especially on the rooftop of the saratoga anyway because of the fireworks i figured reles would finish his call with the president early and as soon as i had let the casino manager see me back in the casino after going up to the penthouse for the first time i returned to the eighth floor which was as far as i could go of course without an elevator key but on the corner of the building theyre repairing the saratogas neon sign which meant that there was some scaffolding on which someone might climb up from the eighth floor to the penthouse terrace someone with a head for heights or someone who was determined to kill max reles at almost any cost it was quite a climb i can tell you and i needed both hands to do it i certainly couldnt have managed that climb with the revolver in my hand or tucked into my belt that was why i needed to leave the weapon on maxs terrace max was still on the phone when i got up there again i could hear him talking to batista going through the figures with him it seems that the president takes his thirty percent stake in the saratoga very seriously i opened the case took out the revolver screwed on the silencer and quietly approached the open window maybe i had a few second thoughts at that moment and then i remembered and how hed shot two people in cold blood right in front of me when we were aboard a boat on lake tegel you were already on your way back to the states when it happened but he threatened to have his brother abe kill you when you arrived back in new york unless i cooperated with him i knew i was safe more or less i already had evidence of his corruption that would have put him away but i had no means of stopping his brother from killing you after that we kind of held each other in check at least until the olympics were over and he went back to the states but like i said earlier he had it coming and as soon as he put the phone down i fired actually thats not quite accurate he saw me just before i pulled the trigger the first time i think he even smiled i shot him seven times i went to the edge of the little terrace and tossed the revolver into a basket of towels by the swimming pool on the eighth floor then i climbed down i covered the revolver with some more towels and went into a bathroom to clean myself up by the time the firecrackers started i was already in the elevator going back down to the casino the plain fact of the matter is that id forgotten about the fireworks when i made the silencer otherwise i might not have bothered but as it happened it enabled me to use the fireworks after the fact as a different kind of cover well the next day i went back to the saratoga like everything was normal in my life there was no way around that i had to act normally or suspicion would have fallen on me as it was captain sánchez marked my card for the murder right from the very beginning he might have made it stick too until i managed to convince lansky that the murder might not have taken place under cover of the noise from the fireworksas everyone seemed to think it had and the police were helpful there they hadnt even bothered to search for the murder weapon i flexed my adlon hotel detective muscles and suggested a search of the laundry baskets not long afterward they found the gun as soon as those mobsters saw the silencer on the revolver they began to think it might be a professional killingsomething to do with their business in havana and probably nothing to do with something that started twenty years ago better still i was able to suggest that the silencer meant that the murder could have happened at any time not necessarily during the fireworks as the captain had suggested effectively that discredited his theory about my being the killer and left me looking like nero wolfe anyway that was gunther in the clear i thought only id been too convincing for my own good meyer lansky appreciated the way id bested the cop and since max had already told him something about my background as a berlin homicide detective lansky decided that in the interest of avoiding a mafia war in havana i was now the man best qualified to handle the investigation of max reless death for a moment or two i was horrified and then i began to see the possibility of putting myself completely in the clear for it all i needed was somewhere safe to lay the blame that wouldnt result in anyone else getting killed i had no idea that they would kill waxey maxs bodyguard as a sort of insurance policy just in case he really did have something to do with it so you could say i killed him too that was unfortunate anyway by a stroke of good luck for me although not for him one of the pit bosses at the saratoga a fellow named irving goldstein was involved with a female impersonator at the palette club and when i found out that hed killed himself because max had been on the brink of firing him for being a pansy well he seemed made to order to take the blame so the night before last i went to search his apartment with captain sánchez and i planted the technical drawing id made of the bramit silencer and made sure that sánchez found it later on i showed the drawing to lansky and told him it was prima facie evidence that it had probably been goldstein who murdered max reles and lansky agreed he agreed because he wanted to agree because any other result would have been bad for business more importantly it left me in the clear so there it is you can relax it certainly wasnt your daughter that killed him it was me i dont know how i could ever have suspected her said noreen what kind of mother am i dont even think about it i smiled wryly as a matter of fact when she saw the murder weapon at the penthouse she recognized it straightaway and later on she told me she thought it might have been you who killed max it was all i could do to convince her that the gun was a common one in cuba even though it isnt thats the first russian weapon ive ever seen in cuba of course i could have told her the truth but when she announced that she was going back to america i couldnt see the point i mean if id told her that i might have had to tell her everything else i mean thats what you wanted isnt it her to leave havana and go to college and thats why you killed him she said i nodded you were quite right you couldnt let her stay with a man like that he was going to take her somewhere they could smoke opium and god only knows what else i killed him because of what she might have become if shed actually married him and because of what fredo told you when you went to his office in the bacardi building he told you about that on the way to the hospital thats why you helped him isnt it because he told you that dinah is your daughter i was waiting to hear you say it noreen and now you have i guess i can mention it is it true its a little late to be asking that isnt it in view of what happened to max i could say much the same thing to you noreen is it true yes its true im sorry i should have told you but that would have meant telling dinah that nick wasnt her father and until he died shed always had a much better relationship with him than with me it felt like id have been taking that away from dinah at a time when i most needed to exercise some influence over her do you see if id told her i dont know what the result might have been when it happenedi mean in when she was borni thought about writing to you several times but each time i thought about it i saw how good nick was with her and i simply couldnt do it he always thought dinah was his daughter but a woman always knows these things as the months and then the years went by it seemed less and less relevant eventually the war came and that appeared to end for good any idea of telling you that you had a daughter i wouldnt have known where to write when i saw you again in the bookstore i couldnt believe it and naturally i thought about telling you that same evening but you made a rather tasteless remark that left me thinking you might be another of havanas bad influences you seemed so hardbitten and cynical i hardly recognized you i know the feeling these days i hardly recognize myself or even worse i recognize my own father i look in the mirror and see him staring back at me with amused contempt for my own previous failure to understand that i am and always would be exactly like him if not him exactly but you were quite right not to tell her im her father max reles wasnt the only man dinah couldnt be around its me too i know that and i dont intend to try and see her and establish some kind of relationship with her its rather late in the day for that i think so you can rest assured on that count its enough for me to know that i have a daughter and to have met her all thanks to alfredo lópez as i said i didnt know hed told you until we went to the hospital just now lawyers arent supposed to tell strangers about their clients affairs are they after i pulled his nuts out of the fire with those pamphlets he figured he owed me and that i was the kind of father who might be able to help her somehow thats what he told me anyhow he was right im glad he did she hugged me closer and you did help her id have killed max myself if id been able we all do what we can do and this is why you went to sim headquarters and persuaded them to let fredo go because you thought you wanted to pay fredo back what he said it gave me some kind of hope that my life hasnt entirely been wasted but how how did you persuade them to let him go a while ago i stumbled across a weapons cache on the road to santa maría del rosario i traded it for his life nothing else what else could there be i dont know how to begin to thank you she said you go back to writing books and ill go back to playing backgammon and smoking cigars from the look of things youre getting ready to move into that new house of yours i hear hemingway will soon be back here again yes hell be here in june hems lucky to be alive after what happened he was seriously injured in two consecutive plane crashes he then got himself badly burned in a bushfire by rights the man should be dead some american newspapers even published his obituary so hes risen from the dead its not all of us who can say as much later on i went out to my car and in the shifting dark i thought i saw the figure of the dead gardener standing beside the well where hed drowned maybe the house was haunted after all and if the house wasnt haunted i know i was and probably always would be some of us die in a day for some like me it takes much longer than that years perhaps we all die like adam its true only its not every man thats made alive again like ernest hemingway if the dead rise not then what happens to a mans spirit and if they do with what body shall we live again i didnt have the answers nobody did perhaps if the dead could rise and be incorruptible and i could be changed forever in the blinking of an eye then dying might just be worth the trouble of getting killed or killing myself back in havana i went to the casa marina and spent the night with a couple of willing girls they didnt make me feel any less alone all they did was help me to pass
