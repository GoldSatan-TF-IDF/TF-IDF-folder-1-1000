jilly cooper prudence for maura mccarthy with love authors note the idea for prudence first came to me in i wrote it as a long short story called house of cards and it appeared in serial form in i took the story and completely rewrote it and the result is prudence chapter one for the twentieth time i said goodnight to pendle and let myself into the flat big ben was striking eleven jane my flatmate stretched out in front of the fire raised a scarlet face to me through a mass of drying blonde hair any progress she asked hopefully then answered for herself no obviously not you look as unpounced upon as ever i went over to the mirror my curls were unruffled my lipstick unsmudged boasting apart i looked great why then after twenty dates hadnt pendle made a pass at me wed met at a party a couple of months back a ghastly whatdoyoudoforaliving ohibashatypewriter sort of party with overhead lighting and someone dishing fruit salad from a huge bowl into our glasses pendle and i were the only sheep among a huge crowd of goats but then they always say the fairest flowers grow on the foulest dungheaps he was not the sort of man you noticed immediately light brown hair a thin expressionless face and pale grey eyes but he had a detachment and exaggerated cool that was in itself a provocation he wore a charcoal grey suit of the most irreproachable orthodoxy grey shirt and a pale tie but he was tall and very thin so his clothes looked good on him i was wearing my joke kit that evening im very sensitive to clothes when i wear frills i become demure in studded leather i stride around and act butch but when i wear my joke kit orange bermudas with braces and a cheesecloth shirt i scintillate and tell jokes when pendle came over and joined our group i rattled off three jokes in quick succession that had everyone except him falling about so i moved off to talk to someone else the party was given in one of those long high eau de nihilistic sloane square rooms where you always think something exciting is happening at the other end and it never is one of the flatmates marcia had even asked her mother not that ive anything against mothers in the right context but at parties they do waste valuable hunting time and this one was a twentystone dogooder whod set like a great pink blancmange on the sofa every so often unfortunate guests were clobbered to talk to her eats anyone said another flatmate waving a plate under our noses im sure youre not on a diet pru youre so skinny im starving i said spearing a sausage i only had time to grab a sandwichboard man at lunchtime i do hope i dont pong confided the flatmate marcia filled the bath with ice so none of us could have a bath next minute marcia rolled up with two new arrivals i want you to meet eileen she said introducing me to a large blonde with dirty finger nails who makes absolutely sooper jewellery i know youd like some pru and this is clifford our firms accountant whos very clever with figures only some figures said clifford leering at my too tight bermudas then braying with laughter and spraying cashew nuts all over me between the gap in his front teeth i asked eileen about the sooper jewellery oh please dont interrogate me she said im so tired and proceeded to describe the entire plot of a film shed seen that afternoon i work in harrods said a pale girl but in the book department as though that made it better then they all talked about president carter mrs thatcher laura ashley and the latest biography by antonia fraser which everyone seemed to have read except me i know one should try to look vivacious at parties when ones stuck with boring people attractive men are always supposed to think what fun you look and come over and introduce themselves but the man in the charcoal grey suit was showing no signs of approaching me and any minute id be buried alive in cashew nuts the flatmate came round with the sausages i drew her aside whos the man in the grey suit her face brightened oh isnt he lovely hes called pendle pendle mulholland i bet he made that up hes quite capable of it she said marcia invited him she says hes absolutely brilliant evidently he was called to the bar younger than anyone else in years he ought to be called to the bar more often i said crossly he hasnt touched his drink it might make him more jolly im a trier at parties so i chatted up all the draggy men and danced around to the record player but i was conscious all the time of this pendle man watching me like a cat perhaps the fruit salad was more potent than id thought because i finally went up to him and said why dont you have another drink and look a bit more jolly there isnt any whisky he said and the local wines a bit too vigorous for me although its done wonders for that plant he pointed to a mauve chrysanthemum in a pot on the table it was quite dead when i arrived i giggled and took another sip at my drink i cant place the tangy flavour i said vim probably marcia mixed it in the wash basin you must have the constitution of an ox he added as i drained the glass im after the cherry i said i hear youre a solicitor barrister i never know the difference i talk more in court what did you do today defended a wifebasher goodness how exciting did you get him off naturally how by proving his wife was utterly impossible was she shouldnt think so that isnt the point he said my job was to get him off defending the wicked for the sake of worldly gain i said i examined his cold fleshless face with its beautiful bonestructure and strange grey unblinking deepset eyes he must look stunning in a wig robespierre the charcoal grey incorruptible i bet youre absolutely lethal in court i said he gave a thin smile and told me about a drugs case in which hed been prosecuting the week before i found it riveting i was also fascinated how detached he was then a diversion was caused by one of marcias young men who had mistakenly thought it was fancy dress and had turned up as a goat in a furry coat and pink udders i had had enough to drink by then to think it terribly funny and started crying with laughter looking up suddenly i saw pendle absolutely devouring me with his eyes are you taking me for a levels i said groping for a tissue didnt your mother ever teach you it was rude to stare im sorry youre extraordinarily like someone i used to know my boss doesnt like solicitors i said he says but for them hed have had a perfectly amicable divorce they all say that what do you do im a copywriter i sit in an office all day thinking what to put then when i finally put it down rodney my boss comes along changes it all and pretends it was his idea in the first place hes been away all week shooting grouse asked pendle no butter commercials in devon id obviously been hogging the most attractive man in the room for too long because marcia came up and asked pendle if he was all right bloody rude i thought then she asked me if i was going to the old girls reunion in pavilion road i said i wasnt had i seen anything of old piggy hesketh i said i hadnt then i admired her dress because i couldnt think of anything else to say laura ashley of course she said smugly redfaced flatmates were now staggering in under piles of plates towards a table at the other end of the room theres eats whenever you need them she said suddenly there was a lot of shrieking and some rugger types arrived oh god said pendle i do hope everyones going to dance again once theyve eaten said marcia i must go and turn up the vol dust to dust laura ashley to laura ashley i intoned helping myself liberally to a bottle of cointreau that had been left on the table i looked at pendle again suddenly deciding i wanted him very much who was the person you think im exactly like i said he was about to tell me when marcia came roaring over saying she must break us up like a french loaf because she terribly wanted pendle to meet charles who was a partner in death and march almost at once the lecherous accountant whod given up spraying cashews and taken up toast crumbs and pâté came over and asked me to dance so i jigged around with him and had another belt of cointreau to keep up my spirits then i had some gin and orange that had been brought by one of the rugger players for his girlfriend then one of the rugger players asked me to dance and thrust me around like a cocktail shaker if you dont stop ill turn into a white lady i panted normally i dont drink much but pendles presence had jolted me i knew i was reaching the dangerous stage when suddenly a wicked alter ego emerges making me cast smouldering glances at happily married men and cannon off groups of people like a shiny red billiard ball a stockbroker in a flowered scarf kept turning off the lights i expected to see pendles eyes gleaming in the dark like a cat people were eating now despite the fact that the pâté tasted like old socks and the kipper mousse contained more bones than highgate cemetery everyone was sycophantically asking marcia for the recipe lots of brandy and garlic she was saying nice tits said the rugger player looking at my nipples the pockets of my cheesecloth shirt which usually covers them had ridden up after all that shaking its much easier of course if you get your butcher to mince the pork and the pigs liver first like my butcher does said marcia id like a balloon i said to no one in particular come back to my little black hole of belgravia said the accountant then you chop up some fresh thyme said marcia suddenly she noticed that her mother was sitting unattended on the sofa stuffing herself with kedgeree and grabbing my arm like a vice said oh pru i know youd like to meet mummy why should i meet mummy i was far too busy keeping handsome men in stitches with my witty repartee i stuck my legs in like our dog when he doesnt want to be bathed but marcia was too strong for me much stronger than any of the rugger players next minute i was rammed down on the only tiny corner of the sofa that wasnt occupied by mummy lovely kedgeree marcia said her mother enthusiastically i dont know how you do everything oh its just organization you know that better than anyone said marcia skipping away like a young lamb and leaving me to my fate i couldnt see pendle anywhere you must be very proud of marcia i said insincerely everyone says that said her mother smugly she gets on with everyone runs the flat holds down a job and of course shes sir basils right hand and then theres all her voluntary work after marcia she moved on to shopping rabbiting on and on about triumphant forays to dickins and jones dignified rebukes to shop assistants the matching saucers tracked down the jersey with the pulled thread returned really i wasnt up to it at all behind her the accountant was making more code signs trying to get me on to the dance floor and out of the corner of my eye i could see the rugger player waiting to tackle from the left the flatmate who hadnt been able to have a bath was dancing with the goat which seemed appropriate perhaps they were having a pongpong match a couple were necking unashamedly on the next door armchair the mans hand well advanced into the girls blouse i was terrified marcias mother would see them marcia had turned up the volume to drown the more excessive of the rugger songs and the distant sounds of some of the fruit salad being regurgitated in the lavatory i couldnt hear a word marcias mother was saying my only hope was to watch her teeth and laugh when she did i was in despair my glass was empty i thought of sending out maroons i knew as a copywriter and as a potential novelist i ought to be studying the old monster one day i might want to put her in the book the true writers supposed never to be bored by anyone but what was the point of studying her if id be far too drunk to remember anything about her in the morning suddenly i saw pendle through a gap he was talking to the blonde with dirty fingernails but he was glancing at his watch and had the abstracted look of a referee about to blow his whistle that decided me i must get you some of marcias delicious pudding i yelled in her ear and floundered towards the food table marcia passed me going in the other direction poor mummy she screamed i was just coming to rescue you i ate some kedgeree out of the dish it was quite good i licked the spoon thoughtfully and took some more one of the rugger players tugged off the goats udders and to much shrieking threw them out of the window pendle suddenly looked round and caught my eye he left the blonde and came over i stood among them but not of them i intoned in a shroud of thoughts which were not their thoughts you got trapped he said ive been taken on a tour of three million department stores i feel utterly shopwrecked he didnt smile i licked the spoon then helped myself to more kedgeree and ate it then i realized how disgusting it must look i blushed and put the spoon down the mauve candles bought to match the michaelmas daisies which mummy had presumably brought up from the country were almost burnt down the rain in spain falls mainly on the plaintiff i said picking at the battlements of wax still not a flicker really he was making me feel very edgy with all this staring pretty fireproof arent you i snapped why dont you go if youre so bored he looked at me consideringly for a minute then said i will if you come with me i was so surprised i nearly dropped the saucepan wild horseguards wouldnt keep me away i said two seconds later i was burrowing like a dog through all those tweed and camelhair coats to find my bag panicking that he might change his mind outside the beginning of autumn lay sodden and misty with a faint smell of dying bonfires in the chelsea gardens conker husks and the kapok innards of the udder lay strewn over the pavement he had an expensive looking car pale grey of course i remember there was a halfeaten bar of chocolate in the glove compartment i ought to have seen the red light then people who dont gobble up a bar of chocolate in one go have too much selfcontrol why are you called pendle i said snuggling down in the front seat after a mountain not far from our house i bet its hell to climb and covered with snow all the year round i said admiring his perfect greek nose id got hiccups quite badly not a very good party i dont like cold houses and warm drink said pendle but it had its compensation where do you live on my nerves and on the edge of battersea park my flatmate works in publishing shes lovely all girls say their flatmates are lovely she really is shes having an affair with a married man going home to bed in the lunch hour and all that what about you he said i play the field i said it was true i had plenty of boyfriends at that time but no one i really cared about i was poised for the big dive the sky was a brooding dappled dun colour the moon was drifting through the clouds like a distraught hostess a slight breeze jostled the leaves along pavements and gutters we were driving along the embankment now the river rippling in the moonlight such was my euphoria i didnt realize we hadnt crossed chelsea bridge towards battersea until we drew up at a large block of flats ou sommesnous maintenant i said mon apartement said pendle oh la la wheres that westminster very convenient for my chamber in the temple torture chambers i muttered i suppose thats where you dream up devilish plots to confound your poor victims pendle lent across and opened the door for me i dont usually go to mens flats the first night i meet them i said im sure you dont he said calmly i hope you dont usually go to parties like marcias oh well i said as he locked the car just a quick drink and then home what floor i said collapsing into the lift thirteen are you superstitious no just super as i haphazardly pressed a button pendle took me in his arms that first kiss felt so faintmakingly right that it was only when he stopped for breath that i realized the lift had stopped too aware that i wouldnt be looking my best with smeared lipstick under overhead light i scrabbled at the lift gates then felt very silly when i realized we were still on the ground floor pendle laughed you pressed the wrong button when we finally reached his flat i headed straight for the bathroom for a respray my face was very mussed and flushed if only i looked as nice after parties as i do at the beginning to my dismay i then realized id left my muck bucket at marcias and brought someone elses bag instead inside i found a notecase with three fivers a driving licence several credit cards and a photograph of a labrador and a tweedy woman with her legs apart there was even a diary with the pencil still in the back and we were now in september obviously a wellordered person alas the only makeup she had was an awful cherry lipstick which was hardly sufficient for the repair job i needed i peered into pendles medicine cupboard hoping for some makeup left by a former or current mistress but only found expensive aftershave talcum powder and what was more interesting two halffull bottles of tranquillizers and sleeping pills perhaps he was much more strung up than he seemed behind the cool façade oh well i thought taking the shine off with a bit of talcum powder and slapping his aftershave on to my pulse spots ill just have to rely on personality he was standing in the hall for a minute he stood there staring at me as though he was memorizing every feature its incredible will i do i said swinging on the door handle a thousand ships he said what well perhaps ships a purist would grumble about the freckles and say your eyes were too far apart i looked bemused sorry he said ive been trained to be infuriatingly enigmatic its a game i used to play with my brother jack you know helen was the face that launched a thousand ships we used to grade women from ships downwards whats marcia i said she only rates a rather dirty tug boat and a couple of sampans i giggled she wont be pleased ive walked off with someone elses bag it seems sad that someone of your tender age should join the criminal classes so early said pendle will you defend me mlord the defendant was not in full possession of her senses when the crime occurred you can say that again had i better take it back christ no not tonight ring up and say youve got it the telephones over there just as i was dialling pendle picked up my hair and kissed me on the back of my neck sending shivers down my spine nice hair he said is it natural of course i said im far too young to dye i actually made him laugh oh the wages of scintillation then i had to dial the number again marcia was cross weve been looking for it everywhere and mummy and i wanted to do the washing up where are you back home ill bring it over first thing in the morning i wandered into the drawingroom which was beautiful harmonizing greys and rusts with several abstract paintings with signatures even id heard of thousands of books and the sort of vastly elaborate hifi system you need a licence to drive he opened a cupboard full of drink that ought to have been another warning if jane and i have a bottle in our flat we drink it if theres more than one we give a party what dyou want to drink he said a gimlet please i said thinking that would fox him but he reached straight for the vodka im sorry i havent any fresh limes he said will lime juice do ill get some ice put a record on they were all classical but i bypassed the bach and the bruckner and put on ravels bolero that beat drives me insane he came back and handed me a large drink how delicious i said taking a huge gulp that nearly took my throat off he poured himself some whisky and sat down on the sofa opposite me he lit a cigarette and stared at me through the smoke it was very unnerving hes the only man ive met who is completely unembarrassed by silences i was at school with marcia i said silly that the old bag seemed to be our main point of communication she was always winning prizes for history she still seems to be buried in the dark ages said pendle how do you know her her fathers a high court judge oh so he was ambitious i started to sing that snatch of gilbert and sullivan about falling in love with an old attorneys elderly ugly daughter not that marcias so elderly or ugly really i added quickly remembering that men arent supposed to like bitchy girls i couldnt do that i rattled on marry someone awful just to advance my career i dont think i could ever sleep my way to the top the rate i was going downhill i reflected i could easily sleep my way to the bottom i did fancy him but i mustnt not on the first night i was far too tight anyway and my bermuda shorts were even tighter they left the most unattractive creases on my body he was still staring at me i tried to cross my legs but found they were already crossed that bolero was really getting going now tumtutty tum tutty tutty tutty tum tutty tum i was itching to dance but instead i got up and went over to look at his books there was some philosophy some poetry but mostly law books i turned round and smiling danced slowly towards him the music made me feel as though i had long gipsy skirts on i must have looked an idiot in those bermudas i stood swaying in front of him he watched me through narrowed eyes for a moment then caught me by the hips and pulled me on to his knees oh dear i did adore kissing him but suddenly everything got out of control he was biting at my lips his hands were everywhere ripping off my clothes he turned completely savage and i was fighting to get away from him then just as suddenly he stopped and buried his face in my neck im sorry he whispered im sorry it was weird as though he were talking to someone else after a few seconds he got up and took me home and he never made another pass at me chapter two in fact i was shattered when pendle rang me the next day and asked me out and from then on took me out two or three times a week as a boyfriend you couldnt fault him he always took me to nice places he rang when he said he would and was never more than five minutes late but somehow he never opened up with me and beyond the fact that he dressed well had a beautiful flat and was already making a name for himself at the bar i knew nothing about him what i noticed most was his rigid selfcontrol or was it lack of appetite he never ate much pushing his plate aside after a few bites and lighting a cigarette he never drank much and always after an excellent dinner and a bottle of wine when i was expansive and ready for laughter and love he would tip the waiter exactly per cent gather up his change and take me home i tried everything to win him i leant forward in lowcut dresses and backward in highneck sweaters i put my hair in bunches in case he was on the lolita kick i put my hair up in case he liked sophisticates i even faked flu and wore a seethrough nightie when he came to see me not a pass was made not a lecherous grab and yet i found this icy reserve ridiculously seductive every time i made him laugh i felt id conquered everest i had also seen him moved to tears by a beethoven quintet the whole time i was aware of the banked fires beneath the icy reserve of a tension just this side of menace as the weeks passed i found myself getting more and more hooked on him jane and i discussed it interminably perhaps hes a pouf said jane that was no pouf who attacked me the first night perhaps hes married and doesnt want to compromise you thats never deterred any married man i know perhaps hes shy shy hes the coolest thing this side of an iceberg so perhaps hes serious and doesnt want to muck it up after the first nights fiasco wouldnt that be lovely i sighed ill ask him to dinner and you can tell me what you think dinner was a catastrophe usually i love cooking but the evening pendle came round i tried too hard i asked rodney my boss whos a bit fingersnapping and aggressively trendy but a giggle when he gets tanked up and another smashing zany girl copywriter from the agency called dahlia who can be guaranteed to make any party go jane had asked a man she fancied in her office who was very witty as well as being a liberal mp all week i had fantasies of jane and i sitting round looking radiant by candlelight and contributing the odd remark as the conversational ball bounced scintillatingly along usually when people came to dinner we ate lounging on cushions in front of the fire and jane made jokes about having to lay the floor but that night i polished up the gateleg table and laid it with candles and flowers when jane arrived home i was rolling out pastry with a milk bottle hows it going all right except ive made too much never mind henry cant come so ive asked this fantastic guy i met at a party last night hes called tiger millfield isnt that great and he plays rugger for england so im sure hell eat for at least fifteen oh dear i hope he and pendle get on whats in here said jane tripping over a casserole on the floor there was so little room in our kitchen the filet for the boeuf en croute mopping up a vat of nuits st georges i said airily now everyone can say i marinaded beneath me jane groaned you have got him bad candles flowers gin whisky jolly good thing its the beginning of the month what else are we having pâté and tomato salad to start with then the beef and peaches soaked in white wine to finish up with janes mouth watered what about the finger bowls and the waterlily napkins she said im surprised you arent dressing rodney up as a butler i ignored her and went into the drawingroom to give the gate leg table a last polish with my skirt do you think i ought to put pendle or rodney on my right i shouted rodneys been married does that take precedence over a bachelor i really dont know id better go and change into something suitably gracious theres still masses to do i wailed well id better not distract you then somehow at five to eight i was ready id even bought a new dress for the occasion long and medieval looking in rustcoloured velvet with an embroidered panel at the front and long trumpet sleeves i kept having another fantasy about pendle staying long after everyone else drawing me into his arms and saying really theres no end to your achievements thats nice said jane admiring the dress the lady of shallot appropriate too after all those onions youve been chopping youd better take the price off jane was wearing very tight jeans no bra and a blue tshirt which matched her blue eyes and made her nipples stand out like acorns she looked far better than me my beastly face kept flushing up and clashing with the rust bang on the dot of eight the doorbell rang jane picked up the answerphone its pendle she said raring to get at you with shaking hands i put a new purcell record on the gramophone jane giggled are we all going to dance the gavotte initially i could see jane was impressed by pendle he was wearing a grey pinstriped suit which fitted his long greyhound figure to perfection and his cold seagulls eyes looked at her without any of the enthusiasm she was accustomed to from men here was a challenge i made a lot of fuss pouring his whisky running back and forth for water and ice usually jane and i talked ninety to the dozen but his presence seemed immediately to shut us up do you think youll win the westbury case i said after a long pause i had been following it in the times we might said pendle if lady westbury can be persuaded to go into the box sounds like a horse said jane why said pendle well some horses are difficult to get into horse boxes or loose boxes she added brightening do you ride yes said pendle well you must know its called a box oh forget it pru says youve got a gorgeous flat in westminster yes that must be fun lots of mps smuggling in their mistresses did you ever meet john stonehouse no said pendle dont they invite you to orgies pendle in fact didnt respond at all and made no attempt to chat her up the pauses in the conversation became longer and longer it was with passionate relief that we heard the doodle bug tick tick of a taxi arriving and an explosion of voices and car doors slamming in the street below it must be rodney hes bringing dahlia i said shes lovely rodney arrived with two litres of pedrotti and no dahlia she had evidently got flu instead he had brought a beautiful but unbelievably dreary girl from the publicity department called ariadne who lived on weed salads and yoghurt and was permanently talking about diets rodney a confirmed lecher had suffered a great shock when his wife had suddenly left him and had consequently by way of compensation taken up even more dedicated lechery and the wearing of selfconsciously trendy clothes tonight he was resplendent in a dark green velvet cat suit tucked into black boots and slashed to the waist to show a blond suntanned chest he had just been filming in ibiza the suit was a little too tight for him i wished hed worn something slightly less outrageous pendle was looking at him with distaste jane in wonder i was in such a state i forgot ariadnes name when i tried to introduce her she needed livening up with a good strong drink but she insisted on just having water had i any idea how many calories there were in alcohol oh come on live a little said rodney ive lost three inches off my hips since i gave up booze oh bottom thou art translated said rodney jane shrieked with laughter rodney sensed an ally whats this crap youve put on the record player he said turning to me purcell i said blushing well it wont wash he said winking at jane for gods sake take it off and put on something less rarefied who else is coming he said counting the places tiger millfield said jane the international said rodney i was at school with him we sat next to each other in chapel for three years what was he like said jane never spoke to each other jane and i laughed pendles face didnt flicker rodney took a belt at his whisky and made a face youve put tonic in darling instead of soda you must be in a state youve had a terrible effect on her he added grinning at pendle shes supposed to flip through the nationals every morning to see if any of our clients get a mention all she does is pore over the law reports says theyre even better than crossroads oh shut up rodney i said weve worked together for two years rodney went on so if you want any gen on her ill give it to you at a price perhaps in return you could give me some advice about my divorce i dont do much divorce work said pendle coldly id consult a solicitor if i were you the rudeness was quite blatant pendle obviously thought rodney too silly for words he got up and looked at the books far too many of them cheap novels rodney shrugged and winked at jane who winked back pru never said you were this pretty he said sitting down beside her and admiring her tits have you ever done any modelling i think youd have a great future i havent had a bad past said jane i swear by a glass of hot lemon juice first thing in the morning said ariadne i swear automatically first thing in the morning said rodney i dont need lemon juice i escaped to the kitchen suddenly there seemed a hell of a lot to do making the bearnaise sauce unwrapping the butter uncorking bottles of wine putting on the potatoes and the mangetouts two strong drinks didnt seem to have done anything but make me clumsy i felt myself getting redder and redder in the face oh why had i been so ambitious the beef would be ruined if tiger millfield didnt arrive soon when i got back jane and rodney were nose to nose admiring each others cleavages pendle was looking grey with boredom ariadne was saying i tried the meat and citrus fruit diet but it made my breath smell i couldnt face them i escaped into the kitchen again and was just shaking a lettuce out of the window when jane joined me dont leave them i wailed isnt he fantastic said jane pendle i said brightening no rodney what do you think of pendle he doesnt exactly make one feel at home does he do you think he fancies me hard to tell he never takes his eyes off you but its like a cat watching a mouse dont you think hes devastating not my type really let me have about me men that are fat yon pendle has a lean and hungry look he thinks too much such men are dangerous she finished off pleased with herself at the comparison why havent you shelled the peas theyre mangetouts i snapped well he may not be your type but what about me i preferred your other boyfriend charlie even old tom charlie and old tom were slobs i said shaking the lettuce so furiously that i let go of the cloth and it went sailing out into the street now look what youve done never mind theres so much to eat said jane soothingly where the hells tiger got to i snapped the doorbell rang rodney picked up the answerphone in the drawingroom its the grandest tiger in the jungle he said i must go to the loo said jane disappearing into the bathroom i knew perfectly well shed gone to tart up as i went to answer the door there was a terrible crash tiger had tripped over all the twentyfive milk bottles id put outside in my giant tidyup for pendle he swayed in the doorway with a lettuce leaf on his head he was very handsome but also quietly and extremely drunk crosseyed he confronted his diary think ive been asked to dinner hello darling said jane coming up and kissing him removing the lettuce leaf from his head she took him into the drawingroom and introduced him was it a good party said rodney looking at him speculatively sizing up the competition think so said tiger my cigarette packets absolutely covered in telephone numbers its always been my ambition to play rugger for england said jane mine is to go to work every day reading a pink paper in the back of a chauffeurdriven rollsroyce said rodney mine is to weigh seven stone said ariadne rodney bent on sabotage poured tiger the most enormous whisky pendle was looking at his watch well eat in two seconds i said and hared back to the kitchen for a lastminute panic of dishingup my medieval sleeves trailed in the bearnaise sauce which had started to curdle oh why hadnt i stuck to jeans i was frenziedly mashing the potatoes when rodney came in i love the way your bottom wiggles when you do that i gritted my teeth cook is obviously getting a little unnerved he went on the same intelligence is required to marshal an army as to cook dinner well im not officer material i snapped i do like your flatmate said rodney he peered into the bearnaise sauce i didnt know we were having scrambled eggs too many cooks spoil the brothel said jane i think we ought to eat pru darling pendle and tiger are getting on like a piece of damp blotting paper on fire go and sit people down i said and make sure pendle doesnt get the side plate with the rabbits running round or the threepronged fork mind out said jane pulling rodney out of the way or youll be run over by a passing capon whos going to say grace said jane as we sat down give us this day the will to resist our daily bread said rodney ive put on a stone in the last three months i used to be lithe as a panther let me have about me men that are fat said jane meaningfully have some pâté i said to ariadne no i wont thank you very much it looks delicious though now we were in the awful hassle of have you got butter toast pâté tomato salad pepper watch out the tops inclined to fall off oh dear you havent got a fork you must have left it in the tomatoes the table was much too small and everyone was jabbing elbows into everyone else ariadne having nibbled one piece of tomato from which she had shaken all the oil was watching every bit of food that went into everyones mouth like a slavering dog people dont realize how fattening cheese is she said to pendle no thank you i wont have any wine tiger and rodney having established they were at school together were swapping anecdotes across me jane was hanging on their every word and not taking any notice of pendle who was sitting opposite me i darent ask him about work as i knew jane and rodney would start mobbing me up suddenly our eyes met and he gave me that swift wicked smile and for the first time that evening i felt like not cutting my throat stick with me baby i pleaded with my eyes im not enjoying it any more than you are but the next moment he had turned back to ariadne who was talking about some diet book that had just been published butters evidently quite all right in moderation she said she was awfully pretty perhaps he fancied her tigers elbow kept falling off the table and we all had to wait while he ploughed through a second helping dyou mind if we look at the box during the news at ten break asked rodney who had several crumbs in his hairy chest i want to see the virago tyre commercial i keep missing it have you seen it he added to pendle i dont watch television said pendle rodney flipped his lid thats what ive got against lawyers he howled your attitude is positively antedeluvian how can anyone not watch television in this day and age oh god he was about to launch into his antilegal profession tirade i leapt to my feet could you pass your plate up darling but rodney was not to be halted and when i staggered in with the beef en croute five minutes later he was still at it my own divorce would have been perfectly amicable my wife and i might even be struggling on together today if it hadnt been for lawyers putting their oar in everyone should conduct their own defence oh rubbish i said if eve had had a decent counsel wed probably all still be living in paradise i thought that was quite a bright remark but no one took any notice they didnt like pendle they were waiting for rodney to carve him up lawyers are a lot of incompetent hacks said rodney blinding people with their own mumbo jumbo all you care about is reputation you dont give a bugger about the issues of the case you just want to beat other lawyers thats right said jane i think pljs a ripoff said ariadne hopefully no pastry thank you pru pendle sat very still looking at rodney the expression on his face too complex for me to read its meaning in spite of twelve hours marinading the boeuf en croute had overcooked to the consistency of horse meat only tiger seemed to have no trouble with it the people who control our courts went on rodney splashing wine into everyones glasses are a lot of geriatrics in fancy dress the whole system in fact is designed to isolate them from the pressures of modern life who pray are the rolling stones christ youre cushioned against reality we deal with murders rape divorce every day said pendle mildly id hardly call that exactly my point interrupted rodney you can only deal with the horror of life by turning it into a play with a stage and a cast in period costume we havent got any napkins said jane leaping to her feet rodney was warming up now why do legal costs increase as the price of a house increases although exactly the same amount of paperwork is involved why cant you go to four different lawyers and get estimates for their services and its all geared to the rich isnt it pay a fine or go to prison so the rich pay up and the poor have to go to jug napkins anyone said jane coming in with a roll of loo paper and proceeding to break bits off for everyone i put my head in my hands its time for drastic reform said rodney tipping back his chair the crime rates going up and up the divorce rates rocketing and parasites like you are cleaning up pendle was playing with his knife pale ascetic watchful beside rodney and tiger he looked like a jesuit priest among a lot of debauched jolly cardinals the reason why crime is going up said pendle softly is because people have never before been so well informed about what theyre missing and weve got your profession to thank for that every time we turn on a television set or walk down a street or go in the tube were bombarded by advertisements tempting us with the promise of a better life as a result everyone thinks theyve got a right to a modern kitchen a new car a beautiful girl in a cornfield a happy family life children in permanently white jeans a bouncing brighteyed dog no wonder marriages break up when people are constantly bombarded by an idealized picture of marital bliss oh dont give me that old crap spluttered rodney advertising provides a service we tell the public whats on the market rubbish said pendle you create discontent envy and avarice you encourage a constant desire for novelty change the packaging sell the product as new everything is backed up by market research and statistics said rodney pompously advertising people use statistics like a drunk uses a lamp post snapped pendle for support rather than illumination what sort of world dyou think youve created when theres no child whose unhappiness cant be dispelled by a sunshine breakfast no romantic setback that cant be cured by using a new kind of toothpaste no marital dustup that cant be ended with a box of chocolates he was playing with words now bravo i said advertisings fun no one takes it seriously protested jane oh yes they do said pendle thousands of people write in for an amazing offer of a socalled steak knife thats worth p dress anyone up in a white coat and the public think hes an unimpeachable authority i came across an advertisement the other day which claimed its product was used by per cent of actors who play doctors on television sounds like the sort of line i write i said in a desperate attempt to lighten the atmosphere at least advertising keeps people in work actors writers designers stuttered rodney advertising stultifies creativity said pendle crushingly thats why hardly any decent poetry or painting or musics being produced in this country at the moment all the creative talent is being frittered away in advertising there was a silence tiger millfield let out a huge belch but no one giggled somehow when rodney had attacked pendle it had just been bluster but with pendle one felt it was the real thing it was too late to do any rescue work i really ought to catch the eye of the highest lady of rank and whisk her out of the room leaving the combatants to their port but we hadnt had pudding yet im sure some of the advertising for slimming products is very suspect said ariadne isnt it time for your commercial rodney said jane well if that concludes the case for the prosecution said rodney getting to his feet and switching on the box i think we might indulge in a little animated corruption i cleared away it was sad that people could leave more on their plates than you appeared to have given them in the first place i didnt bother with the pudding and by the time i got back with the coffee the commercial break was over and jane and rodney were stuck into some political scandal on the news tiger millfield was listening owlishly to ariadne yapping on about wheat germ pendle was looking at his watch wheres your glass i said i must go but its early now beastly dinners over we can relax ive got to drive down to winchester early tomorrow morning the brief only arrived this evening i havent studied it yet he nodded a curt goodbye to everyone else and i followed him out into the hall will you be down in winchester long i said suddenly overwhelmed by desolation a couple of days thank you for having me you certainly floored rodney i said i didnt know you felt so strongly about advertising his eyes gleamed wickedly i dont if id wanted to i could have argued the case for advertising just as well bbut you were so convincing i said thats my job and he was gone without even saying hed ring me back in the drawingroom tiger millfield was trying to ring for a taxi on the answerphone in the end he decided to go and flag one down in the street taking ariadne with him thank goodness you get so tired on a diet she said are you coming rodney ill stay on a bit said rodney mustnt break up the party all at once i left rodney and jane and went into the kitchen i felt near to tears physically and mentally exhausted the hostess with the leastest mrs utterly beaten a pile of pots pans glasses plates and uneaten food greeted me i couldnt face it i went back into the drawingroom rodney was sitting in an armchair rolling a joint telling jane about the pot he grew in his back garden jane was leaning against his knees they stopped talking when they saw me lovely dins darling said rodney im sorry about the beef i said flopping into an armchair you were had by the butcher said jane i never know if meats tender just by looking at it i said it all looks the same like chinamen rodneys going to put me on a poster said jane youre going to see me hoarding down from every stare there was a long pause then they both said simultaneously darling hes not for you why not i said blushing because hes a bastard said rodney its only because he worsted you in an argument i said he didnt really mean what he said about advertising he admitted it outside in the hall he couldve just as easily argued for advertising thats whats wrong with him said jane hes inhuman beneath that cold chilly legal exterior said rodney is an even chillier legal heart he handed jane the joint she inhaled deeply i dont know why he didnt go and sit in the fridge she said with a giggle might have warmed him up a bit she offered it to me but i shook my head i felt too miserable come on cheer up said rodney there are plenty more cold fish in the sea but i dont want to go out with a fish why does he keep asking me out i said with a sob i dont know said rodney hes obviously far more interested in his own briefs than getting into yours if he really cared for you said jane hed have made an effort to be polite instead of freezing us out whatever he feels for you said rodney much more gently it isnt the normal healthy lust a man feels for a beautiful normal girl hes playing games with you pru and i dont reckon hes up to any good chapter three whatever game pendle was playing he left me to stew after the dinner party he didnt ring me for a fortnight i kidded myself he must be working hard probably out of london i tried to forget him but instead spent a lot of time sobbing in the bath and composing long quotationloaded letters of renunciation in my head an added irritation was that jane was having a riproaring time going out every night mostly with rodney on the monday evening a fortnight later she was getting ready for yet another date trying to repair the ravages of a weekend of dissipation in front of the drawingroom mirror while i sat slumped on the sofa eating my way through a box of chocolates youll get spots said jane squirting blue liquid into bloodshot eyes do you know what im sitting on i stormed wwhat the shelf i am hurtling towards spinsterhood and middle age without even a whisker of a supertax husband on the horizon dyou know how long it is since ive been out with a man what about mark hes not a man hes a stockbroker i got up and wandered into the kitchen next door i doubt if anyone will ever ask me out again i must face up to a future looking after cats in an attic ive definitely decided to give pendle up good said jane at least i would if hed have the decency to ring me up so i could tell him so ive got nothing to do and no one to do nothing with i think i shall buy a dog i opened the fridge and found a jar of pickled onions i ate five if he asked you out i bet youd go said jane trying to paint out the purple circles under her eyes i would not not if they stripped me naked and wild horses dragged me four times round the world through the forests and across the burning deserts i ate another pickled onion noisily the telephone rang i must have qualified for the olympics hurtling across the room it was pendle he apologized but not quite enough for not ringing before hed been impossibly busy had i eaten would i like some dinner an hour later my curls still wet from a hasty washing i sat in julies bar lapping up a large glass of wine and talking out of the corner of my mouth like a gangster so as not to asphyxiate pendle with the smell of onion he looked even rougher than jane his face greyishgreen with tiredness his eyes heavylidded and redrimmed i hoped it was from poring over legal documents not looseliving when i first saw him i wondered why id been eating my heart out for him then as the wine curled down inside me the old magic started working again have you had any exciting cases i asked just routine stuff but ive got a big case coming up tomorrow he smiled slightly defending a rapist after the way hed tried to pull me the night wed met i was tempted to point out that he must have plenty of experience in that field but it seemed a shame to rot up the evening so early on will you get him off the odds are against it my clients a man called bobby canfield hes sales manager of a small exportimport firm in the city hes charged with raping he lowered his voice slightly fiona graham i whistled rick wetherbys girlfriend but shes ravishing ravished you mean said pendle rick wetherby was a very successful racing driver absolutely dripping with charisma and money his affair with fiona graham had been well publicized in the papers werent they about to get married i said pendle nodded bobby canfield was her boss she claims he asked her to work late the day before she was due to give up work actually rick wetherby turned up unexpectedly to collect her from work and found the door locked she claims canfield had raped her how exciting had he well they definitely had it off ive got to prove it wasnt rape the wetherby clan are naturally out to hammer canfield and theyve got the money to do it theyve hired jimmy batten to prosecute hes one of the best qcs in the country canfield should have got a qc to represent him too im not really a big enough shot but i handled his sisters divorce a year back and i suppose he was impressed by that he says fiona graham was absolutely asking for it but its going to be a bugger to prove girls dont usually ask for it when theyre about to marry something as luscious as ricky wetherby i said exactly said pendle and canfields got a shocking reputation with women he held up his hardly touched glass of wine in the shaft of light from the table lamp rocking it in the thick glass so it looked almost black his eyes were just dark hollows now in a white drawn face its your big break i said wonderingly arent you terrified he grinned and filled up my glass absolutely shitscared itll be packed out i said wistfully i wish i could come and hear you you can if you like pendle said if you can get the day off ill save you a place in court if the onions hadnt been making a comeback id have kissed him then and there there was a heavy frost that night next morning smothered in janes red fox fur coat i walked to the tube each twig and blade of grass glittered with whiteness the last yellow leaves covered the parked cars and crunched like frosted cornflakes beneath my feet outside the court the crowds shivered and stamped their feet they were mostly motor racing fans anxious to catch a glimpse of ricky wetherby and his beautiful fiancée for the sake of procedure her name was supposed to be kept a secret but everyone knew who she was once inside i was utterly turned on by the theatrical atmosphere of the packed courtroom the rows of journalists lounging and exchanging gossips the solemn beefy policemen and the array of wigs and robes the judge in scarlet was a little molelike man with bright eyes and a twitching inquisitive nose he looked capable of ferreting out the truth and not likely to stand any nonsense opposite sitting in the vast dock was bobby canfield raffish handsome his face slightly weak about the mouth and chin his hair thinning and too long at the back and there was pendle even paler than ever but outwardly calm and looking sensational in a grey wig and gown james batten qc a sleek dark dapper otter of a man in his early forties opened for the prosecution and for half an hour in magnificently sculptured prose had the privilege of so blackening canfields character that before a word of evidence was heard there seemed no longer any doubt about his guilt in the dock ladies and gentlemen of the jury he said in tones of fastidious horror is a man charged with a revolting offence a typing pool don juan who took advantage of this innocent girl so in love with her handsome fiancé that there was no other thought in her head but her marriage in a few weeks time canfields face was expressionless but there was a muscle going like a sledgehammer in his cheek and he was twisting his signet ring round and round his little finger you could see batten had impressed the jury oh poor pendle i thought in anguish what chance has he got i shall now call my first witness miss graham said batten smoothing his sleek hair with an air of anticipation the press and public gallery licked their lips fiona graham did not disappoint them she came into court wearing a grey wool dress with a white collar a hermes scarf attached to her gucci bag her shoulderlength blonde hair brushed back from a smooth forehead with her blue eyes downcast and a slight flush on her beautiful pink and white complexion she indeed looked the picture of innocence i thought the white puritan collar was overdoing it a bit but there was no doubt the jury were impressed as she took the oath in a whisper you could feel the waves of approval and sympathy even the judge looked more benevolent batten rose with a reassuring smile do you recognize the man in the dock miss graham she bit her lip looked at canfield gave a shudder and said she did then in a clear but occasionally quavering voice aided by much sympathetic prompting from batten she told the court how canfield had asked her to stay late as he was going to be out of the office next day how he waited till the building was deserted then tried to kiss her running to the door she had found it locked whereupon canfield had ripped her dress open forced her back on the desk and proceeded to rape her afterwards when she was still sobbing hysterically there was a hammering on the door after telling her to straighten her clothes canfield had opened the door and found her fiancé and miss cartland the head of the typing pool outside my fiancé then insisted i went to the police she whispered i didnt want to with a sob in her voice she went on to say how excited she had been about the wedding she was so beautiful and so touching you could see the pity on everyones face two of the women jurors were surreptitiously wiping their eyes in this emotionally charged atmosphere pendle rose to crossexamine hasnt a dogs chance muttered a fat woman on my right offering me a glacier mint pendle too reassured fiona graham with a slight smile his voice was quiet and gentle in direct contrast to battens histrionics when this unfortunate event occurred you were getting married in six weeks time she nodded i think we could all agree your fiancé is a rich man yes he is in fact marriage to him would represent a considerable change in your circumstances it was almost indecent the caress pendle could get into his voice listening to the soft unhurried syllables fiona began to relax her pretty white hands with their colourless nails unclenched on the gucci handbag i gather youve been working for mr canfield for three months that you came as a temporary and stayed on was that because you liked mr canfield no not especially but he wasnt in the office much and i liked the other people who worked there as you were marrying such a rich man with so much to do before the wedding was it strictly necessary to go on working fiona grahams eyes widened i wanted to be independent my fiancés given me so much im not married to him yet my mothers a widow and she hasnt got much to pay for the wedding i wanted to help out as much as i could the jury nodded sympathetically pendle examined his finger nails if you needed money he said softly why didnt you get a job nearer your flat where the fares would have cost you less and you could have earned more money after all temporaries can get up to a week but i gather you were only getting working for mr canfield when ones getting married said fiona sweetly theres so much to think about its a strain adjusting to a new job im not a very good typist i thought it would be less hassle to stay where i was better the devil you know said pendle did you find mr canfield attractive fiona graham shuddered no she said sharply anyway im not interested in other men i love my fiancé in fact you disliked mr canfield i didnt dislike him i was embarrassed the way he looked at me in what way well she blushed as though he wanted me then why did you work late i wanted to do my job properly she said with a sob i never dreamed hed abuse my trust she was like little nell little death knell where pendle was concerned the jury were looking at him with loathing he seemed unmoved you claim that the evening the socalled assault occurred mr canfield ripped your dress open and a button came off what happened to the button i dont know she whispered i wwasnt in a fit state to there was an agonizing pause then pendle said in a voice of ice earlier you told my learned friend you were crying hysterically because the defendant had taken advantage of you and this crying was overheard by miss cartland who runs the typing pool and later by your fiancé that is correct i suggest hissed pendle you were crying because you were caught in a trap the wedding was only six weeks away your financial setup necessitated making a rich marriage but you suddenly discovered you werent in love with your fiancé at all but infatuated with mr canfield jimmy batten leapt to his feet mlord i must protest fiona graham burst into tears its not true she sobbed i love ricky i hate and detest mr canfield there was so much desolation in her voice i thought pendle was going to get lynched coldblooded bastard said my fat neighbour i bet he treats women badly he does i said accepting another glacier mint pendle picked up a piece of paper does the name gerry seaton mean anything to you suddenly fiona was still like a wary animal but her tone was flat when she answered i dont know what you mean its a simple question said pendle politely do you or do you not know a man called gerald seaton i have never heard of him you didnt spend a weekend with him in the cotswolds on july th and st this year certainly not she allowed herself a little hauteur now batten was on his feet again my lord he said wearily i hardly see this is relevant get back to the point mr mulholland said the judge no more questions said pendle and sat down fiona graham was followed by an impressive array of prosecution witnesses including the office crone shivering with venom all hammering another nail into canfields coffin pendle battled valiantly with each one but didnt make much headway finally to the excitement of many of the crowd who recognized him ricky wetherby went into the box and was so handsome godlike and suntanned and so distressed in a stiff upperlipped way that within seconds the whole court was on his side and that concludes the case for the prosecution said batten ricky wetherby stepped down the judge looked at his watch and we adjourned for lunch pendle stopped for a few words with canfield and his poor shattered wife and then joined me outside you were great i said i never dreamed youd be that good he shook his head its going to be rough this afternoon come on weve only got an hour it was still bitterly cold but a weak sun shining through thin clouds like a sullen pearl had melted most of the frost a few typists were feeding the pigeons as the taxi bowled through lincolns inn field our destination was a hot steamy little pub with darkpanelled walls which seemed to be full of lawyers i was about to say how nice it was when i stiffened for there at the bar downing a large whisky stood jimmy batten look i hissed i know said pendle jimmy batten turned round and smiled at us you made it what can i get you a large whisky please said pendle you can afford it too out of the vast fee youre no doubt getting out of the wetherbys you had a bloody good morning might go either way said jimmy batten with unconvincing modesty i must say you do dump your clients with indecent haste said pendle you ought to be reported to the bar council you cant have spent more than ten seconds reassuring the lovely miss graham i thought you might bring her in here for a drink oh shes far too innocent for dives like this said jimmy winking at me arent you going to introduce me to this ravishing creature i was gazing at them both openmouthed but youve been sneering and glaring and hissing at each other all morning i gasped i know said jimmy its part of the act shows were trying what can i get you to drink a large gin and tonic and her names prudence said pendle giving me a cigarette you were in rare form jimmy all those references to tarquin and lucrece have to give the jury their pornographic kicks said batten only way of keeping them awake i suppose youre going to butcher my client this afternoon im going to carve him up my dear ice and lemon he added handing me my drink and doesnt he deserve it pru thinks hes innocent said pendle shes with me and dont forget it id never known him so friendly perhaps it was because batten was so important shes much too pretty to waste herself on a cold fish like you said jimmy his merry dark eyes sparkling and stroking my fur coat as though i were a cat i found him very attractive he had all the assurance of the older man but none of the pomposity since you find her so alluring said pendle would you mind feeding and caring for her while i nip back to chambers and sign some documents delighted said jimmy batten with such alacrity that it took away some of my disappointment at pendle sloping off after all all the womens magazines encouraged one to get on with his friends dont listen to a word jimmy says said pendle running a finger down my cheek lawyers are the most frightful gossips and he was gone i felt myself go crimson both at the unexpected caress and the speculative way jimmy was looking at us jimmy and i ate shepherds pie and shared a bottle of wine crammed thigh to thigh in a panelled alcove jimmy was blissfully easy to talk to particularly as he was just as interested in yapping about pendle as i was i never expected him to be that good i said hes brilliant mind you hes a bit too cool to go down well with a jury he hasnt got an easy ingratiating personality and he knows it but hes good at asking questions he doesnt say anything really offensive but before the witness knows whats happening he finds himself tied up in knots he did it with my boss the other night it brought the entire dinner party to a halt jimmy grinned i noticed how many laughter lines he had on his face it was sad pendle had none i admire the way he never gives up on a case he said filling up my glass i bet hes up to something now trying to rootle out a piece of evidence thatll blow my case skyhigh not that itll do him any good its obvious as hell canfields guilty has he been taking you out for long i knew he was pumping me now i must be careful since the summer its the first time ive seen him with a girl thats nice i said i sometimes wondered if he werent a bit the other way said batten idly and hes working hard to sublimate it queer you mean he shot me a sidelong glance and nodded he refers to the lovely miss graham for example but hes totally unmoved by her oh no i insisted in horror hes certainly not queer youve got proof have you i must confess if you belonged to me i couldnt keep my hands off you have an enormous brandy and tell me more im sorry to keep staring at you not that its not a pleasure but you remind me of someone and i cant for the life of me think who it is pendle said that the first night we met i said i had an uneasy feeling he knew a lot more than he was letting on and such was the warmth of the room and the amount id drunk and the cosiness in his manner i was tempted to pour out my anxieties about pendle then i remembered about lawyers being terrible gossips i wasnt sure i trusted mr batten so i changed the subject after lunch it was the turn of the defence as pendle rose to his feet straightening his gown and the papers in front of him his hands shook but he spoke calmly enough we intend to prove that my client has been the victim of a monstrous calumny not only has he been charged with a revolting offence he has also lost his job will no doubt have difficulty finding another one been publicly humiliated and privately diminished in the eyes of his family and friends and all this on the testament of one girl her word against his her fiancé arrived too late and found a locked door what we have to find out ladies and gentlemen was what went on beyond that door intercourse he paused we have no doubt the police medical report bears this out but at whose instigation miss graham looks like the innocent flower but is she perhaps the serpent underneath he paused again for effect and glared at jimmy batten who glared back his lip curling with disdain i was hard put not to giggle even as he took the oath canfield gave the impression of being a con man a rep with his shiny shoe in the door the jury were looking at him with disgust pendle stared at him thoughtfully mr canfield was miss graham a good secretary no said canfield why did you keep her on then canfield smiled wryly i suppose i was attracted to her there was a ripple of chattering round the court i told you so muttered my fat neighbour handing me a pack of maltesers you wanted to sleep with her said pendle in a word yes but refrained from doing so she was engaged to be married i do have some principles besides ricky wetherby is much bigger than me it was a bad joke which did nothing to endear canfield to the jury and what happened on the day of the socalled assault she said shed lost her notebook could i possibly dictate the letters id given her yesterday again i said i had to go to a meeting i came back at and told her to come into my office what was miss graham wearing shed changed into a new dress it was very becoming can you describe it well it was very low cut and made more so because shed lost a button what happened then i said she looked smashing was she going to meet her fiancé she smiled and said not until much later i said he was a lucky man and wed better get on with the letters or wed both be in trouble suddenly she burst into tears said she felt trapped that her fiancé was a disaster in bed there was a murmur of protest from the public gallery the judge told them to shut up fionas face was expressionless we heard a step outside fi i mean miss graham said please lock the door and then she went on crying i told her she was crazy to marry him feeling like that i put my arm round her to comfort her did she offer any resistance god no quite the reverse she said shed wanted me for weeks the next minute we were on the floor and intercourse occurred it certainly did the rustling and coughing always present in court had died away people were leaning forward not to miss a word thank you mr canfield said pendle and sat down he seemed surprisingly elated particularly since batten took over next and absolutely tore canfield to pieces although canfield stuck to his story it looked pretty ragged by the end white and shaken he sat down next pendle called one of the pretty typists from the office she came in giggling and patting her hair and wearing far too much makeup pendle handled her with the utmost gentleness and soon her nerves disappeared we were both in the ladies getting ready to go home it was about fi i mean miss graham was changing into this lovely dress very low cut she said she was going to meet her fiancé later at that moment a button popped off which made it almost well indecent youre sure of this course im sure she said that was the trouble with buying cheap clothes i offered to lend her a needle i said once she was married to ricky she wouldnt have to buy cheap clothes any more besides it looked more sexy without the button and we had a giggle about that the tension was beginning to mount in the court the jury were sitting up and taking notice the next witness was blond handsome and brash and said his name was gerald seaton he described himself as a commercial traveller have you seen miss graham before said pendle yes we met in the kings cross hotel lounge exactly four months ago how did you meet she picked me up suddenly the court went very still i was working on some figures she came and sat near me and smiled at me i smiled back she was a very pretty girl she said she was meeting her aunt off the leeds train but it had been delayed we arranged to meet next evening did she tell you she was engaged oh yes she made no secret of the fact she was going to marry this rich bloke said he was no good in bed i glanced at ricky wetherby he looked as though hed been turned to stone what happened next i took her away to the cotswolds for the weekend we stayed in a hotel how did you pass the time we spent it in bed even though she was engaged to be married didnt worry her why should it worry me jimmy batten looking rather grim got up to protest surely my lord this is utterly irrelevant these events happened long before my client met the defendant i can assure you it has the utmost relevance on the case said pendle quickly proceed mr mulholland said the judge what happened after this weekend we met once then she suddenly refused to see me pretending shed decided not to cheat on her fiancé any more well that didnt wash with me after her performance in the cotswolds so i waited for her outside her office one evening her new office said pendle yes she must have been working there about a fortnight we went and had a drink she got a bit bombed and then it all came out shed got a thing about this bloke at work said she was mad about him but he refused to do anything about her do you remember what his name was i can it was the same village near my home he was called canfield bobby canfield there was not much batten could do with mr seaton nor did he have much joy with the hotel manageress in the cotswolds who remembered fiona and gerry seaton staying there they signed in as mr and mrs seaton i remembered her because she was so pretty we didnt think they were married i mean they stayed in their room all weekend we just took their meals up the wetherby camp looked thunderstruck next moment fiona was on her feet theyre lying theyre all lying its a frameup jimmy batten put out a hand to hush her and rising to retrieve the situation said smoothly mlord i should like my client to go back into the witness box to refute these charges the jury looked shaken and undecided fiona went back into the box she had regained her sangfroid now she denied that she had ever been away for the weekend or even met mr seaton there must be some mistake she remembered shed had a bad cold that weekend her fiancé had been abroad so shed stayed in bed without going out for two days its a conspiracy she said her eyes filling with tears again i swear ive never set eyes on this man in my life the barometer was wavering once again i felt the jury were going to believe her there was a long pause then it was pendles turn miss graham he said in his gentlest drawl you do realize that people who dont tell the truth in court can be sent to prison of course she said pendle crossed the court and handed her a piece of paper did you write this letter she glanced at it yes its a thankyou letter for a wedding present pendle went back to his place my lord i have here a document in the same writing as this letter later i will call a handwriting expert to verify their similarity normally i wouldnt resort to snooping and appropriating private documents but when my clients reputation is at stake all right mr mulholland said the judge irritably get on with it what have you got to show us pendle picked up a kingfisherblue leatherbound book which had been hidden in his papers the lock was hanging from it i have here a diary belonging to miss graham in which she chronicles only too clearly the events of the past few months suddenly fionas face twisted in horror no dont let him she screamed hes got my diary hes a thief be quiet miss graham snapped the judge proceed mr mulholland jimmy battens face never moved an inch but he must have felt the floor give way beneath him mlord he protested i must object to my learned friends methods im sure you do said the judge go on mr mulholland in a minute the ladies and gentlemen of the jury can examine the diary themselves said pendle but first id like to read out one or two passages the lack of expression in his voice made fionas passionate outpouring sound even more dreadful first there was her description of meeting gerald seaton and the weekend in the cotswolds exactly as he had described them its marvellous he read in his flat drawl after ricky to find someone who knows what hes doing in bed fionas lips were blue now its a forgery she whispered pendle flipped over a few pages now he said softly let us turn to her description of her first days of working for mr canfield my new boss is really sexy i fancy him rotten here on the th is a picture of mr canfield cut out of the investors chronicle nothing unusual in that snapped jimmy batten any girl would cut out a photograph of her boss as detail followed horrendous detail of her growing obsession for canfield i couldnt bear to look at her or at ricky wetherby sitting stunned and unbelieving i was mesmerized by the distaste and cruelty in pendles voice how he seemed to hate her i could only think of a cobra striking again and again and now he said suavely if youll bear with me ill read the entry on september th the day before the alleged rape bobbys wife came in today god i loathe her the old frump bet she bores him to death in bed tomorrow is my last chance i shall die if i dont get him if only rickyd let me go on working after were married ill wear my new blue dress and pretend ive lost my shorthand notebook and ask bobby to give me the letters again after work if were alone in the building somethings bound to happen i know he fancies me against my will my eyes went to ricky wetherby and came away again at once it was crucifixion pendle paused again and looked slowly round the court after this the diary becomes rather anatomical and moves into the realms of fantasy as to what miss graham would like mr canfield to do to her in bed i imagine the ladies and gentlemen of the jury would find it less embarrassing to read for themselves but the next moment fiona had jumped down from the witness box and was crossing the well of the court towards pendle screaming abuse bastard bastard give it back to me i thought she was going to claw pendles face but ricky was too quick for her he was beside her in a flash his handsome face stonegrey as a pavement leave her alone he shouted at pendle putting his arms round fiona say its not true fiona darling for christs sake say you didnt write it for a minute she glared at him yes i did she hissed i wrote every word of it cant you understand that i love him i love him and she collapsed sobbing hysterically into the arms of a policewoman a great sigh went through the court for a minute the jury conferred pendle was about to call his next witness but the foreman of the jury forestalled him if it so pleased his lordship they felt they had the evidence required what witness were you about to call mr mulholland a handwriting expert mlord the foreman consulted with the jury again mlord we have reached our verdict already we are unanimous in returning a verdict of not guilty always thought she was a fast piece said my neighbour disconsolately upending the empty red malteser packet the judge in his summing up congratulated pendle on his handling of the case admiring his tenacity if not his slightly reprehensible methods of obtaining information the moment he swept out in his scarlet robe pandemonium broke out fiona graham was led away by the police and the press made a most indecent dive for the public telephones outside across the court pendle was being congratulated by a stunned canfield contingent his hands were shaking as he gathered up the papers i knew he was dying for a cigarette looking up he caught my eye over the crowd and waved i made a double thumbs up sign then he mouthed that he was a bit tied up but hed pick me up at the flat at i took a bus to sloane square and then walked home i wanted some fresh air and time to think women in tweed skirts were raking up leaves in chelsea gardens an aeroplane trail was turning pink in the setting sun inside the houses people were switching on lamps and lighting fires a group of children were throwing sticks into a goldfish pond a black spaniel ran round them barking with excitement it all seemed so normal after the dramas in court i was haunted by ricky wetherbys stricken face he had been so godlike and selfconfident that morning i kept thinking of pendle cruel and as merciless as torquemada turning and turning the thumbscrew on fiona graham in a kinky way though the whole day had been so erotic fionas feverish craving for canfield had been uncomfortably near to my own feelings for pendle if he didnt make a pass at me soon i should burst i had been rattled too by jimmy battens comments perhaps pendle was queer and if so what was the point of seeing any more of him but after today i knew i was in too deep to get out i felt restless uneasy and horribly carnal id better have a cold bath before i went out in fact we had a heavenly evening all my fears were lulled pendle took me to parkes and we sat in a secluded corner guzzling champagne and mediterranean prawns fried in garlic and gloating over the evening papers canfield had been vindicated at great length with the most sensational headlines how on earth did you get that diary i asked holding out my empty glass absently pendle filled it i spent the last fortnight chatting up fionas flatmate is she pretty i said bristling no pendle flipped my nose teasingly with his finger shes a cow and absolutely eaten up with jealousy where fionas concerned she pretended it wasnt quite cricket to hand over the diary actually she was frightened fionad find out shed nicked it when did she finally give it to you lunchtime today i whistled i did run it a bit close i admit thats why i had to abandon you to jimmys blandishments you made a conquest there did i how lovely he rang up when i got back to the office ostensibly to congratulate me actually to ask us both to dinner next friday ooh can we go pendle was silent for a minute fidgeting with his lighter that was odd id never seen him fidget before then he took a deep breath im thinking of going home for a few days next week i was wondering if youd like to come too for a few seconds i couldnt believe my ears i was so overwhelmed i couldnt speak id adore to i finally squeaked relief seemed to flood over him its a long way my family live in the lakes but it doesnt take that long up the preston motorway id like to leave on thursday afternoon and probably come back on sunday night can you get the time off ive still got some holiday left i said and i can always blackmail rodney by threatening to tell jane terrible things about him good well try and make it in time for late dinner then itll be such heaven getting out of london i said he smiled rather ruefully i hope youll enjoy it theyre all rather formidable particularly my mother i went whooping into the flat dying to tell jane all about it and barged into the drawingroom in the dim light i could just distinguish two people locked on the sofa get out shrieked jane she must have picked up someone at the party shed been to how crude i thought loftily as i made myself a cup of coffee how much more sensible pendle and i were conducting our affair id obviously destroyed their mood for a few minutes later i heard voices and the front door bang jane came into the kitchen looking ruffled you look jolly smug she said sourly has he asked you to marry him not quite i crowed clutching my happiness to me like a hot water bottle but hes asked me to stay with his family next week for a second her face fell however much one likes ones flatmate one cant bear their lovelife to go too well but jane is basically a nice person and she smiled almost immediately pru thats marvellous when for how long what on earth did he say tell me all he must be serious to take you home to meet his mother i muttered something about chickens before theyre hatched but i found it difficult in the next few days to keep my mounting elation in check and wrote prudence mulholland all over my shorthand notebook chapter four jane became very bossy if pendle says his mother is formidable she must be a tartar shes bound to go through your things when you and pendle are striding over the fells to see if youre a slut or not youd better buy some new underwear i counted two safety pins in your bra and a new nightie in case pendle comes stealing down those dark passages after lights out you must be joking i said but i could not suppress a shiver of excitement in the end she did my packing for me tissue paper always impresses people she said and lots of little polythene bags for your sweaters she insisted that i bought a pair of laceup shoes but ive got a perfectly good pair of boots i wailed kinky she added darkly she lent me a silk dress but refused to let me take any of my more outrageous clothes you want to borrow them while im away i grumbled ill look such a frump pendle wont recognize me but i managed to sneak in my green culotte dress when she wasnt looking now remember she warned me lots of housework clean the bath dont wipe your makeup off on the towel and for gods sake dont smoke in bed these old houses burn down very easily youd better take my knitting too but i cant knit i protested that doesnt matter just take it out of its bag from time to time and count a few stitches it gives the right impression you seem to know a lot about it i said nastily where did it get you the mothers adored me she said airily it was the sons who went off me pendle picked me up at the office about five he was wearing a dark grey sweater which emphasized his pallor if we dont hit heavy traffic he said putting my luggage in the boot we should be there by nine he was smoking incessantly and seemed very much on edge we didnt talk much then my tummy started rumbling i hadnt eaten since breakfast theres a slab of chocolate in the back he said i found it and as pendle wasnt hungry wolfed the lot and then felt sick before we get there i said licking my fingers can we sort your family out a bit pretty complicated he said but ill try and explain my father as you know is dead and im the eldest then theres my sister linn who has emotional problems and works in manchester so she probably wont be there then theres my younger brother jack hes only twentyeight but hes already on his second marriage he used to be a terrible rake but hes running the family firm now and seems to have settled down with jack you have to take the smooth with the smooth but youll like him everyone does there was a trace of bitterness in his voice whats his wife like i asked maggie very young very spoilt i dont think shes very nice but like jack you cant help liking her theyre staying with my mother until their house is built so therell be your mother maggie and jack i said ticking them off on my fingers and to confuse you further there might be ace whos he my stepbrother my father was married before but his wife died when ace was a baby poor little boy who brought him up my father wasnt the sort to stay a widower long he married my mother almost immediately and we were all brought up together is he married too ace he was but his wife was killed in a car crash two years ago she was driving to meet him at the airport the roads were icy oh how awful i said ghastly particularly as she was pregnant he absolutely worshipped her we all did we never thought anyone would be good enough for ace but she was pendle had never sounded so enthusiastic about anyone what did he do after that he was working for panorama in london then he landed a job in new york for american television he roves all over the world he hasnt been home since elizabeth died but my mother said he might possibly be back this weekend the conversation dwindled i slept fitfully and wondered if it would be worth letting my head slip on to pendles shoulder but thought better of it as a few stars made a tentative appearance i speculated about pendles brothers jack the reformed rake whom everyone liked ace whom no one was good enough to marry a slim white moon slipped between the stars we were now driving over cobbled streets when we stopped for petrol a blast of icy wind came through the door not far now said pendle well be there in twenty minutes the hills began to grow into mountains ive always been frightened by mountains and i suddenly shivered as i wondered what i really knew about the silent withdrawn man beside me i put on some scent to give me confidence beside the road there was a gleam of silver thats grasmere he said a few minutes later he swung off the road up a winding drive the headlights showed heavy undergrowth and brambles hanging in festoons on either side here we are he said hooting his horn i could only see that the house was large and hung with creepers as we opened the car doors a black labrador and a large english setter came bounding out wagging their tails and barking amiably the front door opened and we were flooded in a stream of light i was quaking with nerves as i saw an old woman standing in the doorway she had an apron on pendles mother i walked forward smiling hello mr pendle she wheezed obviously not pendles mother hello mrs braddock said pendle its good to see you back after so long come into the warm mrs mulholland must be a cold customer i thought not to come rushing out to welcome him i knew what my mother was like whenever i came home i followed mrs braddock into the hall which was huge and baronial and covered in faded crimson wallpaper ill just help mr pendle with the cases she said a moment later pendle followed me he looked furious a muscle was twitching in his cheek im afraid my family arent here theyve gone to a party in ambleside so wed better eat now ill show you your room i expect youd like a wash id been so steamed up to meet his mother it was a terrible anticlimax i followed him upstairs along a dark winding passage to my room im sorry its frightfully cold in here he said drawing the curtains and turning up the central heating if only he had taken me in his arms then and there everything might have been all right its lovely i said ill just clean up and come down on closer inspection i found it wasnt at all lovely none of the drawers had been cleaned out there was only one broken coathanger and even i who never noticed dust couldnt miss the thick coating on the dressing table i couldnt imagine my mother having anyone to stay and not giving them flowers the only compensation was the large double bed i was strangely chilled by that room however i redid my face and calmed my wild curls abit in the diningroom i found places had been laid for pendle and me at opposite ends of a long table mrs braddock served us watery soup its incredibly difficult to drink soup quietly in a huge empty room and then we had stale game pie and cold potatoes which stuck in my throat luckily pendle opened a bottle of wine mrs braddocks been with us for years her husband looks after the garden and the stables i dont know who else would put up with my mother the two dogs sat on either side of me drooling at the mouth then the setter put a large speckled paw on my knee theyre lovely i said what are they called wordsworth and coleridge said pendle coleridge is the setter i dont expect anyones remembered to feed them i was relieved when he picked up both his and my game pie gave one to each dog and then lit the inevitable cigarette the wine was stealing down me and i began to perk up we had coffee in the drawingroom which was also huge and shabby and full of beautiful things a bowl of dahlias which had seen better days were shedding their petals on the smeared table on one wall there was a large square of much lighter red wallpaper where a picture must have recently hung oh god said pendle my mother must have flogged the romney ace will do his nut i huddled by the fire clutching coleridge for warmth a fat orange cat was asleep on the sofa her names antonia fraser said pendle ruefully have some brandy i oughtnt to i said i dont want to be tight the first time i meet your mother well im going to he said so you might as well i noticed his hand was shaking as he poured out two glasses he was so jumpy he was making me more and more nervous i was just about to examine the photographs on the desk when i heard voices and doors slamming here they are said pendle hed gone as white as a sheet we went into the hall the front door was thrown open a very beautiful woman stood in the doorway she was as slim as a blade darlings she cried rushing towards us how awful you must think us we didnt think youd be here for hours jacks wife pendles sister this is my mother said pendle my jaw clanged like a visor but you cant be i said youre too young fatuous remark but she was delighted this is pru said pendle you must call me rose she said taking my hand oh look naughty coleridge has moulted all over you she probably hadnt altered her style of dressing for twenty years but she was bang in fashion now with rippling blonde waves round eyes and a tiny scarlet mouth shed have set them by the ears in the kings road too in that marvellous fifties crêpedechine dress i felt absurdly selfconscious in my twinset and tweeds she didnt look so young in the drawingroom but she quickly switched off the overhead light and put on two side lights how are you pen darling you look tired have you been overworking such a good party maggie and jack are still there i thought i heard voices outside said pendle rose looked sheepish james copeland dropped me off linns james copeland rose nodded oh god said pendle is he after you too well a bit too embarrassing really my daughter linn gets so cross when her young men run after me she added to me i stared at her fascinated id never known a mother like this skipping around in raver kit pinching her daughters boyfriends do get primrose and me a drink darling she said to pendle her names prudence said pendle acidly and shes got a drink whens ace coming back rose turned her eyes to the ceiling oh dont remind me the day after tomorrow no dont glare at me like that pen you know im fond of ace but he makes me feel so hopeless and hes bound to nag about money how is money oh disastrous as ever look how shabby everything is she picked at a piece of cotton wool oozing out of the yellow sofa jack and maggies house is costing the earth another car drew up outside more doors slammed and we heard voices in the hall pendles face was expressionless but once again that muscle was twitching in his cheek dont spend all night said an irritable male voice the door was pushed open and a man walked in his face creased into an incredulous smile youre here already you must have blown a gasket on the motorway pendle looked rather ostentatiously at his watch its already eleven oclock he said god is it that late i am sorry he turned to me this is my brother jack said pendle jack mulholland was outstandingly goodlooking and already going to seed he had terrific bags under his eyes and was beginning to put on weight under the chin tall and broadshouldered he had those blue sexy bloodshot eyes that looked as if hed been swimming under water too long and he knew how to use them he looked into my face for a minute then very slowly ran his eyes over my body then back to my face again as though he had to memorize every detail a smile spread over his face at least ships but then you always had excellent taste pen i squirmed with embarrassment and pleasure wheres maggie said rose redoing her face darling do get us drink said rose jack filled up our glasses and poured two more for rose and himself pendle raised his eyebrows prus not a great drinker dont be a spoilsport said rose well heres to you darlings and a happy weekend that was bloody good you getting bobby canfield off said jack everyones talking about it round here mrs braddocks started a scrapbook of your cuttings said rose i took a sip of my drink and nearly choked through streaming eyes i caught jack laughing at me he is attractive i thought the moment he comes into the room the temperature goes up at that moment a girl came in and the temperature shot even higher she was everything fashion magazines say you shouldnt be her brilliant red hair looked as though it had been cut with garden shears she wore so much eyeliner her eyes slanted into her ears and she was falling out of a dress two sizes too small for her and jackedin at the waist with a green leather belt but she was gorgeous any man confronted with that glowing vitality would want to tear those terrible clothes off her and tumble her into bed she stood in the doorway staring at pendle all of a sudden the room became very still the colour drained out of pendles face hello maggie his voice was curiously dry you look well this is pru she turned and smiled at me her eyes were like headlights i wanted to blink how odd she said slowly she looks rather like me i blushed i looked like a ghost beside this buxom radiant creature not odd at all said jack with a slightly twisted smile mulhollands always go for redheads maggie sat on the arm of pendles chair get me a drink jack she said and as jack went over to the drinks tray added quite audibly you shouldnt have stayed away so long pen something funny was going on but i was too tired to work it out the brandy was sending me to sleep i hardly listened as they swapped family gossip i was only conscious that beneath the superficial banter there was an underlying tension it was jack who noticed i was falling off my chair poor little prus half dead for goodness sake take her up to her room pen i staggered to my feet dont bother i can easily find my own way will you be all right said pendle of course she wont said jack leaping up and taking my arm come on lovie say goodnight to everyone it was arctic in the hall you go on up said jack ill try and dig you out a hotwater bottle after a few false starts i found my room i hardly had the energy to undress and take off my makeup i laughed as i remembered janes instructions about folding my clothes up neatly that lot downstairs wouldnt care if i strewed them all over the landing by the time jack came upstairs i was sitting in bed in my new black nightdress im afraid ive drawn a blank on the hotwater bottle he said will you be warm enough he added standing by the bed and looking down at me im fine i said i was coming out in goose pimples but it wasnt because of the cold you look very fit for human consumption he said examining my back youre still brown its always the bits that dont show that last longest i said slowly jack mulholland undoubtedly had a way with women like some people have with animals he made them relax before i realized it hed put a warm hand on my bare back and bending down kissed me slowly on the mouth after a moment he broke off but his hand was still caressing its way down my back goodness hes lethal i thought get a grip on yourself prudence hes the sort of man wholl stop at nothing wow said jack dreamily youre gorgeous and he was about to kiss me again when a familiar voice said everything all right i pulled away from jack as though id been stung pendle stood in the doorway his face was as enigmatic as ever thats done it i thought i wonder how long hes been standing there jack laughed he didnt seem remotely embarrassed oh dear ive lapsed again he said id better ring up redheads anonymous chapter five i was woken next morning by rain like machinegun fire on the roof and coleridge and wordsworth lying on my feet the curtain let in long fingers of light across the ceiling i looked at my watch it was eleven oclock i had a bath and dressed no one was about downstairs i went into the drawingroom last nights jetsam of glasses cigarette ends and coffee was still lying about i pulled back the musty dark blue velvet curtains and caught my breath at the desolation of the scene before me down below in the valley was a huge black lake and all around like dark sleeping beasts lay the mountains their peaks shrouded in mist the garden was a wilderness of tangled shrubbery lichen crawled over the paved terrace and id never seen such rain sweeping in great curtains across the lake stripping the last leaves from the trees flattening the blackened dahlias there was no colour except where the beech trees still smouldered among the dark pines this is pendles country i thought country that would put winter into anyones soul oh god i did hope he wasnt upset about jack kissing me last night remembering janes advice about helping in the house i gathered up the glasses and cups found the kitchen and washed them up not so easy as there was no washingup liquid where on earth was everyone i was dying for some coffee suddenly i heard a noise and poking my head out of the kitchen door saw a tall man with a black and grey flecked crew cut wearing a college scarf and a tweed jacket tiptoeing towards the front door carrying his shoes i couldnt see his face the next moment hed opened the door and shot out closing it very quietly behind him he must be one of roses boyfriends i went back to the drawingroom and had another look at that terrifying view drinking it all in said a voice it was maggie in a dressinggown she didnt look so ravishing this morning deathly pale with her mascara smudged underneath her eyes you havent got a cigarette have you she asked jacks gone over to the mill with pendle and ive run out i got a packet out of my bag and handed it to her she lit a cigarette with a trembling hand god i needed this we rather overdid the boozing last night what a fantastic view this is i said maggie shrugged her shoulders it gives me the creeps particularly on days like this i want to go back to london but jacks so keen on the mill i suppose were stuck here for good i asked her if i could make a cup of coffee oh hell its mrs braddocks day off so everything goes to pot tomorrow shes got to blitz the house from top to toe ace is coming home hell be appalled at the state of the place she looked round grimacing at the sticky rings left by glasses all over the furniture the peeling paint the dead flowers thats the odd thing about my motherinlaw she went on as long as she can have stunning clothes and pay her bridge debts she doesnt mind if the house falls to bits we went into the kitchen antonia fraser jumped off a chair and started weaving between my legs mewing for food i found some bacon and eggs shall i make you some i asked maggie shuddered i never touch breakfast anyway im getting disgustingly fat ive put on a stone since i married jack boredom i suppose wheres pendles mother i asked putting rashers into the frying pan rose she never surfaces before lunchtime pendle said she was formidable i said so i imagined shed be all tweeds and corrugated hair maggie laughed shes stunning isnt she gosh that bacon smells good while youre making it you might as well cook some for me i made some coffee and dished the bacon and eggs on to two plates and we took them into the drawingroom how long have you been married i asked about two years it seems ages longer she turned her headlight eyes on me did you know i was going to marry pendle before i met jack suddenly the room seemed to go dark no i didnt know i said yes it was funny really i came up for a holiday when i was only eighteen and met pendle and we had a most terrific affair not just bed but endless gazing into each others eyes and walks in the moonlight and passionate letters full of quotations you know how good pendle is at making things serious i wanted to get married at once but again you know pendle he swore he loved me but he thought we ought to wait six months so we could find somewhere proper to live and then jack came home from south africa his first marriage was on the rocks by then he was all brown and his hair was bleached almost white and he seemed to be always laughing and pulling fivers out of his pocket i came up to see pendle for the weekend and fell in love with jack and we eloped rose thought it hysterical but everyone else was livid particularly ace for the first month we holedup in a little hotel in ambleside terrified that pen would turn up with a hatchet but typical dontloseyourcool pendle he sent us a nice letter and later even a wedding present i was disappointed ive always wanted to have men fighting over me then aces wife was killed in a car crash so the limelight was directed off jack and me we all met up at the funeral then ace took this job working for american television and jack took over the mill i felt sick i couldnt finish my breakfast so this was the girl pendle had loved who had broken through that icy reserve knowing pendle he would never forgive her for jilting him and marrying jack but if he had forgiven her he must still love her why the hell had he brought me here why is their stepbrother called ace i asked in a desperate attempt to change the subject hes really ivan ace stems from when they were children three boys and a girl with jack the youngest ace king pendle queen linn and jack you see ace stuck as a nickname whats he like maggie took one of the photographs down from the desk and handed it to me it was a face you would never forget blackhaired beetlebrowed very deepset eyes high cheekbones like pendles a large aquiline nose something slightly cruel about the mouth a tough haughty uncompromising face used to getting its own way i wouldnt like to meet him on a dark night i said lightly oh i would a dreamy expression came over maggies face you cant help fancying ace hes a cross between mr rochester and darcy but theres a kind of gipsy passion about him like heathcliff why is everybody so scared of him maggie took another of my cigarettes he holds the purse strings old mr mulholland realized what a spendthrift rose was and left all the money to ace hes generous mind you but nothing could be enough for rose he doesnt suffer fools gladly but hes still wildly attractive sos jack i said quickly maggie looked at me out of the corner of her eyes oh jack has very taking ways particularly with other peoples girlfriends and a very good line in smooth talk just like his mum but were hell together we rat all the time now if i were married to ace it would be different i wouldnt dare behave horribly ive always wanted a man i can honour and obey she really shocked me lets go and get rose up she said she should have finished her exercises by now i took rose some coffee and maggie went on ahead carrying my cigarette roses bedroom quite unlike the rest of the house was enchanting all pink silk and rosebuds she was fully madeup wearing a pink negligee and painting her nails darlings you shouldnt have bothered its terrible to leave you on your own on your first day she added to me but those wretched boys have rushed off to look at the mill jacks like a little boy with a new toy maggie pulled a face behind her back they make the most lovely tweeds said rose not quite my style but the americans go wild about them youll have to get jack to give you a piece and have it made up into a skirt when you get back to london the telephone rang and maggie rushed off to answer it but was back in a few seconds some awfulsounding man for you rose she said rose brightened pinched one of my cigarettes and the matches and went out carefully shutting the door behind her its that ghastly copeland linns boyfriend said maggie trying on one of roses lipsticks and wiping it off on the counterpane hes always hanging around i once asked jack what his childhood was like he just said my mother was always in love we couldnt hear what rose was saying but her laugh rang out over and over again copeland once told her she had a beautiful laugh said maggie sourly and shes been behaving like a hyena ever since does she have lots of people after her i asked oh millions said maggie seems extraordinary doesnt it she must be at least fifty but i suppose shes only a few years older than bardot i hope i have as much fun when i get to her age what does copeland do i said calls himself a writer but weve never seen any evidence of it he was attached to manchester university but he gave it up to write full time and pursue rose i wondered if he was the tall man id seen creeping out that morning i examined roses dressingtable id never seen so many bottles her knowledge of makeup and skin care must be positively encyclopaedic in the middle tucked into a framed photograph of jack was a snapshot of a little girl with blonde hair and blue eyes whos she i asked maggie lucasta jacks child from his first marriage said maggie shes ravishing i said and suddenly as maggies eyes narrowed i realized id put my foot in it well she certainly doesnt get her looks from her mother she said sharply fays an old frump i cant think why jack ever married her and lucastas so bloody spoilt she winds jack round her little finger shes terribly jealous of me of course and youre terribly jealous of her i thought does she come over here often as little as i can help it shes an absolute menace when she does her outburst however was checked by rose coming back pink with excitement admiring my beautiful grandchild she said seeing me still holding the photograph isnt she a poppet that was dear professor copeland she went on hes coming to dinner theres no one to cook objected maggie so there isnt never mind theres buckets of drink and we can always go out i thought wed ask admiral walker and the simons and have a little party maggie who was gazing through the rainsmeared window at the grey sky and careering leaves cheered up a bit its the last one well have she said youll have to give up your cakes and ale once ace arrives yes said rose gaily i must remember to stop the milkman tomorrow and although they smoked their way through three packets of my cigarettes and i cooked and washed up lunch and tea and the thought of pendle and maggie was never far from my mind that day was one of the happiest i spent with the mulhollands it was like being in the flat with jane i cant say the same of the evening pendle and jack got home about six jack looked tired and headed straight for the drinks tray pendle kissed rose and ruffled yes actually ruffled my hair he seemed curiously elated im sorry we slunk off at the crack of dawn he said to me but weve had a marvellous day jacks done wonders with the mill you should be proud of him maggie he looked at her for the first time oh i am i am she said have you been all right jack asked me pouring himself a tumblerful of whisky and not even bothering to dilute it with water shes been perfect said maggie a walking cigarette machine and endless lovely food appearing on trays there was a slight edge to her voice jack smiled and said i expect youve waited on them hand and foot my mother is the laziest woman in the world but my wife runs her a close second he squeezed roses hand as he said this but the look he directed at maggie was decidedly unfriendly pendle lit a cigarette people in boiler suits kept rushing up to me he said telling me what a great thing jacks been for the mill he spends enough time there snapped maggie at least i get regular meals at the canteen said jack did you get my blue suit out of the cleaners no said maggie youve had all bloody day did you go down the house and talk to the plumber no maggies lashes swept down over half her cheek well what the hell have you been doing entertaining lovely pru said maggie demurely i know what a fan of hers you arewe couldnt leave her alone on her first day jack shot her a murderous look by the way lucastas coming next weekend he said christ muttered maggie thats all we need my blood froze as i looked at pendle his pale grey eyes were gleaming hes enjoying it i thought he likes them sniping at each other professor copeland and a few people are coming over this evening said rose oh god said jack draining his glass of whisky for once i thought we might get an early night i felt very depressed as i went up to change then i thought to hell with it wheres your fighting spirit put on your warpaint and three pairs of false eyelashes and go out and get him i wore a very simple very short tunic in coffeecoloured crêpe with a wide belt at least i had a waist to belt which is more than maggie had and i brushed my curls sleek to my head i was pleased with my appearance but it might just be the mulhollands mirrors they were so dusty one tended to look good in them jack meeting me in the hall gave an appreciative whistle you look like a greek youth he said is that nice or nasty nice and extremely disturbing i was pleased that maggie wore a purple dress obviously bought before she put on weight she had added black fishnet stockings yesterdays green belt and jade earrings that looks smart mocked jack it must have shrunk at the cleaners maggie scowled at him at that moment the door bell rang answering it jack found a man from the inland revenue come to talk to rose about her tax he was pastyfaced and bald with a few strands of hair combed across his head like anchovies across a boiled egg it isnt a frightfully convenient moment said jack of course it is said a voice and the next moment rose swept down the stairs poured into a black velvet dress which showed off her lovely figure with pearls gleaming round her neck and at her ears mr ramsbotham she said taking both the taxmans hands im so sorry i havent answered your letters but ive been away come in and have an enormous drink were just about to have a party you simply must stay jack darling mr ramsbotham wants a large whisky and ignoring jacks signals of horror she swept him into the drawingroom and introduced him to the rest of us hasnt the weather been frightful she went on were thinking of building an ark mr ramsbotham went rather pink and muttered that perhaps hed better have a private word with rose as matters were getting rather pressing and he was expected home for supper nonsense nonsense said rose airily its friday a man must unwind after a long week we cant talk about boring tax now actually im thrilled you dropped in this evening i know youre a racing man and i just thought you might be able to give us some tips for newcastle tomorrow heres your drink thank you jack darling one had to hand it to her within seconds mr ramsbotham was totally hypnotized discussing racing from nose to nose on the sofa jack and pendle were still talking about the mill i sipped my drink and talked to maggie about pop music and took another good look at her sizing up the competition she had sat down opposite pendle and kept crossing and recrossing her legs so he must be getting a constant suggestion of gleaming white checkered thighs she looked carnal and hemmed in and not what mother would call a lady but who wants to be a lady when they can exude so much animal health in such a dangerously unhealthy way unlike rose she wasnt at all flirtatious she didnt flutter her eyelashes or flaunt her bosom she just stared at pendle with that stripping look you felt if youd walked between them it would have burnt you like a laser beam youre not to call me mrs mulholland any more my names rose and im going to call you arnold rose was saying to mr ramsbotham jack darling youre not doing your stuff arnolds drinks nearly empty oh dear said maggie scooping up a handful of nuts i was going to go on a diet before ace came back wasnt i i wish i had a small bust like you pru its so much easier for clothes she looked complacently down at her own cleavage bitch i thought perhaps she does mind jack chatting me up after all do you think hes here for the night i muttered to pendle as vatman enthusiastically accepted a refill expect so at least he can dance with copeland chapter six it was an odd party jack mixed a hells brew with a brandy base i was as high as a kite after the first glass everyone seemed determined to drink as much as possible as fast as possible to wash away the boredom i suppose two hours later things were really in their stride pendle was behaving impeccably filling my glass plying me with drink but there was no message in his eyes in jacks eyes however there was too much he never missed a chance to reach my hand or squeeze me round the waist every time i looked up i seemed to see those dissipated blue eyes smiling at me tinkle tinkle went the ice in the glasses conversation became more extravagant the ashtrays filled and spilled over my smile was as brittle as a dried chickenbone as i saw the passionate concentration on pendles face each time he talked to maggie i talked to one of roses bridge friends about hats everyone fell over coleridge and wordsworth who bored of barking at the door bell stretched out in front of the blazing log fire the room was impossibly hot because rose worried that professor copeland might not appreciate the chilliness of large english houses had also turned the central heating up full blast the professor arrived late and stood in the doorway for a minute with his head held high so that everyone stopped talking and looked at him he likes to make an entrance said maggie he was wearing a grey herring bone jacket a blue denim buttondown shirt a black knitted tie grey flannel trousers and a big black velours hat which he left in the hall in his middle forties he was one of those tall thin craggy galbrathian american intellectuals with an impossibly slow drawling voice who one felt ought to have one hip permanently hitched on to a broken column and be rabbiting on about the beauties of ancient civilization he was also without doubt the man id seen creeping out in his stockinged feet that morning almost immediately rose brought him over to meet me prus a writer too she said airily so i know youll get along professor copeland concentrated on lighting a revolting pipe looked at me with hooded eyes and in a slow drawling voice asked what i was working on at the moment i was tempted to say pendle then said i was only a copywriter and at present was wrestling with a tinned peaches campaign not south african i hope i stifled a yawn and shook my head and professor copeland in between puffs went on to say that hed never met an ad man who didnt yearn to be a real creative writer and he was darn sure id got a half finished narvel in my bottom drawer stifling another yawn i asked him what he was working on at the moment he said he was researching a narvel which was set in africa which he found ethnically interesting and what a lonely business writing was and how hed given up teaching because he found it so exhausting to carncentrate on creative writing and on and on and on god he was a monster as long in inches as he was short on charm out of the corner of my eye i could see maggie bending over the sofa talking to pendle i didnt like the way she was letting her hand trail along the back of his neck whats your novel about i said immediately professor copeland waved a long finger at me no no he said crinkling his eyes in what he no doubt thought was a fascinating smile ive had so many good plots pinched in the past i know you wouldnt do it deliberately but youd be bound to talk about it when you get back to london i know what vultures these advertising men are i hope youve insured the bit youve already written i said crossly come on professor drink up said jack managing to top up copelands glass and pat my bottom at the same time well just a small one said copeland normally i dont drink i find it dulls the senses but ive had an exhausting week i guess so i owe myself a little relaxation with wine and charming women it was really roses evening what with vatman admiral walker copeland and sundry elderly letches vying for her favours she was well away she put an old record of night and day on the gramophone and danced around waving her cigarette holder in time to the music and sending a cloud of ash on to the floor come along admiral she said gaily start the ball rolling the admiral who had a red face and a laugh like basil brush whistled through his moustache with excitement and clutched rose gingerly as if she was a bag of eggs if i hold you up to my ear admiral said rose fluttering her eyelashes will i be able to hear the sea god awful old bore said copeland scathingly as the admiral breathed even faster never stops verbalizing about his darned convoys i better talk with him later this evening to get some more material ive got a blimpish character like him in my novel and he was off really it was impossible to tear copeland away from himself for more than a second thank god the record ended and rose claimed him for the next dance next moment vatman had taken the floor he had removed his jacket to show great sweaty patches under his armpits and was sweeping one of roses bridge friends round like something out of come dancing i inherited the admiral who stood bristling with rage watching copeland and rose damn shame mulholland isnt alive he muttered never have let a pansy like that in here nor would young ace for that matter whens he coming home some time tomorrow i said about time too place has gone to rack and ruin since he left best of the bunch you know oh jacks got charm but he cant really carry his corn and as for that pendle chilly fella always seems to have given too many pints of blood i knew i ought to defend pendle but the admiral seemed about to have a coronary over copeland as it was never have allowed a pansy like that in here he muttered again hes writing a book about africa i said never bin there dont want to full of blackamores cant trust these writer chappies just read a biography of monty fella made out he was a homo damned cheek i tried to distract him with small talk but it was like trying to amuse a dog tied up outside the supermarket waiting for its mistress to come out vatman his bald patch glistening with sweat now paused in his fishtails and telemaques to help himself to some pâté and biscuits on the table roses bridge friend took the opportunity to escape his clutches where on earth did rose dig him up she said in a horrified whisper i left her and the admiral to it and went and stood by pendle you made me love you i didnt want to do it sang al jolson are you enjoying yourself said pendle with a slightly twisted smile surprisingly yes i said oh why didnt he ask me to dance vatman who was really getting uncorked now was trying to cut in on copeland and rose may i personally congratulate the lovely lady of the house on her pâté he said and request the pleasure of a dance in a minute arnold cried rose merrily vatman helped himself to more pâté washed down by several other peoples drinks pendle and i watched him fascinated suddenly there was a gasp of horror behind us it was maggie she had turned green whats the matter said pendle do you recognize the pâté bowl she said faintly its nearly empty i said it belongs to coleridge and wordsworth i forgot to put it down for them ramsbums downed an entire tin of chappie we all looked at each other in horror then collapsed in uncontrollable giggles id better whisk it away said maggie wiping her eyes before ramsbum starts lifting his leg gimme gimme what i cry for sang professor copeland in a pleasant baritone foxtrotting past with rose you know youve got the kind of kisses that id die for sang rose smiling up at him the admiral went purple god the poor admiral i thought its all too much like followmyleader the absent linn after copeland the admiral after rose jack after me me after pendle pendle i dreaded after maggie and maggie i imagined after ace when he arrived id had too much to drink everyones in love with the wrong people in this house i said to pendle he looked at me sharply what on earth do you mean but before i had time to answer jack came over and asked me to dance i wasnt very steady on my feet but as it was oldfashioned music i was entitled to cling on to him did you have a meaningful duologue with the professor he asked hes ghastly i said the admiral thinks hes a pouf do you no dear said jack putting on a camp voice but he helps out if theyre busy it wasnt all that funny but i fell about laughing jacks arms tightened round me christ youre pretty when the record ended maggie got up and put on a rod stewart record and then she started to dance by herself the way she slid into the rhythm was unbelievable jungle sensual i quickly looked at pendle but his face was turned towards her he was incredibly still come on pen she said softly come and dance with me in one fluid movement he got up hed never danced with me but with maggie he was inspired ive never seen anything so provocative as the way they moved their hips pendles face was completely deadpan undulating there he looked once again as pale and slim and dangerous as a cobra i was reminded of the way he had behaved in court the rest of us were mesmerized only rose and copeland continued to resolve noisily in one corner jack lit a cigarette and handed it to me and then lit one for himself im afraid weve just witnessed a chemical reaction he said flatly come and look at the moon he took my arm and led me into the hall where vatman was on the telephone but monica i shall be home shortly he was saying but there is a lot of paperwork to go through jack took me into the diningroom he didnt bother to switch on the light there was no moon outside it was hidden by pale luminous clouds scurrying across the sky the rain had stopped and the lake gleamed white in the valley beautiful isnt it said jack i love this place even if it is falling to pieces maggie hates it i often feel if i packed in the works and got a job in london shed be happier shes very beautiful i said dully pendles just wanted her for a long time at last it was out in the open i stood very still but she doesnt want him doesnt she jack drew on his cigarette i dont know she certainly wants him to go on wanting her which comes to the same thing he ought to live with her for six months that would cure him but i dont understand i said miserably why did he bring me up here i guess he heard rumours that maggie and i were having trouble probably from my mother who loves stirring things he knows my weakness for redheads particularly beautiful ones and brought you up here as bait the one thing that drives maggie mad is my chasing after other women then you think pendle doesnt give a damn for me i tried to stop my voice trembling i think youve been dealt a marked card darling whether he likes you or not is immaterial the only thing he wants is to get maggie back and hes waited a long time to get her beneath that rockhard exterior theres a heart of stone oh dear he might have been rodney talking im telling you this because i like you very much and i want you to get out before you get in too deep i felt the tears rolling down my cheeks at the futility of the last few months ive made you cry im sorry it doesnt matter i sobbed im sorry for you too can i borrow your handkerchief please it was silk and smelt of expensive aftershave i blew my nose noisily i got it all wrong i said i thought he was serious because he didnt make a pass at me people usually do you see im not surprised said jack and took me very gently in his arms its strange how unhappiness sparks off a mood of frantic sensuality jack was just a handsome man kissing me because i was miserable but as i felt those powerful shoulders and the thick hair beneath my fingers and breathed in his expensive cologne he suddenly seemed like a god i kissed him back as though he were the last man on earth wow he said wow and he kissed me again we were so engrossed we never heard the door open suddenly we were flooded in light we swung round blinking jack kept his arms round my shoulders towering in the doorway looking faintly amused was a man i instantly recognized from his photograph as ace mulholland everyones playing general post as usual he said now i really know im home jack gave a shout of delight and bounded forward ace my god how marvellous we were expecting you tomorrow so i see said ace dryly rose everyone ace is back jack shouted down the hall rose gave a muffled shriek and after a few seconds came running downstairs patting her hair her dress was on inside out goodness knows what shed been up to for heavens sake jack dont play silly games then she saw ace and turned pale my god ace how wonderful to see you so nice to feel wanted said ace dryly i couldnt take any more as i fled upstairs i heard him ask whos that for a minute i thought maggied lost weight pens girlfriend said jack shes called prudence ace laughed a singularly inappropriate name he said i was horrified when i looked in the mirror crying had streaked my mascara kissing had smudged my lipstick like a clown the top buttons of my dress were undone and my bra strap had slipped down to my elbow i washed my face and tried to screw up enough courage to go downstairs i jumped in terror at the knock on the door to my amazement it was pendle pru he said are you ok suddenly you disappeared ace has arrived a day early and my mothers having hysterics come and meet him he took my hand and led me downstairs stopping on the way to say sorry ive been uptight this place always has a devastating effect on me thank you for being so sweet he squeezed my hand and suddenly kissed me on the cheek that threw me i nearly started crying again what the hell was going on perhaps things were going so well with maggie he could afford to be nice to me on the other hand it was only jacks word against his all that talk about pendle and maggie might easily be jacks method of prising me loose from pendle in the drawingroom i was hailed like a longlost sister conversation was very sticky with everyone trying to conceal the fact that they were half cut all the guests had evaporated which only served to emphasize the chaos a battalion of empty bottles stood on the table records out of their sleeves lay like a handful of loose change in the corner pru darling said rose pronouncing her words very carefully this is ace twentyfour hours early but no less welcome for that ace got to his feet and shook hands with me giving no sign that he had already met me in less happy circumstances come and sit down he said pointing to the big armchair right away from jack pendle sat on the arm maggie and jack were holding hands on the sofa why are you a day early asked jack the venezuelan riots were crushed much quicker than anyone thought they would be there was no point in hanging around so i flew straight back how long will you be here asked rose hard to tell perhaps indefinitely the bbc have offered me a news programme that would mean youd be in england all the time said rose faintly yes said ace with a smile that didnt reach his eyes then i could keep an eye on you all couldnt i hows lucasta he said to maggie and jack oh shes absolutely gorgeous now said maggie enthusiastically weve got her next weekend so youll be able to see her shed certainly changed her tune not a trace of the wicked stepmother anymore humbuggery is legal after ninety days at sea i muttered i could now understand why they were all so wary of him he was tall easily the tallest of the three brothers and even broader than jack and his skin was tanned to the colour of old leather hed grown a black moustache since the photograph was taken which made him look not unlike a venezuelan bandit himself and he obviously hadnt slept for days but even exhausted he was formidable he was one of those tough selfassured men who rove round the world in search of truth always where the action is watching wars begin and governments fall each time he opened his mouth i expected the panorama signature tune to strike up he had a rough abrupt way of shooting out questions then listening closely to the answers i sat in a semicomatose state as he asked jack about the mill pendle about the bar and maggie about the new house just as if he were conducting a series of short sharp interviews each time rose chipped in he brushed her aside occasionally his eyes flickered over me my turn would come later i dont like him i decided hes a bully rose picked petulantly at her nail polish for a few minutes then announced she was off to bed i went too in the hall we found someone had left the telephone off the hook what a frightful waste of electricity said rose putting it back this time when i got upstairs i strewed my clothes all over the bedroom and when i lay down the room went round and round chapter seven i dreamt i was trapped by falling masonry with the flames flickering towards me i woke up pouring with sweat to find coleridge lying heavily across my legs after yesterdays deluge the waterfall outside the window was thundering on the rocks which did nothing to alleviate my excruciating hangover i lay for a bit trying to adjust to the pain after all people learnt to live with suffering people with cancer and odette churchill having her fingernails pulled out just relax into it i told myself clutching my head i gave a low moan it was no good i got up and staggered down the passage to the bathroom where i was confronted by the most glorious back view broad brown shoulders thick black hair curling into the nape of the neck powerful haunches wrapped in a scarlet towel and long brown muscular legs perhaps id died after all and gone to heaven next moment my illusions were shattered ace mulholland turned round the bottom half of his face covered with lather under the black thatch of hair his eyes were swollen with sleep and not particularly friendly wont be long he said starting to scrape off the soap at least the rains stopped i said faintly hanging on to the door handle for support we might get a lovely day then i remembered i was wearing my black temptress seethrough nightie which must look pretty incongruous in my present state of collapse so i went back to my room and sat on my bed groaning if i didnt get a drink pretty soon the top of my head would come off i put on a brown sweater and a pair of brown corduroy jodhpurs which were fashionable that autumn id never been on a horse in my life it took centuries to get dressed and i had awful trouble with my new walking shoes every time i bent down to do up the laces i was nearly sick it was a bit late anyway to try and impress ace with my respectability i threw my walking shoes in the corner and put on my orange boots i seemed to have gone downhill rather fast in the last two days clinging on to the banisters holding my head in place with my left hand i found ace prowling round the downstairs rooms drinking black coffee and looking bootfaced certainly the state of decay looked even worse by daylight coleridge now stretched out in the hall thumped his tail oh please dont i groaned have you got any alkaseltzer youll never keep it down in that condition he said ill get you a fernet branca in the kitchen i found mrs braddock noisily washing up trembling with rage that shed been caught on the hop mrs mulholland should have warned me mr ace was coming back she grumbled she didnt know i said remembering roses insideout dress she was more surprised than anyone probably never read mr aces letter properly and i was going to take the budgie in for a checkup this morning said mrs braddock viciously crashing a saucepan down on the drainingboard which didnt really help matters ace came in with a glass i gulped it down then choked youve poisoned me i croaked for a second i thought i was going to explode then suddenly it was a horror film in reverse the terrified creature being torn apart by draculas teeth was transformed into the radiant bride again suddenly i was all right i shook my head three times it didnt even hurt very clever i muttered ace regarded me thoughtfully then waiting until mrs braddock had stumped off to collect some more glasses said do you always drink as much as this i looked him straight in the eyes no i said ive been corrupted by your family he sighed i was afraid you had where is everyone still asleep before you came down i discovered a man from the tax office stretched out in the broom cupboard i giggled he had a heavenly time last night well he wasnt feeling so hot this morning but was coherent enough before he left to give me a few details about the financial setup here ill have to have a session with my stepmother later oh dear cant you wait till tomorrow i dont imagine shell be quite up to it today i thought youd sleep in too i havent got used to the time yet coleridge wandered in gazed at me with lustrous brown eyes then put a large speckled paw on my knee if he tells you he hasnt had a mouthful since yesterday hes lying said ace ive just fed him hes terribly nice i said scratching him behind the ears wheres wordsworth buggered off somewhere probably after a bitch in the village you havent possibly got a cigarette have you i said i left mine upstairs no said ace youd do better with some fresh air dyou want to come and look around outside all right i said after all it was important to get on with pendles family although id been getting on a bit too well with jack ace got me one of roses old sheepskin coats from behind the door picked up a large parcel on the dresser and we went out of the back door the most radiant morning greeted us the air was as soft as primroses the sun had broken through everything in the drenched garden sparkled deep puddles reflected a sky as blue as the angel islington in monopoly we walked through the kitchen garden past overgrown gooseberry bushes blue and green cabbages full of fat rain drops and ancient fruit trees the ground beneath them covered with rotting yellow apples that no one had bothered to pick along the fence the remnants of former shrubberies were thickly choked with weeds there was a lovely smell of wet earth and mouldering vegetation a robin perched on a spade thrusting out its orange breast in the sunshine at the top of the garden we went through a rusty iron gate into open fields at the end of the fields beyond a belt of dark pine trees a huge mountain reared up covered in rocks khaki grass and bracken so red it looked as though it had been dipped in henna coleridge charged on ahead snorting down rabbit holes his plumy tail going all the time it was very quiet all you could hear was the occasional mournful bleat of a sheep and the full roar of hundreds of little becks coming off the mountain how much of the land is yours i said about twenty thousand acres said ace most of it is let to local farmers it stretches to beyond the village over there he pointed to a clump of little grey houses in the distance the smoke was going straight up from the chimneys the sun caught the gold lichened roofs and the blue dress of a woman who was hanging out washing its so beautiful i breathed arent you glad to be back not sure yet havent been here long enough suddenly i decided i rather liked him then he started grilling me and i decided i didnt it was just like being interviewed for a job how long had i known pendle where did my family live what did my father do how many brothers and sisters had i got why hadnt i gone to university how long had i been in my present job two years i said defiantly that should show him id got staying power if youve got a good job you hang on to it at the moment everyones nervous the advertisers are still pulling back the bosses spend more time worrying about cashflow than producing ads what do you do i work for the creative director and doesnt he create sometimes ace was like pendle he didnt laugh at my jokes either in need of light relief i kicked a toadstool and then did a handstand coleridge had reached a little stream and was splashing up it snapping at the waterfalls hes what they call a watter dog round here said ace when he gets home hell rush upstairs and dry off in someones bed youd better keep your door locked i told him about pendles rape case yeah he did well i got the cuttings in the states even abroad he kept tabs on them then he started quizzing me about the english political scene which was totally disastrous i couldnt even remember who was minister of labour let alone shadow chancellor and id never known what the balance of payments was anyway im not interested in politics i said crossly theyre always changing cant we have a commercial break i really dont care about the state of the nation at this hour of the morning the dark searching eyes held mine for a minute do you ever he said dismissively not if i can help it you should try professor copeland if you want serious conversation i snapped and did a couple of cartwheels which didnt do my head any good either we had come full circle now the house was visible over the hill we passed a thick clump of silver birches and reached the stables and whatever state of delapidation the rest of the house had fallen into you couldnt fault them everything had been newly painted a glossy duckegg blue the yard was swept and the horses in the boxes were in magnificent condition and one felt that never in the past two years had they ever been anything else there was also no doubt about the incredulous delight on old mr braddocks face when he saw ace who handed him the parcel he was carrying he was too shy to open his present in front of us but stumped off bowlegged to leave it in the tackroom and then took us on a tour of the horses this is new said ace stopping in front of a handsome chestnut looking balefully out of her box and pawing at the straw mr jack bought her for young mrs mulholland last summer said mr braddock jumps anything you can see the sky over but she doesnt get enough exercise we went out to the paddock to look at the ponies a plump blue roan came bustling up to us whickering through her nostrils nudging at ace with her roman nose this is bluebell he said pulling gently at her ears she taught us all to ride god knows how old she is now i was just bending down to pick her some grass when a pair of hands grabbed me round the waist i let out a piercing shriek and leapt forward bluebell tossed up her head and cantered away what the bloody hell snapped ace it was jack his hair lifting in the breeze wearing a dark blue sweater and ludicrously tight jeans even a hangover couldnt dim his beauty hullo my darlings he said youre up revoltingly early arent you pleased with the horses he added to ace theyre all in good nick arent they ace nodded makes a nice change from everything else what dyou think of the mare i bought maggie too fat said ace jack laughed like her mistress and quite unlike this heavenly creature whos not got an ounce of spare flesh on her how are you this morning angel he went on grabbing me round the waist again and pulling me against him ace was glaring at us so fiercely i decided i wanted to irritate him all the better for seeing you i said smiling up at jack its nearly opening time he said mustnt give my hangover time to get a grip whos coming down to the pub oh i am please i said no thanks said ace and for gods sake dont pour too much drink down her ive only just sobered her up and turning abruptly on his heel he walked back to the stables we had a nice time at the pub where we found wordsworth parked outside and the admiral on a bar stool inside both looking equally lovelorn and the worse for wear wordsworths been here all morning whining for our sarah said the landlord shaking his head must have got her bad know how he feels sighed the admiral hows yer mother this morning well she hadnt surfaced by the time i left said jack no doubt shell emerge radiant at lunchtime shes got more stamina than any of us wonderful woman sighed the admiral what are you going to drink after that we had several drinks and a post mortem on the party last night most of which was devoted to indepth bitching about the professor hes the most boring man ive ever met said jack and whats more he wears the most boring trousers suppose hes very brainy said the admiral gloomily second in british english fourth in life said jack youll have to go in and fight for her admiral the admiral looked rather excited and bought us more drinks jack and i were exchanging so many eyemeets now it was getting ridiculous we really ought to go i said its twenty to two dragging a reluctant panting wordsworth we got back into the car dropped the admiral off at his cottage on the edge of the lake and set off for home gather ye rose buds while ye may theres no more bed once youre dead said jack he put his hand on my thigh wordsworth will be shocked i said removing it hes far too busy composing tintern abbey said jack i giggled he put his hand back i put my hand firmly on top of his to stop it moving further upwards we were nearly at the bottom of the drive i dont think ace approves of me i said more to get jack off the subject of me than anything else dont think he approves of anything very much at the moment must be hell coming back here with elizabeth buried in the churchyard and every tree and rock reminding him of her she was so lovely and he adored her so much hes missed out on love really with his mother dying when he was only two then losing elizabeth and the baby after such a short time i know hes not easy but hes rewarding if you make the effort he took his hand from my thigh to swing the car in through the drive but where were we he went on when ace so rudely interrupted us last night i must say i did enjoy it oh so did i i said i shouldnt have encouraged him but he was so attractive and i didnt think hed try anything when we were so nearly home he stopped the car at the front smiled at me gently then in full view of the drawingroom window leant over and kissed me very hard full on the mouth which was still half open for a moment i was too surprised to move then i pulled away and leapt out of the car laughing quite undisturbed jack started up and drove round to the garage at the back pendle and maggie were talking conspiratorially in the drawingroom when i went in they gave no evidence of having seen us arrive rose was ringing up all her friends telling them how ghastly it was to have ace back and he walked in in the middle said maggie she was wearing too much rouge and there was makeup on her white shirt but she looked sexy enough in a rumpled way i hear youve been round the estate and visited the pub said pendle pouring me a glass of wine so you know all there is to know about the area i had such a hangover the hair of the dog was the only answer i explained hastily the admiral was in the pub hes very disconsolate professor copelands not too happy either said maggie hes already rung up rose and said he was mightily annoyed about the highhanded way ace ordered him out of the house last night he wants an apology he wont get one said pendle at that moment rose swept in looking a bit pale but with plenty of the old dash about her hullo pru darling she said do you know maggie snelgroves have refused to send me that silver fox on appro not surprised said maggie considering you kept the last one six months and sent it back ripped and with toffee papers in the pocket but roses butterfly mind had flitted to other problems promise not to leave me alone for a minute with ace she said lowering her voice i know he wants to talk about money i dont expect i shall ever see dear professor copeland again ace has been so rude to him ive got nothing to look forward to now except decay she added dramatically never mind said jack coming through the door wearing copelands hat youve got plenty more beaux to your string everyone groaned jack admired himself in the mirror do i look like an intellectual he said crinkling his eyes take more than a hat said maggie nastily oh go and play in the traffic snapped jack he took off the hat and put it on coleridge who was sprawled in an armchair and took absolutely no notice hes exhausted said pendle after spending five minutes on his narvel even rose giggled ace and i are going to ride after lunch said jack i suppose there will be lunch he added to rose and prus coming with me i opened my mouth to protest pendle glanced at my corduroy jodhpurs of course she is he said shes already dressed ill come and see you off worse still they all decided to come and see us off any courage given me by the whisky in the pub evaporated over lunch but i still didnt dare tell them i couldnt ride we all trooped down to the stables three huge horses were led out my teeth were chattering with fear cold today isnt it i said to ace mr braddock led the large grey towards me shes called snowball he said jack and ace were already mounted rose maggie pendle two dogs antonia fraser sitting on the stable roof blinking her yellow eyes and a man carting manure were all watching me i seized the reins and put my foot in the stirrup snowball recognizing a phoney started waltzing round i hopped after her ill give you a leg up said pendle hoisting me into the saddle london from the top of the post office tower couldnt have seemed further away than the ground incapable of standing still snowball started to walk sideways and no sooner had pendle let go of her reins than she set off at a brisk trot out of the yard into the fields hey wait a minute shouted ace snowball trotted even faster up down up down i tried desperately to rise in the saddle but i kept getting out of time and going bump bump instead pull her up yelled jack but in spite of my frenzied tugs she trotted even faster breaking into a brisk canter as ace tried to overtake oh god a different rhythm one two three one two three by the time id got adjusted to it id lost both stirrups and the reins and was clinging on to her mane for grim death suddenly she plunged her head down in a terrifying graveyard cough shaking me to the roots of my foundations then jerked her head upwards and hit me smartly on the nose through streaming eyes i abandoned all hope as she dived into a little copse of trees there were branches everywhere duck your head shouted ace out of the copse into another green field downhill this time towards the lake i was just wondering if a soft piece of grass might be preferable to this bumping hell when ace drew even caught snowballs rein and pulled her to a jolting standstill you bloody little fool saying you could ride he swore at me you might have been killed by those branches i was on the verge of tears beastly lousy horse i said how can i steer it when its all i can do to stay on aces lips twitched jack cantered up laughing so much he couldnt speak at first darling darling pru he said youve no idea how enchanting you looked from the back he wiped his eyes i preserved my wounded dignity for a few minutes and then my sense of humour reasserted itself i began to giggle they took it very gently after that riding on either side of me like police horses bringing in the grand national winner we rode round the lake a few sheep with russet bottoms looked at us curiously a water skier clad in black rubber was zipping across the water gradually my nervousness disappeared and i began to enjoy myself about a quarter of a mile from home i felt jack stiffen beside me two figures were walking by the lake no one could mistake that brilliant red hair the man was obviously pendle they moved slowly as people do who have no destination except each other pendle picked up a pebble and started playing ducks and drakes maggie tried to do the same but every time her stone just fell at her feet i saw pendle put his hand over hers and show her how to flick her wrist she gave a cry of joy as the stone bounded across the water i felt quite sick as pendle then put an arm through hers and they turned away from us to walk along the lake ace looked like a thundercloud but jack merely smiled and rode his horse closer to mine so our legs brushed poor idiot poor besotted idiot he said scathingly he never gives up does he we rode straight back to the stables after that no one saying a word jack and ace went off to have a look at jacks house i curled up with a book in front of the fire but fell asleep i was woken at dusk by pendle are you all right not too bored he said im fine i said stretching a little and bending a glance in his direction intended to be subtly wanton pendle gave one of my curls a little tug of endearment my spies tell me jacks very smitten he said softly which spies i wondered ace maggie rose probably all three oh well hes very handsome and all that i paused in the hope that i might get pendle worried but i dont think my happiness lies in that direction besides hes married we locked looks for a minute pendle dropped his eyes first about tonight he said yes i said brightening perhaps at last he was going to steal down the passage theres a pretty tedious cocktail party on the other side of the lake with fireworks for some reason then we thought wed go and have dinner in ambleside theres a new french restaurant opened there would that amuse you i took a deep breath id much rather be with you i said couldnt we skip the party and go out on our own without the others cant really desert ace on his first night i think hes a bit depressed jet lag and all that its him thats doing the depressing i said crossly why doesnt he go to bed hush said pendle thats not like you i dont know whats like me anymore i said with asob i moved closer close enough for him to take me in his arms and kiss me very gently on the lips i kept my mouth shut terrified after being asleep all afternoon i might taste horrible but i felt myself turn to jelly then just at that moment ace and jack came through the french windows and pendle let me go i nearly wept with frustration with a shiver i wondered if pendle had seen them coming up the garden and just kissed me in order to kid ace he wasnt running after maggie chapter eight as i changed for the firework party i decided to switch tactics so far id played it cool with pendle now for the first time i decided to show him i was really keen my green culotte dress was a showstopper i wondered as i wriggled into it if it were a bit much for the country it clings everywhere and has cutaway sleeves and huge cutouts back and front oh well i thought if it doesnt stir pendle to frenzies of lust at least it will annoy ace the mulhollands reactions to the outfit were varied and typical jack choked over his drink pendle didnt bat an eyelid rose said i wonder if i could get away with that ace raised a disapproving eyebrow and said i appeared to have run out of material maggie walked round and round me and said oh what heaven but how do you go to the loo as we were leaving mindful of my new plan of campaign i seized pendles hand can we go in your car just the two of us pendle looked surprised yes of course he said it was dark now but i could still see a ghostly gleam of the lake through the trees its so lovely i said turning towards him oh pendle thank you for bringing me up here im having such a wonderful time he gave that watchful halfsmile are you really enjoying it oh i am i couldnt resist putting my hand on his knee and leaning over to kiss him he didnt flinch he just drew away from me i shrank back to my side of the car feeling just about as wanted as a christmas tree on twelfth night sorry but its dangerous on these roads he said coolly the hot fever of mortification had not subsided by the time we reached the party it was a curiously fossilized affair a few young people but mostly old women roaring around on crutches and so many retired colonels that even the flower arrangements were standing to attention rose arrived grumbling because ace had refused to close all the windows and had put her false eyelashes in jeopardy she was also annoyed that maggie had appropriated the professors hat and insisted on keeping it on maggie and jack promptly parted like the red sea sick at heart from pendles rebuff i flirted outrageously with jack who was only too willing to oblige in a blue shirt that matched his eyes he was easily the handsomest man in the room and i if not the prettiest was certainly the most outrageously dressed those colonels couldnt keep their monocles off my bare tummy im fast becoming a navel specialist jack told everyone with everyone else in wool dresses i felt rather like a street lamp left on during the day maggie and pendle seemed to have disappeared somewhere and i found jacks presence curiously reassuring we leant against the wall together i like large parties dont you theyre so intimate said jack look at ace talk about the stag at bay i looked across the room ace had been cornered by the daughter of the house hes a handsome sod isnt he said jack dont you find him attractive ace looked up and glared across at us no i dont i said crossly he makes me feel im in the upper fourth and covered with ink ace was obviously coming over to break us up i was dying to go to the loo so i sloped off to the downstairs cloakroom maggie was right the only thing to do was to take my dress off altogether i laid it on the floor in the pile of esquires on the window ledge i found a story by graham greene which i hadnt read i settled down with enjoyment the only snag was that i hadnt locked the door properly a few minutes later it was pushed open and there i was naked to my enemy with old overkill glowering down at me i gave a scream and snatched the dress round me jesus said ace get out i yelled ace slammed the door oh the embarrassment still if hed flipped through esquire hed have seen lots of girls just as naked as me if not in such an undignified position do him good boring old prig all the same it was several minutes before i could screw up enough courage to go back to the party thank goodness the fireworks were about to start and i could hide my blushes in the garden jack brought my drink out to me touching shoulders we watched the fireworks explode over the lake in a blaze of coloured stars while everyone oohed and ahed suddenly someone let off a squib behind me and i jumped straight into jacks arms he seemed in no hurry to let go of me until he saw the expression on aces face as soon as the last rocket had emptied its splendour into the night the mulhollands made leaving noises wont you stay for some spaghetti said the daughter of the house flashing her teeth at ace no they wont said rose theyve got to go on somewhere else but i think ill stay more my age group she added to us besides theyll need some help with the washingup washingup snorted maggie as soon as rose was out of earshot she cant wait to slope off and see copeland we dined in a smart restaurant deep carpets and waiters rushing around silently with lighted frying pans nothing however could have been more flambée than the atmosphere at our table ace and pendle sat on either side of me opposite jack and maggie i found it sinister the way maggie and pendle avoided talking to each other jack kept ordering more wine id adore to have snails i said well i will too said jack garlics all right if you both do what a frightful party he went on unfolding his napkin i didnt notice you making major inroads into it snapped ace oh i had a nice time said jack winking at me but i was worried about the rest of you soon they were all tearing the party to shreds the daughter of the house was noticeably taken by you my dear said jack grinning at ace nice to see you havent lost your touch i had suddenly developed a fearful sore throat and found i couldnt eat very much after all the cold night air knocked me for six when we came out of the hotel as i wandered towards pendles car desperately trying to walk straight i was grabbed by the arm youre coming with me said ace im going with pendle and jack but before i could argue he opened the car door get in he said coldly one didnt argue when he used that tone i lowered the window however and as jack and pendle came out of the hotel i shouted help im being kidnapped im running pru home said ace you two take maggie oh she was coming with us said jack cradlesnatcher he shouted as we drove off my giggle faded away lamely i reached in my bag for a cigarette the packet was empty hell i said angrily you smoke too much said ace do up your seat belt i dont fancy them i dont like being trapped in cars with strange men do it up bloody hitler but he was bigger than me sulkily i tried to shove the seat belt into place in the end he had to do it for me i cringed back against the seat so no part of me would touch him after a couple of miles he turned off the road down a carttrack stopping at the edge of the lake then he lit a cigarette but didnt offer me one out of the corner of my eye i studied his forbidding profile perhaps the sight of me naked in the loo had been too much for him and he was going to run true to mulholland form and make a pass at me more likely he was thinking about elizabeth and that car crash that must have been why hed made me wear a seat belt suddenly i felt sorry for him what a heavenly moon i didnt come here to discuss the moon he said i want you to lay off my brother i gaped at him which one you know perfectly well which one he said harshly jacks married leave him alone he doesnt behave as though he is i snapped of course he doesnt with you egging him on me i said in amazement me egging him on yes you clinging to him like ivy when i arrived last night snuggling up to him at the stables wearing that monstrous dress this evening and pretending you were scared every time the smallest firework went off i dont like bangs i said my voice rising i thought you came here with pendle that went home so did i i said you probably know maggie was pens girlfriend before jack ran off with her how do you think he feels now the first time he brings someone else up here jack just snaps his fingers and she comes running i wanted to scream at him to tell him that pendle hadnt taken any notice of me since we arrived that he hadnt seen the way pendle devoured maggie with his eyes whenever he thought no one was looking but some peculiar loyalty to pendle or was it reluctance to utter out loud what i dreaded kept me from saying anything look i said im not after your precious brother he kissed me the other night only because i was there it makes no difference i suppose that hes married you can behave like that with anyone else you like but not with jack now are you going to leave him alone i might and i mightnt ace exploded you bloody well will he said i lost my temper you dont understand anything i screamed you go about like god almighty on speech day like a flaming spare prig at a wedding ordering everyone around just because to your eyes theyre behaving badly you never stop to think why theyre behaving like that cut it out he said sharply youre behaving like a child this time tomorrow i said my voice shaking i shall have left this beastly place and youll never be bothered with me again he backed the car out and drove down the road i was trembling all over but i was too proud to ask him for a cigarette when we got home i fled upstairs and buried my face in my pillow and cried and cried much later someone knocked on my door and waited and then knocked again but i didnt answer i was overcome with dizziness when i got out of bed the next morning im going into a decline i told myself i dressed and put on a lot of rouge and a huge pair of dark glasses i found maggie reading the sunday papers still wearing copelands hat hullo she said her eyes avid with curiosity we were worried about you what on earth did you and ace get up to nothing i said quickly i suddenly got a terrible headache i dont know whats the matter with ace she said hes so sour this morning you could make yoghurt out of him hes got rose in the drawingroom going through the bills i wish i was a fly on the wall poor rose i said he does jackboot around doesnt he dont blame him really said maggie rose hasnt paid a bill since he left not to mention selling the romney then theres the couple of grand here and the couple of grand there shes touched him for to do up the kitchen and the roof and the drawingroom and you can see how much doing up theres been she picked up a colour supplement and began to flip through it and what about your new house i said oh jacks paid for most of that although rose pretends she has i wish i could work up some enthusiasm about it she went over to the window jack and pendleve taken the boat out i think i might ride this afternoon jacks got to work next moment rose came out of the study looking redeyed tell mrs braddock i dont want any lunch she said faintly and ran upstairs a minute later we heard the telephone click straight on to copeland said maggie a thin lot of good hell be to her but in ten minutes we saw rose flash past the door in dark glasses and a huge blond fur coat the front door slammed and there was a scrunch on the gravel as the car drove off lunch was a nightmare i kept going into a cold sweat and i couldnt eat a thing fortunately they were all arguing too heatedly to notice me after much bickering pendle was persuaded to go riding what about pru said maggie there arent enough horses i said quickly shes so light she can ride one of the ponies said ace shed be happier curled up in front of the fire helping me write this damned report said jack aces eyes were boring into me id like to ride i said firmly i think youll find this one easier than the one you had yesterday said ace later as he gave me a leg up he reached forward and took off my dark glasses dont ride in those he said putting them in his pocket its dangerous if you fall off he looked at me closer you look terrible are you all right ill get by i said coldly maggie contrary to her normal lethargy rode like a gipsy she thought nothing of slithering down a ravine or clearing a fivefoot wall it was a beautiful day but great black clouds were massing ominously on the horizon and a chill wind was ruffling the lake above us on the mountains sheep were wending their way along the ancient tracks about half a mile from home we entered a long grassy ride suddenly maggie dug her heels into the chestnut come on pen she shrieked race me to the end she got a good start but pendle immediately thundered after her ace was cantering easily and even my pony trundled along furiously maggie was still whooping herself into the lead but pendle using his whip now was gaining on her his horses coat turned black with sweat a wall loomed in the distance maggie was making for a gap but just as pendle drew level with her her horse pecked and she was thrown over its head she lay in a crumpled heap pendle pulled up his horse with such force that it reared round in the air he was off it like lightning running to maggie his face ashen maggie he said hoarsely maggie darling for gods sake say something darling you cant do this to me suddenly maggie opened her eyes and smiled at him sweetly darling pen what a pretty speech i must pretend to pass out more often pendles face twisted with rage god you bitch he slapped her viciously across the face maggie gave a moan and burst into tears pendle jerked her into his arms and kissed her passionately pendle snarled ace for christs sake pendle looked up the fury and defiance in his eyes were terrifying to hell with you all he said shes mine and i love her im not built for drama it was just like a trailer at the cinema i swung my fat pony round and cantered off the way wed come crying great tearing sobs it started raining and i was soon soaked to the skin dusk was falling as i rode up to the house jack was standing in the doorway my poor darling he said in dismay ace is out looking for you go and get dry ill look after the pony for you i dragged myself upstairs i was feeling really ill i peeled off my wet clothes and sat on the bed in my bra and pants my teeth going like castanets there was a knock on the door and ace barged in where the hell did you get to he said oh go away i said i swayed as i got up to reach for my dressinggown he caught my arm sit down he said more gently putting a hand on my forehead ill be fine in a minute he felt the sheets of my bed and grimaced damp of course he put my dressinggown round my shoulders and led me across the passage get into my bed at least its dry i lay down and stared at the photograph beside the bed this must be elizabeth she had a soft shining face and masses of cloudy dark hair no wonder he had loved her he came back with a thermometer you cant possibly travel tonight he said when hed looked at my temperature stop bullying me i snapped trying to get out of bed see for yourself he said showing me the thermometer it was nearly a hundred and four help i shrieked whipping back into bed im dying he handed me two pills theyll make you sleep he stood over me till id taken them there was a knock on the door it was pendle his face was grey but he looked quite calm ace left us to it pendle came over and took my hand sorry youre sick he said i turned my face away to hide the tears i should never have brought you here he said it was a bloody trick but when youre desperate you try anything i was attracted by you pru but maggies like a drug i understand i said feeling like st teresa on her deathbed he looked so haggard i suddenly wanted to comfort him please take me with you i whispered acell look after you he said ill come and pick you up next friday those pills must have been killers hed only been gone a few minutes when great waves of sleep rolled over me chapter nine i woke next morning back in my own bed and not feeling any better a fire had been lit in the grate the smoke made me cough ace and jack came in to see me on their way to the firms board meeting ive left a note for mrs braddock to ring the doctor said ace hours later maggie wandered in i tried to ring the doctor just now but he was engaged i think he hunts on monday anyway blasted mrs braddocks got flu too do you need anything id love some water i said she filled the jug from the bathroom she was wearing a silvergrey silk shirt isnt it beautiful she said ace brought it me from america ive been dying to have a gossip with you wasnt it awful pen grabbing me like that you missed the best part rushing off they simply swore at each other after youd gone ace is getting so righteous he really ought to go into the church its only his family being hurt that he minds i said heavens who was i to defend him but maggie wasnt listening its incredible this thing pen has for me she said he felt guilty about you dyou know he deliberately brought you up here because he knew jack would fancy you but i told him not to worry you were having such fun with jack perhaps we should swap its a vicious circle i thought wearily she droned on until rose walked in hullo sweetie how are you mrs braddocks got the bug such a bore cold meat again for supper mustnt come too near flu can play havoc with ones looks at my age are you ready maggie is it time to go said maggie were going out darling said rose to me youll be all right they always say starve a fever well be back soon she drifted out on a wave of expensive scent at first i was glad to be left in peace but as the hours limped by and night fell i began to get frightened one moment i was drenched in icy sweat the next hot as a volcano it started to rain and the wind was rising the telephone rang i dragged myself out of bed black whirls of giddiness overwhelmed me it took hours to get along the passage and as i reached the telephone it stopped ringing burglars i thought in terror ringing to see if anyone was in a door was banging the wind was rattling the trees against the window pane i staggered back to bed delirious with fear i dont remember how long i waited but suddenly another door banged downstairs someone was coming up the stairs moving lightly but inevitably towards me oh god oh god i wept the door was pushed open a figure towered in the gloom i gave a shriek and was about to pull the sheets over my head when i suddenly realized it was ace i thought you were burglars i said bursting into a wild fit of sobbing he crossed the room in an instant and put his arms around me its all right he said i was so frightened i sobbed the telephone rang and stopped as soon as i got there there there its all right he was stroking my hair i felt sanity flow back into me from the warmth of his body the bloody board meeting dragged on and on it was me ringing i came straight back when there was no answer he laid me gently back on the pillows wheres mrs braddock shes got flu and rose and maggie they popped out for a minute for lunch i suppose what did the doctor say he hasnt arrived yet aces face blackened he soon will he said stalking out of the room i heard him dialling can i speak to doctor wallis its ivan mulholland there was a pause then i dont give a bugger if hes in the middle of his supper i want him over here at once ivan the terrible the doctor was over in ten minutes a little man with spectacles absolutely gibbering with fear his hands were cold and sweating when he touched me i heard him mutter about pneumonia as he went downstairs i was scared rigid im a terrible hypochondriac im not really ill am i i asked ace when he came back he smiled and pushed my damp hair back from my forehead youll live he said dear jane i wrote five days later im sorry i havent written before but my rotten temperature has only just come down i hope pendle rang and said i wasnt coming back his family really are weird id better not say too much as theyre quite capable of steaming this open i wish you were here pendle has two brothers one is terribly handsome and lecherous right up your street the other one is older in his thirties i loathed him at first hes very tough and doesnt give an inch but hes been simply angelic since ive been ill he brought me a kitten from the stables today to cheer me up i think pendle and i are washed up his choice not mine ill tell you about it when i see you do write soon tons of love pru certainly ace had been angelic never in a million years would i have expected him to display such patience gentleness and sensitivity comforting me through the worst phase when i was half delirious and screaming for pendle bringing me hot lemon laced with honey and whisky in the middle of the night when i was coughing my guts out even on the nightmarish occasion when i forced myself to eat some lunch in an attempt to please him and promptly brought the whole lot up over newly changed sheets he didnt bat an eyelid afterwards as i sat huddled in a basket shuddering with mortification watching him put another lot of sheets on the bed with admirable deftness i suddenly thought how hopeless pendle with all his fastidiousness would have been in such a situation not that we didnt have our battles ace was inflexible about me taking my medicine and wearing a dressinggown and not smoking and he promptly confiscated my wireless when he came in at midnight one evening and caught me curled up under the blankets at the bottom of the bed listening to top twenty nor would he allow me any visitors i liked that i didnt feel up to the scrapping and intriguing of the rest of the family i was quite happy lying in bed flitting through novels playing with the kitten which we christened mcgonagall listening to the gentle snoring of wordsworth and coleridge stretched out in front of the fire and the faint scratch of aces fountain pen steadily moving over the notepad he was finishing a piece on venezuela for the sunday times and had holed up in my room sitting in the big faded blue velvet armchair a pile of books and papers at his feet only leaving occasionally to make telephone calls or walk the dogs i admired his application he could gut a book in threequarters of an hour and he only paused occasionally when he was writing to cross out a word or listen to a few bars of music on the wireless it was so different from my haphazard methods of producing advertising copy chainsmoking gossiping to rodney writing endless variations on different bits of paper only to produce one very undistinguished slogan by the end of the day rodney had sent me a bunch of yellow chrysanthemums as big as grapefruit and a getwell card signed by the rest of the department all the same advertising and the tinned peaches campaign seemed very far away it was very cosy in my bedroom i got to know the blue and green flower pattern of the curtains extremely well and i found my thoughts straying less and less to pendle friday was a red letter day i managed my first meal chicken soup hot ginger bread and a cup of tea and ace finished his piece as night fell and went downstairs to telephone his copy through to the paper ten minutes later jack walked in clutching two enormous whiskies one each he said sitting down on the bed and removing his jacket i thought you might need cheering up i certainly do whats the matter maggie she hasnt even got the energy to row with me she just slops around looking broody hows work i said taking a slug of whisky it tasted vile tough plenty of orders but no ones paying us my secretary and my wife are both suffering from premenstrual tension my head is splitting from furiously banged doors theyve just opened a home for battered husbands in manchester im thinking of booking a room i giggled jack edged towards me whats more important how are you ace never lets me near you these days hes looked after me jolly well the ladykiller with the lamp said jack im dying for a cigarette i said i havent had one for nearly a week jack got out a packet of rothmans do you think i dare acell go bananas if he catches me oh hell be hours yet its pretty inflamatory stuff hes phoning through from the bit i heard downstairs the cigarette tasted fouler than the whisky i started to cough jack admired rodneys chrysanthemums who sent those my boss must have cost a few bob is he after you no more interested in my flatmate and who sent that enormous rubber plant i laughed and coughed even more the admiral he wanted an excuse to come and see rose he barged in here this afternoon when i was half asleep imagine waking up and seeing his bright red colonial face peering through all that tropical vegetation i thought i was hallucinating ace threw him out ace is getting much too proprietorial where youre concerned not sure i like it i took another tentative puff and started to choke really badly oh god another nail in my coughing jack patted me on the back then his hand slid round my waist pulling me towards him there is a moment when you decide whether or not youre going to have an affair with a man pendle was gone jacks marriage was in smithereens he was extraordinarily attractive we stared at each other for a long sexy moment i saw the lines of dissipation creeping round his merry blue eyes not my line of country i thought easy to get but impossible to hold he lacks that wintry detachment that stripped bone quality that attracted me to pendle youre sweet he said all work and no play makes jack adulterous and he leant over to kiss me at that moment ace walked in with a swift glance he took in the clinch the whisky and my cigarette smouldering in the ashtray he hit the roof he absolutely roared at us i was terrified jack edged away from me ace grabbed my cigarette throwing it into the wastepaper basket and snatched my whisky from my hand spilling a great deal of it over the kitten who spat and took it in very bad part do you want to have a complete setback shouted ace his eyes blazing no i said nervously and started to cough again look at you he said have you got some sort of death wish she soon will have if you dont stop bullying her said jack did the sunday times like your piece and you can shut up too snapped ace of all the fucking irresponsible behaviour fortunately at that moment a diversion was caused by the wastepaper basket bursting merrily into flames quick said ace throw your coat over it why not your coat protested jack mines just come back from the cleaners i started to giggle ace grabbed the water jug beside the bed and emptied it into the wastepaper basket which flickered and died with an effort he gained control of himself ive just been talking to pendle he said hes got a case in devon thats going to carry over into next week so he cant make it this weekend i told him you werent well enough to travel anyway so hes leaving it until next weekend it was as though id been reprieved i put it down to the fact i wasnt feeling strong enough to face pendle there was a knock on the door and in walked maggie she looked beautiful but definitely fat all that misery eating i suppose she was wearing a black velvet dress with a crosslaced bodice but her bust had got so big the laces were almost horizontal with strain she was obviously dressed for a party and had dropped in to show herself off what are you all talking about she said pendle said ace evenly hes not coming up this weekend what a shame said maggie lightly i had a feeling she already knew how disappointing for you pru are you ready she added turning to jack what for said jack felicitys party christ didnt know she was having a party i told you twice this morning but you were so engrossed in your hangover are you coming ace no said ace picking up the empty water jug and going towards the door oh do you need a break after all that sickbed attendance felicityll be frightfully disappointed im sure shes got half westmorland coming boasting youll be there shell have to lump it i never gave her a definite yes he was still extremely tightlipped oh well said jack putting on his jacket and draining the remains of his whisky one may as well get drunk at someone elses expense rather than ones own the front door bell rang who the hells that said maggie probably vatman said jack there were sounds of commotion downstairs then we heard feet pounding up the stairs and a childs voice saying daddy where are you jesus said jack its lucasta i completely forgot she was coming oh god so did i said maggie in carefully simulated horror no you didnt i thought to myself one never forgets things ones dreading like the dentist the door burst open and framed in the doorway wearing a blond fur coat and jeans was the most ravishing child for a moment she stood looking at us making her entrance the image of rose forty years ago then she shouted daddy and threw herself into jacks arms there was no question of their delight at seeing each other im going to be king in the christmas play because im tall she screamed jason whites going to be gold im myrrh and damions going to be frankenstein only maggie didnt join in the laughter and ive got a wobbly tooth she went on opening her mouth and wiggling it for jacks benefit if you leave it under your pillow the fairies might bring you p said jack the fairies left jason white p last week you cant get anything decent with p said lucasta wriggling down off jacks knee hullo lucasta said ace dyou remember me of course i do said lucasta holding up her face to be kissed you used to tell me bedtime stories without a book mummy said you might be here did you have a nice time in america did you meet six million dollar woman dyou know what knocks down little old ladies and pinches their bread no said ace bionic pigeon said lucasta did you bring me a present lucasta said jack in mock horror youre getting even more avaricious than your mother she said i was to remind you about the school fees oh look at that kitten isnt it sweet mcgonagall was licking off the whisky and making terrible faces arent you going to say hullo to maggie said jack suddenly all expression was wiped off lucastas face hullo she said tonelessly then turning to jack whys she wearing a party dress are you going out of course not said jack ignoring maggies furious signals not on your first night maggies wearing a party dress to welcome you you havent met pru either how do you do said lucasta sizing me up watchfully she plainly didnt believe in giving herself too easily wheres granny out i think said jack is she still going out with james copeland said lucasta or has she got a new boyfriend mummy says shes a sexy maniac your mothers biased said jack come on lets go downstairs and find you a coke or would you like something stronger id like a highball jack roared with laughter maggie looked like a thundercloud feeling absolutely played out i lay back on the pillows and caught ace watching me i gave him a beseeching look of apology for a second he glared at me then he grinned his harsh face suddenly illuminated come on everybody out he said prus had enough excitement for one evening see you tomorrow said lucasta going towards the door and adding to jack if you let me stay up and watch bride of dracula i dont mind if you go to that party chapter ten next morning ace went into carlisle leaving strict instructions that i was to be left alone the moment he left the house one member of the family after another trooped in to see me maggie was first bitching about lucasta isnt she a monster wouldnt you like to boil her in oil and do you know what her bloody mother did sent me a list of all the clothes shed put in lucastas suitcase with a letter asking me to tick them off when lucasta goes home because on the pathetic maintenance jack pays me i simply cant afford to buy her any more clothes at the moment the bitch alimony is the root of all evil i suppose her obsessive rattle against both lucasta and fay went on and on and on youre far more in hate with them than in love with jack i thought hows rose i said trying to distract her well shes promised ace she wont have professor copeland in the house anymore he doesnt approve of her stealing linns boyfriend probably having him in someone elses house at that moment rose appeared in the doorway buckling under carrier bags what have you got there asked maggie oh a few little things tights and so on replied rose airily ive got to have something new with all the christmas parties coming up actually i bought them yesterday and hid them in the potting shed couldnt wait for ace to go out so i could smuggle them in i must say i shall never forgive him for being so beastly to poor james and so rude to me too i mean i am his mother stepmother said maggie bitterly it makes a difference i shudder to think what life would be like if i was ever dependent on lucasta lifes very hard said rose patting her curls in my mirror i thought james and ace would get on i expected them to have so many good talks about books ace says copelands knowledge comes more from the beginning of books than the end said maggie aces always being cynical and sarcastic said rose i expect hes jealous of james oh well if he doesnt want to communicate with one of the keenest minds on western civilization good luck to him good luck was plainly the last thing she wanted ace to have who said james had one of the keenest minds on western civilization asked maggie james did said rose simply oh come on said maggie lets go along to your bedroom and see what youve bought theres a very exciting offer for garden furniture in the mail said rose when is it warm enough here to sit outside said maggie as they went towards the door god i felt tired without ace i was totally defenceless hullo came a voice hows your ammonia it was lucasta better i said i might get up and have a bath soon on one arm she was wearing a fluffy puppet fox with sleepy eyes disappearing into its fur and a long tail hes lovely i said ace brought him back from america hes called sylvia hes my best toy he looks a bit like your father daddys gone to see the burrow engineer about the new house when he moves in he wants me to come and live with him thats nice i said that would finish maggie off altogether can i have an apple she said making the fox select one from the fruit bowl and eating on the side of her face to avoid her wobbly tooth i wish it would snow she said every night i pray for snow and it never comes what else do you pray for her blue eyes narrowed suddenly her little face looked very hard that maggie might go away and daddy might marry mummy again oh dear i said i wouldnt do that i hate her said lucasta and she hates me being here every time daddy takes me out she gets cross after a few bites she got bored with the apple and going to the cupboard selected a pair of my black high heels and put them on im on book four she said shall i go and get it she teetered off out of the room a minute later she teetered back sat on my bed and read the whole book through in a high singsong voice without a single mistake thats brilliant i said in surprise i seemed to remember maggie saying she wasnt very bright lucasta grinned and shut the book and i can read it without the book too she said and proceeded to reel the whole thing off from memory i was still laughing when there was yet another knock on the door this time it was mrs braddock and how are you love feeling better i hope now come along she added to lucasta you know mr ace said miss pru wasnt to be bothered im not bothering her answered lucasta she turned to me do you know mrs braddock can do magic she did some in the kitchen today mrs braddock looked smug and smoothed down her apron waiting no doubt for lucasta to describe some particularly delicious concoction shed run up that morning well what is it i said lucasta gave a naughty giggle she can take all her teeth out and put them in again i loved the mulhollands i loved them all but i couldnt cope with them at the moment i couldnt cope with the feverish crosscurrents i felt like the centre court net at the end of wimbledon fortnight all i wanted was to go back to the peace of ace and me being shut up together its because i havent been well i kept telling myself mrs braddock and lucasta were shortly followed by jack back from the borough engineer when hed finished grumbling about the builders and his hangover he said since im obviously not allowed to seduce you or bring you a drink shall we have a game of chess all right i said that would be fun as we were setting up the board maggie wandered in and watched us sourly you never play with me she said accusingly to jack i do protested jack i played with you the other day ah yes said maggie bitterly but that was chess on sunday matters came to a head between the two of them they had been to a drinks party at midday and carried on drinking through lunch getting more and more stroppy i wandered downstairs in the afternoon it was my first time up i felt dreadful so exhausted in fact that i had to hang on to bits of furniture i found maggie in the drawingroom with the sunday papers and a bottle she had that sulky petulant look of a cat huddling on a window ledge to keep out of the rain outside in the garden wordsworth was chewing on one of the sunday joint bones and coleridge whod already buried his was walking round and round under the weeping ash tree wiping his face on the twigs jack ace and lucasta were making a bonfire jack was pulling up undergrowth with the exuberance of too much alcohol and fooling around with lucasta ace was laughing and breaking up sticks he was wearing a thick black sweater i thought what a handsome trio they made then collapsed on to the sofa wondering if it were possible to feel so weak have you got aces piece on venezuela i said here said maggie throwing the review section across to me its the only decent thing in the paper this week they had given him a huge byline and a picture taken before hed grown a moustache he looked younger and much less sombre he wrote very well the prose was spare and economic but his powers of observation were amazing it was as though he had a hundred eyes like argus you could feel the heat and dust and despair of the rebels you felt as though you were there its terribly good i said in surprise i know and hes just as good on the box thats why hes being headhunted so much at the moment god i hate the country she went on refilling her glass nothing to do for days on end no one to drive me to the sea when i want to go to the sea nothing round me except sulky faces and mine is the sulkiest of all what shall we do now in the end we settled down together to do a huge jigsaw puzzle of the new avengers it was all either of us were fit for it was nearly dusk when jack came in hullo lovely he said to me how are you feeling he was about to ruffle my hair his hands smelt of wood smoke i wouldnt i said ace wont let me wash it its coming off my head im sure ive got scurf i never get scurf said maggie smugly youre too thickskinned remarked jack bending over the puzzle bags i put in joanna lumleys crutch ill get it he said as the telephone went darling how are you we could hear him saying from the hall so sorry i missed you the other day why didnt you pop in i think this is a bit of steeds bowler hat said maggie who is it i whispered well we know her names darling said maggie no shes being marvellous jack went on kept us all in fits shes out with ace at the moment flying the kite he bought her the most fantastic fox puppet back from the states yes he thinks shes terrific maggie stiffened and her hand moved slower and slower over the puzzle ears on elastic it must be fay on the other end for at least a quarter of an hour jack had a very leisurely gossip about the family copeland the admiral and pendle having been up for the weekend i didnt dare look at maggie jack must be still tight or hed never have made such a meal of it i glanced round he was lounging on the hall chair his feet up on a table smiling into the telephone utterly relaxed when do you want lucasta back he asked eventually there was a long pause maggie unseeingly shoved a bit of steeds umbrella into the sky but thats marvellous jack went on enthusiastically thats a real break im so pleased for you darling until thursday of course we can no problem no dont worry about that well have her birthday party here weve had enough practice for christs sake you cant possibly organize it if youre working maggies got nothing to do maggie clenched a pile of sky up in her fist and ace is here and pendles girlfriend pru shes been ill but lucasta adores her and shell be on her feet by then so theres only my dear mother to rot things up youve booked a conjuror well tell him to come here instead well pay the petrol of course we will itll be fun dont worry about a thing if you get away early on thursday come to the party i know aced love to see you ok then and good luck darling maggie got up and poured herself a drink her hand was shaking so much she spilt most of it her green eyes blazed she looked like the queen in snow white and as quite as capable of cutting out lucastas heart jack wandered into the room looking pleased with himself well well well he said it was extremely unwell i wanted to hide under the sofa i suppose you want a drink said maggie softly you read me like a book said jack rather a bad one admittedly he was still tight that was fay he went on shes got a small film part at the beginning of next week playing the back of the pantomime horse i suppose said maggie so i said wed keep lucasta here for how long these words were dropped like pebbles into a deep deep pool until thursday night it doesnt matter if she misses school and whos going to look after her said maggie jack filled his glass why you are darling itll do both you and lucasta good to have some time together with me out of the way ive got things to do tomorrow tuesday and thursday well youll have to cancel them and think of someone else for a change said jack sharply picking up the sports page oh sod it united lost again i should have expected it of fay said maggie belligerently trust her not to give anyone any warning shes only just heard about the part protested jack oh very likely on a sunday afternoon shes just bloody inconsiderate jack went on reading the paper what have you got against her shes never done you any harm oh yes she has hissed maggie she divorced you if she hadnt id never be saddled with you now still jack didnt look up theres an extraordinary story here he said to me about a woman whos trying to get a crossing for toads on the preston motorway dont bug me screamed maggie its a pity youre not married to her if you think shes so wonderful i wish i was said jack quietly oh no i said dont say that please dont youre both pissed youll regret it later you keep out of it yelled maggie you havent been behaving like a vestal virgin since you came up here then the explosion came jack threw down the paper and got to his feet you spoilt little bitch he said softly youve never done a bloody stroke in your life youre lousy at housework you cant hold down a job you cant organize the builders or even remember to pick up a suit from the cleaners the only thing you show any talent for at all is writing cheques and bitching about my first wife but youre so bloody jealous of her you cant even be civil to my child your child is a monster howled maggie leave her out of it how can i you asked her to stay on it never enters your thick head i suppose that if fay gets work i wont have to work so bloody hard to keep her in alimony but you wouldnt think of that would you youre so wrapped up in yourself you never give a fuck what i do and i suppose old fairy fay did yes she did she loved me maggie was very white around the mouth why did you leave her then she screamed christ knows said jack ill tell you why because you were bored to death with her and she was no good in bed she was a bloody sight better than you if you want to know maggie gave a little gasp i put my head in my hands at least she didnt just lie back and think of pendle said jack viciously there are things that couples should only say to each other in bedrooms when they get a sort of sexual kick out of seeing who can hurl the worst insults knowing the battle will end up in bed stop it i screamed stop it jack took no notice just for four days out of your useless life he went on youve got the opportunity to do something useful to create some kind of relationship with lucasta and you reject it and if im lucky hissed maggie i get a conjuror to help me on thursday whats all that about you bastard so that old bag was better in bed than me was she and i have to act as nanny to her flaming child well i wont do it ill be here i said miserably ill look after her oh darling said maggie turning her fury on me ace wouldnt hear of that we cant have his precious patient having the tiniest set back oh shut up i shouted the door opened and in came lucasta daddy my tooths come out so thats p from the fairies and we lost the kite up a tree ace is still trying to get it down jesus said jack were now welcoming world listeners i fled upstairs trembling i couldnt bear it maggie had said awful things but jack had bugged her by that deliberately provocative telephone conversation and afterwards hed said far worse things than she had matters may have come to a head too but i could see that their relationship was like a hydra in a few hours it would have grown a dozen more heads i did my teeth and collapsed into bed oh the blissful welcome of cool plumped pillows and smooth turneddown sheets the fire had been banked up the water jug filled and a new spray of winter jasmin put in the blue vase all my mess of apple cores books tissues and sweet papers had been tidied up immediately mcgonagall landed in the middle of my stomach all four paws sticking out tail going straight up in the air next moment he dived under the eiderdown bicycling furiously against my toes i lay back on the pillows still shaking the door opened and coleridge wandered in followed by ace good girl he walked round the bed examining me as though i was a building site you didnt stay up too long how do you feel fine i said brightly liar he put a hand on my forehead what happened maggie and jack had a bit of a row they were boiling up for it might clear the air what was it about fays got a part jack said wed hang on to lucasta until thursday and have her birthday party here maggie had a go at fay and lucasta jack stuck up for them a bit too much much too much ace sighed christ they never let up do they what dyou want for supper i dont know how about some smoked salmon and a glass of champagne oh god thatd be lovely suddenly happy again i looked at him out of the corner of my eyes wont that give me a complete setback ace laughed probably ive given up i liked your piece i said it was wonderful he seemed surprisingly pleased but you must be used to people telling you how good you are ace shrugged all writers run on flattery you must know that coleridge chose that moment to clamber heavily on to the bed with the kitten swinging for grim death on his tail pretending to ignore ace coleridge circled three times then curled up on my feet and closed his eyes with a deep sigh i may have given up said ace but ive still got some standards left get off coleridge he wont be nearly so attractive when his suntan fades i tried to tell myself chapter eleven after breakfast on monday morning lucasta wandered into my room her eyes brimming with tears my tooths still there she wailed the fairies forgot to come oh poor darling i said putting my arms round her and daddys gone off to the office without even saying goodbye she sobbed even louder i suddenly realized how insecure she was behind the precocity and apparent sophistication whats the matter said ace appearing in the doorway the fairies forgot to come theyre terribly busy at this time of year he said helping father christmas sort out all the toys sometimes they turn up a bit late why dont you try again tonight i said keep her here ace mouthed to me over lucastas head thats a nice nightie i said lucasta sniffed can i have a sweet its a bit early would maggie let you oh maggie doesnt mind what i do said lucasta bitterly she likes me being naughty then she can grumble to daddy she unwrapped the lemon sherbet dropping the paper on the floor shall i draw you a picture why dont you do one for maggie i hate her if you were nicer to her she might be nicer to you i said and daddyd be so pleased daddy doesnt like her hes always shouting at her whats a slut by the way thats enough lucasta said ace coming back again for very special people the fairies work overtime why dont you go and have another look all right then said lucasta and scampered off poor little sod said ace too much spoiling too little attention look im going into manchester today the bbc want to see me and ive got to have dinner with the granada people tonight i thought i might as well kill two birds will you be all right of course i will i said quickly oh do look at mcgonagall the kitten having pounced on aces shoe laces frenziedly pedalling at them with all paws suddenly shot up his trouser leg leaving only a ginger tail sticking out the fairies have come the fairies have come screamed lucasta thundering down the passage theyve left me p i must go and show granny you make a lovely fairy i said to ace after shed gone wish i could magic up some fairy gold to pay a few bills said ace talk about walking into the valley of debt it was a relief to joke i was still dismayed how much i disliked the thought of him going off all day if you dont overdo things he said as he was leaving ill drive you down to the sea tomorrow can i wash my hair i said no im not risking you catching cold i got up for lunch still feeling very shaky i was appalled at my appearance in the mirror id lost pounds and my hair was hanging round my grey little face like damp seaweed i couldnt go out with ace looking like this i heard voices whispering outside you ask her i could hear rose saying no you ask her said maggie it sounds better coming from you anyway she seems to rather like children i opened my door they were in the passage dressed to go out i felt so pale and drab beside them darling said rose mrs braddocks going to bingo this afternoon shes been so grumpy recently i thought she needed cheering up and maggie and i are going out to lunch in ambleside so we thought you wouldnt mind looking after lucasta after lunch lucasta and i walked down to the village shop to spend her p it was a dull cloudy day the lake was as black as satin every tree was bare now december naked on the way home we walked through the churchyard sucking humbugs and playing hide and seek behind the tombstones my aunt elizabeths buried over there said lucasta pointing to a new white tombstone under a willow tree elizabeth beloved wife of ivan mulholland i read shed been so young only a year older than me on the grave somebody probably ace had laid a bunch of freesias oh god why did everything make me cry at the moment when you die god lives you and turns you into a fairy said lucasta when we got home we made hot buttered toast in front of the fire and looked at family photographs theres mummy and daddys wedding said lucasta i was surprised that fay was so pretty from maggies descriptions id expected her to be an old frump and theres my christening wasnt i a sweet little baby it was a picture of fay holding lucasta in long white frilly robes and jack looking on fondly and proudly i hoped maggie didnt look at these photographs very often shed be lacerated with jealousy the person i found myself looking at most was elizabeth with her cloud of dark hair and her huge eyes i noticed how besottedly she smiled up at ace and how handsome and young and carefree hed looked in those days what wouldnt i give to make him look happy like that again later lucasta and i were watching television after supper when rose arrived with professor copeland ace wont be back for hours she whispered coming into the study so were just going to have a little drink ill leave you to it then i said thatd be kind darling james is terrified of catching your cold wearily i went upstairs i still had cotton wool legs and felt absolutely knackered i was appalled how much i was missing ace suddenly i caught sight of my awful hair in the landing mirror id never get him that way to a counterpoint of lucastas chatter i did my nails plucked my eyebrows shaved my legs and had a bath i really think you ought to go to bed i said feebly im not tired to hell with ace i must wash my hair i could dry it by the time he got back oh the bliss as the dirt streamed out the only socket that fitted the plug of my hairdryer was on the landing under the cuckoo clock i sat in the passage on a carpet worn almost bare by generations of mulholland children waiting for the cuckoo to come out lucasta wandered off to watch starsky and hutch id only just started drying my hair when i felt a tap on my shoulder i looked round and nearly jumped out of my skin when i saw it was ace what the bloody hell do you think youre doing he snapped ripping the plug out of the socket sitting in a nightie with wet hair in howling draught i muttered and fled into my bedroom fortunately mrs braddock had lit the fire ace picked up a towel and sat down in the blue velvet chair come here he said itll dry all fluffy i grumbled i thought hed rub my head off now finish it off he sat down on the bed and lit a cigarette i looked at him under my lashes as i crouched by the fire i saw that he was grinning youre impossible he said i only have to leave this place for half a day for complete anarchy to break out every light blazing lucasta watching the sort of television bound to give her nightmares and my stepmother and the egregious professor copeland drinking gin in the drawingroom did you throw him out i said couldnt be bothered rose was so upset last time thought id be nice to him for a change the kitten emerged from under the bed and teetered towards him he scooped it up on to his knee did you have a nice dinner i said bloody boring who was there he reeled off a string of stars you mustnt be so blasé i said id give anything to meet people like that theyre no more exciting than the fishmonger or the postman once you get to know them mcgonagall was purring like a turbo jet engine as ace stroked its blond tummy lucky lucky kitten i thought involuntarily will granada offer you a job probably but still dont know if i want to settle in this country he put the kitten down and got up and felt my hair youre dry he said and taking my hands pulled me to my feet i had an insane feeling he was going to kiss me but he just said into bed with you can i read i said as i snuggled down under the sheets i suppose so not for long are you going to bed i said i thought id go downstairs and try and find out what makes professor copeland tick monumental egotism i should think youre going to bury the hatchet i said thats nice bury it in his cranium more likely for a minute he looked at me frowning thoughtfully funny i missed you today i felt myself going scarlet goodness thats the first nice thing youve ever said to me you havent given me much chance he said and was gone a fat lot of reading i did after that he missed me he actually said hed missed me ok it was a millionth of what hed ever felt for elizabeth but it was a start next day after a sleepless night as i was getting ready to go out maggie wandered into my room god i feel depressed she said why dont you come out with us i said praying she wouldnt accept she shook her head i thought id go into manchester and buy a dress can you lend me a tenner the next visitor was lucasta driving me spare while i was trying to do my face could i do her hair in a pony tail could she try on my lip stick could i do up the sleeve buttons on her shirt in a pathetic attempt to appear healthier i slapped on suntan makeup and a bright coral lipstick but it made me look like an old tart so i washed it off and settled for looking pale and interesting with my wildly dishevelled curls which were quite out of control as a result of aces drying methods i looked a bit like swinburne certainly i was raring to swop the lilies and languors of virtue for the roses and raptures of vice why arent you wearing a bra said lucasta as i pulled on a dark sweater and jeans because the only bra i brought needs washing i said untruthfully can i come with you i promise i wont talk all the time no you cant said ace from the doorway pru had to put up with quite enough of you yesterday prus not wearing a bra announced lucasta rose lent me a pale suède coat with a fur lining and hood the forecast says the temperatures going to drop and i dont want you catching cold she said adding out of the corner of her mouth and do keep ace away as long as possible im sure professor copeland is already mewing outside roses bedroom waiting to be let in said ace as we drove down the drive it was one of those days that seemed to have lingered over from summer the air was gentle as silk and everything was suffused in a golden glow we had lunch at a little seaside pub and ate shellfish and drank buckets of white wine suddenly i found i was terribly shy with ace my conversation kept sticking then coming out in great dollops like tomato ketchup this is what i call hard core prawn i said spiking a large piece of shell fish i must say it is heavenly to have a day out not that i dont love all your family i said hastily they drive me demented said ace you shouldnt worry about them so much i know and i must stop telling them what to do if they want to drink and fornicate themselves stupid its no concern of mine i giggled let them fight their own battles how did you get on with the professor last night awful he tried to relate to me youve got enough relations round here as it is ace grinned he said he wanted to have an indepth discussion on my piece on venezuela because he found so many parallels with his book on africa and he was off exactly threequarters of an hour of absolute tripe on botswana im supposed to be trained to cut people off when they started waffling but jesus copeland had me beat i dont believe hes written a word of that book either its all talk poor rose i said gouging bread along the grooves of my cocquille shell soaking up the last traces of sauce she needs a nice millionaire in shining armour she needs a kick up the arse said ace any millionaire would be bled white in a matter of months solvencys a question of attitude not income shes having a terrible effect on maggie too in a way they compete maggie sees rose getting off with half westmorland and cant see why she shouldnt do the same the sooner jack gets her into that house the better she ought to have a baby of course she should give her something to do have they been trying theyre being extremely trying at the moment said ace i want to knock their heads together dyou want some pudding no thanks just coffee if she had her own baby i said shed be less jealous of lucasta ace filled up my glass you get on all right with lucasta dont you yes i said but im not her stepmother shes sweet lucasta but shes learnt to be diplomatic she can beam at jack with one eye and freeze maggie with the other all at the same time and although i think jacks lovely i gathered that several times said ace oh shut up i said not in that way i know hes your brother and all that but hes terribly insensitive towards maggie always putting her down i couldnt cope with it i hope to christ they dont break up said ace to lose one wife looks like misfortune i said but to lose two looks like carelessness its difficult to get anyone to take you seriously if youve got two marriages under your belt youre a perceptive child sometimes arent you not about myself i said gouging crosses in the brown sugar there was a pause ace shot me a speculative glance pendles the one who worries me really hes heading for a crackup if hes not careful ah pendle i said tearing out the soft inside of my roll and kneading it into pellets he only went after me because i looked like maggie and he was trying to kick the habit you dont have to talk about it if you dont want to suddenly i found i did he took me back to his flat and tried to pull me the first night we met wed been to a party i was a bit tight but when the crunch came he stopped in the middle he simply couldnt bring himself to i felt my face going very hot and took another slug at my wine it was awful as though he really hated touching me like a person making himself pick up toads i think i knew it was no good for ages but ive always been one to go on watering plants long after theyre dead i knew i was living in a fools paradise better than no paradise at all said ace he must have given you a hard time im sorry wasnt much fun but in a way it was such a nightmare during that afterwards hasnt been nearly so bad like the red queen pricking her finger pain first prick afterwards pricks dont seem to have had much to do with it said ace im going to have a large brandy would you like one too later we wandered for miles along the shingle the waves booming the seagulls circling and complaining overhead i suddenly looked at ace angular features softened black hair slightly ruffled suntan whipped up by the wind and my stomach disappeared youre very quiet he said what are you thinking about oh i stammered i was just thinking how nice it is and how i dont want to go back to work and my horrid old boss how old is he quite old i said without thinking he must be thirty and then realized what id said i mean i only called him my old boss like some people call their wives their old woman when theyre not old i mean i see said ace dryly when we got back to the car we looked out to sea for a minute please god make him kiss me i prayed ill behave well for at least a year god wasnt listening ace lit a cigarette i came here with elizabeth he said not long before she died it was a bitterly cold day she used to feel the cold i kept giving her pairs of gloves but she always lost them she had a whole drawer full of single gloves because she couldnt bear to throw away anything id given her i found my eyes filling with tears does it still hurt all the time it gets better then one has terrible jabs like a war wound its pretty good hell being a widower i could feel him carefully putting quotes around the word depression makes you lousy company when you meet old mates youre reminded of previous times when you were together you avoid happily married couples you cant stand the togetherness and you can feel yourself projecting your bitterness and indifference on to everyone else however sympathetic people are theres something humiliating about disaster you always feel yourself being pitied or patronized the dark eyes were brooding beneath the thick brows what a splendidly strong face he had he was not at all like the person i first thought much more complicated and though he didnt realize it much more vulnerable one feels guilty too about forgetting but you cant give up women for good i said i dont its been two years now casual affairs are all right but when youve had the sort of thing elizabeth and i had casual affairs arent really enough on the other hand one feels guilty about becoming totally committed to someone else he threw his cigarette out of the window and started up the car it had suddenly got much much colder an apricot sun was firing the pine trees as we drove home some pole was playing chopin nocturnes on the car wireless suddenly a black and white bird flashed across the road it was a magpie one for sorrow two for joy i looked frantically round for its mate id had enough unhappiness recently but there was no sight of another one not too tired he said i feel marvellous well stop soon for a drink an hour later i sat in a happy stupor drinking a huge dry martini thank you for a heavenly day i said ace smiled its not over yet the foods good here would you like to stop for dinner oh yes please i said ill go and ring home i was expanding like a flower but my daydreams were rudely interrupted afraid weve had dinner here he said a couple of mates have turned up unexpectedly at home arrived just after we left and been cooling their heels waiting ever since so wed better go back we can all eat out locally i told jack to book a table we drove as fast as possible along the narrow roads headlamps lighting up stone walls hung with rusty bracken and fern the wireless was playing schuberts c minor symphony and as various sections of the orchestra stalked catlike through the second movement i tried to fight off bitter disappointment no cosy têteàtête now just mulhollands scrapping all through dinner with two more of aces friends clamouring for his attention and no doubt having conversations about politics ten feet above my head ace suddenly seemed very uptight too the lovely intimacy wed built up during the day was disintegrating like an iced lolly at the end of its stick it was all the fault of that bloody magpie look ace said are they i began we both started speaking at exactly the same time no you go on we both said there was a pause are they nice your friends i said you may know one of them jimmy batten hes a barrister knows pendle i think oh i love him i said perking up he was prosecuting in pendles rape case whos the other bloke its a girl said ace an american called berenice de courcy sounds familiar i said doesnt she churn out bestsellers about raising ones consciousness shes a big star in the states isnt she thats right said ace slowing down to avoid a sheep and ravishingly beautiful i can support the movement and shave my legs sort of thing thats the one trust jimmy batten to have someone like that in tow i thought he was married not very said ace putting his foot on the accelerator i wanted to put on some makeup to compete with the formidable berenice but there was not much i could do careering along in the dark i nearly gouged out my eye with my mascara wand then slapped on the dregs of a bottle of diorissimo and had done with it chapter twelve they were all in the drawingroom when we got back neither rose nor maggie were looking their best rose had obviously had too much to drink and no time to wash her hair a threedayold fringe separated on her forehead showing up lines making her look much older than usual maggie was sulking and wearing too much makeup jimmy batten stood with his back to the fire nursing a large gin and tonic and exuding urbanity he looked less attractive than i remembered him his camelcoloured casual clothes were a little too tight and clashed with his now drinkflushed face his sleek dapper otter good looks went much better with a dark suit jack just back from the office already with several large whiskies under his belt was gazing at berenice with undisguised admiration and well he might because she was ravishing straight out of the pages of harpers with a mane of black hair rippling down her back a long lean figure slitty dark eyes a wide red mouth and a conker brown suntan she was wearing a black satin shirt grey suède gauchos clinched by a black hermes belt and black cowboy boots which showed off her terrific legs and she exuded so much glossy good health she made everyone else look like hospital cases goodness i thought j batten has done well for himself the next moment she had swiftly crossed the room to us ivan sweetest she purred taking both his hands i know we should have warned you but i got your letter and you sounded so down i decided to come over myself instead of answering ace gave a slightly twisted smile and kissed her smooth brown cheek you were always one for surprises i thought you were in florida i got bored out of my mind with sunbathing then james phoned from new york and persuaded me to come over hullo ace said jimmy grinning i was guarding her from hijackers honest i was then he gave me a great hug pru my darling i hear youve been terribly poorly you do look a bit pulled down never mind berenice is the health freak round here shell soon pump you full of megavitamins and have you right as rain hi prudence said berenice flashing her great white teeth at me james hasnt stopped talking about you since we met she turned back to ace how was venezuela darling i read your piece on sunday it was terrific boy can you empathize with the underprivileged and ive got finished copies of brave nutritional world she went on picking up a book with a large photograph of herself on the front theyre already reprinting my british publishers really zapped out when they heard i was coming the bbc and border have already been on and im going to granada in manchester tomorrow ace laughed youve certainly been busy rosemary has been so gracious letting me use the phone said berenice smiling at rose youre quite right about your family ivan i recognized margaret and rosemary and of course jack immediately without being introduced weve been verbalizing nonstop since we arrived for a second i caught jacks eye and started to giggle then hastily turned it into a cough ill get you a drink said jack who wanted an excuse to refill his own sure you wont change your mind berenice she refuses to drink anything but tomato juice he added to ace berenice smiled and said she didnt need alcohol she was bombed out of her skull just meeting ivans folks she didnt seem quite so keen on the animals giving coleridge and wordsworth vertical pats to keep them away whenever they approached her and fussily brushing antonia frasers ginger fur off the sofa and her shirt i dont mean to sound pressing said jimmy batten as his glass was filled up but i for one ought to mop up some alcohol soon ive booked a table at dorothys at said jack rose peered at her face in her powder compact then calmly got a pair of pants out of her bag and cleaned the glass with them berenice determinedly didnt look shocked you can count me out said rose putting pants and mirror away and getting to her feet im going to wash my hair and go to bed early im going to change i said are they staying the night i said to rose as we went upstairs yes mrs braddocks made up a bed hadnt they better have my room i said its got a double bed oh no sweetie its not worth shifting your things just for one night jimmys going early tomorrow morning he can have linns room and berenicell be sleeping with ace i clutched the banisters for support i thought she was jimmys girlfriend i whispered oh no darling she and ace have been living together in new york for the past six months are you sure i said of course i am said rose rather acidly shes spent all afternoon when she wasnt on the telephone telling us what a warm beautiful human being ace is i hope shes tough enough to cope with him once in my room despair overwhelmed me to be so unprepared to have no idea i had fallen so totally in love only to find it was hopeless and to think id been presumptuous enough to imagine that a man in aces class could possibly fancy someone as young and unsophisticated as me it was ludicrous i didnt cry its funny you dont when something really cataclysmic happens i sat on the bed trembling and dry eyed clutching the kitten who purred noisily and grooved the side of its face against my chin desperately i cast around for some kind of comfort but there was none no lifebelts no driftwood no passing ships oh no i whispered no no no there was a knock on the door my heart leapt perhaps it was ace come to say it was all some horrible mistake but it was lucasta in tears i cant find my foxy she sobbed ive looked for him everywhere hes in the hot cupboard i said we put him there after he fell in the bath yesterday oh so we did please dont go away again ive been left with mrs braddock all day i wasnt allowed in the drawingroom because bare knees is there she said she just loved children then she kept telling me to go away granny says shes going to marry ace i hope she doesnt at twelve oclock tonight i can say tomorrows my birthday you will stay for my party wont you would i i was tempted to bolt straight back to london but couldnt bear to tear myself away quite yet oh look said lucasta running to the window snow was beginning to fall a glistening crumbling drift had formed on the window ledge now a storm of big flakes swept giddily by tomorrow we can make a snowman oh i wish i had a sledge i looked at myself in the mirror my reflection stared back pale and holloweyed with the exhausted grittedteeth look of a candidate whos just lost his seat what the hell could i wear tonight ace had seen everything id brought all my seductive clothes were in london anyway except for my green culotte dress which was much too naked and went too well with my little green face in the end i kept my jeans on and put on a white slightly seethrough shirt not that theres much to see any more i thought gloomily then i discovered id left my only decent eyeshadow behind in the pub at lunchtime it seemed centuries ago when i was happy ace was waiting in the hall hed changed into a suit and a pink shirt oh the beauty of those broad pinstriped shoulders and long long legs i could smell his aftershave i felt faint with longing are you sure youre up to going out he said i could read the compassion in his eyes im fine i snapped absolutely terrified of betraying myself dorothys restaurant was named after dorothy wordsworth it had soft lighting black beams framed photostats of pages from dorothy wordsworths diary on the whitewashed walls and forced daffodils on every table it was pretty but a bit twee berenice however absolutely freaked out standing in the doorway of the diningroom in her huge wolf coat shrieking my god i am not ready for this i am simply not ready for this well if youre not i am said jimmy batten briskly come on pru you go in first ill sit next to you maggie sat on the other side with jack opposite me and berenice next to him and then ace so at least i didnt have to spend all dinner directly avoiding his eyes berenice made a great deal of palaver about removing her coat and entrusting it to the waiter until everyone in the restaurant was staring at us isnt this place just darling she went on glancing round at the couples in the alcoves we must come here on our own one evening ivan darling she was slightly less amused when she consulted the menu which took up the whole table and discovered there were no vegetarian dishes i forgot you were all on this carnivore trip over here she said can you have a word with the waiter ivan they might have some egg plant lasagne or some lentils theyre not into all that macrobiotic crap over here said ace this is england oh well said berenice looking martyred ill just settle for veggies and sour cream this evening id like an enormous steak very rare and chips jack said to the waiter and tell the wine waiter to step on it were not into gourmet tripping any more in the states said berenice i just ask people to drop around and take pot luck and then dump another quart of water in the lentil soup said jimmy batten spreading butter thickly on a roll berenice looked at him in disapproval you dont realize what white flour does to you james it amazes me the garbage you british eat ivan was living on hamburgers when i met him no wonder he nearly had an ulcer whens your new book coming out said jack in january its being translated into fifteen languages it ought to be translated into english first said ace oh starp sweetest starp said berenice laughing hes so vile about my literary style being an academic im afraid im used to writing for an optimum intellectual readership you know i cant believe im in ivans home town at last we cant quite believe youre here either said jack were going to need at least four bottles ace such a relief going into a restaurant where im not known said berenice in the states i cant cross the street without being mobbed shes utterly poisonous i thought cheer up darling whispered jimmy batten in my ear hows pendle hes coming up on saturday to collect me i said not going very well i shook my head thought as much he lowered his voice still after maggie poor old you i should have warned you when we met in london maggie looks terrible too ive never seen such a deterioration in anyone she used to be so pretty the dinner seemed to go on for ever i had to force myself to get any food down taking frequent gulps of wine ace was talking to jimmy batten about delinquency in new york berenice was going on and on about jacks unimaginative life style you ought to cut out that nine to five shit she said waving a cauliflower floweret in the air and get in touch with the universe i cant really cut it out protested jack ive got two households to support now berenice was rabbiting on about her last husband i wanted an open living relationship based on trust and growth and all he wanted was his jockey shorts ironed i mean we werent coming from the same place at all and ace doesnt expect you to do his ironing said jack suddenly i felt his ankle rubbing up and down against mine oh starp dont make comparisons said berenice putting one of her lovely sunburned hands on jacks arm ivan is just terrific he gives off this incredible togetherness its beautiful we have these terrifically productive dialogues sitting around for hours rapping surprised you dont find him too forceful said jack well hes a leo of course admitted berenice theyre very big on macho tripping but hes trying to overcome it for a second i met aces eye found myself blushing and looked away i was a big star of course when i met ivan berenice went on but my life was empty i needed a whole loving caring environment where i could be totally committed youve no idea the creases hes taken out of my mind so ace is the one whos doing the ironing said jack gravely berenice didnt flicker she was not to be deflected she was in such full flood she didnt even notice when jack rolled a tonic bottle across the table towards me inside on a bit of paper hed written help i took it out and wrote i love you on the back and rolled it back again it was a comfort that he thought her as silly as i did but she was certainly mad for ace shed reached the stage now when she couldnt bear not to touch him her free hand strayed now to his hair now to the nape of his neck now to his thigh then she decided i needed bringing in and asked me what i thought of northern ireland but my mouth was still full of dry unswallowable chicken so i just shook my head and she said she thought peoples capacity for outrage in this country was amazingly dulled then it was maggies turn she was wearing the shirt ace had brought her from the states im so glad youre wearing that shirt margaret ivan and i must have gone to a dozen shops to find the right colour then she turned to ace licking him on the ear and youve no idea the free gift ive got for you later darling she said huskily i couldnt bear any more i could feel the sweat rising on my forehead it was so hot must go to the loo i muttered wriggling round the table and scuttling across the restaurant when i came out i found jimmy batten ill take you home he said oh please i felt sick and giddy very near to tears ill just go and tell everyone could you just get a waiter to tell them after weve gone i couldnt face ace at the moment the snow was thickening as we drove home settling in the arms of trees and on the tops of walls and gates as we reached the end of the village and started on the road up to the mulhollands house we passed a large notice saying unfenced road beware of animals its not the animals you have to beware of round here i said bitterly its not pendle any more is it said jimmy batten oh god is it that obvious only to me i could never understand what a larky girl like you could see in pendle hes like a synopsis ace is a whole book is it a very big thing him and berenice tis for her she talks a lot of crap about ltr living together relationships as she calls them but shed do anything to get him up the aisle i guess hes the one whos putting up the sandbags hes not ready to marry anyone yet whats so marvellous about her i said dismally superior muscle tone darling shes a very ballsy lady shes terrific in the sack she used to be a girlfriend of mine i couldnt cope with the neurotics but maybe ace can handle her i see i said listlessly poor little pru jimmy put out a hand and touched my cheek you havent had much luck with the mulhollands have you after hed seen me upstairs he said im leaving at crack of dawn tomorrow ive got a case in birmingham ring me when you get back to london ill buy you dinner i got into bed and read the same page over and over again then i got pendles photograph out of my top drawer it was tattered and creased from being hawked around in my bag for so long it was as though i was looking at a total stranger how could i have ever loved him beside ace he seemed a complete shadow it was after midnight when i heard them coming home the snow was six inches deep on the windowsill there was a knock on my door it was ace he came and sat down on the bed why didnt you tell me you felt bad id have brought you home you were otherwise engaged i said bleakly he looked at me in silence the tassels of the bedside lamp fretting a shadow across his left cheekbone you looked miserable all evening i was watching you i hope you learnt something i snapped shifting my legs irritably next moment pendles photograph had fluttered down on to the floor ace picked it up and looked at it for a minute i see have you been talking to jimmy yes i said tonelessly what did a thumping lie matter now seeing him brought the whole pendle thing back youve had a long day one doesnt get over these things all at once and they always seem worse when youre tired i felt my chin trembling it was the onset of tears again ace put his hand out but i flinched away if he touched me i knew i was lost dont i cant bear it he sighed took my book from me and switched off the bedroom lamp try and get some sleep i heard his bedroom door open and shut my body seemed to burn as i tossed and turned i must forget about him i must stop imagining all the things he and berenice would be doing in a minute i wondered if hed removed elizabeths picture before he got to work large tears rolled out of the corners of my eyes the night seemed to go on and on one thing could be said in favour of falling in love with ace it was going to make dying a whole lot of fun chapter thirteen when i woke next morning i could see dirty flakes of snow falling outside the window i had only halfdrawn the curtains the snow was coming down sideways now slanting to the left if i stared at it long enough i felt giddy i closed my eyes but knew i wouldnt get back to sleep again gradually i pieced together yesterdays events and groaned really they ought to find a premarriage guidance council for people like me pendle was due in two days perhaps if it kept on snowing the roads would get blocked up and hed never arrive there was a knock on the door and mrs braddock came in with a red nose and a breakfast tray followed by coleridge the kitten swinging on his back legs lovely weather said mrs braddock the snow came over my ankles when i opened the back door someone will have to shovel it away but it wont be me you shouldnt have bothered i said wriggling into a sitting position i was going to come down mr ace insisted he said youre to eat it all as you didnt touch your dinner last night and to remember your medicine you are kind i said valiantly trying to work up some enthusiasm for bacon and eggs is he having breakfast gone down to mill with mr jack mr battens left hes a nice gentleman and shes up already poking around the kitchen giving orders asking questions who i said mrs braddock was suddenly a picture of outraged dignity berenice or whatever she calls herself waited until mr ace had gone then down she came poking into my larder saying we were all poisoning ourselves with chemicals and threw all my packets of cake mix in the dustbin ive cooked for this family for thirty years hardly a day of sickness never known such a healthy lot nor have i they must have constitutions like oxen to survive all that booze shes even given me a shopping list puffed mrs braddock where can i find soya beans and brown rice and courgettes and bran in the village in the middle of winter i giggled get mr braddock to make her up a bran mash down at the stables well i must get back to my kitchen the washing machines acting very strange and miss maggie left the professors hat in the hall and antonia fraser slept on it last night and squashed it flat as a pancake the cat sat on the at i said feeling slightly better i got up gave the bacon and eggs to coleridge who already had long trails of saliva hanging from either side of his mouth and waved at lucasta who was building a snowman in the garden in the drawingroom i found berenice looking like something out of country life wearing an olive green cashmere twinset a brown tweed skirt beautiful casual shoes with stacked heels and listening to vivaldi she was obviously being thwarted in her attempts to spend a morning en famille doesnt anyone ever get up here that poor old woman whos quite past it is having to do everything ive never seen anything like the dirt in this house dog hair everywhere and ive just spent half an hour cleaning the john the what oh the loo i said she took a bottle of brown tablets out of her bag here are the multivitamin tablets i promised you id take four if i were you three times a day gosh thanks i said feeling perhaps id misjudged her are you into yoga prudence she said flexing her neck gracefully whenever i get tense i sit down and meditate ive got a book on the subject ill lend it to you im sure it would help you get it together with pendle interfering old busybody i wondered how much ace had told her now she was walking around the room examining everything this room could be so charming if only someone bothered in my apartment in new york ive gone back to natural fibres and earthy colours i mean environment is terrifically important to ones inner serenity shed have that red wallpaper out in a flash i wondered if i really tried if i could ever be as beautiful as she was and decided not standing by the window with her glowing suntan and the snowy mountains behind she was rather like a winter sports poster perhaps mrs braddock would come in yodelling and bearing gluwein what does rosemary do all day apart from squandering ivans inheritance asked berenice well its a good question shes got lots of friends plays bridge looks beautiful and er has fun and margaret shes really out of shape her derrière follows her upstairs well the same really i said lamely but she seems to have less fun i got very negative vibes from her last night i guess she and jack arent getting it together i must have a good rap with her later about redefining the parameters of their relationship she got up and turned vivaldi over to the flip side this is the only record that hasnt got scratches i dont expect anyones ever played it i said i suppose wed better start thinking about lucastas party im an expert on kids parties said berenice smugly last summer i gave an all night party for my son che hes the same age as lucasta but super intelligent how on earth did you keep them all amused all that time oh we didnt bother with games i provided a running buffet soya bean canapés carrot cake and my lentil loaf and the kids wrote their own scenario as the party went along at that moment lucasta barged in emitting tarzan howls and leaving the door open will you come and see my snowman she said kneeling down by the fire and holding her hands to the flames dyou think the lakes going to freeze over can i have a biscuit may i have a biscuit corrected berenice with a charming smile a raw carrot would be much better for you im not a donkey are you coming pru is your mummy up yet said berenice ignoring her rudeness shes not my mummy hissed lucasta shes my fathers wife almost on cue maggie came through the door she shot a venomous look at lucasta but didnt say anything she looked very pale are you all right i said so so look jacks on the telephone you wouldnt like to have a word with him i went into the hall and picked up the receiver baby said jack are you better hows the great american disaster heavy he laughed you wouldnt like to have lunch with me then afterwards we can choose lucastas presents and get the things for the party oh id love to what about maggie she looks rotten i said doesnt she want to come with us not in the least ill pick you up about one oclock back in the drawingroom berenice was starting her ancient mariner act on maggie i exercise every morning she was saying exercises aimed at the stomach the tarps of the legs and whole pelvic area that one uses for sex start using those internal muscles and everything improves and i mean everything margaret she smiled warmly at maggie im sure you and jack can work it through ace came back at lunchtime with jack who said hed just flip through his mail and wed be off maggie was still in her dressinggown rose hadnt surfaced berenice was flapping around about going on television in manchester that evening the producer has said dont bother to dress up would her french jeans and hermes belt be too casual what time did ace think they ought to start would the roads be bad i saw ace stifle a yawn he looked absolutely knackered too much of berenices superior muscle tone i thought sourly having been so crochety with him last night i found it very difficult to act normally now we were acidly polite to each other i still couldnt look him straight in the eye the telephone rang maggie shot out of the room to answer it normally jack wouldnt be home at this time of day i wondered idly if it was pendle ringing berenice turned to ace shall i make an egg plant lasagne for this evening sweetest we could heat it up when we get back ace said that hed much rather eat out maggie poked her head round the door its for you ace she said its penelope blake you look a bit uptight sweetest said berenice when ace came back five minutes later shall i massage your neck i am not uptight snapped ace that was elizabeths mother confirming lunch tomorrow im sorry he added to jack it was arranged before i knew about lucastas party i cant really stand them up course you cant said jack throwing a pile of envelopes into the wastepaper basket youll miss my party wailed lucasta ace pulled her on to his knee no i wont lovie its only forty miles away i should get back by five if the snow doesnt get any worse im so much looking forward to meeting elizabeths folks tomorrow said berenice im sure we can be very supportive im afraid ive got to go on my own said ace bluntly i havent seen them since the funeral it wouldnt be very tactful to barge in with someone else berenice shook back her dark hair angrily suddenly there was a muscle going in her cheek and what am i supposed to do while youre away you can help pru organize the party lunch with jack was a blissful relief we both drank too much and i told jack about berenices plans for revamping the drawingroom shell have my mother jogging in a track suit and mrs braddock in an old peoples home by christmas well all be out at the rate shes going she believes in clearing the decks i said gloomily and she isnt too choosy who she sweeps into the sea shes certainly put the kibosh on ace he could hardly walk this morning never actually came near the mill at all just sloped off to see an osteopath about his bad back i giggled jack always had the ability to make things seem less awful i expect youll be round at the osteopath tomorrow i said berenice has been giving maggie a few tips on sexual technique jack took my hand when you said i love you in that tonic bottle last night did you mean it yes i said brothersister well always be friends wont we christ how maudlin can one get what the hell am i going to do about maggie you could boost her morale a bit more i said afterwards expansive from drink we went shopping buying party food and three cases of entre deux mers to cheer up the mothers said jack then we spent a fortune at the toyshop buying loads of little presents for the party and a red and silver sleigh and a threefoot fluffy white rabbit as main presents for lucasta i bought her a black velvet cat suit i thought she might like to wear to the party its so much easier shopping with you than maggie sighed jack she always gets green eyes when i spend money on lucasta when we got back ace and berenice had gone i found maggie eating chocolate cake in the kitchen what are you doing in here i said its the warmest room the central heatings given up the ghost berenice and i have been having a terrifically productive dialogue jack and i have got to work through our conflicts and stop laying bad trips on each other and restructure our marriage thats nice said jack coming in with a tumbler half full of whisky and heading for the fridge you can start off by putting a couple of my shirts in the washing machine thats broken too said maggie it went bananas this afternoon it was like lake windermere in here an hour ago well you can wash a shirt by hand said jack tomorrow is my daughters birthday i have important customers coming over i need a clean shirt christ isnt anyone ever going to defrost this fridge i am not going to wash your shirt jack said maggie her voice rising just because i am a female person you are a microcosm of the whole male power base dont you know the whole macho number is sick oh boy said jack that is profound i think youve been talking to berenice i cant even get the ice tray out but i would have thought you and ms de courcy would have provided enough hot air to melt it cant we even have a meaningful dialogue youve been on a macho trip all your life jack oh shut up im entitled to my own opinions of course you are i dont want to hear them thats all oh i hate you sobbed maggie rushing out of the room and slamming the door behind her at least that might loosen the ice tray said jack later we watched berenice on television she was wearing a mans grey flannel suit a white shirt and the inevitable hermes belt shes certainly easy on the eye i said and absolute hell on the ears said jack i was safely in bed by the time they came home but this time ace didnt bother to come and say good night chapter fourteen the good thing about lucastas birthday party was that i was so busy i didnt have much time to brood after a lousy night i got up early it was bitterly cold the central heating was still kaput and there were frost patterns like doilies all over the windows i put on a thick grey sweater over two other sweaters rust shorts tights leg warmers and boots and i was still cold i went down to the kitchen to help mrs braddock make sausage rolls and fillings for the sandwiches she was still muttering about berenice i was mindlessly mixing salad cream with hardboiled eggs when jack came in on his way to the office knock knock he said whos there ivan ivan who ivan orrible eadache i havent actually its maggie shes complaining of a migraine may be diplomatic because of lucastas party but she looks pretty rough probably suffering from an overdose of berenice yesterday im sorry to dump all this on you theres still the bridge rolls the cake some meringues and eclairs to be collected from the village and the conjurorll be here by he picked up his briefcase ill come home soon as im shot of these americans will you be all right id rather cope with thirty children than berenice i said send them all out for a run in the snow said jack and offer as a prize to the one who comes home last a blackbird suddenly tapped its yellow beak on the frosted window peering in at us with inquisitive bright eyes id stay outside if i were you i said its much warmer out there ace came down looking even more heavyeyed than yesterday presumably from another night of passion hows your bad back i said sweetly he shot me a dirty look and went off and vented his rage on the gas board there are women and children freezing to death over here i could hear him saying for christ sake cant you put chains on your vans i want someone over here immediately lucasta was delighted with her presents ace had given her snoopy in a snoopy kennel handbag from the states berenice gave her a flower press and spent a lot of time explaining that lucasta mustnt use it on grannys cyclamens but must wait until the summer granny gave me a giveoutcher from harrods lucasta told me but i like the sledge and snoopy and your velvet cat suit best i went upstairs to see maggie she was huddled in bed a brimming ashtray beside her looking terrible ill try and get up later she said did you know today was the first day of the rest of your life another of berenices profundities i said crossly i think its rather good its been said before berenice doesnt seem very keen on you said maggie oh i said what did she say about me it was yesterday i was saying you were pretty she said your looks were rather ordinaire and she didnt consider you a woman of substance bloody bitch i said crossly what else did she say but maggie was gazing out at the white landscape today is the first day of the rest of my life she said dreamily im going to take a lover the question is whose id just finished making jellies and filling the meringues with cream and was making a hideous hedgehog by sticking cubes of pineapple and cheese on sticks into a grapefruit half when berenice arrived down looking radiantly businesslike in black wool trousers a red shirt and her hair tied back in a red bandana arent you frozen i said of course not she said briskly my exercises whip up the circulation wheres ivan she went on pouring out her revolting health food breakfast that looked like rat droppings in sawdust trying out the new sledge with lucasta and rosemary and margaret still in bed i said chopping up some more pieces of cheese and giving a bit to the dogs who were slobbering at my feet berenice looked annoyed theyre not being very supportive are they after all lucasta is jacks biological daughter brushing some nonexistent hairs off her trousers she stepped over coleridge to get some milk from the fridge those damn dogs are moulting everywhere and im sure i found a flea in our bed this morning its much too cold for fleas said ace coming in at the back door with lucasta there were snow flakes on his hair and his moustache he looked cold and cross like simpkin in the tailor of gloucester back home after picking everything up from the village mrs braddock and i were spreading chopped eggs on bridge rolls trying not to listen to berenice giving a blow by blow account of how she made soya bean canapés ace was blowing up balloons they were playing carols on the wireless god i thought dismally itll be christmas in a couple of weeks how the hell was i going to survive all the festivities my thoughts careered wildly towards ace kissing me under the mistletoe handing me a present in front of the tree and careered away again no doubt hed spend christmas enjoying berenice in some fourstar paris hotel lucasta sat on the table eating maltesers and swinging her legs and telling us the plot of her nativity play then the angel gabriel appears to mary and announces her and then he goes to the shepherds and says piece of earth good will to all men i caught aces eye and giggled it was midday everyone except berenice had been banished from the kitchen so she could give her all to her carrot cake even ace had been thrown out she was sulking because he refused to try one of her soya bean canapés the dogs were behaving appallingly because no one had had time to take them for a proper walk mrs braddock was trying to clean the hall floor putting down newspapers to dry it as she went wordsworth sat just behind her whining querulously coleridge had just eaten a whole plate of sausages and then rushed off upstairs i found him rolling around on ace and berenices bed wiping his face on their counterpane elizabeths photograph had been removed from the bedside i noticed fifteen love to berenice i went downstairs and gathered up the balloons climbing on to the hall table to pin them in a bunch from the ceiling suddenly i was overcome by dizziness and felt myself swaying the next moment two hands grabbed me firmly round the hips and steadied me i looked down and blushed scarlet it was ace he was wearing a navy blue overcoat with the velvet collar turned up obviously just going out my fingers were suddenly all thumbs i took ages to tie the string when i finished he lifted me down and just for a second held me frowning down at me let me go i muttered terrified once more that i was going to cry stop fighting he said softly ive got enough people bitching at me today without you joining them i tried to smile im sorry he let go of me now for christs sake remember how ill youve been and dont overdo it lie down for a couple of hours after lunch the manll be over to do the central heating any minute he went towards the door i hope it isnt too agonizing going to see them i stammered im sure itll mean a lot to them you will drive carefully wont you of course he opened the door letting in a blast of icy air by the way i like your leg warmers he said theyre my supportive hose i said just for a second a smile flickered across his face back in the kitchen berenice was pounding lentils with unnecessary violence her mouth set in a hard line i am trying to remain supportive at the moment but ivan is being very difficult she said instead of being on the same wavelength hes giving off a lot of static he was so different in the states its the effect of his family of course theyre absolutely hopeless but he adores them they wear him down and why does he have this morbid obsession with the past its so hypocritical elizabeths parents have got to face up to the fact that hes bound to make another commitment sooner or later but theyre old i said removing antonia fraser who was thoughtfully licking crab paste off the bridge rolls and they all loved elizabeth crash came the pestle down on the poor lentils that marriaged have come unstuck anyway rubbish i said furiously he adored her everyone says so hed never have achieved his full potential married to her hed have got bored because she wasnt a woman of substance i said sourly i suppose you would have found her a little ordinaire berenices face suddenly took on the unarresting personality of a stopped clock god rest you merry gentlemen sang the wireless i escaped from the kitchen before i wrung her deeply tanned neck lucasta met me in the hall very bad news she said coleridge has been sick three times on the stairs and theres bits of leather in it oh god from a cursory examination of the stairs it was quite obvious that coleridge had regurgitated a good deal of chewedup hermes belt shall i tell berenice asked lucasta happily god no i said do you want coleridge put in an old setters home dont look so sad said lucasta to me as i mopped away with a jay cloth and disinfectant she put her arm round my shoulders you may not be very clever she said but youre very good at wiping up sick at that moment rose came down the stairs carrying a suitcase she looked very crestfallen in fact her crest was positively round her ankles beastly beastly weather she said youre not going away granny said lucasta no darling im going to have lunch and a nice hot bath at professor copelands and change into something pretty for your party where is she she whispered looking round nervously making health food canapés in the kitchen rose shuddered she keeps trying to interest me in yoga she thinks her navel is the centre of the universe i used to think naval officers were the centre of mine said rose sadly there still seemed to be an awful lot to do hiding the goingaway presents in a special drawer putting cream in the meringues hanging doughnuts on pieces of string on a clothes line across the drawingroom the child that finished its doughnut first eating with its hands behind its back would be awarded a prize it was an excellent icebreaker said berenice i drew a donkey for people to pin a tail on berenice did an incredibly neat parcel for passtheparcel using string instead of sellotape the snow was getting thicker blanketing everything i hoped ace was getting on all right finally the man came to mend the central heating maggie came down an hour before the party was due to start poured herself a large drink and balefully surveyed the platefuls of food in the kitchen it looks like the planet of the canapés she said berenices lips tightened at such unsupportive behaviour but she merely extracted the vim from the cupboard under the sink and went towards the door where are you going said lucasta to have a bath said berenice grimly gosh you must be dirty this is to clean the bath before i get into it chapter fifteen i had hoped to have a bath too and change but berenice pinched all the hot water and at the end there was a terrible rush what with trying to find some candle holders for lucastas cake and getting her dressed and doing her hair sting was pounding away in an empty drawingroom i had only one eye made up when the doorbell rang it was a mother twenty minutes early awfully sorry she said i didnt know how much time to leave because of the snow and in no time the hall seemed to be full of sophies pollys emilies and katies milling round in their long party dresses like coloured butterflies watching lucasta the most ravishing of all in her black velvet catsuit tearing open her presents i was charging round like a scalded cat telling mothers where to put their coats trying to open bottles of entre deux mers answering the door and keeping the dogs off the food where the hell was everyone then there was that terrible lull when half the children had arrived and you didnt know whether to start a game or not none of the children were lucastas special friends because the party wasnt being given at her own home but just offspring of various local friends of the mulhollands so they were all very shy to begin with and stood around gazing at each other very done up mothers and nannies wandered round looking disappointed and saying we expected ace or at least jack to be here theyre coming later i said i charged upstairs i found maggie on the telephone in roses room all right my sweetheart she was saying huskily ill call you later she blushed absolutely scarlet when she saw me standing in the doorway and slammed down the receiver please come down and help i wailed i cant do everything what do you want me to do she said following me downstairs just shepherd them into the drawingroom and start the children on the doughnuteating race the winner gets a wrappedup prize theyre in the drawer of the sideboard oh god theres the doorbell it was a glamorous but rather grubby brunette in a sheepskin coat hi im delphinium she said vaguely i brought damian and midas pointing to two very beautiful longhaired boys one blond one dark who nearly knocked me sideways as they charged past me into the drawingroom i left lucastas present behind she said drifting after them can i help myself to a drink i know where its kept the muppet show record had succeeded sting on the gramophone as maggie came back into the hall hi delphinium she said then turning to me im afraid coleridge and wordsworth have got into the drawingroom and eaten half the doughnuts theyve gone really wild today it was all too much i started to giggle helplessly its because they cant verbalize their feelings i said i guess theyre getting negative vibes from a certain person and theyre just overreacting oh well wed better play passtheparcel that wasnt much of a success either because berenice had done up the knots so beautifully no one could undo them so we played musical bumps but so many children had perfected the lightning descent they kept deadheating and the ones already out who included damian and midas got bored and started a punchup a diversion was created by the doorbell and the arrival of jason a sickly looking child in a green velvet suit who turned out to be the sworn enemy of damian and midas oh bugger said lucasta tearing open jasons present another boring flower press at that moment berenice chose to make her entrance wearing a rust shirt tan boots and a black skirt with a slit up the front her newly washed hair gleamed no wonder there wasnt any hot water left for me she looked a million dollars and extremely irritated you havent seen my hermes belt have you prudence who wants to stick the tail on the donkey i shouted the fun became more fast and furious rose arrived with professor copeland several fathers rolled up and a man to deliver some garden furniture its my special offer said rose excitedly we must hide it in the cellar before ace arrives berenice had decided to give up grumbling about her belt and had found a soulmate in delphinium its hard to keep your mind alive when you spend your time with people three feet high she was saying i looked at my watch it was five oclock and the conjuror was quarter of an hour late i mopped my brow wed have to eat soon there was a howl as damian whose blindfold seemed to have slipped plunged the donkeys tail into professor copelands bottom midas was hitting jason over the head with a tennis racket still in its press i shouldnt engage in that form of activity if i were you midas said delphinium its amazing said berenice the way children work out their hostility if you dont interfere with their natural instincts fivefifteen still no conjuror i shepherded all the children into the kitchen for tea whats this crap said damian picking up a piece of carrot cake and hurling it at jason crap said midas picking up a soya bean canapé and hurling it at antonia fraser two of the pollys or emilies or sophies started to cry arent they a nightmare said maggie putting her head round the door why doesnt delphinium do anything to control them i said in desperation she lives in a commune on the other side of windermere i dont think shes very into discipline their father commutes to london in a ferrari said maggie the conjuror a pouf with brushed forward hair finally arrived gibbering with guilt and ill temper at talk about the panic stations of the extremely cross the roads are simply atrocious id like to get started straight away he said and by some miracle five minutes later he had all the children sitting spellbound at his feet in the study and pigeons coming out of his sleeve phew blissful relief the grownups were having a riproaring party in the drawingroom everyone was well away i was just pouring myself and mrs braddock a drink when the doorbell rang yet again i always read rod mckuen to my potted plants berenice was saying as no one was obviously going to move i went to answer the door it was another mother she had bruised eyes ash blonde hair and the startled look of a race horse she was also vaguely familiar hullo she said nervously is it all right if i come in of course i said if youve come to collect im afraid were running behind schedule the conjuror arrived late but the grownups are having a terrific party in the drawingroom you know what the mulhollands are like she smiled only too well im fay i swallowed oh my goodness im pru what on earth was maggie going to say lucastas talked about you on the telephone she said youve been so kind to her are you sure its all right my coming she was so friendly you couldnt not like her of course it is how was the play it was good she said taking off a rather worn fur coat i had a nice director i think hell give me more work has lucasta had a nice birthday sensational i shouted over the party roar as we passed at the drawingroom door gosh im nervous of going in there said fay she neednt have been rose gave a shriek of excitement and fell on her neck darling darling fay she cried how lovely to see you you shouldnt have stayed away so long and how ravishing you look youve lost so much weight how lovely james berenice delphinium this is fay jacks first wife and lucastas mother everyone crowded round fay saying how nice it was to see her again im ivans permanent commitment i heard berenice saying suddenly i caught a glimpse of maggies face through the throng i felt sick she looked absolutely crucified i was about to fight my way through to her when i heard a scream in the hall i found the conjuror in floods of tears theyre the worst lot of kids ive ever had to deal with theyre little monsters that damian tried to send one of my pigeons up the chimney with a message for santa claus and singed all its feathers he wiped his eyes i cant go on oh please i said you were booked for an hour have a strong drink and another go i dont drink sobbed the conjuror and you need a bodyguard for that lot leave that rabbit alone you little sod he screamed rushing back into the study jack was next to arrive he was in a good temper hed pulled off a terrific deal with the americans maggie and i can spend christmas in bermuda if we want to im not sure shell want to i said fays in the drawingroom being fêted by everyone jacks face lit up fay is isnt she great i must go and say hullo damian burst out of the study and ran yelling down the passage towards the kitchen beautiful child isnt he i said sourly probably mine said jack hes a monster i protested he belongs to someone called delphinium jack laughed then hes definitely mine he smoothed his hair in the hall mirror straightened his tie and fought his way into the drawingroom look whos here jack darling i heard rose shriek its darling fay doesnt she look beautiful the next moment maggie came out of the room i caught a glimpse of her white stricken face as she fled upstairs after that the party got completely out of hand the children came screaming out of the study followed by the conjuror still in tears i want my money he said and im going no one of course had any cash jack had an irish p and berenice had travellers cheques and the conjuror wouldnt take an ordinary cheque i want cash on delivery he said firmly sitting down on his trunk of magic i dont trust that lot in there not to bounce cheques and im going to wait until i get it i could just have paid him myself but i wanted to keep enough cash for my fare back to london just in case in the drawingroom jack was chatting to fay one hand holding a drink the other lying along the sofa behind her head he looked the picture of handsome relaxed contentment berenice surprisingly was nose to nose with professor copeland i think its so terrific she was saying how youre able to plug into yourself and find this conduit into your unconscious and be able to tap all that energy rose was suddenly looking a little disconsolate jason ran screaming through the crowd followed by damian and midas each carrying one of jacks masai spears the professor and berenice followed their progress fondly if id been able to act out what i felt like that im sure i wouldnt have had to spend all those years in analysis said the professor i mean my fathers a casebook example of an anal retentive youre working too hard come and sit down and talk to fay jack shouted across at me i will in a minute i said in the kitchen i found coleridge and wordsworth and antonia fraser and the kitten demolishing the food but even they drew the line at lentil loaf and carrot cake upstairs i found maggie a sodden heaving lump on her bed i cant bear it i cant bear it i expected her to look like an old frump she sobbed and she turns up looking gorgeous and jacks obviously mad about her she must have been on a diet for days i never thought shed be that thin and everyones wwatching and saying how much prettier she is than me of course theyre not i said firmly youre much prettier than she is and much younger look how theyre all over her jack berenice copeland rose even ace i expect when he gets back theyre so fickle they want to make things easier for lucasta i said and i expect jack feels guilty because he left her for you and he wants to make things up to her not to go back at all just to say hes sorry i hate them i hate them both sobbed maggie more screams downstairs and a volley of loud explosions ill be back in a minute i said damian and midas were standing on the stairs they had found a packet of cigarettes and had lit up and were systematically bursting balloons stop it i screamed they took no notice they really ought to join some paramilitary operation like the scouts more dads arrived in second cars to collect children and mums who were not sober enough to drive and they all stayed for the party and had to be got drinks as well lucasta was sitting on jacks knee now playing with fays charm bracelet they all looked so happy jesus i thought what a bloody lot of unhappiness divorce makes professor copeland and berenice were still having a great rap i found i couldnt write about it she was saying my life with aaron was too painful to be transformed into enduring art dont pull antonia frasers tail like that damian said delphinium physical violence is not the answer perhaps i will have a drink after all said the conjuror somewhere in the distance i heard the back door slam it was seven oclock now i was worried about ace the roads must be like glass when we give a childrens party said berenice we just write the scenario as we go along in the hall damian and midas were writing their own scenario in red lipstick all over the walls stop it i screamed at them stop it you little monsters once again neither of them took any notice then damian raised two fingers at me the next moment jason came out of the kitchen brandishing a kitchen knife no i shrieked a key turned in the door and ace walked in oh the blissful blissful relief to see him oh thank god youve come i said whats the matter they are i pointed to damian and midas and jason who was now deciding which to carve up ace was across the room in a flash stop it he said firmly removing jasons knife and picking both damian and midas up by the scruff of the neck or ill bash all your heads together theres a television in the study go and watch it to my amazement they went quietly what else is the matter the conjurors in hysterics he couldnt handle the children and no ones got enough money to pay him so hes joined the party and started drinking and he doesnt drink go and get him said ace getting a wad of tenners out of his notecase what else he said after the conjuror had been dispatched into the night fays here i said miserably rose is all over her and jacks flirting like mad with her and maggie he said swiftly he always got the point at once shes in absolute floods upstairs he went towards the stairs ill go up and talk to her be an angel and mix me a very stiff whisky was it all right today i said not too awful he shrugged his shoulders pretty bloody but at least its done i went into the drawingroom to get the whisky the party showed no signs of abating at all wheres ivan said berenice he should be back by now hes back i said hes upstairs with maggie berenices eyes narrowed till they seemed one black slit across her face shes upset i explained whatever for shes unhappy because fays here shes so oldfashioned said berenice scornfully everyones loose about exes these days its healthy youve got to stay loose i cant understand jealousy its something ive never suffered from oh im sure youre above that sort of thing i snapped i put some ice in the whisky and shot out of the room i met ace coming down the stairs he looked very bleak he was holding a letter whats the matter i said maggies walked out to pendle i whispered so she says in this note to jack he put his hand on my arm im sorry oh god how awful but she cant have got far she was here twenty minutes ago he opened the front door and looked out snow was eddying and whirling and a shower of hard tiny frozen flakes swept inside jacks cars gone she must have taken it must be trying for the she could kill herself on these roads suddenly he looked ashen beneath his suntan he must be remembering elizabeth driving too fast on icy roads in her excitement to meet him at the airport he took the whisky from me and drained it in one gulp im going to see if i can stop her dont say anything until ive got back say ive gone to get some cigarettes he was back in threequarters of an hour i just missed her she left the car parked across the road as a final gesture of defiance i suppose id better go and break up the party we went into the drawingroom ivan sweetest berenice extracted herself from professor copeland and a ring of fathers and crossing the room put her arms round aces neck and kissed him tenderly where have you been the nannies perked up and pulled down their sweaters the mothers patted their hair even pale and travelworn ace was still a knockout i wondered why i hadnt noticed it when i first met him he went over and kissed fay who was still thigh to thigh with jack on the sofa hullo my love youre looking very beautiful he said im glad about the play her eyes lit up goodness its lovely to see you how was america very successful obviously im so pleased about you and berenice she lowered her voice i meant to write about elizabeth but i wasnt very together at the time it must have been just after jack left her perhaps now maggie had gone they might get together again ace however had other ideas i thought you might like a lift home shes staying for supper said jack quickly anyway the partys not over cried rose itd be better if she came another day said ace firmly lucastas tired and its high time these children went home over by the window damian and midas were systematically cramming a plate of meringues down jasons velvet suit somehow ace managed to empty the room in ten minutes i went upstairs with fay and helped pack lucastas things and gather up her presents ive got a tummy egg wailed lucasta youve been eating too many sweets said fay as we went downstairs jack was saying angrily to ace what the bloody hells going on why cant fay stay for supper we cant throw her out on a night like this ace got maggies letter out of his pocket i think youd better read this he said grimly as he and jack went into the drawingroom he turned to me can you say goodbye to fay and lucasta for us outside lucasta hugged me tightly can i come and stay with you in london will you take me to see the knife guards at buckingham palace of course i will i said clinging to her i couldnt bear to let her go was ace shocked that i was here whispered fay anxiously no it was maggie she was a bit jealous she was jealous said fay with sudden bitterness it was she who took him away from me in the first place i suppose it was tactless of me to stay i was so pleased to see them all again she added wistfully theyre so lovely i know they are i said i went back into the house pausing to look at my pale reflection in the looking glass in the hall i still only had one eye made up the drawingroom door was open pru rose called were all in here jack was sitting on the window seat surrounded by a debris of crisps coloured streamers and burst balloons upon his face was a desolation so haggard i hardly recognized him berenice had her supportive face on ace handed me a stiff gin and tonic rose was revelling in the situation isnt it dreadful she said to me maggie and i were playing bridge tomorrow and shes taken professor copelands hat with her and my hermes belt i shouldnt wonder said berenice its very odd of maggie said rose i thought pendle was supposed to be prus boyfriend jack turned to me you saw her last what did she say i think she was jealous of you chatting up fay shed never met her before she was well a bit shocked fay looked so attractive and you seemed so pleased to see her hell i was pleased to see her said jack i always liked her when we werent rowing i take saunas with my ex and his permanent commitment said berenice youve gotta stay loose about exes jack shot her a look of pure hatred then he turned to ace i cant believe shes gone shall i drive down and get her ace shook his head leave her alone if you drag her away now shell never know how much she hated living with pen she might like it theyll drive each other round the bend jack looked at his untouched drink i deserve it i suppose i had absolutely no compunction about pinching her from pen in the first place its an eye for an eye he gave a hollow laugh at least she wont have to change her name oh let her go jack said rose shes not worth bothering about it was the first time id seen jack angry it was terrifying shut up you stupid bitch he spat at rose if it hadnt been for you leading her astray rose bridled really jack theres no need to speak to your mother like that ace took roses arm why dont you watch television rose tossed her head do you really think id watch television at a time like this go on said ace she flounced out ace turned to berenice and me can you both possibly keep her happy for halfanhour we found rose thumbing through the radio times in the study we had a really good bridge four lined up she said maggie might have waited until wednesday she never had any sense of proportion i wasnt listening i was thinking about ace charlie drakes on in a minute said rose suddenly switch it on theres a love ive just got time to go and tell the professor about maggie he wont be at all pleased about his hat she bustled out into the hall antonia fraser was sharpening her claws on the sofa the television leapt noisily into life reginald bosanquet was talking about the chaos caused on the roads by the snow british news is so parochial said berenice turning it down you must be upset prudence she went on you wont get your lift back to london now oh shut up i said berenice picked at the polish on one of her long scarlet nails you only hurt yourself by coming on hostile she said dont you realize anger is just the flipside of depression you must ask yourself why you feel threatened by me i cant stand your crummy philosophizing youre not being honest prudence theres a time when absolute honesty must take precedence in an enlightened community over more pragmatic considerations otherwise we simply recreate the hypocrisy of our times could i have an interpreter i said taking a slug of my gin youre emotionally fixated on ivan i am not but i could feel myself going scarlet oh yes and he knows it too and hes very very embarrassed by it cant imagine him being embarrassed by anything i said that shows how untuned you are into other peoples vibrations ivans been supportive to you over the past week or so because youve been ill and he thought pendle gave you a raw deal he cares about people hes a people person hold on while i rummage for my sick bag i said desperately prudence dont joke about this everyone is embarrassed by you being here but they expected pendle would be here tomorrow to take you back now its quite obvious pendles cashed in his chips where youre concerned do you honestly want to go on outstaying your welcome no i whispered no of course i dont ivans got enough worries coping with jack and rose he doesnt need you hanging around like a lovesick teenybopper anymore playing gooseberry reginald bosanquet was making a little endofprogramme joke with andrew gardner about a canary whod learned to whistle beethovens ninth rose bustled in full of excitement the professors going to send pendle a bill for that hat it cost at herbert johnson rose i said would you mind awfully if i slipped off to bed im still a bit weak and its been rather an exhausting day i slunk into bed clutching the kitten and turned off the light tomorrow id beat it i wasnt hanging around any longer being a nuisance hours and hours later i heard ace and jack coming to bed still talking in low voices chapter sixteen ace came in to see me very early next morning and handed me a letter from jane im going into manchester with jack to see our solicitor he said ill be back for lunch you dont look too good yesterday must have tired you out dont get up till i get back he ran a finger down my cheek im sorry a family crisis has blown up in your face hes going i thought in panic trying to imprint his features on my memory and ill never see him again it was as though my heart was being torn out of me as he reached the door i called to him thank you for looking after me and everything he turned i havent finished yet im sorry ive been difficult his face softened youve been bloody difficult and he was gone i dressed quickly flinging my clothes into a suitcase and then went to see rose who was horrified at being woken at such an ungodly hour ive just had a letter from my mother i lied shes awfully ill and theres no one to look after my father so im afraid i shall have to leave at once oh dear said rose petulantly everyones going first pendle then jimmy then maggie and now you its like something out of chekhov never mind you must come again braddock will drive you to the station would you mind if i took the kitten i said of course not said rose far too many animals around the place as it is we might have a basket somewhere my letter to ace took ages its so difficult when all you want to say to someone is i love you i love you i love you in the end it was a bald little note saying thank you and that my mother was ill mr braddock put my things in the car the kitten was thumping round in its basket mewing piteously i went into the kitchen berenice was sitting eating her revolting ratsdroppinginsawdust breakfast and reading the guardian i ignored her and hugged mrs braddock goodbye and thank you for bringing up all those trays and everything mrs braddock mopped her eyes with her apron youre a good girl and you worked very hard yesterday and well all miss you very much i hope you come again soon although im not sure ill be here she shot a venomous glance at berenice who calmly went on eating mr braddock appeared in the doorway well have to hurry love if were going to catch the train i walked to the door ignoring berenice but she looked up and said goodbye prudence im sure youll find a permanent commitment soon i hope youve got enough ego strength not to take ivans rejection as a sign of rejection for a second i looked at her meditatively teenybopper to woman then i said as you keep saying the only really authentic thing in life is to act on your own impulses and i picked up her plate of horrible health food and emptied it milk and all over her shiny newly washed head and ill come and throw brown rice at your wedding i added then i ran out to the waiting car rose was waiting outside it was a beautiful day the sunshine the sparkling snow and the rollicking dogs seemed so incongruous beside my black suicidal gloom goodbye rose darling i said leaping into the car give my love to jack and ace as she waved me off i felt like a barnacle being prised away from its rock the mountains gleamed like marble against the bright blue sky snow ivied the walls every twig and grass blade glittered thickly like sparkler fireworks what was the poem we learnt at school crack goes the whip and off we go the trees and houses smaller grow last round the woody turn we swing goodbye goodbye to everything i turned and caught a last glimpse of the mulhollands house with its dark fringe of pines i felt i must be leaving behind a shiny snails mark of tears suddenly i heard a low chuckle i looked at mr braddocks impassive face then he chuckled again mrs braddock and i could scarcely restrain ourselves he said we could have cheered and cheered to my dying day i shall remember the expression on her face with all the milk and stuff dripping down it i wish i had the nerve to do something like that anyway your name shall be writ large for evermore oh dear i could do without the publicity ace is going to be livid perhaps it will make the scales fall from his eyes if that woman becomes mistress of ambleside mrs braddock and i will be out on our ears then he chuckled again after buying a platform ticket and carrying my suitcase and the still furiously mewing kitten on to the platform he said hed be off ive got a lot of snow to shovel but perhaps i may shake you by the hand pleased ive made someone happy i said gloomily the journey back to london was a nightmare tears kept trickling out from under my dark glasses the train was packed and all the old ladies who said how sweet the kitten was when i got into the carriage and begged me to let him out of his basket got fed up when he crawled all over them and laddered their stockings i commuted between the loos all down the train crying myself stupid until someone rattled the door then moving on to the next one jane was obviously not expecting me back for ages she was out and shed been making full use of my wardrobe my clothes were strewn all over the bedroom and shed left the top off my favourite bottle of scent i made the kitten at home gave it a tin of lobster we had in the larder and wandered desolately round the flat wondering if id been crazy to walk out like that jane came in about ten and made a great fuss about being pleased to see me she was horribly embarrassed because she was wearing my fur coat and my boots suddenly she looked at me for the first time full in the face her embarrassment turned to horror pru lovie you look like a road accident what or rather who have you been up to ive been ill i said and burst into tears eventually the whole story came pouring out i knew all along of course said jane sententiously i could tell from your letter you were getting over pendle pretty quickly and there was an obvious swing towards ace mind you i think youre raving mad she went on i wouldnt have left id have battled it out with this berenice woman what a soppy name look how keen on pendle you were and now look at you well ace may have fancied this woman a bit and now he doesnt you wait hell come pounding after you but ace didnt come after me for the first time in my life i became familiar with real hell you dont need a pitchfork and demons just take someone away from someone they love thats enough before when id been unhappily in love it only needed a handsome man giving me the glad eye in the street or a patch of blue sky above a grey building to jerk me temporarily out of my gloom but this time it was unrelieved despair i dragged myself round the flat like a wounded animal and every night i cried great earthshaking sobs until dawn came the weekend crawled by not a letter not a telephone call i even rang up the engineers to check if the telephone was working jane worried at first got rather fed up with me one cant dole out sympathy indefinitely she rang rodney who took her out for a long drunken sunday lunch to discuss what to do for and about prudence on monday morning back in the office gazing at a lot of statistics about canned peaches i was just wondering how id ever get through the week when the telephone rang rodney answered it its for you he said waving the receiver a voice from your immediate past who is it i said listlessly someone called mulholland i was across the room like a streak of light hullo pru said a familiar drawling voice it was maggie how are you i said battling with my disappointment comme ci comme very ca pendles out come to lunch id like to i said crazy masochist i couldnt resist talking to someone who knew ace and i was also curious to know how she was enjoying living with pendle when i arrived i hardly recognized pendles flat it had always been so impeccably tidy now clothes lay everywhere carrier bags and tissue paper were littered all over the floor ashtrays were overflowing and maggie had made dramatic inroads into that wellstocked drinks cupboard professor copelands hat still carrying a fair sprinkling of antonia frasers ginger hairs was perched rakishly over the nose of julius caesars bust she hugged me when i arrived pru how lovely to see you i rang quite on the offchance i thought you might still be at home are you wildly hungry i shook my head good because im afraid weve only got whisky and some smoked salmon for lunch she poured us out huge drinks do you like my new kit she asked twirling round she was wearing a red midi dress and her hair was permed into tight little curls shed plucked her eyebrows to the edge of extinction and was wearing pink shoes super i said i thought she looked frightful im as in as you are now i came away without any luggage so pendle had to buy me a new wardrobe weve been out every night plays and films and nightclubs we went to hesters last night have you ever been there i shook my head pendles wonderful he does everything to keep me amused do you know what he said to me as soon as i got here please unpack darling everything then i can get rid of your suitcase and then towards the end of the first night neither of us slept a wink he said this is the happiest night of my life better than when i passed my bar finals or got that scholarship to oxford the awful thing is having longed for me to come and live with him for so long i dont think he quite knows what to do with me she rattled on feverishly then suddenly as she was casually shaking ice around in her glass she said how was jack when i left did he mind yes he did he minded like hell he nearly murdered rose when she said he was better off without you he loves you he was simply shattered he couldnt stop looking at your photograph and saying he couldnt believe it she went over to the recordplayer pendle has such ghastly records i went and bought some pop ones but ive played them into the ground she swung round her eyes were full of tears was jack really upset yes then why didnt he come and get me he wanted to but ace wouldnt let him ace said it would be better if you realized you didnt like living with pendle first maggie put her face in her hands ace is quite right blast him she said i always thought pendle was much more interesting and enigmatic than jack but he isnt hes just boring jacks much funnier and he never minded me being a slut he just roared with laughter if only he didnt run after other women so much he doesnt mean anything by it i said hes just proving that hes attractive like gorillas beat their chests and whats more i think im pregnant and its jacks child and pendle wants me to have an abortion oh you cant i know ive had a lot of time to think about jack and i think if we were away from rose with a house and baby of our own we might get it together what are you going to do maggie got up and picked up one of her new dresses and held it against her i dont know do you think i can take these new clothes with me she looked at my untouched smoked salmon youre not eating anything you look ghastly thanks i said its ace i suppose what do you mean i stammered my mouth full of ashes all that bull about hating his guts it stood out as plain as a spot on ones nose that you were hooked on him how i said you never addressed a civil word to him and the way you were always going on about him not being attractive its like saying grass is red anyway i said wearily it doesnt matter what i feel hes going to marry berenice of course he wont said maggie scornfully jack reckons ace is hooked on you too all that little hitler behaviour when you were ill and thats why he was so stroppy when berenice turned up and put a spoke in the wheel i mean he couldnt just throw her out the moment she arrived they had been living together in new york oh look youve spilt your drink all over the carpet she mopped it up with one of pendles silk cushions do you really think he wont marry her not in a million years do you really think jack was missing me chapter seventeen during the afternoon my elation subsided if ace had been keen on me he would have contacted me by now i felt completely exhausted when i got back to the flat jane was eating bread and jam with one hand and trying to put in heated rollers with the other where are you going i asked out with rodney she said again i said in disgust weve decided whats the matter with you she said youre suffering from the dr kildare syndrome oh yeah well you know women always fall in love with their gynaecologists and their doctor its the same with you ace looked after you when you were ill so you see him as your doctor youll find you get over him very quickly very clever i snapped and by the way pendles on his way round thats all i need i groaned i only hope maggie hasnt left him already what on earth can he want have we got any drink only some cooking sherry ill pop round to the offlicence and get some i said id forgotten what a marvellously sexy voice hes got said jane i caught a glance of myself in the offlicence mirror i looked ghastly like an oxfam advertisement i wondered dolefully if id ever be pretty again i walked home past the pet shop listlessly looking at the notices on the door please remove your crash helmet before entering it frightens the parrot due to bereavement will someone provide a home for fluff a black and white tom fluff is lovable and clean oh dear due to bereavement will someone provide a home for prudence quite clean but not very lovable if i dont tread on any of the lines on the way home i said to myself ill get over ace and off i went taking longer and longer strides and then a string of little ones then i spoilt it all by bumping into a lamp post and treading on three lines at once i let myself into the flat hullo i shouted jane came into the hall making an agonized face and pointed at the drawingroom door steeling myself i went in i felt the blood drain out of me i clutched the table for support standing with his back to the fire like a great mountain was ace what on earth are you doing here i stammered jane said pendle was coming round she got the wrong mulholland he said we sound the same on the telephone he looked desperately tired and there were huge black rings under his eyes ive missed you he said and if it hadnt been ace and he hadnt been suntanned i could have sworn he was blushing ive missed you like hell he held out his arms and i went straight into them i thought he would kiss all the life out of me then he said why the bloody hell did you run off like that which sounded more like the old ace how did you find me i said a damned dance youve led me with that cockandbull story about your mother being ill after hunting through every telephone directory the post office had to offer i finally found your parents number your mother must have thought i was mad when i said i was sorry she was sick however we had an illuminating little chat she said she hadnt heard from you for ages but shed gathered from your flatmate that you were staying with some very odd people in the north of england i scuffed the carpet with my foot i thought you were going to marry berenice i said what on earth gave you that idea berenice did she would said ace she doesnt think so now shes not very pleased with you either wantonly emptying breakfast food over her newly washed hair think of all the starving healthfood freaks in russia i hung my head then i saw that he was laughing but i saw maggie today i said quickly and she said you werent going to marry her i know you saw maggie he said i talked to her on the telephone before i came round here i derived a certain amount of comfort from the fact that she said you were looking like death hows jack i asked pretty low but maggied better pull her finger out if she wants to go back to him he was beginning to chat up one of the betterlooking nannies who came to lucastas party when i left i giggled he is awful hes just jack said ace dyou think maggie will go back i asked frankly i couldnt care less at the moment all i know is that professor copeland broke his toe on a stone hot waterbottle creeping into roses bed last night and hasnt stopped complaining since and i am sick to death of other peoples problems im far more interested in my own pru look at me i was almost blinded by the blaze of love in his eyes i love you he said simply to total distraction you slunk into my heart snapping and snarling like a vixen so i didnt realize it was happening but i think i really began loving you the first moment i saw you but you were so nasty to me i said in amazement i thought you thought i was awful did you really fancy me yes to use your revolting expression i did fancy you even during the row we had after the firework party my god he added coming towards me and taking my hands if you had any idea of the selfcontrol ive had to exert all the time you were in bed at home and that day by the sea i was so nervous of making a false move i was proceeding like a batsman on but i was all set to declare myself that evening then jimmy batten and berenice arrived and suddenly i thought you were still hooked on pendle i wasnt i said i was just trying to hide the fact that i was bananas about you jesus said ace we have wasted a lot of time dyou want a drink not yet he said sitting down in the armchair and pulling me on to his knee about berenice i muttered ace sighed i was certainly screwing her in new york i was lonely still missing elizabeth ive never been very good at playing the field she was a big star i suppose i was flattered but she certainly didnt travel to england and there was her superior muscle tone ivan i said innocently shut up said ace pulling one of my curls you can take the piss out of me after were married but not before i went very still what about elizabeth i loved lizzie nothing can take that away i wouldnt want to i said quickly but it doesnt hurt anymore since i met you that day i went to see her parents i kept wishing you were there to cheer everything up in the end i found myself telling them all about you that i loved you oh goodness were they upset they understood they said theyd like to meet you next time you come up his hands tightened on mine i want you pru for good i still couldnt take it in i felt dizzy and had to get up and take a turn round the room but you dont understand i said in agitation im a belligerent scruff and im scatty and id shipwreck your smart dinner parties and upset all your grand friends he pulled me back on to his knee and putting his arms around me said very gently darling stop gibbering do i have to spell it out for you isnt it enough that youre beautiful and funny and you make me happy and just holding you in my arms gives me the first peace ive had in days he looked at me for a minute and then bent his head and kissed me until i thought id faint with excitement dont you think in my turnhe said im terrified that im ten years older than you and that ive got a frightful reputation for being difficult and a bully who said so i asked furiously how dare they you did he said examining his fingernails and its also a slight bother that you havent told me yet that you love me oh i cried in horror oh darling darling ace dont you understand that im absolutely deliriously bonkers out of my mind for you it was the same with me i think i was hooked on you from the first moment i saw you ive never reacted so violently to anyone in my life ive been so desperately unhappy since berenice arrived and even worse since i left you and now youre here i cant quite take it in its just like discovering father christmas is real after all i was crawling all over him like a kitten and kissing him his hand tightened on my shoulder his face was expressionless but i knew he was pleased with his other hand he held out an imaginary microphone to me well he said putting on a toneless carefully modulated television announcers voice im sure everyone looking in was fascinated by that lucid dissertation on love i know i was but im afraid times running out in the few seconds we have left would you mind very quickly summing up your views on marriage i gave a sigh of happiness oh yes i would oh yes please i said the end
