the thousandth man will stand by your side to the gallowsfoot and after rudyard kipling day thursday august am it is a glorious day a day for watching cricket for drinking pimms for building sandcastles for mowing the lawn not a day to be travelling in a sweatbox for miles having served twentyone days and fourteen hours in belmarsh i am about to be transported to hmp wayland a category c prison in norfolk a group van is my chauffeurdriven transport with two cubicles for two prisoners i remain locked in for fifteen minutes awaiting the arrival of a second prisoner i hear him talking but cant see him is he also going to wayland at last the great electric gates of belmarsh slide open and we begin our journey east my temporary moving residence is a compartment four feet by three with a plastic seat i feel nauseous within ten minutes and am covered in sweat within fifteen the journey to wayland prison in norfolk takes just over three hours as i peer through my tiny window i recognize the occasional familiar landmark on the cambridge leg of the trip once the university city is behind us i have to satisfy myself with a glimpse at signposts whenever we slow down at roundabouts to pinpoint where we are newmarket bury st edmunds thetford so for this particular period of my life that very special lady gillian shephard will be my member of parliament the roads become narrower and the trees taller the further east we travel when we finally arrive at wayland it couldnt be in starker contrast to the entrance of belmarsh with its foreboding high walls and electric gates and most pleasing of all not a member of the press in sight we drive into the yard and come to a halt outside the reception area i sense immediately a different atmosphere and a more casual approach by prison officers but then their daily tariff is not gangland murderers era terrorists rapists and drug barons the first officer i meet as i walk into reception is mr knowles once he has completed the paperwork he signs me over to a mr brown as if i were a registered parcel once again i am stripsearched before the officer empties my hmp belmarsh plastic bag onto the counter and rummages through my possessions he removes my dressing gown the two large blue towels william had so thoughtfully supplied and a blue tracksuit he informs me that they will be returned to me as soon as i am enhanced how long will that take i ask usually about three months he replies casually as if it were a few grains of sand passing through an hourglass i dont think ill mention to mr brown that im hoping to be moved within a few days once the police enquiry into baroness nicholsons complaint concerning the simple truth appeal has been seen for what it is mr brown then places my beige slacks and blue shirt on one side explaining that i wont get those back until ive been released or transferred he replaces them with a striped blue prison shirt and a pair of jeans after signing over my personal possessions my photograph is taken holding up a little blackboard with the chalk letters ff under my chin just as youve seen in films i am escorted by another officer to what i would describe as the quartermasters stores there i am handed one towel green one toothbrush red one tube of toothpaste one comb two bic razors and one plastic plate plastic bowl and plastic cutlery having placed my new prison property in the plastic bag along with the few possessions i am allowed to retain i am escorted to the induction wing mr thompson the induction officer invites me into his office he begins by telling me that he has been in the prison service for ten years and therefore hopes he will be able to answer any questions i might have you begin your life on the induction wing he explains where youll share a cell with another prisoner my heart sinks as i recall my experience at belmarsh i warn him that whoever i share a cell with will sell his story to the tabloids mr thompson laughs how quickly will he find out prison would be so much more bearable if you could share a cell with someone you know i can think of a dozen people id be happy to share a cell with and more than a dozen who ought to be in one when mr thompson finishes his introductory talk he goes on to assure me that i will be moved into a single cell on another block once ive completed my induction how long will that take i ask were so overcrowded at the moment he admits that it could take anything up to a month he pauses but in your case i hope it will be only a few days mr thompson then describes a typical day in the life of wayland making it clear that prisoners spend considerably less time locked in their cells than they do at belmarsh which is a slight relief he then lists the work choices education gardening kitchen workshop or wing cleaner but he warns me that it will take a few days before this can be sorted out nothing is ever done today in the prison service and rarely even tomorrow he describes how the canteen works and confirms that i will be allowed to spend ps per week there i pray that the food will be an improvement on belmarsh surely it cant be worse mr thompson ends his dissertation by telling me that hes selected a quiet roommate who shouldnt cause me any trouble finally as i have no more questions he accompanies me out of his little office down a crowded corridor packed with young men aged between eighteen to twentyfive who just stand around and stare at me my heart sinks when he unlocks the door the cell is filthy and would have been the subject of a court order by the rspca if any animal had been discovered locked inside the window and window sill are caked in thick dirt not dust months of accumulated dirt the lavatory and the wash basin are covered not with dirt but shit i need to get out of here as quickly as possible it is clear that mr thompson doesnt see the dirt and is oblivious to the cells filthy condition he leaves me alone only for a few moments before my cellmate strolls in he tells me his name but his yorkshire accent is so broad that i cant make it out and resort to checking on the cell card attached to the door chris is about my height but more stocky he goes on talking at me but i can understand only about one word in three when he finally stops talking he settles down on the top bunk to read a letter from his mother while i begin to make up my bed on the bunk below he chuckles and reads out a sentence from her letter if you dont get this letter let me know and ill send you another one by the time we are let out to collect our supper i have discovered that he is serving a fiveyear sentence for gbh grievous bodily harm having stabbed his victim with a stanley knife this is mr thompsons idea of someone who isnt going to cause me any trouble pm all meals are served at a hotplate situated on the floor below i wait patiently in a long queue only to discover that the food is every bit as bad as belmarsh i return to my cell emptyhanded grateful that canteen orders at wayland are on a friday tomorrow i extract a box of sugar puffs from my plastic bag and fill the bowl adding longlife milk i munch a belmarsh apple and silently thank del boy pm exercise there are several differences between belmarsh and wayland that are immediately apparent when you walk out into the exercise yard first you are not searched second the distance you can cover without retracing your steps can be multiplied by five about a quarter of a mile third the ratio of black to white prisoners is now compared to at belmarsh and fourth my arrival in norfolk causes even more unsolicited pointing sniggering and loutish remarks which only force me to curtail my walk fifteen minutes early i wish mr justice potts could experience this for just one day on the first long circuit the salesmen move in anything you need jeff drugs tobacco phonecards theyre all quite happy to receive payment on the outside by cheque or cash i explain to them all firmly that im not interested but its clearly going to take a few days before they realize i mean it when the barrow boys and secondhand salesmen have departed emptyhanded im joined by a lifer who tells me hes also sixtyone but the difference is that hes already served twentyseven years in prison and still doesnt know when if ever hell be released when i ask him what hes in for he admits to killing a policeman i begin a conversation with a black man on the other side of me and the lifer melts away several of the more mature prisoners turn out to be in for white collar crimes fiddling the dss the dti or hm customs one of them david joins me and immediately tells me that hes serving five years what for i ask smuggling drugs no spirits he confesses i didnt realize that was against the law i thought you could pop across to calais and yeah you can but not sixtyfive times in sixtyfive days with a twoton lorry carrying twenty million quids worth of whisky he pauses its when you forget to cough up eight million quid in duty that the customs and excise become a little upset a young man in his late twenties takes the place of the police murderer on the other side of me he brags that hes been banged up in six jails during the past ten years so if i need a cooks tour hes the bestqualified operator why have you been sent to six jails in ten years i enquire no one wants me he admits ive done over two thousand burglaries since the age of nineteen and every time they let me out i just start up again isnt it time to give it up and find something more worthwhile to do i ask naively no chance he replies not while im making over two hundred grand a year jeff after a time i become sick of the catcalling so leave the exercise yard and return to my cell more and more disillusioned more and more cynical i dont consider young people who are first offenders and have been charged with minor offences should be sent to establishments like this where one in three will end up on drugs and one in three will commit a far more serious offence once theyve received tuition from the prison professors the next humiliation i have to endure is prisoners queuing up silently outside my cell door to get a look at me no hi jeff how are you just staring and pointing as if im some kind of an animal at the zoo i sit in my cage relieved when at eight oclock an officer slams the doors closed pm im just about to start writing up what has happened to me today when chris switches on the television first we have half an hour of eastenders followed by top gear and then a documentary on robbie williams chris is clearly establishing his right to leave the tv on with a programme he has selected at a volume that suits him will he allow me to watch frasier tomorrow i lie in bed on my thin mattress my head resting on a rockhard pillow and think about mary and the boys aware that they too must be enduring their own private hell i feel as low as i did during my first night at belmarsh i have no idea what time i finally fall asleep i thought i had escaped from hell so much for purgatory day friday august am intermittent fitful sleep unaided by a rockhard pillow a cellmate who snores and occasionally talks in his sleep sadly nothing of literary interest rise and write for two hours am cellmate wakes and grunts i carry on writing he then jumps off the top bunk and goes to the lavatory in the corner of the cell he has no inhibitions in front of me but then he has been in prison for five years i am determined never to go to the loo in my cell while im still in a oneup onedown unless he is out i go on working as if nothing is happening its quite hard to distract me when im writing but when i look up i see chris standing there in the nude his chest is almost completely covered with a tattoo of an eagle towering over a snake which he tells me with pride he did himself with a tattoo gun on the knuckles of his fingers on both hands are diamonds hearts spades and clubs while on his shoulders he has a massive spiders web that creeps down his back theres not much pink flesh left unmarked hes a walking canvas am the cell doors are unlocked so we can all go and have breakfast one hour earlier than in belmarsh chris and i walk down to the hotplate at least the eggs have been boiled quite recently like today were also given a half carton of semiskimmed milk which means that i can drop the longlife version from my weekly shopping list and spend the extra p on some other luxury like marmalade am mr newport pops his head round the cell door to announce that mr tinkler the principal officer would like a word with me even the language at wayland is more conciliatory when i leave my cell he adds its down the corridor second door on the left when i enter mr tinklers room he stands up and ushers me into a chair on the other side of his desk as if he were my bank manager his name is printed in silver letters on a triangular piece of wood in case anyone should forget mr tinkler resembles an old sea captain rather than a prison officer he has weathered lined skin and a neatly cut white beard hes been in the service for over twenty years and i learn that he will be retiring next august he asks me how im settling in the most common question asked by an officer when meeting a prisoner for the first time i tell him about the state of my room and the proclivities of my cellmate he listens attentively and as there is little difference in our age i detect some sympathy for my predicament he tells me that as soon as my induction is over he plans to transfer me to a single cell on c block which houses mainly lifers mr tinkler believes that ill find the atmosphere there more settled as i will be among a group of prisoners closer to my own age i leave his office feeling considerably better than when i entered it am ive only been back in my cell for a few minutes when mr newport pops his head round the door again were moving you to a cell down the corridor pack your belongings and follow me i hadnt really unpacked so this exercise doesnt take too long the other cell also turns out to be a double but once im inside mr newport whispers were hoping to leave you on your own mr tinklers sympathy is translated into something far more tangible than mere words i slowly unpack my possessions from the regulation prison plastic bag for the seventh time in three weeks as i now have two small cupboards i put all the prison clothes like shirts socks pants gym kit etc in one while i place my personal belongings in the other i almost enjoy how long it takes to put my new home in order am mr newport is back again hes making his rounds this time to deliver canteen lists to every cell he has already warned me that if the computer hasnt transferred my surplus cash from belmarsh i will be allowed an advance of only ps this week i quickly check the top of the list to discover im in credit for ps this turns out to be my weekly allowance of ps plus two payments from the education department at belmarsh for my lecture on creative writing and two sessions at the workshop i spend the next thirty minutes planning how to spend this windfall i allow myself such luxuries as gillette shaving foam robertsons marmalade and four bottles of evian water noon lunch on fridays at wayland lunch comes in a plastic bag a packet of crisps a bar of chocolate a bread roll accompanied by a lettuce leaf and a sachet of salad cream i can only wonder in which prison workshop and how long ago this meal was packed because there are rarely sellby dates on prison food i return to my cell to find the canteen provisions have been deposited on the end of my bed in yet another plastic bag i celebrate by thumbing my bread roll in half and spreading robertsons golden shred all over it with the aid of my toothbrush handle i pour myself a mug of evian already the world is a better place pm part of the induction process is a private session with the prison chaplain mr john framlington looks to me as if its been some years since hes administered his own parish he explains that hes a fillin as he shares the work with a younger man i assure him that i will be attending the service on sunday but would like to know if it clashes with the rcs he looks puzzled no we both use the same chapel father christopher has so many parishes outside the prison to cover each sunday he holds his service on a saturday morning at ten thirty mr framlington is interested to discover why i wish to attend both services i tell him about my daily diary and my failure to hear father kevins sermon while at belmarsh he sighs youll quickly find out that father christopher preaches a far better sermon than i do pm the first setback of the day mr newport returns the bearer of bad news six new prisoners have arrived this afternoon and once again i will have to share i learn later that there are indeed six new inductees but as the prison still has several empty beds there is no real need for me to share however there are several reporters hanging around outside the prison gates so the authorities dont want to leave the press with the impression i might be receiving preferential treatment mr newport claims he has selected a more suitable person to share with me perhaps this time it wont be a stanleyknife stabber just a machete murderer i transfer all my personal possessions out of one of the cupboards and stuff them into the other along with the prison kit pm my new roommate appears carrying his plastic bag he introduces himself as jules see plate section hes thirtyfive and has a fiveyear sentence for drug dealing hes already been told that i dont smoke i watch him carefully as he starts to unpack and i begin to relax he has an unusual number of books as well as an electric chessboard i feel confident the evening viewing will not be a rerun of top of the pops and motorbike scrambling at five to four i leave him to continue his unpacking while i make my way to the gym for another induction session pm twenty new inmates are escorted to the gym there are no doors to be unlocked on our unimpeded journey to the other side of the building i also notice that on the way we pass a library i never even found the library at belmarsh the gym is an even bigger shock its quite magnificent wayland has a fullsize basketball court which is fully equipped for badminton and tennis the gym instructor asks us to take a seat on a bench where were handed forms to fill in giving such details as age weight height and sports we are interested in my name is john maiden he tells us and im happy to be called john i never learnt the first name of any officer at belmarsh he tells us the different activities available cricket basketball badminton football rugby and inevitably weight training he then takes us into the next room an area overcrowded with bars dumbbells and weights once again im disappointed to discover that there is only one treadmill three rowing machines and no step machine however there are some very strangelooking bikes the likes of which ive never seen before a gym orderly a prisoner who has obviously been trained by mr maiden takes us round the room and describes how to use each piece of equipment he carries out the task most professionally and should have no trouble finding a job once he leaves prison im listening intently about bench pressing when i find mr maiden standing by my side are you still refereeing rugby he asks no i gave up about ten years ago i tell him once the laws started to change every season i just couldnt keep up in any case i found that even if i only refereed veteran teams i couldnt keep up quite literally dont let knowledge of the laws worry you said mr maiden well still be able to use you the session ends with a look at the changing room the shower facilities and more importantly clean lavatories im issued with a plastic gym card and look forward to returning to my old training regime pm back in the cell i find jules sitting on the top bunk reading i settle down to another session of writing before were called for supper pm i select the vegetarian pie and chips and am handed the obligatory yellow lollipop which is identical to those we were given at belmarsh if its the same company who makes and supplies them to every one of her majestys prisons that must be a contract worth having although its only my third meal since i arrived i think ive already spotted the power behind the hotplate hes a man of about thirtyfive six foot three and must weigh around twentyseven stone as i pass him i ask if we could meet later he nods in the manner of a man who knows that in the kingdom of the blind i can only hope that ive located waylands del boy after supper we are allowed to be out of our cells for a couple of hours association until were banged up at eight what a contrast to belmarsh i use the time to roam around the corridors and familiarize myself with the layout the main office is on the first landing and is the hub of the whole wing from there everything is an offshoot i also check where all the phones are situated and when a prisoner comes off one he warns me never use the phone on the induction landing jeff because the conversations are taped use this one its a screwfree line i thank him and call mary in cambridge shes relieved that ive rung as she has no way of contacting me and cant come to see me until shes been sent a visiting order i promise to put one in tomorrows post and then she may even be able to drive across next tuesday or wednesday i remind her to bring some form of identification and that she mustnt try to pass anything over to me not even a letter mary then tells me that shes accepted an invitation to go on the today programme with john humphrys she intends to ask baroness nicholson to withdraw her accusation that i stole money from the kurds so that i can be reinstated as a dcat prisoner and quickly transferred to an open prison i tell mary that i consider this an unlikely scenario shes not decent enough to consider such a christian act i warn my wife im sure youre right mary replies but i will be able to refer to lynda chafers parliamentary reply on the subject and ask why ms nicholson wasnt in the house that day if she cares so much about the kurds or why had she not at least read the report in hansard the following morning mary adds that the bbc have told her that they accept i have no case to answer when are you going on next wednesday or thursday so its important i see you before then i quickly agree as my units are running out i then ask mary to warn james that ill phone him at the office at eleven tomorrow morning and will call her again on sunday evening my units are now down to ten so i say a quick goodbye i continue my exploration of the wing and discover that the main association room and the serveryhotplate double up the room is about thirty paces by twenty and has a fullsize snooker table which is so popular that you have to book a week in advance there is also a pool table and a tabletennis table but no tv as it would be redundant when theres one in every cell im walking back upstairs when i bump into the hotplate man he introduces himself as dale and invites me to join him in his cell telling me on the way that hes serving eight years for wounding with intent to endanger life he leads me down a flight of stone steps onto the lowerground floor this is an area i would never have come across as its reserved for enhanced prisoners only the chosen few who have proper jobs and are considered by the officers to be trustworthy as you cant be granted enhanced status for at least three months i will never enjoy such luxury as i am hoping to be moved to a dcat fairly quickly although dales cell is exactly the same size as mine there the similarity ends his brick walls are in two tones of blue and he has nine fivebyfiveinch steel mirrors over his washbasin shaped in a large triangle in our cell jules and i have one mirror between us dale also has two pillows both soft and an extra blanket on the wall are photos of his twin sons but no sign of a wife just the centrefold of a couple of chinese girls blutacked above his bed he pours me a cocacola my first since william and james visited me in belmarsh and asks if he can help in any way in every way i suspect i would like a soft pillow a fresh towel every day and my washing taken care of no problem he says like a banker who can make an electronic transfer of a million dollars to new york by simply pressing a button as long as you have a million dollars anything else phonecards food drink i could do with some more phonecards and several items from the canteen i can also solve that problem dale says just write out a list of what you want and ill have everything delivered to your cell but how do i pay you thats the easy part send in a postal order and ask for the money to be placed against my account just make sure the name archer isnt involved otherwise theres bound to be an investigation i wont charge you doublebubble just bubble and a half three or four other prisoners stroll into dales cell so he immediately changes the subject within minutes the atmosphere feels more like a club than a prison as they all seem so relaxed in each others company jimmy whos serving a threeandahalf year sentence for being an ecstasy courier carrying packages from one club to another wants to know if i play cricket the occasional charity match about twice a year i admit good then youll be batting number three next week against d wing but i usually go in at number eleven i protest and have been known to bat as high as number ten then youll be first wicket down at wayland says jimmy by the way we havent won a match this year our two best batsmen got their dcats at the beginning of the season and were transferred to latchmere house in richmond after about an hour of their company i become aware of the other big difference on the enhanced wing the noise or rather the lack of noise you just dont hear the incessant stereos attempting to outblare each other at five to eight i make my way back to my cell and am met on the stairs by an officer who tells me that i cannot visit the enhanced area again as its off limits and if you do archer he adds ill put you on report which could mean a fortnight being added to your sentence theres always someone who feels he has to prove how powerful he is especially if he can show off in front of other prisoners i put archer in his place didnt i in belmarsh it was the young officer with his record bookings i have a feeling ive just met waylands back in my cell i find jules is playing chess against a phantom opponent on his electronic board i settle down to write an account of the day there are no letters to read as no one has yet discovered im in wayland pm dale arrives with a soft pillow and an extra blanket hes disappeared before i can thank him day saturday august am ive managed to sleep for six hours thanks to jules hanging a blanket from the top bunk so that it keeps out the fluorescent arc lights that glare through the bars all night at i place my feet on the linoleum floor and wait jules doesnt stir so far no snoring or talking in his sleep last night jules made an interesting observation about sleep if s the only time when youre not in jail and it cuts your sentence by a third is this the reason why so many prisoners spend so much time in bed dale adds that some of them are gouching out after chasing the dragon this can cause them to sleep for twelve to fourteen hours and helps kill the weekend as well as themselves am the cell door is unlocked just as im coming to the end of my first writing session during that time ive managed a little over two thousand words i go downstairs to the hotplate hoping to pick up a carton of milk only to be told by dale that its not available at the weekend am im first in the queue at the office to pick up a vo for mary in a ccat youre allowed one visit every two weeks a prisoner can invite up to three adults and two children under the age of sixteen the majority of prisoners are between the ages of nineteen and thirty so a wife or partner plus a couple of young children would be the norm as my children are twentynine and twentyseven it will be only mary and the boys who ill be seeing regularly am i attend my first gym session each wing is allowed to send twenty inmates so after my inability to get on the list at belmarsh i make sure that im at the starting gate on time the main gym is taken up with four badminton matches like snooker its a sport that is so popular in prison that you have to book a court a week in advance the weighttraining room next door is packed with heaving and pumping musclemen and by the time i arrive someone is already jogging on the one treadmill i begin my programme with some light stretching before going on the rowing machine i manage only metres in ten minutes compared with the usual i do back in the gym on albert embankment but at least that leaves me something to aim for i manage a little light weight training before the running machine becomes free i start at five miles an hour for six minutes to warm up before moving up to eight miles an hour for another ten minutes just to give you an idea how feeble this is roger bannisters fourminute mile in was at fifteen miles an hour and i once saw seb coe do twelve miles an hour for ten minutes hold your breath at the age of forty and he was only warming up for a judo session i end with ten minutes of stretching and a gentle warm down most of the prisoners walk into the gym and go straight on to the heavy weights without bothering to warm up later they wonder why they pull muscles and are then out of action for the next couple of weeks i return to my cell and try out the shower on our wing the wash room has four showers which produce twice as many jets of water as those at belmarsh also when you press the button the water continues to flow for at least thirty seconds before you have to press it again there are two young black lads already showering who i notice keep their boxer shorts on i later learn this is because theyre muslims however one problem i still encounter is that im allowed only two small thin towels three by one foot a week if i intend to go to the gym five days a week followed by a shower ill have to speak to dale about the problem i give james a call at the flat and ask him to send ps in postal orders to dale at wayland so i can buy a razor some shampoo a dozen phonecards as well as some extra provisions i also ask him to phone griston post office and order the times and telegraph every day sundays included james says hell ask alison to call them on monday morning because hes going on holiday and will be away for a couple of weeks ill miss him even on the phone and it wont be that long before will has to return to america noon i skip lunch because i need to start the second draft of todays script and in any case it looks quite inedible i open a packet of crisps and bite into an apple while i continue writing pm when the cell door is unlocked again at two oclock dale is standing outside and says hes been given clearance to invite me down to the enhancement wing the officer i bumped into yesterday must be off duty its like entering a different world we go straight to dales cell and the first thing he asks me is if i play backgammon he produces a magnificent leather board with large ivory counters while im considering what to do with a six and a three never a good opening throw he points to a plastic bag under the bed i look inside a gillette mach razor two packets of blades a bar of cussons soap some shaving foam a bunch of bananas a packet of cornflakes and five phonecards i think it unwise to ask any questions i thank dale and hand him my next shopping list i assure him funds are on the way we shake hands on a bubble and a half hell supply whatever i need from the canteen and charge me an extra per cent the alternative is to be starved unshaven or cut to ribbons by a prison razor this service will also include extra towels my laundry washed every thursday plus a soft pillow all at an overall expense of around ps a week we are once again joined by two other inmates darren see plate section and jimmy transporting ecstasy during the afternoon i play both of them at backgammon win one and lose one which seems acceptable to everyone present dale leaves us to check in for work as no on the hotplate so we all move across to darrens cell during a game of backgammon i learn that darren was caught selling cannabis a parttime occupation supplementing his regular job as a construction contractor i ask him what he plans to do once he leaves prison in a years time having completed three years of a sixyear sentence he admits hes not sure i suspect like so many inmates who can make fifty to a hundred thousand pounds a year selling drugs hell find it difficult to settle for a nine to five job whenever hes contemplating his next move i try to take in the surroundings you can learn so much about a person from their cell on the shelves are copies of the oxford shorter dictionary two volumes the oxford book of quotations he tells me he tries to learn one a day and a dozen novels that are clearly not on loan from the library as the game progresses he asks me if rupert brooke owned the old vicarage or just lived there i tell him that the great war poet only resided there while working on his fellowship dissertation at kings college jimmy tells me that theyre plotting to have me moved down to the enhanced wing as soon as ive completed my induction this is the best news ive had since arriving at wayland the cell door swings open and mr thompson looks round ah he says when he spots me the governor wants a wordt i accompany mr thompson to mr carltonboyces office hes a man of about forty perhaps fortyfive he welcomes me with a warm smile and introduces me to the senior officer from c wing which he tells me is where they plan to transfer me i ask if they would consider me for the enhancement spur but am told the decision has already been made ive come to realize that once the machine has decided on something it would be easier to turn the qeii around than try to get them to change their collective minds mr carltonboyce explains that he would quite happily move me to c wing today but with so many press sniffing around outside it mustnt look as if i am being given special treatment so i have to be the last of my intake to be moved no need to explain to him the problem of rap music and young prisoners hollering from window to window all night but he repeats the press interest is tying his hands pm i return to my cell and continue writing ive only managed a few pages when im interrupted by a knock on the cell door its a young man from across the corridor who looks to be in his early twenties can you write a letter for me he asks no one ever introduces themselves or bothers with pleasantries yes of course who is it to and what do you want me to say i reply turning to a blank page on my pad i want to be moved to another prison he tells me dont we all what no nothing but why should they consider moving you i want to be nearer my mother whos suffering from depression i nod he tells me his name is naz and then gives me the name of the officer to whom he wishes to address the letter he asks me to include the reason his request should be taken seriously i pen the letter reading each sentence out as i complete it he signs along the bottom with a flourish i cant read his signature so i ask him to spell his name so i can print it in capitals underneath then the officer in question will know who its come from i explain i place the missive in an envelope address it and he seals it naz picks up the envelope smiles and says thank you if you want anything just let me know i tell him i need a pair of flipflops for the shower because im worried about catching verrucas he looks anxiously at me i was only joking i say and wish him luck pm supper i settle for a lump of cabbage and half a portion of chips which is a normal portion in your world the cabbage is floating around in water and reminds me of school meals and why i never liked the vegetable in the first place while im waiting in line jimmy tells me that he didnt enjoy his spell of serving behind the hotplate why not i ask the inmates never stop complaining he adds about the quality of the food no about not giving them large enough portions especially when it comes to chips when i return to the cell i find over a hundred letters stacked on the end of my bunk jules reminds me that at weekends were banged up at around five thirty and will remain locked in our cells until eight fifteen the following morning so ill certainly have enough time to read every one of them fourteen hours of incarceration once again blamed on staff shortages unpleasant but still a great improvement on belmarsh i say unpleasant only because when youve finished your meal youre left with dirty smelly plastic plates littering your tiny cell all night it might be more sensible to leave the cell doors open for another twenty minutes so that prisoners can scrape the remains of their food into the dustbins at the end of each corridor and then wash their utensils in the sink and dont forget that in many prisons there are three inmates to a cell with one lavatory i compromise scrape my food into a plastic bag and then tie it up before dropping it in the wastepaper bin next to the lavatory when i look out of my cell window i notice several prisoners are throwing the remains of their meal through the bars and out onto the grass jules tells me that hes working on a letter to the principal officer mr tinkler about having his status changed from ccat to dcat he asks if i will go through it with him i dont tell him that im facing the same problem jules is a model prisoner and deserves his enhanced status he gained this while he was at bedford where he became a listener hes also quiet and considerate about my writing regime he so obviously regrets his involvement with drugs and is one of the few prisoners ive come across who i am convinced will never see the inside of a jail again i do a small editorial job on his letter and suggest that we should go over the final draft tomorrow i then spend the next couple of hours reading through todays mail which is just as supportive as the letters i received in belmarsh there is however one missive of a different nature that i feel i ought to share with you university college hospital london pm my dear lord archer many poets and writers have written much of their best work in prison owfor one however i cannot conceive of you having to spend four miserable years in a maximum security prison i spent days in such a facility in canada on a trumpedup charge of disturbing the peace i escaped by a most devious means i can arrange for your immediate release from bondage however only if you are willing to donate psm to my charity foundation i can be contacted anytime at if you would like some company choose three noncriminal or whitecollar offenders to join with youforan appropriate amount yours as an artist i am quite unable to read the signature in the second post there is another letter in the same bold red hand pm dear geofrey sic after having sealed my letter to you i realized that i wrote psm instead of psm so just to reassure you im not an idiot i repeat my offer to spring you and a few other trustworthy buddies yours in every greater art again i cannot read the signature day sunday august am woken by voices in the corridor two officers one of them on a walkietalkie they open a cell door and take a prisoner away i will find out the details when my door is unlocked in a couple of hours time am write for two hours am breakfast sugar puffs prison issue longlife milk mine because its sunday beans on burnt toast prisons am i go to the library for the first time and sign up you are allowed to take out two books a third if your official work is education the library is about the same size as the weightlifting room and to be fair just as well stocked they have everything from graham greene to stephen king i claudius to harry potter however although forsyth grisham follett and jilly cooper are much in evidence i can find none of my books on the shelves i hope thats because they are all out on loan lifers often tell me theyve read them all slowly and in some cases several times i take out a copy of the glass bead game by hermann hesse which i havent read in years and famous trials selected by john mortimer naturally i have to fill in another form and then my choices are stamped by the library orderly a prisoner to be returned by august im rather hoping to have moved on by then kevin the prisoner who stamps my library card tells me that all my books were removed from the shelves the day they found out i was being transferred to wayland why i ask direct order from the number one governor it seems that belmarsh informed her that the prisoners were stealing your books and if they could then get you to sign them the blackmarket price is a thousand pounds i believe everything except the thousand pounds which sounds like a tabloid figure am i check my watch leave the library and quickly make my way across to the chapel on the other side of the corridor there is no officer standing by the entrance it suddenly hits me that i havent been searched since the day i arrived im a couple of minutes late and wonder if ive come to the wrong place as there are only three other prisoners sitting in the pews along with the chaplain john framlington is dressed in a long black gown and black cape with crimson piping and welcomes me with literally open arms the chapel is very impressive with its woodpanelled walls and small oils depicting the life of christ the simple altar is covered in a cloth displaying a white cross with splashes of gold there is also a large wooden cross hanging from the wall behind the altar the seating consists of six rows of twenty wooden chairs set in a semicircle reminiscent of a small amphitheatre i take a seat in the third row as a group of men and women all dressed in red tshirts enters by the backdoor they assemble their music on stands while a couple strap on guitars and a flautist practises a few notes shes very pretty i wonder if its because its my twentyfifth day in prison but that would be an ungallant thought she is pretty by ten fortyfive the congregation has swelled to seven but we are still outnumbered by the ninestrong choir the prisoners are all seated to the right of the altar while the choir is standing on the left a man who appears to be the groups leader suggests we move across and join him on their side of the chapel all seven of us dutifully obey ive just worked out why the congregation at belmarsh was over two hundred week in and week out while at wayland its down to seven here you are allowed to stroll around the buildings for long periods of time so if you wish to make contact with someone from another wing its not all that difficult in belmarsh chapel was a rare opportunity to catch up with a friend from another block relay messages pass on drugs and occasionally even pray the chaplain then walks up to the front turns and welcomes us all he begins by introducing shine who he tells us are a local group that perform for several churches in the diocese we all join in the first hymn he who would valiant be and shine turn out to be rather good despite our depleted numbers the service still swings along once the chaplain has delivered the opening prayer he comes and sits amongst the congregation he doesnt conduct any other part of the service as that has been left in the capable hands of the leader of shine next we sing amazing grace which is followed by a lesson from luke read by another member of the group following another hymn we are addressed by the leader of shine he takes his text from the first reading of the good samaritan he talks about people who walk by on the other side when you are in any trouble this time i do thank god for my family and friends because so few of them have walked by on the other side the service ends with a blessing from the chaplain who then thanks the group for giving up their time i return to my cell and write notes on everything i have just experienced pm i call mary in grantchester how i miss my weekends with her strolling around the garden at the old vicarage the smell of the flowers and the grass feeding the fish and watching students idly punting on the cam mary briefs me on what line she intends to take on the today programme now that the foreign office and the kdp kurdish democratic party have confirmed how the money for the kurds was raised and distributed i try to think how ms nicholson will spin herself out of this one mary reminds me that she cant come to see me until she receives a vo i confirm i sent her one yesterday she goes on to tell me that her own book photoconversion volume one clean electricity from photovoltaics advance sales price ps has been well received by the academic world we finish by discussing family matters although ive come to the end of my twenty units i dont tell her that i am in possession of another two phonecards as that might cause trouble for dale especially if the conversation is being taped i promise to call her again on tuesday and we agree a time just in case youve forgotten the calls are always one way out my next call is to james who is giving a lunch party for ten friends at our apartment in london i do miss his cooking he tells me whos sitting round my table and what they are eating roquefort fig and walnut salad spaghetti and ice cream followed by brie stilton or cheddar this will be accompanied by an australian red and a californian white i begin to salivate dinner yells an officer and i quickly return to the real world pm lunch chinese stirfried vegetables they may have been stirred but they are still glued together an apple supplemented by a mars bar p and a glass of evian guests preselected pm i join dale on the enhanced wing i grab darrens sunday times and read very slowly while dale and jimmy play backgammon the lead story is the alleged rape of a girl in essex by neil and christine hamilton this is more graphically described in dales news of the world and the implausible story is memorable for christine hamiltons observation if i wanted to do that sort of thing it would be in kensington or chelsea not essex we play several games of backgammon during which time the assembled gathering questions me about the contest for the tory party leadership darren marijuana only is a fan of michael portillo and asks how i feel i tell him that i think it might have been wise of the committee to let all three candidates who reached the second round clarke duncan smith and portillo be presented to the party membership leaving michael out is bound to create some bad feeling and may even cause trouble in the future its quite possible that the membership would have rejected portillo in any case but i feel that they should have been allowed the opportunity to do so dale wounding with intent is a huge fan of margaret thatcher while jimmy ecstasy courier voted for john major a decent bloke he says its sometimes hard to remember that i may be sitting in a room with an armed robber a drug dealer a millionpound fraudster and heaven only knows who else its also worth mentioning that when it comes to their other world they never discuss anything in front of me pm exercise i take the long walk around the perimeter of the prison about half a mile and several inmates greet me in a more friendly fashion than they did on my first outing last thursday the first person to join me is a man who is obviously on drugs unlike william keane do you remember him from belmarsh i cant tell which drug hes on just by looking at his skin his name is darrell and he tells me that his original sentence was for ten years his crime cutting someone up in a pub with a broken bottle he was nineteen at the time i take a second look he looks about forty then why are you still here i ask assuming he will explain that hes serving a second or third sentence for another offence once i ended up in prison i got hooked on drugs didnt i did you yeah and id never taken a drug before i came in but when youre given a tenyear sentence and then banged up for twentytwo hours a day with prisoners who are already on skag you sort of fall in with it dont you first i was caught smoking cannabis so the governor added twentyeight days to my sentence twentyeight days for smoking cannabis but i then tried cocaine and finally moved on to heroin every time i got caught my sentence was lengthened mind you ive been clean for over a year now jeff ive had to be otherwise im never going to get out of this fuckin shithole am i how long has it been twentyone years im fortyone and over half my sentence has been added because of being caught taking drugs while inside im trying to take this in when were joined by a burly older man of around my height who looks middle eastern darrell slips quietly away which i fear means trouble the new man doesnt bother with any small talk how would you like to make fifty grand a week while youre still in prison what do you have in mind i ask innocently because he doesnt look like a publisher ive got a lorryload of drugs stuck on the belgian border waiting to come into this country but im a little short of cash at the moment put up fifty grand and youll have a hundred by this time next week i quicken my pace and try to lose him but within seconds hes caught me up there would be no risk for you he adds slightly out of breath we take all the risk in any case no one could pin it on you not while youre still in jail i stop in my tracks and turn to face him i hate drugs and i detest even more those people who peddle them if you ever try to speak to me again i will repeat this conversation first to my solicitor and then to the governor and dont imagine you can threaten me because they would be only too happy to move me out of here and my bet is your sentence would be doubled do i make myself clear i have never seen a more frightened man in my life what he didnt know was that i was even more terrified than he was i couldnt forget the punishment meted out in belmarsh for being a grass hot water mixed with sugar thrown in your face or the man with the four razorblade scars administered in the shower i quickly leave the exercise yard and go back to my cell pull the door closed and sit on the end of the bed shaking pm when jules returns im still shaking i go off in search of dale i know that bastard says dale just leave him to me what does that mean i ask dont ask i have to im trying not to cause any trouble he wont trouble you again that i guarantee he then raises his twentysevenstone frame from the end of the bed and departs pm association i emerge from the enhanced wing with two mars bars having played a couple of games of backgammon with darren i become aware of the most incredible uproar emanating from the games room am i about to experience my first riot i glance anxiously round the door to see a group of west indians playing dominoes every time they place a domino on the table its slammed down as if a judge were trying to bring a rowdy courtroom to order this is followed by screaming delight more normally associated with lara scoring a century at sabina park the officer on duty mr nutbourne and the other inmates playing snooker pool and table tennis dont seem at all disturbed by this i stroll across to join the dozen or so west indians and decide to watch a couple of games one of them looks up from the table and shouts you wanna try your luck man thank you i reply and take a seat vacated by one of the players a west indian with greying hair divides the dominoes between the four of us and we each end up with seven pieces the player on my right is able to begin the game as he has a double six he places his prize with a thump in the middle of the table which is followed by shouts and screams from the assembled gathering the game progresses for four rounds without any player failing to place a domino on the end of the line during the next round the player on my left doesnt have a three or six so passes and as i have a six i place my domino quietly on the table i notice the brothers are becoming a little less noisy by this time a large crowd has gathered round until only two of us are left with one domino i have a five and a four but it is my opponents turn if hes going to win he has to hit and hit now the brothers fall almost silent can the player on my left thwart me and win the game i pray for the second time that day he has neither a four nor a one and passes without a murmur i try desperately to keep a poker face while holding my last domino in the palm of my hand a forest of black eyes are staring at me i quietly place my four next to the four on the righthand end and so much bedlam breaks out that even mr nutbourne decides to find out whats going on i rise to leave another game man another game they demand how kind of you i say but i must get back to my writing its been a pleasure to play you this is followed by much slapping of hands i depart quickly aware that if i were to play a second round the myth would be shattered frankly i know nothing of the subtleties of the game having just brought a new meaning to the phrase beginners luck pm supper when i reach the hotplate dale takes my plastic bowl and just as tony always did at belmarsh decides what i shall be allowed to eat he selects a vegetarian quiche a few lettuce leaves carefully extracted from a large bowl and a tomato i will no longer have to think about what to eat as long as dales on duty pm jules and i are banged up again until eight tomorrow morning fourteen hours in a cell seven paces by three just in case youve forgotten as its sunday there are no letters awaiting me so i just go over my script before returning to hermann hesse pm jules and i watch meg ryan and kevin kline in french kiss which has us both laughing but then we are a captive audience pm i settle my head on my new soft pillow it isnt goose down or even duck feather just foam rubber but i know luxury when i feel it day monday august am yesterdays early morning commotion in the corridor turned out to be a prisoner needing medication and the assistance of a listener he had pressed the emergency call button theres one in every cell next to the door which when pressed illuminates a small red light in the corridor while another flashes up in the main office it is known by the inmates as room service although prison orders state that it must be used only in emergencies otherwise you will be placed on report i couldnt find out why the prisoner needed the help of a listener but as it was his first night at wayland it could have been for any number of reasons remembering my first night i can only sympathize i write for two hours am breakfast sugar puffs mine milk theirs one egg on a slice of toast theirs a second slice of toast theirs marmalade mine am banged up for two hours which i plan on using to work on the second draft of this mornings script thats assuming there are no interruptions there are two am the cell door is unlocked by mr newport who wants to talk to jules about his application for a change of status from ccat to dcat jules explains that he has written his reasons in a letter so that they the authorities will have all the relevant details on record mr newport glances over the two pages and promises to arrange an interview with mr stainthorpe the classifications officer the cell door is banged shut am the cell door is opened a second time on this occasion its mr nutbourne who says now tell me jeffrey the first officer to call me by my christian name do you want the good news or the bad news you decide i suggest you wont be going to c wing after all because were going to move you down to join your friends on the enhanced corridor so whats the bad news i ask unfortunately a cell wont be available until august when the next prisoner on that corridor will have completed his sentence but you could still put me in a single cell on another part of the block dont push your luck he says with a grin before slamming the door closed noon lunch soup minestrone and a piece of brown bread fresh couldnt face the meat pie heaven knows what animals inside it pm gym im the first to set foot in the gym only to find that the running machine has broken down damn damn damn i warm up and stretch for a few minutes before doing ten minutes on the rower i manage metres a vast improvement on yesterday a little light weight training before moving on to a bicycle the like of which i have never seen before i cant get the hang of it until mr maiden comes to my rescue and explains that once youve set the speed the peddles just revolve until you stop them he sets the pace at thirty kilometres per hour and leaves me to get on with it i sweat away for ten minutes and then realize i dont know how to turn it off i shout to everett gbh for help a black man who i sat next to during the dominoes encounter but he just grins or simply doesnt understand my predicament when my screaming goes up a decibel mr maiden finally comes to my rescue he cant stop laughing as he shows me which button i have to press to bring the machine to a halt its marked stop in red i fall off the bike exhausted which causes much mirth among the other prisoners especially the dominoes players i use the rest of my time lying on a rubber mat recovering as the prisoners begin to make their way back to their cells no gates no searches im called to mr maidens office once his door is closed and no other prisoner can overhear he asks would you like to join the staff on friday morning to assist with a special needs group from dereham adult training centre of course i would i tell him jimmy is the only other prisoner who presently helps that group so perhaps you should have a word with him i thank mr maiden and return to my cell i dont immediately take a shower as i am still sweating from the bicycle experience so i use the time to call my pa alison i tell her i need more a pads and pens because im currently writing two to three thousand words a day i also need stamped envelopes addressed to her large a size for the manuscript and slightly smaller ones so i can turn round my daily postbag alison tells me that because of the sackfuls of letters i am receiving both in prison and at the office as well as having to type two scripts at once shes putting in even longer hours than when i was a free man and to think that you were worried about losing your job if i were to end up in jail i remind her just wait until i get my hands back on my novel youll be working weekends as well alison confirms that the last five chapters of belmarsh have arrived safely thanks to the cooperation of roy the censor no such problem at wayland where you just drop your envelope in a postbox and off it goes i remind her that i need the belmarsh script back as soon as possible to go over it once again before i let jonathan lloyd my agent read it for the first time my final request is to be put through to will hes in cambridge with mary although i check to see how many units are left on the phonecard i havent needed to worry about the problem lately as dale seems to be able to arrange an endless supply of them i dial cambridge and catch mary who is just leaving to chair a meeting at addenbrookes hospital where she is deputy chairman after a few words she passes me over to will he is full of news and tells me mum has been preparing in her usual diligent way for the today interview since he spoke to me last andy bearpark who covered kurdish affairs at the overseas development administration during the relevant time confirms he has been contacted by kpmg regarding the audit will feels the police will be left with little choice but to complete their initial report quickly and reinstate my dcat i thank him particularly for the support hes giving his mother i then tell him that ive finished the belmarsh section of the diaries and ask if hes found time to read the odd chapter i just cant face it dad its bad enough that youre there i tell him that i have already decided that there will be three volumes of the prison diary hell purgatory and heaven with an epilogue called back to earth this at least makes him laugh as im telling him this jimmy passes me in the corridor and i turn to ask if he could spare me a moment he nods and waits until i finish my conversation with will jimmy has also heard that i may be joining them on the enhanced wing but wonders if nutboumes information came from on high exactly my thoughts i tell him i then mention that mr maiden has invited me to join them in the gym on friday morning to assist with the special needs group im surprised by his reaction you jammy bastard says jimmy i had to wait a couple of years before i was invited to join that shift and you get asked after four days funnily enough i hadnt thought of it as a perk but simply as doing something worthwhile jimmy invites me down to his cell for a drink my only chance of having a diet coke were joined by jason who spotted me in the corridor jason hands me a pair of slippers and a wash bag which are normally only issued to enhanced prisoners you jammy bastard repeats jimmy before he starts going on about his weight jimmy is six foot one slim and athletic see plate section he trains every day in the gym and is known by the inmates as brad pitt more like arm pitt says jason jimmy smiles and continues to grumble i need to put on some weight i like you as you are darling jason replies i decide this is an ideal opportunity to ask them how drugs are smuggled into prison both throw out oneliners to my myriad questions and between them continue my education on the subject of the six major drugs cannabis speed ecstasy cocaine crack cocaine and heroin only cannabis and heroin are in daily demand in most prisons each wing or block has a dealer who in turn has runners who handle any new prisoners when they arrive on the induction wing its known as drug induction this is usually carried out in the yard during the long exercise break each morning the price ranges from double the street value to as much as a tenfold markup depending on supply and demand even in prison free enterprise prevails payment can be made in several ways the most common currency is phonecards or tobacco you can also send in cash to be credited to the dealers account but most dealers dont care for that route as even the dumbest officer can work out what theyre up to the preferred method is for the recipient of the drugs to arrange for a friend to send cash to the dealers contact on the outside usually his girlfriend wife or partner just as there is a canteen list of prices taped to the wall outside the main office so there is an accepted but unprinted list of available drugs in any prison for example the price of five joints of cannabis would work out at around ps or five phonecards a short line of cocaine would cost about ps while heroin a joey or a bag which is about half a gram can cost as much as ps next we discuss the bigger problem of how to get the gear into prison jason tells me that there are several ways the most obvious is via visits but this is not common as the punishment for being caught usually fits the crime for both the visitor and the prisoner if you are caught you automatically lose your visits and the use of phonecards for most prisoners this is their only lifeline to the outside world few other than desperate heroin addicts are willing to sacrifice being able to see their family and friends once a fortnight or speak to them regularly on the phone so most dealers revert to other safer methods because were they to be caught twice they not only lose the right to a phonecard as well as a visit but will be charged with the offence and can expect to have time added to their sentence what are the other methods i ask you can arrange to have gear thrown over the wall at a designated time so it can be picked up by a gardener or a litter collector helps to supplement their seven pounds a week wages jason explains but home leave or town visits are still the most common source of drugs coming in a clever courier can earn some extra cash prior to being released mind you adds jimmy if youre caught bringing gear in not only do you lose all your privileges but you can be transferred to an acat with time added to your sentence what about by post i ask sending in a ballpoint pen is a common method jason says you half fill the tube with heroin and leave the bottom half full of ink so that when the screws remove the little cap on the bottom they can only see the ink they could break the tube in half but that might mean having to replace as many as a hundred biros a week but the most common approach still involves brown envelopes and underneath stamps envelopes i ask down the side of most large brown envelopes is a flap if you lift it carefully you can place a line of heroin along the inside and carefully seal it back up again when it comes in the post it looks like junk mail or a circular but it could be hiding up to a hundred quids worth of skag one prisoner went over the top recently says jimmy hed been enhanced and put on the special wing one of our privileges is that we can hang curtains in our cell when his selected curtains arrived prison staff found the seams were weighed down with heroin the inmate was immediately locked up in segregation and lost all his privileges and did he also get time added to his sentence no jason replies he claimed that the curtains were sent in by his codefendant from the original trial in an attempt to stitch him up i like the use of the words stitch him up in this context not only did he get away with it continues jimmy but the codefendant ended up being sentenced to five years both men were as guilty as sin but neither of them ended up in jail for the crime they had committed jimmy adds not the first time ive heard that but you can also have your privileges taken away and time added if youre caught taking drugs jason reminds me true says jimmy but there are even ways around that in the government brought in mandatory drug testing to catch prisoners who were taking illegal substances but if youre on heroin all you have to do is purchase a tube of smokers toothpaste from the canteen and swallow a mouthful soon after youve taken the drug how does that help i ask if they ask for a urine sample explains darren smokers toothpaste will cloud it and they have to wait another twentyfour hours before testing you again by the time they conduct a second test a couple of gallons of water will have cleared any trace of heroin out of your system you may be up all night peeing but you dont lose your privileges or have time added but thats not possible with cannabis i ask no cannabis remains in your bloodstream for at least a month but its still big business whatever the risk and you can be fairly certain that the dealers never touch any drugs themselves they all have their mules and their sellers they end up only taking a small cut and are rarely caught and some of them even manage to make more money inside prison than they did outside adds jason the call for tea is bellowed down the corridor by an officer i close my notepad thank jason for the slippers and wash bag not to mention the tutorial and return to my cell pm supper vegetarian pie and two potatoes if i become enhanced i will be allowed to have my own plate plus a mug or cup sent in not to mention curtains pm write for just over an hour pm watch sue barker and roger black sum up the world athletics championship which has been a disaster for britain one gold for jonathan edwards in the triple jump and a bronze for dean macey in the decathlon the worst result for britain since the games began in and that was following such a successful olympics in sydney im almost able to convince myself that im glad i was prevented from attending pm read through my letters just over a hundred today pm jules and i watch a modern version of great expectations with robert de niro and gwyneth paltrow if i hadnt been in prison i would have walked out after fifteen minutes i begin to read famous trials selected by john mortimer i start with rattenbury and stones the problem of a younger man falling in love with an older woman now thats something i havent experienced i fall asleep around eleven day tuesday august am overslept after a nights rain the sun is peeping through my fourbar window i write for a couple of hours am breakfast two weetabix one hardboiled egg and a piece of toast am ive been writing for about an hour when the cell door is opened mr clarke tells me that as part of my induction i must attend a meeting with a representative from the bov board of visitors everything has an acronym nowadays nine prisoners assemble in a waiting room opposite mr newports office there are eleven comfortable chairs set in a semicircle and a low table in the middle of the room if there had been a few outofdate magazines scattered on the table it could have passed for a gps waiting room we have to hang around for a few minutes before being joined by a man in his late fifties who looks like a retired solicitor or bank manager hes about five foot nine with greying hair and a warm smile he wears an openneck shirt and a pair of grey flannels i suspect that the only other time hes this casually dressed is on a sunday afternoon he introduces himself as keith flintcroft and goes on to explain that the board is made up of sixteen local people appointed by the home office they are not paid which gives them their independence we can see the governor or any officer on request and although we have no power we do have considerable influence our main purpose he continues is to deal with prisoners complaints however our authority ends when it comes to an order of the governor for example we cannot stop a prisoner being placed in segregation but we can make sure that we are supplied with details of the offence within a period of seventytwo hours we can also read any written material on a prisoner with the exception of their legal papers or medical records mr flintcroft comes over as a thoroughly decent bloke a man who obviously believes in giving service to the local community just like so many thousands of citizens up and down the country he expects little reward other than the satisfaction of doing a worthwhile job i believe that if he felt a prisoner was getting a rough deal he would within the limits of his power try to do something about it he ends his tenminute chat by saying youll find that we spend a lot of our time roaming around the prison you cant miss us because we wear these distinctive buffcoloured name badges so feel free to come and talk to us whenever you want to in complete confidence now are there any questions to my surprise there are none why doesnt anyone mention the state of the cells on the induction wing compared with the rest of the prison why when there is a painter on each wing who i observe working every day isnt there one to spruce up the induction wing do they leave the wing in a filthy condition so that when inmates are moved to another part of the prison theyll feel its an improvement or is it that they just cant cope with the turnover of prisoners either way i would like to tell governor kate cawley ive discovered the governors name on a notice board but havent yet come across her that its degrading and a blip in an otherwise wellrun prison why are the induction prisoners locked up for such long hours while the rest of the inmates are given far more freedom and why and then it hits me i am the only person in that room who hasnt been through this process before and the others either simply dont give a damn or cant see the point of it they are mostly hardened criminals who just want to complete their sentence and have as easy a time as possible before returning to a life of crime they believe that the likes of mr flintcroft will make absolutely no difference to their lives i suspect that the likes of mr flintcroft have over the years made a great deal of difference to their lives without their ever realizing or appreciating it once mr flintcroft accepts that there are going to be no questions we all file out and return to our cells i stop and thank him for carrying out his thankless task noon mr chapman tells me i have a large parcel in reception which i can pick up after dinner lunch pm lunch spam fritters two potatoes and a glass of evian help im running out of evian pm i report to reception and collect my parcel or whats left of it it originally consisted of two books alan clarks diaries and the diving bell and the butterfly by jeandominique bauby which has been sent in by anton one of jamess closest friends theyre accompanied by a long letter about the latest bustup with his girlfriend i do love the young only their problems exist and from alison a dozen writing pads two packets of liquidpoint pens and six books of firstclass stamps mr chapman explains that i can keep the long letter from anton but everything else will be placed in my box at reception and returned to me only when im transferred or released pm i have become so accustomed to prison life that i not only remember to take my gym card but also a towel and a bottle of water to my afternoon gym session the running machine still isnt working so im back to ten minutes on the rower metres not very impressive followed by a light weighttraining session and ten minutes on the bike which i now know how to turn on and more importantly turn off everett gbh leaves his pound bench press and asks if he can have a swig of my evian i nod as i dont think theres much of an alternative a moment later his black weightlifting partner taller and wider strolls across and takes a swig without asking by the time ive finished stretching the bottle is empty once im back on my wing i try to take a shower but the door is locked i look through the tiny window its all steamed up and two prisoners are banging on the door trying to get out i cannot believe that it is prison policy to lock them in and me out i hang around for about ten minutes with a couple of other prisoners before an officer eventually appears i tell him id like to have a shower youve missed your chance i didnt have a chance i tell him its been locked for the past ten minutes ive only been away for a minute maybe two he says ive been standing here for nearly ten minutes i politely point out if i say its one minute its one minute he says i return to my cell i now feel cold and sweaty i sit down to write pm supper a bowl of thick oily soup is all i can face back in my cell i pour myself half a mug of blackcurrant juice the only luxury left at least im still losing weight pm exercise i walk around the perimeter fence with jimmy and darren just their presence stops most inmates from giving me a hard time pm i finally manage a shower i then put on a prison tracksuit grey and baggy but comfortable i decide to call mary there is a queue for the phone as this is the most popular time of day when its my turn i dial the old vicarage only to find that the line is engaged i spot dale hanging around in the corridor obviously wanting to speak to me he tells me that the money hasnt arrived i assure him that if it isnt in the morning post ill chase it up i try mary again still engaged i go back to my cell and prepare my desk for an evening session i check my watch its pm ill only have one more chance back to the phone i call cambridge still engaged i return to my cell to find an officer standing by the door im banged up for another twelve hours pm i read through todays script and then prepare outline notes for the first session tomorrow to the accompaniment of two west indians hollering at each other from cells on opposite sides of the wing i remark to jules that they seem to be shouting even louder than usual he resignedly replies that theres not a lot you can do about window warriors i wonder should i push my luck i go over to the window and suggest in a polite but firm voice that they dont need to shout at each other a black face appears at the opposite window i wait for the usual diatribe sorry jeff he says and continues the conversation in a normal voice well you can only ask day wednesday august am i wake only to remember where i am am breakfast when i go down to the hotplate to collect my meal dale gives me a nod to indicate that the money has arrived am phone mary to be told that shes doing the today programme with john humphrys tomorrow morning and will be visiting me on friday with will as james is on holiday she suggests that the third place is taken by jonathan lloyd he wants to discuss my new novel sons of fortune and the progress of the diary as i am allowed only one visit a fortnight this seems a sensible combination of business and pleasure although i will miss not seeing james phone alison who says shell have finished typing volume one belmarsh hellby wednesday words and will post it to me immediately she reminds me that from monday she will be on holiday for two weeks i need reminding in prison you forget that normal people go on holiday when i return to my cell i find david whisky bootlegger sweeping the corridor i tell him about my water shortage he offers me a large bottle of diet lemonade and a diet robinsons blackcurrant juice in exchange for a ps phonecard which will give him a p profit i accept and we go off to his cell to complete the transaction there is only one problem you are not allowed to use phonecards for trading because it might be thought you are a drug dealer each card has the prisoners signature on the back of it not unlike a credit card see plate section no problem says david he never swears i can remove your name with fairy liquid and then replace it with mine how will you get hold of a bottle of fairy liquid im the wing cleaner silly question am my padmate jules has begun his education course today life and social skills so i have the cell to myself ive been writing for only about thirty minutes when my door is unlocked and im told the prison probation officer wants to see me i recall tonys absconding from ford open prison words when i was at belmarsh dont act smart and find yourself on the wrong side of your probation officer because they have considerable sway when it comes to deciding your parole date im escorted to a private room just a couple of doors away from mr tinklers office on the firstfloor landing i shake hands with a young lady who introduces herself as lisa dada she is a blonde of about thirty and wearing a vneck sweater that reveals she has just returned from holiday or spent a long weekend sitting in the sun like everyone else she asks me how i am settling in i tell her that i have no complaints other than the state of my cell my rude introduction to rap music and window warriors lisa begins by explaining that she has to see every prisoner but there isnt much point in my case because her role doesnt kick in until six months before my parole and as im moving to surrey in about two months time she continues to be nearer my husband who is a prison officer you may well have moved to another establishment long before then so i cant do much more than answer any questions you might have how did you meet your husband i ask thats not the sort of question i meant she replies with a grin he must be nigerian what makes you think that dada its an igbo tribe name the tribe of the leaders and warriors she nods and says we met in prison in circumstances that sound as if they might have come from the pages of one of your novels i dont interrupt i had a prisoner who was due to be released in the morning the evening before he was phoning his wife to arrange what time she should pick him up but couldnt hear what she was saying because of the noise coming from a tv in a nearby cell he popped his head round the door and asked if the inmate could turn the volume down and was told to fuck off in a moment of anger he dropped the phone walked into the cell and took a swing at the man the inmate fell backwards onto the stone floor cracked open his head and was dead before they could get him to a hospital the first prison officer on the scene called for the assailants probation officer who happened to be me we were married a year later what happened to the prisoner i ask he was charged with manslaughter pleaded guilty and was sentenced to three years he served eighteen months there was clearly no intent to murder i know it sounds silly she adds but until that moment his record was unblemished so your husband is black that cant have been easy for you especially in prison no it hasnt but it helps me find a common thread with the dreadlocks so whats it like being a thirtysomething blonde probation officer i ask its not always easy she admits sixty per cent of the prisoners shout at me and tell me that im useless while the other forty per cent burst into tears burst into tears that lot i say thumbing towards the door oh yes i realize its not a problem for you but most of them spend their lives having to prove how macho they are so when they come to see me its the one chance they have to reveal their true feelings once they begin to talk about their families their partners children and friends they often break down suddenly aware that others might well be going through an even more difficult time outside than they are locked up in here and the shouters what do they imagine theyre achieving getting the rage out of their system such a disciplined regime creates pentup emotions and im often on the receiving end ive experienced everything including obscene language and explicit descriptions of what theyd like to do to me while all the time staring at my breasts one prisoner even unzipped his jeans and started masturbating all that for twentyone thousand a year so why do you do it i have the occasional success perhaps one in ten which makes it all seem worthwhile when you go home at night whats the worst part of your job she pauses and thinks for a moment having to tell a prisoner that his wife or partner doesnt want him back just before theyre due to be released im not sure i understand many longterm prisoners phone their wives twice a week and are even visited by them once a fortnight but its only when their sentence is drawing to a close and a probation officer has to visit the matrimonial home that the wife confesses she doesnt want her husband back usually because by then they are living with another man sometimes their husbands best friend and they expect you to break the news yes she replies because they cant face doing it themselves even on the phone and is there any particular set of prisoners you dont like dealing with the paedophiles murderers rapists drug dealers for example no i can handle all of them she says but the group i have no time for are the burglars burglars they show neither remorse nor conscience even when theyve stolen personal family heirlooms they tell you its all right because the victim can claim it back on insurance she glances at her watch im meant to be asking you some questions she pauses not that the usual ones apply try me i suggest lisa removes a sheet of paper from a file and reads out the listed questions are you married are you living with your wife have you any children do you have any other children are any of them in need of assistance or financial help will you be returning to your family when you are released when you are released do you have any income other than the ninety pounds the state provides for you do you have somewhere to sleep on your first night out of prison do you have a job to go to with a guaranteed source of income she looks up the purpose of the last question is to find out if youre likely to commit an offence within hours of leaving prison why would anyone do that i ask because for some of them this is the only place that guarantees three meals a day a bed and someone to talk to youve got a good example on your wing out last month back inside this month robbed an old lady of her bag and then immediately handed it back to her he even hung around until the police arrived to make sure he was arrested i think i know the prisoner shes referring to and make a mental note to have a word with him our hour is drawing to a close so i ask if she will stick with it yes ive been in the service for ten years and despite everything it has its rewards mind you its changed a lot during the last decade when i first joined the motto emblazoned on our notepaper used to read advise assist and befriend now its enforcement rehabilitation and public protection the result of a massive change in society its newfound freedom and the citizens demands for safety the public doesnt begin to understand that at least thirty per cent of people in prison shouldnt be locked up at all while seventy per cent the professional criminals will be in and out for the rest of their lives theres a knock on the door my hours up and we havent even touched on the problem of drugs mr chapman enters carrying two bundles of letters lisa looks surprised thats only the first post mr chapman tells her i can quite believe it she says my parents send their best wishes my father wanted you to sign one of his books but i told him it would be most unprofessional i rise from my place good luck with your appeal she adds as we shake hands i thank her and return to my cell noon lunch macaroni cheese and diet lemonade i hate lemonade so i spend some considerable time shaking the bottle in an effort to remove the bubbles i have a considerable amount of time pm mr chapman warns me that i will not be able to go to the gym this afternoon as i have to attend a carat counselling assessment referral advice and throughcare meeting on drugs this is another part of my induction despite the fact ive never touched a drug in my life i cant afford to miss it otherwise i will never be moved from this filthy dank noisy wing naturally i comply pm i try to pick up my books and notepads from reception only to be told by mr meanwell a man who regularly reminds me meanwell is my name and mean well is my nature that i cant have them because its against prison regulations all notepads and pens have to be purchased from the canteen and all books ordered through the library who buy them direct from waterstones but in belmarsh they allowed me to have two notepads two packets of pens and any number of books i required sent in and theyre a maximumsecurity prison i know says meanwell with a smile its a damn silly rule but theres nothing i can do about it i thank him many of the senior officers know only too well whats sensible and what isnt but are worried that if i receive what could be construed as special treatment it will be all over the tabloids the following morning the rule is enforced because books pads and pens are simply another way to smuggle in drugs however if im to go on writing ill have to purchase these items from the canteen which means ill need to cut down on spam and weetabix pm ive been writing for about an hour when i am called to the carat meeting once again eleven of us assemble in the room with the comfortable chairs the carat representative is a young lady called leah who tells us that if we have any drugrelated problems she is there to advise and help leah reminds me of mr flintcroft although shes pushing an even larger boulder up an even steeper hill i glance around the room at the other prisoners their faces are blank and resigned im probably the only person present who has never taken a drug the one comment leah makes that catches the prisoners attention is that if they were to have a period on d wing the drugfree wing it might even help with their parole but before leah can finish her sentence a ripple of laughter breaks out and she admits that its possible there are even more drugs on d wing than on a b or c drugfree wings in most prisons have that reputation when leah comes to the end of her eightminute discourse and invites questions she is greeted with silence the same silence mr flintcroft experienced i leave feeling a little more cynical drugs are the biggest problem the prison service is currently facing and not one prisoner has a question for the carat representative let alone attempts to engage her in serious debate however i am relieved to observe that two inmates remain behind to have a private conversation with leah pm kit change once a week you report to the laundry room for a change of sheets pillowcases towels and gym kit i now have six towels and include four of them in my weekly change they are all replaced despite each prisoner only being allowed two however they wont replace my second pillowcase because youre allowed only one i cant understand the logic of that youre meant to wash your own personal belongings but i have already handed over that responsibility to darren who is the enhanced wings laundry orderly he picks up my bag of washing every thursday and returns it later that evening he asks for no recompense i must confess that the idea of washing my underpants in a sink shared with someone elses dirty cutlery isnt appealing pm supper unworthy of mention pm exercise i walk round the perimeter of the yard with darren and another inmate called steve steve was convicted of conspiracy to murder he is an accountant by profession well spoken intelligent and interesting company his story turns out to be a fascinating one he was a senior partner in a small successful firm of accountants he fell in love with one of the other partners who was already married to a colleague one night on his way home from work steve stopped at a pub he regularly frequented he knew the barman well and told him that given half a chance hed kill the bastard meaning his girlfriends husband steve thought nothing more of it until he received a phone call from the barman saying that for the right price it could be arranged the phone call was being taped by the police as were several others that followed it was later revealed in court that the barman was already in trouble with the police and reported steve in the hope that it would help have the charges against him dropped it seems the key sentence that mattered was are you certain you want to go ahead with it which was repeated by the barman several times yes steve always replied steve and his girlfriend were arrested pleaded guilty and were sentenced to seven years she currently resides at highpoint while he has gone from a to b to ccat status in a couple of years record time and is now living on the enhanced wing at wayland with dcat status he doesnt want to move to an open prison because wayland is near his home he is also the prisons chief librarian i have a feeling that youll be hearing more about steve in the future on the circuit round the perimeter we are joined by the prisoner i shared a cell with on my first night chris stabbing with a stanley knife he tells me that the news of the world have been in touch with his mother and will be printing a story on sunday he tries to assure me that he has had no contact with them and his mother has said nothing then it will only be three pages i tell him when i return to my cell jules is looking worried hes also heard that chris will be featured in the news of ike world this sunday chris told him that a lot of his friends and associates dont even know hes in jail and he doesnt want them to find out he attends education classes twice a day and wants the chance to start a new life once hes been released i just dont have the heart to tell him that the news of the world have absolutely no interest in his future pm we watch the news still more august storms at jules switches channels to ally mcbeal while i try unsuccessfully to sleep im not sure which is more distracting the tv in our cell or the rap music emanating from the other side of the block day thursday august am i wake from a dream in which i had been using the most foul language when talking to mary i cant explain it i write for a couple of hours am i plug in juless radio so that i can hear marys interview with john humphrys i shave while the news is on and become more and more nervous its always the same i am very anxious when william screens one of the documentaries hes been working on or james is running the metres and especially whenever mary has to give a talk that lay people might expect to understand shes first on after the news and handles all of john humphrys questions in that quiet academic way that could only impress an intelligent listener but i can tell even after her first reply just how nervous she is once mary has dealt with the kurds and baroness nicholson humphrys moves on to the subject of how im getting on in jail that was when mary should have said my agreement with you mr humphrys was to discuss only matters arising from the kurds once mary failed to point this out he moved on to the trial the appeal and the sentence i had warned her that he would he has no interest in keeping to any agreement made between her and the producer and thats why he is such a sharp interviewer as i know from past experience am i call mary who feels she was dreadful and complains that john humphrys broke the bbcs agreement and once the piece was over she told him so what does he care she then tells me that the ceo of the red cross sir nicholas young was interviewed later and was uncompromising when it came to any suggestion that one penny raised for the kurds in the uk had not been accounted for he went on to point out that i had nothing to do with either the collecting or distribution of any monies i suggest to mary that perhaps the time has come to sue baroness nicholson mary tells me that the lawyers first priority is to have my dcat reinstated so i can be moved to an open prison before we issue the writ good thinking dont waste any more of your units she says see you tomorrow am disaster darren reappears with my washing all fresh and clean but the dryer has broken down for the first time in living memory i take the wet clothes back to my cell and hang the tshirts on the end of the bed my underwear from an open cupboard door and my socks over the single chair the sun is shining but not many of its rays are reaching through the bars and into my cell am today is the first day of the fourth test match against australia and hussain is back as captain he said that although weve lost the ashes english pride is now at stake i write for an hour and then turn on the television at eleven to see who won the toss its been raining all morning of course it has the match is at headingley leeds i switch off the television and return to my script am ive been writing for over an hour when the cell door is unlocked the governor would like a word i go to the interview room and find mr caritonboyce and mr tinkler waiting for me mr caritonboyce looks embarrassed when he tries to explain why i cant have any writing pads and pens or alan clarks diaries i make a small protest but only so its on the record he then goes on to tell me that i will not be moving to c block after all theyve had a rethink and ill be joining the adults on the enhanced spur but and there is always a but in prison as no one is being released until august ill have to stay put until then i thank him and ask if my roommate jules can be moved to a single cell as i fear it cant be too long before the news of the world will do to him exactly what theyve done to every other prisoner who has shared a cell with me this shy thoughtful man will end up being described as a drug baron and he doesnt have any way of fighting back governor carltonrboyce nods promises are never made in prison but he does go as far as saying the next thing on my agenda is cell dispersal because we have eight more prisoners coming in tomorrow i thank him and leave aware thats about the biggest hint ill get noon lunch dale passes me two little sealed boxes rather than the usual single portion and winks i was down on todays menu for number three vegetable stew but when i get back to my cell i discover the other box contains mushroom soup so i linger over the soup followed by vegetable stew its not le caprice but its not belmarsh either pm im told that as part of my induction i must report to the education department and take a reading writing and numeracy test when i take my seat in the classroom and study the forms it turns out to be exactly the same test as the one set at belmarsh should i tell them that i took the papers only two weeks ago or should i just get on with it i can see the headline in the mirror archer refuses to take writing test it would be funny if it wasnt exactly what the mirror would do i get on with it pm gym its circuittraining day and i manage about half of the set programme known as the dirty dozen the youngsters are good but the star turns out to be a fortyfiveyearold gypsy who is covered in tattoos and serving an elevenyear sentence for drug dealing hes called minnie and outruns them outjumps them outlifts them outpresses them and isnt even breathing heavily at the end he puts me to shame i can only hope that the youngsters feel equally humiliated pm im back in time for a shower david whisky bootlegger is standing by my door he tells me that hes written the outline for a novel and wants to know how to get in contact with a ghostwriter this is usually a surrogate for are you available i tell him exactly what i tell anyone else who writes to me on this subject three or four letters a week go to your local library take out a copy of the writers and artists yearbook and youll find a section listing agents who handle ghostwriters i assume that will keep him quiet for a few days pm david returns clutching a copy of the writers and artists yearbook and shows me a page of names i glance down the list but none is familiar i have come across only a handful of agents over the years debbie owen george greenfield deborah rodgers jonathan lloyd and ed victor but there must be at least another thousand ive never heard of i suggest that as my agent is visiting me tomorrow if he selects some names ill ask jonathan if he knows any of them pm david returns with the list of names written out on a single sheet of paper he hands over a diet coke hes what simon heffer would describe as a proper gent pm supper vegetable pie two boiled potatoes and a lump of petits pois making un seul pois i switch on the tv australia are for and ponting is not out together with waugh theyve put on switch off why did i ever switch on after supper i go down to the association room to find dale wounding with intent and jimmy transporting ecstasy tablets playing snooker for a mars bar its the first time ive seen jimmy beaten at anything and whats more hes being thrashed by a far superior player its a subject i know a little about as i was president of the world snooker association before i was convicted jimmy whispers in my ear dale beats everyone but like any hungry animal he has to be fed at least twice a day we take it in turns to hand over a mars bar its a cheap way of keeping him under control in case youve forgotten dale is six foot three and weighs twentyseven stone after the game is over the three of us join darren in the exercise yard dale manages only one circuit before heading back in exhausted while the three of us carry on for the full fortyfive minutes during the second circuit i tell them about derek who did the drawing of my cell belmarsh and ask if they know of any artists in wayland jimmy tells me that there is a brilliant his word artist on c block i ask if he will introduce me be warned hes weird says jimmy and can be very rude if he takes against you i tell jimmy that ive been dealing with artists for the past thirtyfive years and ive never met one who could be described as normal its all part of their appeal i feel like a drink says darren as the evening sun continues to beat down on us know anyone whos got some hooch he asks jimmy hooch i say whats that they both laugh a laugh that suggests i still have much to learn every block says darren has a hotplate man a cleaner a teaboy and a painter theyre all appointed by the screws and are paid around twelve pounds a week every block also has a drug dealer a haircutter a clotheswasher and a brewer c block has the best brewer for a twopound phonecard you can get half a litre of hooch but whats it made of the ingredients are normally yeast sugar water and orange juice its harder to produce during the summer months because you need the hot pipes that run through your cell to be boiling in order to ferment the brew so its almost impossible to get decent hooch in august whats it taste like awful but at least its guaranteed to get you drunk says jimmy which kills off a few more hours of your sentence even if you wake up with one hell of a hangover if youre desperate darren adds fresh orange juice is still on the canteen list how does that help just leave it on your window ledge in the sun for a few days and youll soon find out but where can you hide the hooch once youve made it we used to have the perfect hiding place darren pauses but unfortunately they discovered it jimmy smiles as i wait for an explanation one sunday morning darren continues the number one brewer on our spur was found roaming around inebriated when breathalysed he registered way above the limit the drug squad were called in and every cell on the spur was stripped bare but no alcohol of any kind was discovered his hiding place would have remained a mystery if a small fire hadnt broken out in the kitchen an officer grabbed the nearest fire extinguisher and pointed it in the direction of the blaze only to find that the flames leapt even higher an immediate halt was called by the chef who fortunately understood the effects of ethanol otherwise the prison might have been razed to the ground a full enquiry was held and three inmates were shipped out to different bcats the following morning on suspicion of producing hooch in fact said darren it wasnt hooch they were guilty of brewing this particular strain of neat alcohol had been made by filtering metal polish through six slices of bread into a plastic mug in the hope of removing any impurities i feel sick without even having to sample the brew jimmy goes on to point out that not only are some inmates brighter than the officers but they also have twentyfour hours every day to think up such schemes while the screws have to get on with their job but the best hooch i ever tasted said darren had a secret ingredient and what was that may i ask marmite but once the screws caught on to how much yeast it contained they took it off the canteen list he pauses so now we just steal the yeast from the kitchen damn i said i like marmite it was on the belmarsh canteen list i dont think thats a good enough reason my lord to be transferred back to belmarsh says darren mind you he adds perhaps i should have a word with the governor now its known that you are partial to it i kick him gently up the backside as an officer is passing in the opposite direction did you see that mr chapman archer is bullying me ill put him on report and hell be back in belmarsh by the end of the week mr chapman promises we laugh as we continue on the perimeter circuit however i point out how easy it is to make an accusation and how long it takes to refute it its been a month since emma nicholson appeared on newsnight insinuating that i had stolen money intended for the kurds and it will probably be another month before the police confirm there is no case to answer but just think about that for a minute jeffrey if it hadnt been for that bitch nicholson you would never have met jimmy and me who have not only added greatly to your knowledge of prison life but enabled a further volume to be written pm one of the officers says theres a package for me in the office im puzzled as ive already had my mail for today and registered letters are always opened in front of two officers around eleven each morning when i walk in he makes a point of closing the office door before he hands over a copy of alan clarks diaries a pad and a book of stamps someone else who considers the regulations damned stupid he goes on to say that my wife will be searched when she visits the prison tomorrow were all embarrassed about it he adds but it will be no worse than at an airport but perhaps it might be wise to let her know by the way the press are still hanging about hoping to catch her when she arrives i thank him and leave pm i read a few pages of the clark diaries which i enjoy every bit as much a second time i also enjoyed alans company and will never forget a dinner party he gave at saltwood just before the general election in alan posed the question to his guests what do you think the majority will be at the next election most of the assembled gathering thought labour would win by over a hundred the only dissenter was michael howard who was home secretary at the time he put up a bold defence of john majors administration and told his fellow guests that he felt it was still possible for the conservatives to win the next election alan told him that if he really believed that he was living in cloud cuckoo land i dont know to this day if michael was simply being loyal to the prime minister although i can tell you that like john major he is one of those people who doesnt cross over to the other side of the road when youre in trouble pm suddenly feel very hungry eat a bowl of cornflakes and a mars bar check my clothes still not dry i dont bother with another of john mortimers great trials feel i have enough murderers surrounding me without having to read about them day friday august am the first thing i notice when i wake is that my mach razor has disappeared the wash basin is next to the door in future after ive shaved ill have to hide it in my cupboard it would have to be stolen on the day mary is visiting me i want to be clean shaven but i dont want to cut myself to ribbons with a prison razor it also reminds me that because i hadnt expected to be convicted ive been wearing my longines watch for the past month and i must hand it over to my son during the visit this afternoon am breakfast before i go down to the hotplate i extract a letter from yesterdays mail that is in spanish dale has told me that one of the servers on the hotplate hails from colombia so he should be able to translate it for me his name is sergio and he usually stands quietly on the end of the line handing out the fruit i pass the missive across to him and ask if we could meet later he nods and hands me a banana in return am todays induction is education once again held in the room with the comfy chairs for the first time the other prisoners show some interest why because this is how theyll earn their weekly wage the head of education introduces herself as wendy she must be in her fifties has curly grey hair wears a flowery blouse white skirt and sensible shoes she has the air of a headmistress wendy wheels a little projector up to the front and begins a slide show using the white brick wall as a backdrop she shows us what her department has to offer the first slide reveals five options basic skills english as an additional language social and life skills business skills art craft and design education wendy points out is parttime one session a day so you can only earn seven pounds thirtyfive per week the other prisoners dont take a great deal of interest in this slide but immediately perk up when the second chart flashes on to the wall vt and cit training courses bricklaying plumbing electrical installation painting and decorating welding motor mechanics light vehicle body repair industrial cleaning computer application the weekly pay for any one of these courses is also ps but does give you a basic training for when you return to the outside world when the final slide comes up most of the inmates begin licking their collective lips because this offers not only real earning power but a position of responsibility plus perks the extra money guarantees a more substantial canteen list each week extra tobacco and even the opportunity to save something for when you are released the slide reveals plastic recycling ps per week ration packing ps gardening one of the most soughtafter jobs with a long waiting list ps general cleaner ps works ps kitchen ps stores very popular longer waiting list than the mcc ps chapel ps drug rehabilitation unit ps before she can turn back to face her audience the questions come thick and fast wendy points out that most of these jobs already have waiting lists even washingup as there are far more prisoners than jobs wendy handles the questions sympathetically without giving anyone false hopes of being offered one of these more remunerative positions her final task is to hand round more forms to be filled in my fellow inmates grab them and then take some time considering their options i put a cross next to pottery in the education box but add that i would be happy to do a creative writing course or teach other prisoners to read and write wendy has already pointed out that the education department is understaffed however she tells me that such an initiative would require the governors approval and shell get back to me i return to my cell am i report to the gym to assist with the special needs group they are about thirty in number and ive been put in charge of four of them alex robbie les and paul three head straight for the rowing machines while alex places himself firmly on the treadmill he sets off at one mile an hour and with coaxing and patience something i dont have in abundance he manages two miles an hour i have rarely seen such delight on a competitors face this for alex is his olympic gold medal i then suggest he moves on to the step machine while i try to tempt paul off the rower and onto the running machine i have to give him several demonstrations as to how it works before hell even venture on and when he finally does we start him off at half a mile an hour by using sign language hands waving up and down we increase his speed to one mile an hour i next try to show him how to use the plus and minus buttons he conquers this new skill by the time hes walked half a mile while i teach him how to operate the machine he teaches me to be patient by the time hes done a mile paul has mastered the technique completely and feels like a king i feel pretty good too i look around the room and observe the other prisoners murderers drug barons armed robbers and burglars gaining just as much from the experience as their charges our final session brings all the group together in the gym where we play a game thats a cross between cricket and football called catchball a plastic ball is bowled slowly along the ground to a child i must remember that though they think like children they are not who kicks it in the air and then takes a run if they are caught theyre out and someone else takes their place one of the players robbie catches almost everything whether it flies above his head at his feet or straight at him this is always greeted with yelps of delight by eleven thirty were all exhausted the group are then ushered out of a especial door at the side of the gym the boys shake hands and the girls cuddle their favourite prisoner carl a handsome west indian gets more cuddles than any of us they see no colour only kindness as they leave to go home they enquire how long you will be there and thus i discover why prisoners with longer sentences are selected for this particular responsibility i make a bold attempt to escape with the group who all laugh and point at me when we reach the waiting bus mr maiden finally calls me back noon lunch i cant remember what ive just eaten because im glued to the morning papers mary is given rave reviews right across the board dozens of column inches praising the way she handled john humphrys lord longfords reported dying words free jeffrey archer get a mention in almost every column i didnt know frank longford well but enjoyed his wifes reply to roy plomley on desert island discs plomley lady longford have you ever considered divorce lady longford no never murder several times but divorce never i have a feeling mary would have given roughly the same reply pm i am watching the australians leave the field they were all out for when the cell door is unlocked and im told to report to the visitors area i switch off the tv and head out into the corridor how unlike belmarsh i even have to ask the way take the same route as you would for the gym says mr chapman but then turn right at the end of the corridor when i arrive the two duty officers dont strip search me and show no interest in my watch which is secreted under my shirtsleeve for visits all prisoners have to wear striped blue prison shirts and blue jeans the visitors room is about the same size as the gym and is filled with seventy small round tables each surrounded by four chairs one red three blue the red chair and the table are bolted together so there is always a gap between you and your visitor this is to prevent easy passing of illicit contraband the prisoner sits in the red seat with his back to the officers in the middle of each table is a number im fourteen there is a tuck shop on the far side of the room where visitors can purchase nonalcoholic drinks chocolate and crisps the one prisoner trusted to handle cash in the shop is steve conspiracy to murder librarian and accountant wouldbe murderer he may be thief he is not once every prisoner has been seated the visitors are allowed in i watch the different prisoners wives partners girlfriends and children as they walk through the door and try to guess which table theyll go to wrong almost every time marys about fifth through the gate she is wearing a long white dress which shows off that glorious mop of dark hair will is only a pace behind followed by my agent and close friend jonathan lloyd he and will take a seat near the door so that mary and i can have a little time to ourselves mary brings me up to date with whats happening at the red cross their ceo sir nicholas young has been most supportive no fencesitter he because of his firm statements mary feels confident that it wont be long before i am moved on to an open prison she also feels that the prison service and the police have been put in an embarrassing position and will fall back on claiming that they had no choice but to follow up nicholsons accusation the red cross may even consider taking legal action against her the lawyers advice is if they do we should remain on the sidelines i agree she beckons to will who comes over to join us will tells me that hes been monitoring everything and although its tough for me they are both working daily on my behalf i confess that there are times in the dead of night when you wonder if anyone is out there but i realize when it comes to backup there cant be a prisoner alive with a more supportive family when wills completed his report jonathan is finally allowed to join us while will goes off to purchase six diet cokes and a bottle of highland spring three of the cokes are for me jonathan has travelled up to wayland to discuss my latest novel he also wants an update on the diaries im able to tell him that belmarsh is completed words although i still need to read it through once again but hope to have it on his desk in about two weeks time we discuss selling the newspaper rights separately while allowing my publisher a per cent topping right on the three volumes as theyve been so good to me in the past but we all agree that nothing should happen until we know the outcome of my appeal both for conviction and sentence once jonathan feels his business is complete he retires once again so that i can spend the last half hour with mary and will when were alone we recap on all that needs to be done before we meet again in a fortnights time at least i now have enough phonecards to keep in regular touch steve comes across to clear our table its the first time mary has met someone convicted of conspiracy to murder this tall elegant man looks more like a company secretary than a wouldbe murderer is her only comment you probably pass a murderer on the street once a week i suggest time for visitors to leave announces a voice behind me i unstrap my longines watch to exchange it for a twentydollar swatch i purchased in a rash moment at washington airport will is facing the two officers who are seated on a little platform behind me he nods and we both put on our new watches all visitors must now leave repeats the officer politely but firmly we begin our long goodbyes and mary is among the last to depart when i leave the room the officer asks me to take off my shoes which he checks carefully but doesnt ask me to remove anything else including my socks he shows no interest in my watch and nods me through pm back in my cell i find my canteen order has been left on the end of the bed hip hip and my clothes are finally dry hooray as i unpack my wares dale arrives with backup provisions pm supper beans and chips accompanied by a large mug of volvic pm exercise dale joins jimmy darren and me as we walk around the yard and manages all three circuits on the last one he spots the artist he told me about yesterday he is sitting in the far corner sketching a prisoner an inmate is leaning up against the fence in what he assumes is a models pose we walk across to take a look the drawing is excellent but the artist immediately declares that hes not happy with the result ive never known an artist say anything else as hes more than fully occupied we agree to meet tomorrow evening at the same time when i return to the wing sergio hotplate colombian asks me if i would like to join him in his cell on the enhanced spur hes kindly translated the letter from the spanish student it seems that the young man has just finished a bachelors degree and needs a loan if hes to consider going on to do a doctorate i thank sergio and pen a note on the bottom of the letter so that alison can reply lock up bellows an officer just as im about to depart sergio asks can we talk again sometime as theres something else id like to discuss with you i nod wondering what this quiet colombian can possibly want to see me about day saturday august am had a bad night there was an intake of young prisoners yesterday afternoon and several of them turned out to be window warriors they spent most of the night letting everyone know what they would like to do to ms webb the young woman officer on night duty ms webb is a charming universityeducated woman who is on the fasttrack for promotion darren told me that whenever a new group of prisoners comes in they spend the fast twentyfour hours sorting out the pecking order at night wayland is just as uncivilized as belmarsh and the officers show no interest in doing anything about it after all the governor is sound asleep in her bed at belmarsh i was moved into a single cell after four days in wayland ive been left for eleven days among men whose every second word is fuck some of whom have been charged with murder rape grievous bodily harm and drug pushing let me make it clear this is not the fault of the prison officers on the ground but the senior management there are prisoners who have been incarcerated in wayland for some time and have never once seen the governor i do not think that all the officers have met her thaf s not what i call leadership one of yesterdays new intake thought it would be clever to slam my door closed just after an officer had unlocked it so that i could go to breakfast he then ran up and down the corridor shouting i locked jeffrey archer in i locked jeffrey archer in luckily only a few of the prisoners are this moronic but they still make everyone elses life unbearable am breakfast one look at the lumpy powdered scrambled egg and a tomato swimming in water and im off as i leave sergio suggests we meet in his room at i nod my agreement am saturday is a dreadful day in prison its the weekend and you think about what you and your family might have been doing together however because we are unlocked during the day but banged up in the early evening there is always a queue outside my cell door prisoners wanting letters written queries answered or on the scrounge for phonecards and stamps at least no one bothers to ask me for tobacco so on a saturday my only chance of a clear two hours to write are between six and eight in the morning and six and eight at night am i call chris beetles at his gallery its the opening of his cat show these ones are in frames not cages so i dont waste a lot of his time and promise ill call him back on monday on my way back to the cell i pass darren in the corridor and stop to ask him about sergio whose cell is three doors away from his a real gentleman says darren keeps himself to himself in fact i dont know much more about him now than i did when he arrived at wayland a year ago hes a colombian but hes one of the few prisoners who never touches drugs he doesnt even smoke youll like him am when i arrive at sergios cell he checks his watch as if he assumed id be on time if the archer theory is correct namely that you can tell everything you need to know about a prisoner from his cell then sergio is a neat and tidy man who likes everything in its place he offers me his chair while he sits on the bed his english is good although not fluent and it quickly becomes clear that he has no idea who i am which helps considerably when i tell him im a writer he looks interested i promise to have one of my books spanish translation sent in an hour passes before he tells me anything about himself he makes it clear as if he wants the world to know that colombians fall into two categories those who are involved in drugs and those who are not he and his family come into the latter group and he seems genuinely pleased when i tell him that i have an aversion to drugs that is bordering on the manic his family he tells me have no idea hes in jail in fact his weekly call to bogota accounts for almost his entire income hes divorced with no children so the only people he has to fool are his brother his sister and his parents they believe he has a responsible job with an importexport company in london he will return to bogota in five weeks time there is no need for him to purchase a plane ticket as he will be deported were he ever to return to britain he would immediately be arrested put back in jail and would remain locked up until he had completed the other half of his eightyear sentence he has no plans to come back he tells me the conversation drifts from subject to subject to see if we can find anything of mutual interest he has a great knowledge of emeralds coffee and bananas three subjects of which i know virtually nothing other than their colour its then i spot a photograph of him with he tells me his mother and sister a huge smile comes over my face as he removes the picture from the shelf to allow me a closer look is that a botero i ask squinting at the painting behind his mother he cannot hide his surprise that i should ever have heard of the maestro yes it is he says my mother is a friend of botero i almost leap in the air as i have long dreamed of adding a botero to my art collection in london or my sculpture collection in grantchester in fact chris beetles and i travelled to calabria two years ago to visit the great man at his foundry sergio quickly reveals that he knows a considerable amount about latin american art and names several other artists including manzu rivera and betancourt he has met botero and his family are friends of manzu i tell him i would love to own one of their works but both artists are way out of my price range particularly botero who is considered to be the picasso of south america the french think so highly of him that they once held an exhibition of his sculptures along the champselysees the first time a foreigner has been so honoured its just possible i could find one of his works at a price you could afford how is that possible i ask sergio then explains to me at great length what he calls the colombian mentality to start with you have to accept that my countrymen only want to deal in cash they do not trust banks and do not believe in cheques which is why they regularly alternate between being rich and penniless when they are wealthy they buy everything in sight jewellery yachts cars houses paintings women anything when they are poor they sell everything and the women leave them but colombians have no fear of selling he continues because they always believe that they will be rich again tomorrow when they will buy back everything even the women i know a trader in bogota he continues who bought a botero for a million dollars and five years later sold it for two hundred thousand cash give me time and ill come up with a botero at the right price he pauses but i would expect something in return am i about to find out if sergio is a con artist or as darren suggested a real gentleman i have a problem he adds i have been in jail for four years and when i finish half my sentence i will be deported im trying to write notes as he speaks i will be put on a plane without any presents for my three nephews and niece i dont interrupt would it be possible for you to get me three manchester united shirts for the nephews seven ten and eleven years old and a lion king outfit for my eightyearold niece anything else i ask yes i need a suitcase because all i have is a hmp wayland plastic bag and he hesitates i also need twenty pounds in phonecards so i can call bogota and not worry about being cut off is that it he hesitates once more i would like one hundred pounds put in my prison account so i can pick up one or two things for my family at the airport i dont want them to wonder why i dont have any presents for them i consider his requests for risk capital investment of around ps i would have an outside chance of owning a botero i can afford i nod to show that i agree to his terms if you do this for me he adds i will tell you more in fact i have already told you more in an hour than i have any other prisoner in four years he then writes down the name and address of a contact in london and says give her the suitcase the tshirts and the one hundred pounds and she will send them on to me at wayland that way you wont be involved am i phone a friend who used to work in the tshirt business and pass on the order for manchester united tshirts and a lion king outfit he sounds intrigued but doesnt ask any questions i then call my driver at home and explain that the items are to be delivered to a flat in north london along with ps in cash consider it done he says am i cross the corridor to dales room and tell him i need twenty pounds worth of phonecards just like that my lord just like that i reply put it on my account and ill have the money sent through to you he opens a drawer and removes ten ps cards and passes them across youve wiped me out he says then get back to work because i have a feeling im going to need even more next week why are you calling america right idea wrong continent i leave dale and return to sergios room i hand over the ten phonecards and tell him that the other items will all have been delivered by this time tomorrow he looks astonished how fortunate that you are sent to this jail just as i am leaving i confess that i hadnt seen it quite that way and remind him that we have a deal one botero at a price you can afford within a year he confirms youll have it by christmas when i leave him to return to my cell i remember just how much i miss dealing whether its for ps or ps million i once watched jimmy goldsmith bargaining for a backgammon board with a street trader in mexico it took him all of forty minutes and he must have saved every penny of ps but he just couldnt resist it noon lunch i devour a plate of princes ham p surrounded by prison beans while i watch england avoid the follow on pm i head for the library closed followed by the gym cancelled so ill have to settle for a fortyfiveminute walk around the exercise yard pm the man who was sketching the portrait of another prisoner yesterday is waiting for me as darren jimmy and i walk out into the yard he introduces himself as shaun but tells me that most inmates call him sketch i explain that i want a portrait of dale wounding with intent darren marijuana only jimmy ecstasy courier steve conspiracy to murder and jules drug dealing for the diary a sort of montage he looks excited by the commission but warns me that hell have to get on with it as hes due to be released in three weeks time any hope of some colour i ask follow me he says we troop across rough grass littered with rubbish and uneaten food to end up outside a cell window on the ground floor of c wing i stare through the bars at paintings that cover almost all his wall space theres even a couple on the bed im left in no doubt that hes the right man for the job how about a picture of the prison he suggests yes i tell him especially if its from your window because i have an almost identical view two blocks over see plate section i then ask him how he would like to be paid shaun suggests that as he is leaving soon it may be easier to send a cheque directly to his home so his girlfriend can bank it he says hed like to think about a price overnight and discuss it with me during exercise tomorrow im not allowed to visit his cell as he resides on another block so we can only talk through his barred window pm supper vegetable stirfry and a mug of volvic ive negotiated two art deals today so i feel a little better because the library was closed and i have finished the glass bead game i have nothing new to read until it opens again tomorrow i spend the rest of the evening writing about sergio day sunday august talisman of my existence i seem to be the only thing that doesnt move when i reach the hotplate dale gives a curt nod a sign he needs to see me sergio also nods i leave the hotplate emptyhanded bar a slice of toast and two appointments i return to my cell and eat a bowl of my cornflakes with my milk am first peaceful night in weeks yesterday i visited the three prisoners with noisy stereos and the two inmates who go on shouting at each other all through the night but not before i had been asked to do so by several other prisoners on the spur i got two surprises firstly no one was willing to accompany me they were all happy to point out which cells they were in but no more than that the second surprise was that all of the transgressors without exception responded favourably to my courteous request with either not me gov or sorry jeff ill turn it down and in one case ill turn it off at nine jeff interesting am breakfast a prisoner in the queue for the hotplate asks me if im moving cells today no i tell him what makes you think that the name card outside your cell has disappeared always the first sign that youre on the move i laugh and explain its been removed every day a sort of am gym the treadmill is not working again so i start with the rower and manage metres in ten minutes i would have done better if i hadnt started chatting to the inmate on the next rower all across his back is tattooed the word monster though in truth hes softly spoken and whenever ive come across him in the corridor friendly i ask what his real name is martin he whispers but only my mother calls me that everyone else calls me monster hes managed metres in ten minutes despite chatting to me he tells me that in january when he arrived at wayland he weighed seventeen and a half stone he is a taxi driver from essex and admits that it was easy to put on weight in that job now he tips the scales at thirteen stone five pounds and his girlfriend has to visit him every two weeks just to make sure that shell still recognize him when hes released he was sentenced to three years for transporting cannabis from one ilford club to another about a third of the men in this prison have been convicted of some crime connected with cannabis and most of them will say i repeat say that they would never deal in hard drugs in fact darren goes further and snarling adds that he would try to dissuade anyone who did if cannabis were to be legalized and for most of the wellrehearsed reasons i remain unconvinced that it should the price would fall by around per cent tax revenues would be enormous and prison numbers would drop overnight many young prisoners complain its your lot who are smoking the stuff jeff in ten years time it wont even be considered a crime jimmy admits that he couldnt meet the demand from his customers and that he certainly never needed to do any pushing darren adds that although he and jimmy covered roughly the same territory in ipswich they hadnt come across each other until they ended up in jail which will give you an idea of just how large the market is just in case youve forgotten im still in the gym monster leaves me to join darren and jimmy on the bench press where he manages to pump ten reps of pounds i also turn to the weights where i achieve ten curls at pounds this is followed by a spell on the bicycle where i break the world record by peddling three miles in twelve minutes and fiftyfour seconds pity its the world record for running mr maiden the senior gym instructor reintroduces me to the medicine ball which i havent come in contact with since i left school i place the large leather object behind my head raise my shoulders as in an ordinary situp and then pass it up to him he then drops it back on top of me simple i think until i reach my fifth attempt by which time im exhausted and mr maiden is unable to hide his mirth at my discomfort he knows only too well that i havent done this exercise for over forty years and what the result would be well have you doing three sets of fifteen with a minute interval between sets before youre released he promises i hope not i tell him without explanation i then carry out a fifteenminute warm down and stretching as my trainer in london karen would have demanded at the end of the session i am first at the gate because ill have to be in and out of the shower fairly quickly if im to get to the library before the doors are locked am jog to my cell strip shower change jog to the library still sweating but nothing i can do about it steve conspiracy to murder is on duty behind the desk in his position as chief librarian because steves the senior listener hes allowed to wear his own clothes and is often mistaken for a member of staff i return famous trials and take out twentyone short stories by graham greene am once ive left the library i walk straight across the corridor to the chapel and discover there are thirty worshippers in the congregation this week from their dress the majority must come from the local village the black man sitting next to me who was among the seven prisoners who attended last week tells me its the biggest turnout hes ever seen this week a methodist minister called mary conducts the service accompanied by an anglican vicar called val marys sermon is topical she talks about the world athletics championships and her feelings for those competitors who did not achieve what they had set out to do but for many of them there will be another chance i have now attended four consecutive church services and the minister always pitches the message at what he or she imagines will be of interest to the inmates each time they have failed to treat us as if we might just be normal human beings people who have not been to prison tend to fall into two categories the majority who treat you as if youre a convict on the run while the minority treat you as if you are in their front room after the blessing we gather in an anteroom for coffee and biscuits with the locals no need to describe them as they dont differ greatly from the kind of parishioners who attend church services up and down the country every sunday morning average age double that of the prisoners at twelve we are sent back to our cells no search unaccompanied noon lunch i havent had a chance to speak to dale or sergio yet so i fix appointments with dale at pm and sergio at pm i leave the hotplate with a portion of macaroni liberally covered in cheese while we are waiting in the long queue darren tells me when it used to be almost all macaroni with little sign of any cheese nobody thought to comment about this until it became clear that the allocation of cheese was becoming smaller and smaller as each week passed still no one did anything about it until one week when there was virtually no cheese the officer on duty at last began to show some interest the first thing he discovered was that the same cook had been on for the previous four saturdays and sundays so the following weekend he kept an eye on that particular inmate he quickly discovered that on saturday night the prisoner in question was returning to his cell with a lump of cheese the size of a pillow kg it was when three loaves of bread also went missing the same evening that the officer decided to report the incident to the governor the following saturday night a team of officers raided the prisoners cell hoping to find out what he was up to they discovered that he was running a very successful business producing welsh rarebit which when toasted was passed from cell to cell through the bars of his little window and damn good they were adds jimmy licking his lips how did he manage to toast them i demanded on every wing there is a communal iron which always ended up in marios cell on a saturday evening explained darren how much did the chef charge tor two nights supply a twopound phonecard and how did they punish him the iron was confiscated and mario demoted to washerup with twentyone days added to his sentence but they had to reinstate him after a couple of months because so many inmates complained about the standard of cooking dropping during the weekends so he was brought back and after another six months they also forgot about the twentyoneday added sentence and what is mario in for i ask tax evasion three years and the fraud squad needed to be just as sharp to discover what he was up to then says darren as we leave the hotplate i make a mental note to make sure i meet him pm dale wants to talk to me about my canteen list for next week and has set an upper limit of ps otherwise the screws will become suspicious he explains ps will be quite enough as im still credited each week with ps from my own account dales also solved my writing pad problem because hes somehow got his hands on three a pads for which he charges me ps i would happily pay ps as im down to twenty pages of my last pad but this new supply should last me a month pm i call mary at grantchester but there is no reply i try london but only get alisons voice on the answer machine i forgot shes away on holiday in any case its sunday pm supper the ham looks good but im down for the vegetarian dish and you cant change your mind once youve signed the weekly menu sheet dale thinks about giving me a slice but as my bete noire is on duty behind the hotplate he doesnt risk it every sunday you are given a meal sheet which rotates on a fourweek cycle see opposite you fill in your selection from a list posted outside the main office giving the kitchen advance notice of how much they will have to order of each item cant complain about that pm banged up for the next fourteen hours i begin the basement room by graham greene his description of minor characters is breathtaking in its simplicity and the story although complex still demands that you turn the page i consider it a reflection on the nobel committee not mr greene that he has never won the prize for literature day monday august am wake and wonder how long it will take the police to close their file on the kurds and allow me to be transferred to an open prison i heard a story yesterday about a prisoner who wanted to do it the other way round he put in an application to be transferred from a dcat open prison to a ccat a more secure environment with a tougher regime his reasons seem strange but im told are not uncommon he was serving a twentytwoyear sentence for murder after five years they moved him from an acat to a bcat which is a little more relaxed after a further twelve years they transferred him to wayland at wayland he became an enhanced prisoner with all the privileges that affords he was also chief gardener which allowed him to be out of his cell for most of the day and gave him an income of more than ps a week in his own world he wanted for nothing and the governor considered him to be a model prisoner after twenty years he was granted dcat status as part of his preparation for returning to the outside world he was transferred to ford open prison in sussex to begin his rehabilitation he lasted at ford for less than a month one saturday afternoon he absconded and turned himself in at the local police station a few hours later he was arrested charged with attempting to abscond and sent back to wayland where he remained until he had completed his sentence the governor at the time couldnt resist asking him why hed absconded he replied that he couldnt handle the responsibility of making his own decisions he also missed not having a proper job and the ordered discipline of the wayland regime but most of all he missed the high walls that surrounded the prison because they made him feel safe from all those people on the outside with less than six months to go before the end of his sentence he was found in his cell with a piece of silver paper from a kitkat wrapper a few grams of heroin and a lighted match he had even pressed the emergency button inside his cell to make certain that he was caught the governor wasnt sure what to do because he knew only too well that the prisoner had never taken heroin in twenty years only six weeks were added to his sentence and he was released a few months later within a month of leaving prison he committed suicide am breakfast i have a shredded wheat and think of ian botham this is doubly appropriate because its twenty years ago this week that he scored at headingley and with the assistance of willis and dilly defeated australia despite england having to follow on in todays match australia lead by and i assume adam gilchrist will soon declare as theyve already won the series and england have only scored more than in a final innings against australia once in the last hundred years am one of the prison chaplains visits me she bears a message from michael adie who until recently was the bishop of guildford michael and i first met in when he was vicar of louth and i was the member of parliament for that beautiful constituency he was a more natural friend for mary having gained a firstclass honours degree in mathematics at cambridge michael wants to visit me and has discovered that a bishop can see a prisoner without it affecting his quota of fortnightly visits i suggest to margaret the prison chaplain that for michael to make the long journey to norfolk is typical of his generous spirit but it might be wiser to wait and find out which dcat prison they are going to transfer me to i feel sure it will be nearer london and he could then visit me there she kindly agrees to relay that message back to him noon lunch when i reach the hotplate dale looks anxious and whispers that he has to see me urgently i return to my cell flick on the television to find that england are for and an australian victory now looks certain all we can hope for now is a draw the untutored jules thinks england can still win bless him after all he has only taken to watching cricket because hes stuck in the same cell as me pm gym i complete my usual programme and feel im just about back to the level of fitness i was before being sentenced i leave the exercise room to check up on whats happening in the main hall where i find a volleyball match in progress so many prisoners want to join in that they are playing one team on and one team off by the end of the game i accept the fart that i can no longer hope to play at this level and appoint myself referee within a minute ive given a penalty point because a prisoner swears following one of my decisions a near riot breaks out and its several minutes before i can get the game started again what then follows is a close wellfought match without another swear word uttered when i blow the final whistle the players on both sides all turn to face me and swear as one pm after a shower i sit in my tiny cell and watch england fight their way back to for jules is still convinced england can win dale visits me in my cell soon after jules has disappeared off to education dale warns me that hes been interviewed by a security officer although they have no proof they are fairly sure that the five ps postal orders he received last week came from me and theyve warned him that if any further monies materialize that cannot be accounted for theyll set up a full enquiry we both agree that payments will have to cease and with it my weekly supplies help pm the same officer interviews me thirty minutes later saying he has reason to believe i have been sending money in to another prisoner the officer could not have been more reasonable and adds that if it occurs again it could greatly harm my chances of regaining dcat status it is then that he asks me if i am being bullied and paying someone to protect me i burst out laughing the officer obviously feels that dale at six foot three and twentyseven stone is my paid minder i make it clear that no one is bullying me and i dont require any protection but if i do he will be the first person to hear about it the last thing i need is to jeopardize my dcat or be beaten up i return to my cell to find england are for at tea and butcher is playing out of his skin even mcgrath is being regularly dispatched to all parts of the ground could jules be right pm exercise i go out into the yard every day now not just because i need the exercise but to pick up stories from the prisoners on different wings many of them are professional criminals while others are just stupid or lazy the most dangerous and frightening are a combination of all three however a minority are bright but for the circumstances of their upbringing many of them might well have held down responsible positions darren agrees with me but pointing to an inmate a few paces ahead of us adds but not in his case why i ask whos he thats dumbo he says but offers no further explanation until we have passed him and he is well out of earshot in december last year darren continues dumbo was unemployed and facing the prospect of a distinctly unmerry christmas his wife said shed had enough and told him to go out and get some money and she didnt care how dumbo disappeared off to the towns largest toy store where he shoplifted a replica gun he then walked across the road held up the local chemist and departed with fourteen hundred pounds in cash he returned home handed over the money to his wife confident that she would feel hed done a good days work but after counting the notes she told him that it wasnt enough and to go and get some more hold your breath said darren dumbo once again leaves his home returns to the high street walks back into the same chemist shop with the intention of repeating the holdup only to find two police officers interviewing the proprietor dumbo was arrested on the spot accompanied to the nearest police station charged and later sentenced to eight years for robbery while in the possession of a firearm no novelist would dare to consider such a plot pm when i return to my cell jules is glued to the television butcher is still at the crease we both watch as juless prediction comes true and england sweep to a famous victory butcher having scored the winning run is not out this is an innings he will not be the only person to remember for the rest of his life i feel i should point out that jules is every bit as excited as i am a convert a week ago he couldnt understand a draw let alone what a follow on was now he cant wait for next thursday to watch the fifth and final test i do hope he doesnt expect them all to end like this pm supper im tucking into my beans and chips when mr meanwell unlocks the cell door and asks to have a private word with me he doesnt speak again until we are in his office and the door is closed you were lucky to have got away with it this time but dont do it again he warns me if you do it could hold up your dcat for months and if youre thinking of doing anything with sergio wait until hes completed his sentence im impressed by how wellinformed mr meanwell is day tuesday august am slept well write for two hours am breakfast its rice crispies again its taken me until the middle of the second week to work out that its shredded wheat on monday rice crispies on tuesday cornflakes on wednesday nothing changes everything is by rote am my induction seems to have run its course however i remain on the induction wing as i wait for a single cell to become vacant i am made aware of this because the cycle has begun again a new group of prisoners is being seen by a member of the board of visitors i peer through the little mesh window in the door its not mr flintcroft this time but a lookalike am education i pull on my newly supplied prison regulation heavy brown boots as i prepare for my first pottery lesson once ive left the spur i have to ask several officers and inmates the way to the art centre which turns out to be on the other side of the prison when i finally locate it the first person i see on entering the room is shaun who sits in the corner of the large square workshop working on an abstract pastel he greets me with a smile the next person i spot is a lady who i assume must be our tutor shes around five foot six darkhaired and darkeyed with a warm smile she introduces herself as anne the first task anne sets me is to read a pottery book and see if i come across any object id like to recreate i try to tell her about my lack of talent in this area but she just smiles i begin to read the book as she moves on to roger a jolly west indian bank robber who is doing a sculpture of the virgin mary she then goes across to terry burglar who is moulding his piece of clay into a lion i am engrossed in my book when anne returns accompanied by a large lump of clay she also has a thin wooden stick that looks like a knife without a handle which is numbered four she glances down at the page ive reached to see a head and shoulders figure of a man with the help of the wooden knife she carves chunks off the square putty to start forming the shoulders and then leaves me to begin my first attempt at figurative sculpture as i turn my attention to the head and neck i get into conversation with shaun who is rubbing his fingers into the pastel to try and give his picture a blurred turneresque look while he chats away about which artists influence him i subtly try to steer the conversation off art and find out why he is in prison quite expecting him to claim that hes another victim of drugs no no no he says forgery my ears prick up paintings i ask no he replies much as id like to be a keating or elmyr hory its more mundane than that john lewis gift vouchers i laugh so how were you caught i was grassed up by my mate who got nervous and turned queens evidence he got off while i ended up with thirteen months in prison thirteen months thats a strange sentence i was given twelve months for the forgery and an extra month for not turning up to the first hearing how much did you get away with i ask casually cant tell you that he responds but i admitted to a couple of grand and youll be out in three weeks so how long have you served just over four months so you havent that long to carry out my commission he turns back to his sketch pad and flicks over a few pages be reveals half a dozen sketches of five figures in different poses and asks which one i would prefer which one do you prefer number three he says placing his thumb on the sketch i nod my agreement as anne reappears by my side i see what you mean by lack of talent she says and bursts out laughing at my feeble effort of a head and shoulders which makes like a cross between et and a botero roger bank robber and terry burglar come across to find out whats causing such you should have started with a pot man says roger and not tried to advance so quickly hes already identified my biggest failing without warning two officers march in and begin to carry out a search i assume it must be to check on the number of wooden knives and wire used for slicing the putty but no im told later it was for drugs the workshops are evidently a common place for dealers to conduct their business on the way back to my cell i get lost again but shaun accompanies me to a wing and tells me that he has come up with a concept for the cover of wayland see plate section i had always assumed that a graphic designer would do the cover of the book but the idea of a fellow prisoner carrying out the commission is very appealing i also admire shauns enterprise in spotting the opportunity as we part at the tjunction between our two blocks we agree to meet up during afternoon exercise to continue the discussion noon lunch dales mushroom soup plus a vegetable fritter pm i call my solicitor to try to find out the latest on the simple truth investigation the police have been supplied with all our documents plus a detailed report from the red cross detective chief superintendent perry whos in charge of the case is sympathetic but says he must follow up all baroness nicholsons accusations to dcs perry a day is nothing to me its another fourteen hours locked in a cell pm supper chinese stirfry and vegetables an original recipe served up in one blob and certainly not cooked by anyone who originated from the orient pm no evening gym because there is a cricket match between a and d blocks the drugfree wing known as junkies paradise i am going over my script for the day when jimmy appears outside my cell door youre batting at number five my lord he says looking down at his team sheet what i say the last game i played was for david frosts eleven against the lords taverners and on that occasion i was dean bowled first ball who was the bowler he asks imran khan i reply the pakistani fast bowler he asks in disbelief yes but he was bowling slow leg breaks at the time youre still batting number five report to the top corridor in five minutes i change into a tracksuit place a bottle top in the gap in my door and run to the gate to find darren waiting for me like the new swatch he says what happened to the longines i tell him of my illicit transfer of the watch to will during the last family visit the screws will have spotted it darren assures me and they would have been only too happy to see that particular watch leave the prison think of the trouble it would have caused them if someone had stolen it be warned they dont miss much by the way adds darren one of the guys on our wing is being transferred tomorrow so this may be your chance to get off the induction spur my heart leaps at the news i try to find out more details as we continue our stroll through a gate and out onto a large open field that is surrounded by a high fence topped with razor wire jimmy wins the toss and elects to bat now for those of you who understand the game of cricket hm prisons keep to a set of laws that even the mcc have no jurisdiction over they may or may not give you a better insight into prison thinking a both sides have ten overs each b each over is nine balls and you never change ends c each side must play five bowlers who can bowl two overs each but not consecutively d there are no boundaries and you have to run every run e the side with the highest score is the winner f the umpires decision is final while the other side takes to the field dale and carl pad up for a block i look in the equipment trolley hoping i will find a box and a helmet at the age of sixtyone i dont fancy facing a twentytwoyearold west indian bowler from brixton who thinks it would be fun to put me in hospital with no fear of being arrested for it i cant believe my eyes bats pads helmets guards boxes and gloves that are far superior to anything ive ever seen at any club game our openers are both back in the pavilion by the end of the first over with the score at for we may well have firstclass equipment but i quickly discover that it does little for our standard of cricket our number four lasts for three balls so in the middle of the third over i find myself walking out to join jimmy d block boo me all the way to the crease bringing a new meaning to the word sledging however there is worse to come because the west indian i referred to earlier is licking his lips in anticipation hell hes fast but hes so determined to kill me that accuracy is sacrificed and his nineball over is extended to thirteen with four wides after another couple of overs dont forget nine balls each jimmy and i advance happily on to for that is when my captain decides to try and launch the ball over the prison fence and ends up having his middle stump removed i fear neither neville cardus nor e w swanton could have done justice to our progress from for to all out all you need to know is that the west indian is back on for his second over and during the next nine balls he takes five wickets at a cost of four runs i leave the pitch not out having not faced a ball since my captain returned to the pavilion bowlers dont change ends but all is not lost because when a block takes to the field thanks to our demon quickie vincent manslaughter three of our opponents are back in the pavilion by the end of the first over for a total of only five runs the second bowler is our west indian he is robbed with two dropped catches and a plump lbw or i felt so from cover point when he comes off d block have only reached for but then prison rules demand that we render up our third bowler on his arrival the game is quickly terminated as the ball is peppered ruthlessly around the pitch d block reach the required total with no further loss of wickets and five overs to spare on the way back to our cells the d block captain says not bad jeff even though you played like a fucking public school cunt in prison you have to prove yourself every day once were back inside the block i tell jimmy that i may be joining him on the enhanced spur i dont think so jeff he replies the man whos leaving us is our wing cleaner and i think theyve offered his cell to david whisky bootlegger the cleaner on your wing my heart sinks your best bet is to move into davids cell and stay there until another one comes free pm i return to my cell but unfortunately theres no time for a shower before were all banged up im tired sweaty and even aching a little having used muscles i dont normally press into action in the gym im also hungry so i open a tin of princes ham p and a packet of crisps p pm jules watches the bill while i continue to read graham greenes the man within i fall asleep wondering if this is to be my last night in a double cell day wednesday august am wake fantasize about the possibility of a single cell write for two hours am breakfast cornflakes and one slice of toast dale is missing from behind the hotplate am i spot dale in the corridor he tells me hes resigned from his job at the hotplate hes sick of getting up thirty minutes before the rest of us just to be abused by inmates who never feel their serve of chips is large enough i see my name is chalked up on the blackboard outside the office to report to the so mr meanwell i go straight to the e he has a registered letter for me and slits it open he a twosided typed missive which he hands over but no interest in reading while he checks inside the enveli for drugs money even stamps i begin to read the letter and after only a paragraph pass it back to mr meanwell when he peruses it a look of disbelief comes over his face the writer wants to borrow ps to invest in an impossible to lose deal and hes willing to split the profits fiftyfifty how often do you get one of these he asks two or three times a week i confess asking for sums for as little as fifty pounds right up to a million for yet another impossible to lose deal by the way he says as he hands me the empty envelope you may be moving today by the way by the way by the way so casual for him so important to me one of the chaps on the enhanced spur is being transferred to a prison nearer his home and were allocating his cell to an inmate who will take over his responsibilities as cleaner once thats been sorted out mr meanwell is old enough still to include the word out well move you into his cell i did think of sending you straight to the enhanced spur he admits but there were two reasons not to first the spur needs a cleaner and you wouldnt be my first choice for that particular job and second i want you on the quieter side where its not possible for other prisoners to peer through your window during exercise once i leave mr meanwell i go in search of david whisky bootlegger and spur cleaner i find him attached to the industrial cleaner whirring around the floor of the induction corridor he invites me along to his present cell on the first floor which compared to my one up one down on the induction wing is the difference between fawlty towers and the ritz am exercise during the first circuit im asked by chris burglary if ill sponsor him for a half marathon in aid of the nspcc i agree to ps a mile as long as it comes out of my private finances and not my canteen account otherwise ill be without food and bottled water for several weeks he assures me that the authorities will allow that so i sign up he sticks with us for half a circuit by which time ive learnt that hes the type of burglar our probation officer lisa dada so despises hes twentyseven years old and has spent eight of the last ten years in jail he simply considers burglary a way of life in fact his parting words are im out in six weeks time jeff but dont worry your house is safe i realize those of you who have never been to jail may find this strange but i now feel more sympathy for some of the murderers in belmarsh than i do for professional burglars it was sometime later that i began to ponder on how he could run thirteen miles without occupying half the local constabulary to make sure he didnt escape ill ask him tomorrow jason conspiracy to blackmail joins us on the second circuit and congratulates me on being moved to a single cell it hasnt happened yet i remind him no but it will this afternoon prison has many similarities to the outside world one is that you quickly discover who actually knows whats going on and who only picks up fag ends jason knows exactly whats happening of course if you want to jason adds you can always get yourself transferred to another prison and how would i manage that write yourself a note and drop it in the complaints box you dont even have to sign it its known as the grass box and what would i have to suggest archer is offering me drugs and i cant resist much longer or archer is bullying me and im near breaking point if they believe it youd be transferred the same day in fact your feet wouldnt even touch the ground noon lunch the hotplate seems empty without the massive frame of dale dominating proceedings it looks as if sergio has been promoted to no in his place because he now stands next to the duty officer and hands out the dishes according to whether youre one two three vegetarian or four three sergio says without even glancing at the list and then carefully selects my dish the transfer of power has in no way affected me pm gym the treadmill is working again so im almost able to carry out a full programme with the new medicine ball exercise im up to fifteen with a oneminute break but after a further nine im exhausted and grateful when mr maiden blows the fiveminute whistle so i can warm down as we leave everyone else picks up their assigned gym card before disappearing back to their cells i no longer have a gym card its been stolen every day since i arrived and the management have given up bothering toissue me with a new one pm i come out of the shower to find ms webb waiting for me when the induction wing is banged up at four oclock she says ill leave your door open because were going to move you across to number two cell on the far spur i think about throwing my arms round ms webb but as i only have a towel covering me i feel sure she would put me on report so i simply say thank you once im dressed i place all my belongings into the belmarsh plastic bag in preparation for the move to the other side of the block i am packed and ready to leave long before four this will be my eighth move in five weeks pm david whisky bootlegger is waiting for me in his old cell its typical of his good manners that he has left the room spotless now that i have an extra cupboard it takes me nearly an hour to decide where everything should go although the cell remains the regulation five paces by three it suddenly feels much larger when you no longer have to share the cramped space with another prisoner no more having to keep out of someone elses way no more television programmes i dont want to watch no more having to check whose slippers youve put on that youre using your own toothpaste soap even lavatory paper no more theres a knock on the cell door and darren jimmy sergio and steve make an entrance its a housewarming party darren explains and like any good party we come bearing gifts sergio has three fivebyfiveinch steel mirrors the regulation size he fixes them on the wall with prison toothpaste i can now see my head and upper body for the first time in five weeks steve supplies can you believe it net curtains to hide my barred window and at night tone down the glare of the fluorescent lights jimmy has brought all the paraphernalia needed board blutack etc to attach my family photos to the wall lad darren demands a roll of drums before he will reveal his gift because hes come up with every prisoners dream a plug no longer will i have to shave in my cereal bowl anything else you require my lord steve enquires im out of evian for the first time the visiting team admits defeat a survey has been carried out and its been discovered that i am the only prisoner on the block who purchases bottled water from the canteen so like the rest of us says darren if you want more water youll have to turn on the tap however adds sergio now that im number one on the hotplate he pauses you will be able to have an extra carton of milk from time to time what more could a man ask for pm i read over todays script in my silent cell and when ive finished editing i place the six pages in one of my new drawers every ten days the sheets are transferred to a large brown envelope words and sent off to alison to type up i settle down on my bed to watch a touch of frost david jason is as consistent as ever but the script is too flimsy to sustain itself for two hours so i switch off the television and for the first time in ten days also the light climb into my single bed and sleep goodbye window warriors may i never hear from you again day thursday august am i wake depressed about two matters when i phoned mary last night she told me that the red cross have asked kpmg to audit the simple truth campaign because some of their larger donors have been making waves and they want to dose the subject once and for all tony mortonhooper wrote to the police pointing out that this internal audit has nothing to do with my involvement with the campaign mary and tony are doing everything they can to get the police to admit that the whole enquiry is a farce and that ms nicholsons accusations were made without a shred of evidence despite their efforts i have a feeling the police will not close their enquiry until theyve considered his report so it could now be months before my dcat is reinstated im also depressed because the tory party seems to have broken out into civil war with margaret thatcher saying it will be a disaster if ken clarke wins and john major declaring that if ids becomes leader well be in opposition for another decade six years so far am i write for two hours am after breakfast darren picks up my laundry and warns me that the tumble dryer is still not functioning am banged up for another two hours because the staff are having their fortnightly training session in the gym im told their activities range from firstaid lessons to selfdefence secure and protect from checking through the latest home office regulations to any race relations problems plus fire training hiv reports and likely suicide candidates one good thing about all this is that the tax payer is saved having to fund my pottery class ps am i watch nassar hussain lose the toss for the fourteenth time in a row i must ask mary what the odds are against that i walk out into the exercise yard just before the gates are closed at five past eleven jimmy points to mario not his real name who is walking a few paces ahead of us i hope you can recall marios scam while working on the hotplate he stole almost all the cheese he then made welsh rarebit at a phonecard for two using an iron as the toaster mario was caught creaming off nearly half a million a year from his fashionable london restaurant without bothering to pay any tax on his windfall although i have never frequented marios establishment i know it by reputation there can be no doubt of the restaurants success because it was one of those rare places that do not accept credit cards only cash or cheques while we stroll round the yard marios not into power walking he explains that approximately half of his income was in cash the rest cheques or accounts however the taxman had no way of finding out what actual percentage was cash until two tax inspectors visited the restaurant as diners from careful observation they concluded that nearly half the customers were paying cash whereas marios tax return showed a mere per cent settled the bill this way but how could they prove it the inspectors paid cash themselves and requested a receipt what they couldnt know was that mario declared all the bills where the customer asked for a receipt which he then entered in his books bills for which no receipts were given were destroyed and the cash then pocketed the taxmen couldnt become regular customers their masters wouldnt allow such an extravagance and were therefore unable to prove any wrongdoing that was until a young newly qualified accountant joined the inland revenue and came up with an ingenious idea as to how to ensnare mario the freshfaced youth found out which laundry the restaurant used and over the next three months had the tablecloths and napkins counted there were per cent more tablecloths than bills and per cent more napkins than customers mario was arrested and charged with falsifying his accounts he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to two years he will be returning to his restaurant later this year having in answer to customers enquiries taken a sabbatical in his native florence theyve got it all wrong jeffrey mario says the likes of you and me shouldnt be in jail mixing with all this riffraff they should have fined me a million pounds not paid out thirtyfive thousand to accommodate me for a year my regulars are livid with the police the courts and the inland revenue his final words are by the way jeffrey do you like buck rarebit noon lunch among the many things mario briefed me on was how to select the best daily dish from the weekly menu you must only choose dishes that are made with fresh ingredients grown on the premises and not bought in as from next week there will be variations from my usual vegetarian fare pm i read the morning papers margaret and john have placed their cutlasses back in their sheaths and both have fallen silent for the time being the press are describing the leadership contest as the most acrimonious in living memory and one from which the party may never recover reading this page a couple of years after the event will give us all the benefit of hindsight is it possible that the party that governed for the longest period of time during the twentieth century will not hold office in the twentyfirst or will tony blair suddenly look fallible pm gym its the overfifties spinning session nothing to do with politics dont kid yourself its agony fortyfive minutes with an instructor shouting on the straight up the slope hill climbing taster faster i fall off the bike at four oclock and darren almost carries me back to my cell pm australia are for and looking as if they could score i leave the cricket to get some loo paper from the store this must be collected between am or pm one roll per person per week as i come out of the store room i notice my name is chalked up on the blackboard to see the so i go straight to mr meanwells office he has several registered letters for me including one from some ladies in northampton who have sent me a lavender cake im afraid youre not allowed to have it until you move prisons or have completed your sentence mr meanwell explains why not i ask it could be laced with alcohol or drugs he tells me as i leave the sos office i spot a new prisoner with his right arm in a sling i go over to have a chat injuries usually mean stories was he in a fight was he hit by a prison officer did he fall or was he pushed it turns out to be an attempted suicide he shows me his wrist which displays three long jagged scars forming a triangle which have been sewn up like a rough tear in a turkish carpet i stare for about a second at the crude mauve scars before i have to turn away later im relieved to discover that jimmy reacted in the same way though he tells me that if you really want to kill yourself you dont cut across the artery you only do that when youre looking for sympathy he adds because the screws will always get there in time but one long slash up the arm will sever the artery and youh die long before they can reach you nevertheless i say thats some cry for help yes his father had a heart attack last week and hes just arrived back from the funeral how many suicides have there been at wayland while youve been here i ask jimmy there was one about six weeks ago he replies youll always know when one takes place because were banged up for the rest of the day no one is allowed to leave their cell until the body has been removed from the prison then an initial report has to be written and because so many officers become involved including the governor it never takes less than three hours this prisons pretty good he adds we only get about one suicide a year in norwich where i began my sentence it was far higher more like one a month we even had a prisoner sitting up on the roof with a noose round his neck saying hed jump unless the governor dealt with his complaint did he jump no they gave in and agreed to let him attend his mothers funeral but why didnt they agree to that in the first place because last time they let him out he flattened a screw with one punch and tried to escape so the governor gave in no the governor refused to see him but he did allow the prisoner to attend the funeral doublecuffed doublecuffed first they cross the prisoners wrists before handcuffing him then they handcuff him to two officers with two separate pairs of handcuffs one on either side thank god they didnt do that to me when i attended my mothers funeral its an irony that an hour later when going through my mail i find a razorblade paper attached to the top of one of my letters with the message just in case youve had enough the blade itself had been removed by an officer pm exercise shaun forgery has begun to work on an outline drawing of the montage his first model is dale wounding with intent who is standing on the grass in the sun arms folded not a natural model see plate section dale scowls as we pass him while a few of the other prisoners shout obscenities pm nothing worth watching on television so i finish graham greenes the man within pm i remove the newly washed clothes from all over my bed where i had laid them out to dry they are still wet so i hang them from every other available space cupboard doors the sink my chair even the curtain rail i fall asleep still worrying about the kpmg report and how long it will take for the police to agree that there is no case to answer by the time you read this wayland will be a thing of the past but for now it remains purgatory day friday august am i draw my newly acquired curtains to allow the rising sun to enter my cell i discovered during exercise yesterday evening that they used to belong to dennis vat fraud no one knows how much of the per cent he retained for himself but as he was sentenced to six years we have to assume it was several millions dennis applied for parole after two and a half years having been a model prisoner he heard nothing so assumed that his request had been turned down yesterday at am they opened his cell door and told him to pack his belongings he was being released within the hour the order had come from the home office the week before but as his probation officer was on leave no message had got through dennis had to borrow a phonecard against prison regulations to ask his wife to come and pick him up he caught her just as she was leaving for work otherwise he would have been standing outside the gates all day that is how i inherited the fine net curtains which now adorn my cell and when i leave they will be passed on to the new resident i just hope im given a little more notice jimmy was also let out yesterday but only for the day he has just a few weeks left to serve before his release date so they allow him out once a month on a town visit from am to pm this is part of the rehabilitation programme for any dcat prisoner jimmy has been a dcat but resident in a ccat prison for over three months he doesnt want to move to an open prison because hes coming to the end of his sentence and his family lives locally yesterday jimmy visited dereham he was accompanied by an officer who for reasons that will become clear i shall not name at lunchtime the officer gave jimmy a fiver to buy them both some fish and chips dereham prices while he went to the bank to cash a cheque jimmy collected the fish and chips strolled over to the national westminster and waited outside for the officer when he didnt appear jimmy began lunch without him after the last chip had been devoured jimmy began to worry about what had happened to his guard he went into the bank but couldnt see him so ran out and quickly headed towards lloyds tsb a hundred yards away as he turned the corner he saw the officer running down the street towards him an anxious look on his face the two men fell into each others arms laughing jimmy didnt want to be accused of trying to escape only six weeks before his release date and the officer would have been sacked for giving a prisoner money to assist in that escape jimmy told me later that hes never seen a more relieved man in his life where are my fish and chips demanded the officer once he had recovered i had to eat them guv jimmy explained otherwise yours would have gone cold he handed over fifty pence change am after breakfast i go in search of stan embezzler ps eighteen months the spur painter i ask him if hed be kind enough to come and look at my cell and see if he can recommend any way of brightening it up i tell him i hate the white door and the black square around the basin and the black floor skirting ill see what i can do he says but i cant promise much we only get colours that have been discontinued or the ones no one else wants am pottery i fear this enterprise has proved to be a mistake i simply dont have any talent with clay im going to ask wendy if i can be transferred to the library or education the sun told its readers yesterday that i had applied to take denniss of curtain fame job in the library i didnt even know he worked in the library but now the sun has put the idea in my head ill ask steve conspiring to murder head librarian if theres a vacancy meanwhile i go off to pottery and waste two hours talking to shaun forgery to be fair it wasnt a complete waste of time because he brought me up to date on his progress with the book cover and the montage of prisoners see plate section i also discover more about his crime what i hadnt appreciated was that the forged john lewis gift vouchers were not used simply to purchase articles from the store oh no shaun is far brighter than that he discovered that if you buy an item and present your gift voucher the assistant will hand back the change in cash shaun also found out that if you purchase something for ps and he saw chris eubank buying a television with genuine vouchers and return the item an hour later they dont reimburse you with vouchers once again they hand over cash armed with this information shaun acquired a map of england kindly supplied by a helpful assistant showing every john lewis outlet in the country he then began to travel the land cashing vouchers in each town he passed through he was finally caught when his coconspirator panicked went to the police and grassed on him shauns words i wonder what shaun will turn his mind to once hes released i only mention this because when the conversation changed to the clash between ken clarke and iain duncan smith shaun added a piece of knowledge to the euro debate which neither of the candidates seems to have grasped have you ever seen a euro note shaun asked no i havent i admitted its monopoly money and will be quite easy to reproduce from january it will be legal tender in seventeen countries across europe and ill bet most of the shops dont have any way of identifying a fake someones going to make a fortune i recall that shaun has only three more weeks of his sentence to serve am i return to my cell and find i have a beige door a neat blue square around my basin and cream skirting i go in search of stan and present him with a phonecard value ps worth inestimable am i call paula alison is on holiday and discover to my great relief that the last ten days text of this script have arrived it doesnt bear thinking about having to rewrite those words you may well ask why i didnt make a copy because there isnt a copier available then why dont i hand the papers over to my wife after a visit because its against the regulations my only chance is to rely on the post office and it hasnt let me down yet noon lunch i mournfully watch the test match while eating my vegetable soup australia are piling on the runs at a rate of four an over pm exercise jimmy is chatting about his girlfriends and dont forget this is a man who had three women come to see him at his last visit at some time he tells me hes slept with all three of them not at the same time hes not kinky just healthy and whats more they didnt leave scratching each others eyes out nevertheless this brings me on to a taboo subject i havent yet mentioned sex or the lack of it unless you are a homosexual darren reminds us that in sweden and holland they allow conjugal visits which i cant see happening in this country for many years the current solution is to put a notice on the message board see opposite and hope the problem will go away it will be interesting to see which comes first the legalization of cannabis or conjugal visits offensive and obscene material statement of policy at hmp wayland we feel that it is important that we provide an environment within which visitors staff and prisoners are able to work and visit without being caused offence by the display of any material our aim is to ensure that the dignity of all staff visitors and prisoners is respected it is the duty of all staff to help to ensure that our environment remains free from the display of potentially offensive material therefore the public display of any material that is potentially offensive will not be permitted in any part of the prison types of material that will be restricted any sexually explicit material eg magazines of a pornographic nature which are available from newsagents will be allowed in possession but must not be on display page type pictures can be placed on prisoners noticeboards but pictures showing full nudity cannot photographs artwork and other material may be displayed on noticeboards providing it conforms to the criteria outlined above all managers have a duty to ensure that their areas remain free from the display of any potentially offensive material this applies to all areas including offices rest rooms and other staff only areas after two weeks of walking round the perimeter of wayland prison i can now spot evil fear helplessness and sadness at thirty paces but even i am puzzled by a crouching man who always sits alone in the same place every day huddled up against the fence he cant be much more than thirty perhaps thirtyfive and he rarely moves from his solitary position i ask darren about him tragic he says alistair is one of your lot public school followed by university where he graduated as a heroin addict if he doesnt kick the habit hell be in prison for the rest of his life how can that be possible i ask simple he regularly gets caught injecting himself and always ends up with a few more months being added to his sentence in fact even on the day he was sent down he was found with a needle in his arm somehow and it must have been before the judge passed sentence or soon after he was taken down he managed to stuff a needle covered in cellophane a plunger and ten grams of heroin wrapped in a condom up his backside he then took a laxative so that he could empty his bowels as soon as he arrived at belmarsh once theyd banged him up that evening and dont forget theres a lavatory in every cell he injected himself with heroin and passed out at the nine oclock flap check the night officer found him lying on the floor with a needle stuck in his arm and several grams of heroin sprinkled on the floor beside him he must be one of the few prisoners who has managed to have time added to his sentence before breakfast the following morning i look at the tragic hunchedup figure and wonder if prison is the right answer pm supper i cant remember what i eat but i do recall finding two extra cartons of milk on my window sill sergio is exercising his authority as the new no on the hotplate day saturday august bien graciasy to no tu tu tu tu tu tu bueno we must meet later today sergio adds for another lesson at least ten prisoners standing in the queue and three officers behind the hotplate assume i am simply learning spanish as we have no wish for them to find out what were really up to but more of that later am i wake and think about how i would be spending the august bank holiday weekend if i were not in prison i also begin to consider whether there are any advantages to being in jail certainly incarceration is something to be added to ones experiences particularly as it has come at a period in life when i felt i was marking time ive also had to stretch myself unfortunate pun but ive already reached a stage where i am gaining little from the experience as i could be stuck here for a while longer it might be wise to have an escape plan escape of the mind ive already completed belmarsh hell and have penned words of wayland purgatory i cant wait to get to heaven whenever and wherever that might be am buenos dias i say to sergio as he passes me a boiled egg and a slice of toast buenos dias he repeats como estas tu i concentrate yo estoy bien gracias bien gracias y tu am gym i complete a full programme for the first time since being convicted ive lost over half a stone and feel a lot fitter im about to take a shower when mr king tells me that the governor wants a word ive so far seen three people who claim the title of governor and none of them has been ms cawley the no governor am i about to meet her no on this occasion its a mr greenacre whom ive also never come across before he informs me you will be receiving a visit from a senior officer at belmarsh surely they cant be sending me back there is my first reaction as they are investigating the theft of a chapter of your book you will recall that trevor kavanagh of the sun doyen of political editors returned those stolen seven pages to mary he is well aware of the law of copyright it is clear that the culprit must have been an officer as no prisoners at belmarsh have access to a photocopier no one else could have unlocked my cell door removed the script photocopied and returned it and then sent a copy on to the sun of course the deputy governor is only going through the motions they have no way of finding out which officer was hoping to make a quick buck the problem the prison service is facing is that trevor will never reveal his source back to the visitor from belmarsh mr greenacre tells me to expect a senior security officer to interview me on tuesday morning which means that with luck ill miss pottery ill brief you fully next tuesday am exercise my legs are still aching from the gym session so i find it quite hard to maintain the pace of jimmy twentynine and darren thirtyfive as they march round the perimeter of the jail but im damned if im going to admit it they are chatting away about an unusual use of mirrors every cell has a fivebyfiveinch steel mirror screwed to the wall jimmy is telling us about two west indian prisoners who between them raised enough money to purchase a ghetto blaster and a pair of loud speakers he describes how they went about arranging to listen to the same music in two different cells the first prisoner levered his thin steel mirror off the wall and inserted a coil of wire through one of the tiny holes in a corner every evening after the nine oclock flap check he would slip the mirror under his door then in one movement slide it across the corridor until it reached the door opposite after a few days he could perform this skill as proficiently as any basketball player dunking a ball through a hoop the second prisoner then took the wire and attached it to his speaker so that both men could listen to the same music emanating from one source ingenious but im told by anyone who lived within a mile of the jail unnecessary because on a still evening you could have danced to the music in freiston town hall noon lunch england are for and putting up a spirited fight during the lunch interval i visit sergio in his cell he wastes no words immediately informing me that he has spoken to his brother in bogota he always sounds like a man who has only ten units left on his phonecard of course he may turn out to be a con man who has no intention of trying to find a botero in any case nothing can be done until sergio has completed his sentence he is due to be deported on september a month from today by which time we expect to have worked out a plan to purchase a botero win or lose ill keep you briefed pm i have my hair cut by matt arson for insurance failed to convince cornhill or the jury and was sentenced to three years matt has the reputation of being the best barber in the prison in fact several prison officers also have their hair cut by him in his last prison while serving time for a previous offence matt enrolled on a hairstyling course so now hes a semiprofessional he has all the proper equipment and within moments of sitting on a chair in the corridor outside his cell im in no doubt about his skill i need to look neat and tidy for friday when mary and william hope to visit me again i havent forgotten that mary commented on the length of my hair when she last came to wayland when matts finished the job he even produces a second mirror so i can see the back of my head hes not daniel hersheson but for ten units of a phonecard hes a pretty good imitation pm at close of play england are for after a gritty not out by ramprakash assisted by gough who was clinging in there helping to avoid another follow on the two of them enter the pavilion needing another runs to make australia bat again a couple of years ago darren gough asked me to conduct the auction at his london testimonial dinner at the dorchester as a huge fan of darrens i happily agreed when the event finally materialized it fell in the middle of my trial mr justice potts made it clear to my silk that i should not honour the agreement even though my name was already printed in the programme after all it might influence the jury into believing that i am a charitable man and i suspect that was the last thing mr justice potts would have wanted im feeling pretty low so decide to use the other ten units left on my card to phone mary theres no response i cant get in touch with william or james as they are both abroad i sit on the end of my bed and recall the words of la rochefoucauld absence diminishes mediocre passions and increases great ones as the wind extinguishes candles and fans fire day sunday august am sunday is always the longest day in prison wayland is shortstaffed and there is nothing for inmates to do other than watch walltowall television in belmarsh chapel was a respite as it got you out of your cell but in wayland youre out of your cell without anything to keep you occupied mind you id much rather be in wayland than locked up in belmarsh for twentytwo hours a day i write for a couple of hours am breakfast while im waiting in the queue for the hotplate i get talking to a west indian who is on my landing he asks if he can have my times and sunday times when ive finished with them i agree to his request if in return he will show me how to clean my cell floor i only mention this because the west indians keep the cleanest cells they are not satisfied with sweeping out the dust and dirt but spend hours buffing up the linoleum floor until you can see your face in it although i shower shave and put on fresh clothes every day as well as make my bed and have everything in place before the cell door is opened at am i never look as smart or have as clean a cell as any of the west indians on my spur am on my way to the library i slip in behind a man who frightens me he has an evil face and is one of those prisoners who is proud to describe himself as a career criminal he is a burglar by profession and im somewhat surprised to see him heading off towards the library with a pile of glossy coffeetable books under his arm i try to make out the titles on the spines while were on the move the encyclopaedia of antiques know your antiques and antiques in a modem market are you interested in antiques i ask innocently yeah im making a careful study of them are you hoping to work in the antiques trade when youve completed your sentence i suppose you could say that he replies im sick of nicking em only to find out theyre fuckin worthless from now on ill know what to fuckin look for wont i you would think that after five weeks of mixing with criminals night and day i couldnt still be taken by surprise it serves to remind me again of lisa dadas words about despising burglars not to mention my own naivety am in the library i get talking to an older prisoner called ron abh most inmates tell me they never want to return to prison especially the older ones who have served long sentences but time and again theyll add the rider that doesnt mean i wont jeff getting a job when you have a criminal record is virtually impossible so you stay on the dole until you slip back into a life of crime its a vicious circle for those who leave prison with their statutory ps nfa no fixed abode and little prospect of work i dont know the answer although i accept there is little you can do for people who are genuinely evil and not much for those who are congenitally stupid but the firstoffence prisoners who want a second chance often leave prison only to find that for the rest of their lives the work door is slammed in their face i accept that perhaps only around per cent of prisoners would be worth special treatment but i would like to see someone come up with a solution for this particular group especially the firsttime offenders and how many of you reading this diary can honestly say youve never committed a crime for example a smoked cannabis million crack cocaine heroin b stolen something anything c fiddled your expenses d taken a bus or train and not paid for the ticket e not declared your full income to the taxman f been over the alcohol limit when driving g driven a vehicle without tax or insurance h brought in something from abroad and not paid import tax i have recently discovered that those very people who commit such crimes often turn out to be the most sanctimonious hypocrites including one leading newspaper editor its the truly honest people who go on treating one decently as ive found from the thousands of letters ive received from the general public over the past few weeks am chapel were back to a congregation of eleven the service is holy communion and im not sure i care for the modern version i must be getting old or at least oldfashioned the service is conducted by john framlington resplendent in a long white robe to go with his white beard and head of white hair he must be well into his seventies and he looks like a prophet a local salvation army officer preaches the sermon with the theme that we all make mistakes but that does not mean that we cannot be saved once he has delivered his message he joins john to dispense the bread and wine to his little flock during the singing of the last hymn john walks off down the aisle and disappears we are all left literally standing not quite sure what to do next a female face peeps out from behind the organ and decides to continue playing this brave little gesture is rewarded by everyone repeating the last verse when weve delivered the final line of o blessed jesu save us john comes running back down the aisle he turns to face his congregation apologizes blesses us and then disappears for a second time hes a good man and its generous of him still to be giving his time every sunday for such a motley crew as us am when i return to my spur after chapel i find that it has been locked off and we are unable to get into our cells a small crowd is gathering at the entrance of the spur and i am informed by darren that our cells are being searched for phonecards it seems that one of the prisoners has shaved off the silver lining on the top of his card as this allows him to have a longer period for each unit not a great crime you might consider remembering that were in a den of thieves but what you wont realize is that the next person who makes a phone call will find that bt automatically retrieves those stolen units result the next prisoner will be robbed blind the next inmate on the phone that morning turned out to be a voluble west indian called carl gbh who when his last ten units were gobbled up in seconds never stopped effing and blinding all the way to the pos office the spur was closed down in seconds and carl had unwittingly given the prison search team an excuse to go through everyones personal belongings when the gate to the cells is eventually unlocked a team of three officers comes out carrying a sackful of swag my bet is that the offending phonecard is not among their trophies but several other illicit goods are i return to my cell to find that nothing of mine has been touched even my script lies in exactly the same place as i left it i take this as a compliment noon lunch england have progressed to for but the ominously dark clouds that appear over wayland are also it seems unpaid visitors at the oval i turn my attention to the sunday papers the sunday mirror that bastion of accuracy tells its readers that i defended myself from another inmate with a cricket bat i gave you a full ballbyball summary of that match and the only thing i tried to threaten and not very successfully was the ball the article then goes on to say that i am paying protection money to a prisoner called matthew mcmahon there is no inmate at wayland called matthew mcmahon they add that payment is made with ps phonecards there are no ps phonecards the funny thing is that some inmates are shocked by this they had assumed the papers reported accurately and it wasnt until i took up residence that they realized how inaccurate the press can be pm exercise we are allowed out for an hour rather than fortyfive minutes which is a welcome bonus as we walk round i get teased by a lot of prisoners who say they are willing to protect me if ill give them a ps phonecard some ask how come you have a ps phonecard when the rest of us only have ps phonecards others add that i can hit them with my cricket bat whenever i want to i confess that this wouldnt be so amusing if jimmy and darren were not accompanying me certainly being the butt of everyones humour inside as well as outside begins to tell on one jimmy has also read the story in the sunday mirror and what worries him is who to believe in the latest row between ken clarke and iain duncan smith concerning immigration i tell jimmy that only one thing is certain although the result of the leadership election will not be announced for another two weeks september per cent of the electorate have cast their votes and i assure him that ids is already the next leader of the tory party can i risk a bet on that asks darren yes if you can find anyone stupid enough to take your wager the spur bookie is offering on duncan smith those are still good odds because you cant lose unless he drops down dead the bookie or iain duncan smith asks jimmy either i reply good says darren then ill put three mars bars on duncan smith as soon as we get back to the spur pm i visit sergio in his cell to be given a lesson on emeralds ill let you know why later sergio takes his time telling me that emeralds are to colombia what diamonds are to south africa when hes finished his tutorial i ask him if it would be possible for his brother to find an emerald of the highest quality he looks puzzled what sort of price do you have in mind he asks around ten thousand dollars i tell him he nods ill see what i can do he looks at his watch and adds ill speak to my brother immediately pm sunday supper is always a bag of crisps and a lemon mousse however this evening we are offered two lemon mousses because i note the sellby date on the lid is august pm at last theres something worth watching on television victoria and albert with a cast to kill for nigel hawthorne diana rigg peter ustinov jonathan pryce david suchet john wood and richard briers it only serves to remind me how much i miss live theatre though at times i feel im getting enough drama at the theatre royal wayland day monday august am forty days and forty nights and like our lord i feel its time to come out of the wilderness and get on with some work despite the fact its a bank holiday i write for two hours am breakfast corn pops for a change uht milk a slice of bread and marmalade i stare at the golly on the jar i read yesterday in one of the papers that hes no longer politically correct and will be replaced by a character created by roald dahl and illustrated by quentin blake i like golly hes been a friend for years as a man without an ounce of prejudice in him i am bound to say i think the world has gone mad am i call mary who is furious with the home office winston churchill has written to the home secretary david blunkett asking why im still in a category c jail and winston has received a reply from stephen harrison david blunketts private secretary suggesting that lady archer is satisfied that this is the best that can be hoped for home office officials obviously dont listen to the today programme or read any newspapers it doesnt augur well for justice being done to those prisoners who do not have a supportive family mary will write to martin narey today and put the record straight my solicitor has not yet received a reply from dcs perry perhaps hes still on holiday shes also written to the governor of wayland also no reply thank god im not locked up in russia now im no longer on the induction spur im allowed to have my own plate bowl and mug mary promises to dispatch all three today i cant wait to be rid of the grey plastic set even if they wont allow me to replace the plastic knife fork and spoon mary tells me that the letters of support are still pouring in and says shell send a selection for me to read plus a list of friends who want to visit me in prison she confirms that she and william are hoping to visit me on friday am a block are playing c block at football and jimmy captain of everything asks if id like to be linesman knowing it will get me out of my cell for at least an hour how considerate i tell him but i dont know the rules and i feel sure that theres more to it than just putting your flag in the air when the ball goes out fortunately one of our reserves is fully proficient in the laws of the game and runs up and down the line behind me making me look quite competent the first player i have to adjudicate offside is jimmy who makes no protest and immediately raises his arm the true character of a person cannot be hidden on a playing field by halftime we are two down however in the second half we pull one back and just before the final whistle carl gbh phonecard problem thumps in a blinder from twenty yards to level the score as he is in the next cell to me i can expect several graphic replays in the corridor with the yardage becoming longer by the day pm lunch toadinthehole vegetarian sausage and peas pm exercise weve managed about two circuits when darren jimmy and i are joined by what can only be described as a gang of yobs whose leader is a stockily built youth of about five foot six with two rings in his nose and one in each ear from what i can see of his neck arms and chest it doesnt look as if theres anywhere left on his body to needle another tattoo as soon as he opens his mouth every other word is fuckingthis and fuckingthat im no longer shocked by this but i am surprised by the smell of alcohol on his breath my usual approach when faced with this situation is to answer any question quietly and courteously ive heard enough stories about prisoners being knifed in the yard over the slightest provocation to do otherwise but as there are no questions just abuse hurled at me and my wife theres not much i can say in reply jimmy and darren close in not a good sign but after another circuit the young thug and his gang of four back off and go and sit against the fence and glare at us the home office could do worse than invite darren to sit on one of their committees and advise them on prison policy he is after all far better informed than stephen harrison and therefore the home secretary after a spell in borstal and two terms in prison darren would be a considerable asset to the drugs debate he adds that when he was first sent to jail some fifteen years ago about per cent of prisoners smoked cannabis and only about per cent were on heroin and today i ask around twenty to thirty per cent are still on cannabis with approximately the same percentage if not more on heroin and while the present regulations are in place theres no hope of dealing with the problem only last week a prisoner out on his first town visit returned with five hundred pounds worth of heroin stuffed up his backside and every addict in the prison knew about his cache within the hour they were if they could afford it smoking and jabbing themselves all night but surely the prisoner in question not to mention his customers will be caught the drugs unit interviewed him the following morning they couldnt prove anything but its the last town visit hell make before hes released on the grounds of reasonable suspicion more fool him says jimmy who goes out on a town visit once a month some of them will do anything the group of yobs decide to rejoin us so i have to face another barrage of abuse i sometimes wish mr justice potts could do just one circuit with me but its too late my case was his last and he was clearly determined to go out with a bang when were called back in im not unhappy to return to the peace and safety of my cell pm sergio turns up to tell me the details of a conversation hes had with his brother in bogota tomorrow my brother will travel to the green mountains and select an emerald declares sergio he will then have it valued and insured he will also send one gold necklace carat they sell at a tenth of the price they charge in england i assure him that if i decide to buy it i will make a payment direct to bis bank the day after he has been deported this means he has to put a great deal of trust in me which he seems happy to do he accepts that the transaction cannot take place while both of us are still in jail if hes successful ill have more confidence in his claim that he can produce a botero at a sensible price pm darren lends me his copy of the prisons handbook a sort of relais chateaux guide of jails in england and wales i accept mr meanwells opinion that once my dcat has been reinstated i should apply for spring hill in buckinghamshire which is the bestlocated open prison for both london and cambridge pm darren and i play a couple of games of backgammon and im thankful to have found something i can beat him at he takes revenge by completing the times crossword before supper pm supper beans on toast and an extra lemon mousse stamped with yesterdays sellby date pm i watch the concluding episode of victoria and albert every moment of which i thoroughly enjoy day tuesday august am i write for two hours am breakfast its shredded wheat again eat one save one am pottery i take my new book arts and artists along to my class to while away the twohour period it doesnt seem to bother anyone that im not working on a sculpture as long as im studying some medium of art shaun appears to be depressed which could be nothing more than the melancholy of an artist lost in his thoughts after an hour of painting he opens his sketch book to reveal an excellent drawing of a wayland landscape fairly bleak and another of a prison door then he confides why he is so low probation have decided not to let him out two months early on a tag because he failed to appear in court however this twomonth holdup will pose some problems for both of us the quality of the paper pencils pastels and oils that are available at wayland are obviously not up to professional standards so it may become necessary to enlist the help of a member of the art department to purchase the materials he needs shaun will have to select someone who believes in his talent and more importantly he needs to trust me enough to believe i will pay him back after hes been released in november a member of staff tells me later that shaun is the most talented prisoner they have come across since they started working in prisons our conversation is interrupted by a security officer who says im wanted in reception am a senior officer from belmarsh is waiting for me in the room with the comfortable chairs the governor of belmarsh has put her in charge of the investigation into the theft of seven pages of my diary you will recall that trevor kavanagh the surfs political editor handed the script over to mary who in turn passed the seven handwritten pages on to my lawyer the officer tells me that she has been in the prison service for nearly twenty years and adds that she isnt on a whitewash expedition she makes it clear from the outset that the seven pages of script could not have been stolen by a prisoner as they wouldnt have had access to a photocopier she goes even further and admits that they have narrowed the likely culprit down to one of two officers she then hands me a photocopy of my first seven pages and after reading only a few lines i recall how distraught i was at belmarsh i confirm that i had written these pages when i was in the medical centre on my first day but i have no way of knowing when they were removed or returned or by whom i only recall leaving the cell once in the first twentyfour hours and that was for a fortyfiveminute break in the exercise yard she nods as if she not only knows when i left my cell but exactly how many minutes i was out of the room you were then escorted across to b block to begin your induction did you have the script with you at the time yes i posted the pages to my pa every three or four days but not before they were checked by roy the censor who i didnt meet until the third day so it cant have been him no it certainly wasnt roy she replied because the sun received the material the following morning and in any case roys bright enough to understand the law of copyright whoever did this must have been surprised and disappointed that the sun wouldnt touch it she leaves after about an hour promising to let me know the outcome of her investigation pm lunch vegetable soup and a chocolate wafer sergio slips me a banana pm in order to make up my five lessons a week i have to attend an education class on a tuesday afternoon the education department is situated next to the library and once ive signed in i report to room one as instructed i enter a classroom containing twenty small desks set out in a ushape facing a teacher her name is ms jocelyn rimmington and she looks as if shes been plucked straight out of an evelyn waugh novel her job is a difficult one and i watch her carry it out with consummate skill and ingenuity she has eight charges including me the prisoner shes talking to is learning basic english so he can take a plumbing exam the inmate on his right is reading chaucer as part of an a level course and on his left is an inmate who is learning to read and write the remaining four prisoners are preparing for gcse english ms rimmington moves slowly and methodically from desk to desk answering each and every question thrown at her until she reaches me wendy tells me that youre in the middle of writing another book yes i am i reply and she thinks the best thing would be for you to carry on with it until we decide what to do with you i dont demur after all whats the point of telling this charming lady that i would prefer to do something more productive its obvious that either wendy sergeant who is head of the department or those above her lack the imagination of the education department at belmarsh who had me conducting a creative writing class before the end of my first week pm supper i eat very little because the only gym session i can attend today is at six oclock pm gym complete a full session mainly because half the regulars are out playing football today is the final trial before they select the team for the first match on sunday as i cannot be present at lords for the one day final between somerset and leicestershire ill have to settle for wayland versus rap methwold pm after a long press press pressbutton shower return to the cell and dry myself with a mean little rough green towel sergio knocks on the door walks in plonks himself on the end of the bed and without any preamble starts to give me another lecture on emeralds seventy per cent of the worlds emeralds come from colombia he proclaims over twenty thousand stones change hands in bogota every day the emerald is second only in popularity and value to the diamond and its size is measured in the same way carat the very finest stones he continues are known as drops of oil because if you stare into the centre of the stone you can see what appears to be just that we must make sure that ours is at least four carats and that the drop of oil is there for all to see for one stone the price can range according to quality continues sergio from a few hundred dollars to several millions he anticipates the stone his brother selects could be on its way to london as early as next week because sergio went to the same school as the niece of the owner of the mountain he hopes his brother will be able to deal direct cutting out any middlemen as his brother doesnt know that sergio is ensconced in an english jail i wonder why he isnt puzzled by the fact that he cant call back i dont ask pm pottery followed by an interview with the lady from belmarsh followed by education followed by the gym followed by sergio and his lecture on emeralds interspersed with three writing sessions im exhausted i fall asleep fully dressed during the ten oclock news when i wake its just after eleven i undress use the loo climb into my tiny bed and fall asleep a second time day wednesday august am i have now undergone the same threeweek induction cycle at hmp wayland as i did at belmarsh my routine compared with my life outside is far more regimented conforming to a daily pattern and then a weekly one so i have decided as from today to comment only on highlights rather than simply repeat the numbing routine with which you must now be familiar am i write for two hours and then eat the other shredded wheat covered in milk supplied by sergio am paul one of the tutors brings in a set of slides to the art class and gives us a lecture on the impressionists i am stunned that shaun such a talented artist has never heard of pissarro or sisley he also admits that he has visited a gallery only two or three times in his life the slide show is so popular with the other prisoners that paul promises to bring in examples of other artists next week when he will introduce us to magritte rothko and warhol amongst others noon after lunch i go to the gym when ive finished my programme i jump on the scales to discover that im still losing weight nearly a stone since ive been in prison just as im leaving the football coach calls me into his office and asks if i would attend the first fixture of the season on sunday and write a match report for the prison magazine i readily agree only relieved he didnt invite me to play pm sergio joins me in my cell to tell me the latest on the emerald hunt before continuing with his tutorial the majority of emeralds mined in colombia come from one mountain that has been owned by the same family for generations most of the stones that come out of colombia are exported to japan but sergio is hoping when he returns to bogota to start diverting some of these gems to europe he is becoming more ambitious every day he also informs me that trading in emeralds is every bit as dangerous as dealing in drugs every day eight helicopters fly back and forth from the mountain to bogota airport with four armed guards on each and another twenty private police waiting for them on the runway on the mountain there are workers and armed guards a peasant his description can earn as much as a year if and he repeats if he is lucky enough to dig up any highquality gems but what about theft i ask how do they deal with that one or two of the workers are stupid enough to consider stealing the odd stone but they quickly discover that there is no judge or jury on the mountain so how do they dispense justice instantly he replies one of the guards shoots the culprit in front of the other workers who then bury him but you could swallow a stone and then sell it in bogota where youve already told me that twenty thousand emeralds change hands in the marketplace every day true sergio replies but you will still be caught because the family has over a hundred spotters in the market night and day if a dealer ever traded with a thief they would immediately be cut off from their source of supply and in time the thief will have to return to the mountain if he hopes to go on trading in any case the workers know they will have a far higher standard of living than their fellow countrymen as long as they remain employed on the mountain but they could take the gems abroad and make a fortune most peasants says sergio have never travelled further than the next village and none of them speaks anything but mountain spanish which even i cant understand even the owner of the mountain can still only converse in his native tongue and would never consider leaving colombia it is only because of my four years in an english jail continues sergio that its now possible for me to act as a gobetween and consider the export business and you now also have an advantage jeffrey because your rivals cannot easily buy or sell paintings from colombia i raise an eyebrow i am being deported in four weeks time and can never return to britain unless i am willing to risk completing the remaining four years of my sentence an enterprising dealer could always fly to bogota not wise says sergio fairhaired blueeyed people are not welcome in bogota and especially not on the mountain he goes on to explain it would be assumed that you are an american and your chances of making it back to the airport would be about as good as a peasant caught stealing no wonder its a closed market my tutorial comes to an end when an officer bellows lock up i run out of sergios cell to return to the real world because i need the five minutes to join the queue and change my sheets pillowcase towels and gym kit dont forget its wednesday and if you dont get to the laundry room before they close you have to wait another week pm when i get back to my cell i find a biography of oscar wilde by sheridan morley awaiting me on my bed i had asked steve conspiracy to murder chief librarian to reserve this book for me nothing like a personal delivery service i become so engrossed in wildes life that i miss the ten oclock news i have reached oscars first trial by the time i put the book down i must save the second trial for tomorrow night not a bad day but please dont think even for one moment that its therefore been a good one day thursday august am i arrive for my pottery class to find its been cancelled because the teacher hasnt turned up shaun tells me this is a regular occurrence and he seems to be the only person who is disappointed because he was hoping to finish a painting it gives me another couple of hours to write while the other prisoners are happy to go off to the gym or their cells while still being paid ps am i hear a cry of library bellowed down the corridor and as ive just come to the end of another chapter of oscar wilde decide to take a break and return arts and artists i now know my way around the library and go straight to the art shelves i select a book entitled legendary gemsby eric bruton and add a novel by robert goddard when i return to my cell i find my laundry is waiting in a neat pile washed and dried i look up to see darren standing on my chair clipping up a new curtain rail let me warn you he says as he climbs back down off the chair you cant hang yourself from a prison curtain rail i hadnt given the idea much thought but why not i ask opening my notebook because it just clips on so if you attached a noose to the rail and then jumped off the chair youd land on the floor wrapped up in your curtain so how can i hang myself i demand you should have done it at your remand prison darren replies im not sure i understand most remand prisons are of a victorian vintage and have highlevel barred windows making the job that much easier but i was only there for a few days there are more hangings in the first few days in jail than at any other time why often the psychological impact of entering prison for the first time causes deep depression and thats when a prisoner sees suicide as the only way out so its less common once youve been transferred yes but i knew a prisoner who still found an original way to kill himself i continue to scribble away he was in a cell with a oneup and onedown and when his roommate went to work and he was left alone for the rest of the morning he stood the bed up on its end so that the rail was about seven feet from the ground he used his belt as a noose and attached it to the top railing he then climbed on top placed his hands in the back of his jeans rolled off the bed and hanged himself on the table they found a letter from his girlfriend saying she couldnt wait for three years if you want to kill yourself you can always find a way darren adds matter of factly each year the prison service publishes statistics on how many inmates commit suicide there were ninetytwo in says darren just before he leaves to continue his rounds however what they dont tell you is how many people die or commit suicide within six months of being released i slowly unpack my washing and stack it on the narrow shelves while i consider what darren has just told me pm after lunch i pick up legendary gems and turn to the chapter on emeralds everything sergio has told me during the past ten days is verified by the author which gives me more confidence in sergio however two crucial questions remain does sergio have the right contacts and can he replace the middlemen i am pleased to see that laurence graff warrants three mentions in the diamond chapter to date i havent mentioned laurence graff of graffs of bond street madison avenue and monte carlo but im rather hoping he will agree to value the gem for me laurence and i first met at a charity function many years ago when i was the auctioneer since then he and his wife annemarie have told me many stories about the diamond trade which have found their way into my books it was laurence who gave me the idea for the short story cheap at half the price pm jimmy rushes into my cell with a large grin on his face he scowls at darrens new curtain rail immediately aware of who must have supplied it i am the bearer of glad tidings he says a prisoner on our spur will be leaving tomorrow morning a week earlier than originally planned he keeps the cleanest cell on the block hes even decorated it and best news of all its on the quiet side of the spur so youd better have a word with meanwell before someone else grabs it im just about to go off in search of mr meanwell when jimmy adds hes off today but hes back on tomorrow morning at and dont forget youve got the special needs group at so youd better see him straight after breakfast darren walks in livid to find jimmy sitting on the end of my bed hes obviously picked up the same piece of information and had hoped to be the first to impart it i think youll find my information was as welcome as your curtain rail suggests jimmy smugly only if his lordship ends up getting davids cell says darren well aware that i am playing them against each other still like two children they find the challenge irresistible pm after supper sergio reveals good news having visited the mountain his brother has selected a carat emerald at a cost of if my contact confirms that its shop value is twenty thousand then ill buy it i tell him if not sergio looks up and frowns purchase the emerald i continue and have it sent to london ill need proper certification but if my valuer says he can sell me a stone of the same quality at the same price or cheaper it will all have been a waste of your time and ill return the stone to colombia at my expense my whole reputation rests on this one stone sergio asks youve got it i tell him day friday august am breakfast i eat my cereal out of a china bowl my toast on a plate and drink my milk from a mug mary has selected the plate and bowl from the bridgewater collection and the beaker a garish object covered in the american stars and stripes was a gift will brought back from the states when ive finished my breakfast i fill my washbasin with hot water and fairy liquid allowing my newly acquired treasures to soak while i go off in search of mr meanwell the blocks senior officer has been off for two days so was unaware that david had been released six days early and that his cell on the enhanced wing has suddenly become available hell let me know what hes decided later today i return to my cell and find a gathering of west indians in the corridor theyve come to say farewell to a prisoner who is leaving this morning having served six years of a nineyear sentence for armed robbery his first offence most of you reading this will have already formed a picture of him in your mind as i would have done only a couple of months ago a young black thug whos better off locked up and who will probably beat up some other innocent person the moment hes released and be back in prison within a year in fact he is thirtytwo years old five foot eight slim and goodlooking he was the one who politely asked if he could read my newspapers every evening and he has used his six years productively first to pass his gcses five and two years later a levels in english and history no sooner has he departed than jules appears in the corridor carrying a plastic bag full of his worldly goods he is taking over steves cell he tells me that the past week has not been a happy one because hes had to share our old cell with a heroin addict who was injecting himself two sometimes three times a day am on friday mornings the gym is taken over by the special needs group theyre an enthusiastic bunch who despite their problems bring a range of skills and boundless energy to everything they do les performs well on the rowing machine m in ten minutes while robbie enjoys lifting weights and paul prefers to run but when it comes to the game of catchball that we always play at the end of any session robbie can catch anything that comes his way he could and would happily field in the slips for england all of them are chatterboxes and demand answers to their endless questions do you have a father do you have a mother do you have any brothers or sisters are you married do you have any children by the end of the hours session i am physically and mentally exhausted and full of admiration for their carer ann who spends every waking moment with them at the end of the session i watch them leave chatting laughing and i hope happier there but for the grace of god pm mr nutbourne opens the cell door youre moving again jeffrey he says youve been allocated davids old cell on the enhanced spur he winks thank you i reply and prepare for my ninth move in six weeks the whole process takes less than an hour because on this occasion im assisted by a local removal company darren sergio and jimmy ltd my new cell is on the ground floor with the enhanced prisoners number seventeen is opposite darrens cell who has steve conspiracy to murder and librarian on one side and jimmy ecstasy courier captain of everything on the other the officers describe it as the grownup spur and personally select who will be allowed to reside there to have made it in three weeks is considered quite an achievement although darren managed it in four days the cells are exactly the same size as in any other part of the prison but the table on which im now working is far larger four feet by two i also have an extra cupboard for my possessions which seem to grow as each day passes not unlike when youre on holiday pm once ive completed my move i join darren and sergio for a walk in the exercise yard i stop halfway round to watch shaun sketching dale he is still proving to be a restless model but despite this shaun is producing a good likeness of him pm after supper i call mary my new spur has a phone of its own which any selfrespecting estate agent would describe as an added amenity shes full of news some good some not so good the police confirm that they will not be presenting their report on the simple truth until theyve read the findings of the kpmg report this wont be handed in to the red cross for at least another two perhaps three weeks mary tells me that the police reply to tony mortonhoopers letter was not unhelpful and she hopes that once the kpmg report is finished it will only be a matter of days before they move me to an open prison i use the remainder of my twenty units catching up with all things domestic particularly what is happening at the old vicarage when the phonecard flicks out indicating i have only thirty seconds left i promise to call again on sunday dont forget i no longer have an endless source of cards as soon as i replace the receiver sergio takes over the phone he has the advantage of being able to hold a conversation in a language no one else on the spur can eavesdrop on but the disadvantage of needing at least five phonecards every time he dials home pm when sergio has finished his call he joins me in my cell now that were on the same spur its no longer necessary for me to try and pretend im learning spanish hes just another prisoner from across the corridor sergios brother has selected four emeralds for consideration he confirms they range in price from ten to fifteen thousand dollars once he has made the final choice i will await a valuation from my expert his brother claims that any one of the gems would retail on the london market at around if this proves to be accurate then ill be happy to purchase the selected gem and give it to mary as her christmas present ah youve finally discovered why im going to all this trouble pm to my delight i discover that our spur is unlocked first and banged up last giving us an extra few minutes at each end of the day what i enjoy most about being below stairs is the silence or near silence compared with the floor above no rap music no window warriors and no conversations shouted from one end of the corridor to the other there is actually a feeling of community on this spur i dont bother to turn on the tv this evening as i am totally engrossed in robert goddards caught in the light i fall asleep fully dressed its been an exhausting day day saturday september am the first day of a new month after breakfast i arrange with locke gbh the spur painter to have my new cell redecorated in his spare time as the tariff has to be agreed in tobacco and as i have no idea of the going rate darren marijuana only has agreed to act as my works manager for the transaction once locke has inspected my cell he announces it will first need an undercoat of white which will take him two twohour sessions darren agrees the price on a daily basis tomorrow he will add a coat of cream and on monday the cell door the window ledge and frame plus the square around the wash basin will be painted beige as far as i can work out the painter will receive one pounds worth of golden virginia his choice a day so the whole job will cost me ps which darren assures me is the going rate the paint however will be supplied by her majestys tax payers please note that it was margaret thatcher who taught me never to say government governments dont pay taxes jeffrey only tax payers do locke asks me to vacate my cell while the undercoat is being rolled on because once my bed table and small cupboard have been pulled away from the walls and left in the centre of the room there will only be enough space for one person i cross the corridor to join sergio in his cell where we hold a board meeting overnight sergio has typed out sixteen questions which he needs answered before he speaks to his brother again for example do i want to pay the full insurance cost yes do i want the gold necklace to be or carat carat will i have to pay import tax when the chain and emerald land in london dont know but ill find out once sergio has asked all his questions and written out the answers neatly in spanish we move onto item number two on the agenda ive received a letter from chris beetles who has carried out considerable research into which south american artists have a worldwide market he reports that christies and sothebys have two latin american sales a year both held in new york with the exception of botero who has recently passed million for an oil only lamand tamayo regularly fetches or more under the hammer sergio reads the letter slowly and places it in his file am exercise its darrens turn to be sketched by shaun and hes proving a bit of a prima donna hes a very private man who doesnt keep any photographs of himself hes still grumbling about his participation as we walk out into the yard we are greeted by shaun who is holding a large art pad in his right hand and a couple of pencils in his left darren reluctantly agrees to pose but only on two conditions that the drawing is carried out on the far side of the yard where few inmates will see him during their perambulations he also insists that if he doesnt like the result he will be left out of the final montage i dont have a lot of choice so i agree i can only hope that shaun will make such a good job of the preliminary sketch that darren will be converted to the whole idea jimmy and i go off for a circuit while shaun begins his task while we stroll round the perimeter the talk among the inmates is only of football england are playing germany tonight and wayland are playing methwold tomorrow some of the prisoners tying on the grass against the fence wish jimmy our captain good luck while another suggests that he couldnt score in a brothel by the end of the third circuit a likeness is appearing on shauns sketch pad but i have no way of knowing how darren will react he can be so perverse at times by the time weve completed two more circuits the officers in the yard are beginning to herd us back to our blocks we stop to look at shauns effort darren joins us to see the outline image for the first time its good and he knows it he nods his grudging approval but finally gives the game away when as we stroll back into a block he asks if thats only a sketch before shaun does the final portrait can i have it for my mother see date section noon standing in the lunch queue i discover from dumsday who jimmy told me a few days earlier had adopted an injured crow that his crow died early this morning despite his sitting up all night trying to feed it a boiled egg i return to my cell and eat lunch standing in the middle of the room with the smell of fresh paint all around me i survey my ps investment locke has made a good start pm the spur is getting worked up about the match this evening between england and germany which is a world cup qualifying game i am invited to pull the name of an england player out of a plastic cup and should my selection score the first goal ill win nine mars bars i draw gerard who jimmy assures me has a good chance of scoring i read in this mornings times that england havent won a match on german soil since but i dont pass on this information to a footballmad spur i glance out of my window to see five rabbits eating the leftover food the prisoners have thrown out of their cell as we are hemmed in behind a twentyfoot finemeshed wire fence i wonder how the rabbits get into the prison ill make enquiries pm on a saturday were banged up after supper but as ive mentioned the enhanced spur goes last so we can roam the corridors until six thirty an extra thirty minutes i check my tv listings in the times to find that the football is on bbc but clashes with jane austens persuasion on bbc i elect to watch persuasion while the rest of the spur settles down to follow the match im confident that if england score the whole prison will let me know just as miss elliot meets captain wentworth for the first time the spur erupts with cheering and shouting i quickly switch channels and watch a replay of michael owen scoring for england which means ive lost a mars bar i switch back and continue my vigil with miss elliot who because of her fathers financial problems has had to move from the familys magnificent country home to a smaller residence in bath i become deeply engrossed in the drama of lost love when there is another eruption of cheering i switch over to find england have scored a second goal on the stroke of halftime i discover that the score is in englands favour so i must have missed the german goal it was obviously greeted by my fellow inmates in total silence i turn back to persuasion to find that captain wentworth is flirting the occasional glance with our heroine the one we want him to marry there is another roar i cant believe it and switch across to find our other hero michael owen has scored again and england are now leading three goals to one no sooner have i switched back than there is a further roar so i return to watch a replay of owen completing his hattrick giving england an unbelievable lead i flick over to jane austen and discover that the handsome captain wentworth could be about to marry the wrong girl but then an explosion can it be true i return to bbc to find heskey has scored for england and we now lead five goals to one with ten minutes to go quickly back to persuasion where our hero and longsuffering heroine have become engaged no suggestion of sex not even a kiss long live jane austen pm i finish the robert goddard book and then climb into my bed which is still in the middle of the room i fall asleep to the smell of fresh paint and the sound of my fellow inmates reliving every one of those five england goals day sunday september am after writing for a couple of hours and having breakfast i report to the gym in my new capacity as football correspondent for the prison news the wayland team meet in the changing room where they are handed their kit a light blue shirt dark blue shorts blue socks shin pads and a pair of football boots as with the cricket match last week the team are far better equipped than most amateur club sides and once again all at the tax payers expense all four blocks also have their own strip a blocks is yellow and black i assume this is normal practice for every prison across the country once the team has changed and very smart they look were joined by our coach gary who delivers an unusual team talk because the players have been selected from four different blocks and prisoners come and go every week some of them havent even met before the first thing the eleven men and three subs have to do is to announce their names and the positions theyll be playing in you may well consider that this is an insuperable barrier for any team but not so because the opposition also have several disadvantages to contend with to start with all of waylands fixtures are played at home think about it and the rival team are not allowed to bring along any supporters especially not girlfriends and when it comes to gamesmanship our team are in a class of their own and the officers are just as bad the opposition side are met at the gates by sniffer dogs before being searched the players are then escorted to the changing rooms accompanied by the boos of prisoners from all four blocks and if that isnt enough to contend with they then have to deal with our captain jimmy now jimmy is all charm and bonhomie as he accompanies the opposition side from the changing room onto the pitch but he does consider it nothing less than his duty to inform the visitors that they should keep a wary eye on preston waylands main striker why asks the opposing team captain innocently hes in for a double murder chopped his parents heads off while they were asleep jimmy pauses even we dont like him hes already got a twentyfiveyear sentence and as hes only done three the occasional broken leg doesnt seem to worry him too much especially as hes only likely to get a yellow card the truth is that our main striker is in for breaking and entering rather appropriate but by the time jimmy has reached the pitch the methwold team is convinced that if hannibal lecter were at wayland he would be relegated to the subs bench the first half is a shambles the ball goes up and down the pitch with little speed and even less purpose wayland are trying to get to know each other while methwold still arent sure if they dare risk the occasional tackle its when the whistle blows for halftime and frankly no one deserved to score the second half is a complete contrast as im made aware of the other advantage wayland has fitness all of our team spend at least an hour every day in the gym rather than at the local pub and it begins to show the first goal is headed in by carl gbh after an excellent cross by our doublemurderer the second is scored by dan armed robbery another of our strikers and the third is added by hitch arson we end up winning which augurs well for the rest of the season perhaps we could even win the league cup this year but its back to disadvantages because three of the team including jimmy are due to be released before christmas and the side we will field at the end of the season will bear no resemblance to the one that lined up for the opening encounter despite the teams glorious victory some of the officers are irritated by the fact that theyve been made to hang around until we return for a late lunch with the exception of mr nutbourne who makes sure that the team is fed they cant wait to get us banged up and go off duty the relationship between officers and prisoners is always conducted on a tightrope which both sides walk every day the officers on duty that sunday morning unwisely miss an opportunity to make their own lives easier a few words of praise and allowing an extra minute or two in the shower would have paid huge dividends in the long run instead the victors return to their cells with shrivelledup pieces of meat covered in cold gravy unable to shower until we are unlocked again in two hours time of course i understand that the prison is not run for the convenience of the prisoners but here was an opportunity for the officers to make their own life easier in the long term they botched it with the exception of mr nutbourne who will get far more cooperation and respect from the inmates in the future pm board meeting sergio has talked to his brother in bogota the four emeralds that his brother initially selected have been shortlisted to two and along with a member of the family who owns the mountain sergios brother will make the final selection tomorrow he has also assured him that whichever one they choose the gem would retail at three times the price in a london shop as for paintings sergios school friend has told him that through sergios mother she has made an appointment with boteros mother and will report back by the end of the week my heart leaps at the thought of finally owning a botero pm while i do a circuit with jimmy shaun continues to draw darren who surprisingly now proves unlike dale to be a still and patient model im delighted with the preliminary sketches and more importantly so is darren while shaun is sketching i ask darren about the rabbits the rabbits it seems are no fools they know when the prisoners are fed and burrow under the fence to gather up the food thrown out of the windows by the inmates after lockup they are occasionally joined by a family of ducks but and there is always a but in prison there is also a fox lurking around who is even more cunning he also enters under the fence after lock up and catches the rabbits while they nibble the food dropped from the prisoners table the fox has also worked out that there is no such thing as the wayland hunt i tell shaun that ive spoken to chris beetles and hope that it will result in his being in receipt i select the words carefully of the highest quality drawing paper chalks watercolours and pencils so that his final effort cant be blamed on his tools hes delighted pm early lock up because of staff shortages i will have to remain in my five paces by three cell for the next fourteen hours i start reading jeeves what a different world bertie wooster lived in how would bertie have coped with wayland i suppose jeeves would have volunteered to take his place day monday september am i wake to the smell of fresh paint so i feel i should bring you up to date on my redecoration programme the white undercoat was finished yesterday and while i was at pottery locke gbh spur painter added a coat of magnolia to the walls and beige to the door window ledge and skirting board i have always liked brick as a medium but i find the solid block of white a little unimaginative so during pottery class this morning im going to suggest to shaun that he might design a pattern for the walls and then find out if locke is willing to add interior decorator to his portfolio it may well cost me another couple of pounds but i could then enter my cell for the turner prize am during pottery class shaun begins to knock out a few ideas for a pattern on my walls and very imaginative they are he then produces his sketch pad and shows me his latest ideas for the book cover the first one is a cell door with eyes peeping through the little flap while the second is a prisoners card as displayed outside every cell i wonder if he could somehow combine the two noon after lunch i make notes in preparation for a visit from william james and david my driver of fifteen years once ive done this i have to learn each of the headings by heart as im not allowed to take anything into the visitors room i count how many topics need to be covered william eight james nine david five after that ill have to rely on my memory pm i shower and shave before putting on a new pair of jeans and a freshly ironed bluestriped shirt i have never been vain but i am far too proud to allow the boys to see me looking unkempt and wondering if prison has got the better of me pm as i leave the cell to join my children locke strolls in i havent yet summoned up the courage to tell him about my idea for further redecoration and i suspect ill end up leaving the negotiations to my works manager darren when i arrive in the visitors area i am searched for the first time in over a week but compared to belmarsh this exercise is fairly cursory i dont know if suspected drug addicts and dealers receive different treatment im once again allocated table fourteen where i take my place in the red chair leaving the three blue chairs vacant i look around the room that holds about seventy tables but only five are occupied by prisoners this is because of the breakdown of the prison computer which has thrown the visiting schedule into chaos james is the first through the door surprise surprise followed by william then david once we have completed the hugs and greetings i explain that i wish to allocate the two hours judiciously the first half hour ill spend with william the second with james and the third with david before having the final half hour with all three of them while the other two disappear will updates me on the kpmg report and my dcat reinstatement mary has been in touch with gillian shephard currently my local mp who has promised to contact the governor of wayland and make it clear that once the police have dropped their enquiry i ought to be moved on to an open prison as quickly as possible mind you the prison services idea of as quickly as possible will also reports that he hopes to return to america in about three weeks as he has been offered several new commissions for documentaries to his surprise hes also been approached about some work in london while i try to recall my eight points will briefs me about his mother mary is holding up well in the circumstances but he feels that she has probably been most affected by the whole experience i then ask if will could do three things for me first give chris beetles ps in order that shaun will be in receipt of the art materials he needs second select a bowl and plate from the bridgewater collection and send them to darren at wayland a man whose kindness i will never be able to repay properly finally i ask if he will somehow get hold of my special staedtler liquid pens because will points to the tray in front of me where i see he has slipped two behind a can of diet coke i smile but wonder if i can get the treasure back to my cell without it being confiscated once ive completed my list he brings me up to date on his social life ten minutes later he leaves me and james takes his place i spend some considerable time briefing james on sergios background and explain how three weeks in prison in such intense circumstances is the equivalent of about three months on the outside he nods as hes well aware that this is only background before i broach the real subject having established sergios credentials about which i tell him i have only my instinct to go on we then discuss the subject of emeralds in great detail i explain for an investment of subject to valuation we will acquire one emerald which will arrive in london later this week if sergio turns out to have been honest about the emerald it might then be worth getting him to search for a botero if he doesnt manage to find any paintings i add then the worse case scenario is that mary will end up with a rather special christmas present because james has inherited his mothers brains and my barrowboy instincts theres no need to repeat anything we agree to speak again by phone towards the end of the week i smile across at david and he joins us after a few preliminaries about his wife sue and whether they had a good holiday i can see hes nervous which has always been davids way of telling me something is worrying him i try to make it as easy as possible for both of us are you still thinking of emigrating to australia i ask no he replies much as id like to its near impossible to get on the quota unless you have a job to go to or relatives already living there i suppose ill have a better chance now ive been to prison i suggest before adding so what are you planning to do sue and i are thinking of settling in turkey weve spent our last few holidays there and we like the people the climate and most of all the cost of living so when would you want to leave in a couple of months if thats all right with you boss i smile and tell him thats just fine we shake hands like old friends because thats exactly what we are the four of us spend the last thirty minutes together swapping stories as if i wasnt in jail i think ive made this observation before but if your friends could be in prison with you it would be almost bearable i place the pens will smuggled in into my shirt pocket and just hope im sorry to see the boys leave and its only their absence that reminds me just how much i love them the officer who carries out the search checks my mouth under my tongue makes me take off my shoes and then finishes with a heathrow check i escape which means for the next week ill be able to write with the implement of my choice pm after supper i convene a board meeting in sergios cell the ball is now in your court i tell him youve selected the emerald so were about to discover if youre a serious player or a mountebank he has asked me to use one expression and one word every day that he wont have heard before he immediately looks up mountebank in his spanishenglish dictionary he then stands and formally shakes my hand the ball is now in my court he repeats and youre about to find out that despite the circumstances in which weve met i am not a mountebank i want to believe him day tuesday september am one of the interesting aspects of writing this diary during the day and correcting the script of volume one in the evening is being reminded just how horrendous an experience belmarsh was am pottery paul gives us a lecture with slides on rothko man ray magritte and andy warhol several of the prisoners voice an opinion often heard about modern artists only they put it more bluntly thats fuckin crap why would anyone pay good money for that shit my sevenyearold daughter could knock you up one of those neither of our tutors paul nor anne comments both are professional artists and know only too well that if they could knock up one of those they wouldnt be teaching in prison after the lecture shaun presents me with a pattern for my cell wall unquestionably influenced by magritte its fun but i wonder if locke is capable of reproducing it ill have to discuss the problem with my chef de chantier darren will i really be allowed a sun and moon in my room pm education tuesday afternoon is a bit of a farce i have to attend an education class to make up the statutory number of lessons required by a parttime worker ps a week so end up sitting at the back of the classroom working on this script ive asked wendy sergeant head of the education department if i can teach one lesson a week of creative writing as i did at belmarsh her latest comment on the subject is that the prisoners dont want another inmate teaching them i find this unlikely because at least one inmate a day asks me to read and comment on something theyve written so i wonder what the truth really is i wont bother wendy again as its obvious that someone else has made the decision and she is simply carrying out instructions in future ill just sit at the back of the classroom and continue working for myself pm board meeting sergio reports that hes spoken to his brother again and all the arrangements are in place but he has an anxious look on his face whats the problem i ask im worried about my brother he explains hes a civil servant an academic not used to the way business is carried out in colombia it must have taken a great deal of courage for him to travel to the mountain where no one would give a second thought to killing you for a thousand dollars now we want him to hand over ten thousand in cash and then transport the emerald to the airport without any protection sergio pauses i fear for his life my first thought is that sergio is trying to get off the hook now that hes leaving these shores in a few weeks time what are you suggesting i venture perhaps it would be wiser to wait until i return to bogota then i can handle the problem personally i fear for my brothers life he repeats once sergio is back in bogota i will have lost all contact with him not to mention my ps he has claimed many times during the past three weeks that several prisoners have offered to transfer money to his account in bogota in exchange for a regular supply of drugs but he has always turned them down has he in fact accepted every payment is that account now in surplus thus guaranteeing him an easy life once hes back in colombia however i feel i am left with no choice but to take the high road if youre in any doubt about your brothers safety i tell him lets postpone the sending of the emerald until you return to bogota sergio looks relieved ill call him tomorrow he says and then ill let you know our decision i close the board meeting because given the circumstances theres not a lot more to discuss pm exercise shaun has finished his preliminary sketch of darren and is now making a further attempt at dale as jimmy and i proceed on our usual circuit there isnt a lot of choice we pass a group of three officers who are posted to keep an eye on us one of them is a young not unattractive woman jimmy tells me that she has a bit of a thing about malcolm abh punched a publican who she will miss when hes transferred to his dcat prison on monday the stories i could tell you about malcolm says jimmy yes yes i say my ears pricking up no no says jimmy im not saying a word about that man until im sure hes safely ensconced at latchmere house he flattened that publican with one punch he pauses but ask me again next week day wednesday september pm i watch ian richardson on bbc playing dr bell in a conan doyle drama described in the times as the forerunner to sherlock holmes i will never forget his portrayal of the chief whip in michael dobbs excellent house of cards ive known seven chief whips in my time willie whitelaw francis pym humphrey atkins john wakeham tim renton peter brooke and richard ryder but even their combined talents lacked the machiavellian skills of francis urquhart under whose gaze i certainly wouldnt have dared to miss a vote pm i lie awake thinking about sergio is he a liar just another twobit con man or is he genuinely anxious about his brothers safety only time will tell am locke has finished painting my cell but is nervous about attempting the magritte pattern shaun has designed for the wall darren as works manager agrees that its far too elaborate and should be cut down to about half the original and even then hes not sure ill get away with it but as darren points out the worst they can do is make us return the paintwork to its original colour cost ps so its agreed that while im away at pottery the redecorating will begin and then well have to wait and see how the spur officer reacts am pottery today the class settles down to do a stilllife drawing anne our tutor and former slade graduate has taken a lot of trouble in gathering together objects of interest to make the drawing more of a challenge she has set up in the centre of the room a small card table and placed over it a cloth with a red and white diamond pattern on the table shes placed an empty wine bottle a green vase and a fruit bowl in the bowl shes carefully arranged a bunch of grapes a pineapple three oranges two apples and a peach paul one of our other tutors has supplied a cheese board and a lump of cheddar we all sit round the table in a circle and attempt to draw what we see in front of us keith kidnapper who is sitting next to me will present the piece as part of his alevel submission he understands both perspective and shading i on the other hand do not anne helpfully points out to everyone elses amusement that my peach is bigger than my pineapple after an hour were given a tenminute break when most of the prisoners go off for a quick drag shaun and i disappear with anne into her office to discuss some ideas for a prison landscape which i hope to include in this book i take up as much of her time as possible because i cant face another hour of stilllife drawing however she seems keen to get back and see how the others are progressing anne is a very easygoing person and i cant imagine her losing her temper but when she walks back into the main room and sees the stilllife table she goes berserk all that remains of the original offering is two apple cores the top of a pineapple three orange skins a peach stone a grape stalk with one grape attached and a cheese board with just a few morsels left on it to be fair what is left has been artistically arranged and her pupils are studiously drawing the new composition i burst out laughing and it is only moments before anne joins in i am happy to report that keiths final effort was entered as part of his a level submission and gained high marks for originality pm rugby over fifty prisoners turn out for the first training session of the season which takes place on the main field adjacent to the football pitch for an hour our coach andy harley puts us through passing and handling skills and it soon becomes clear that several prisoners have never played the game before for the last thirty minutes the coach selects two sides for a game of touch rugby which he asks me to referee he tells me that i had refereed him some years before when a newmarket xv visited cambridge because several of the prisoners didnt know the laws of the game i had to be fairly liberal if i wasnt going to have to blow the whistle every few seconds for some minor infringement however i was left with little choice when a large black man threw the ball twenty yards forward as if he were playing american football i blew the whistle and awarded the blue side a penalty he immediately bore down on me shouting expletives while the others stood around and watched i paced ten yards towards his goal line explaining that in rugby you cant swear at the referee his language became riper so i advanced another ten yards by which time he had been joined by three of his mates who werent much smaller two of the coaches ran quickly onto the field and mr harley explained jeffrey is right if you argue with the referee in rugby its automatically a penalty and youd better get used to it because when we have our first match next week a neutral ref will be even stricter many of the prisoners looking on remained silent as no one was sure what would happen next sorry jeff said the big black man and added its just that we never played it like that in brixton he then rejoined his team when i returned to the block i went straight to the shower room and a few minutes later was joined by jimmy i scored two goals he informs me before adding ive just heard about you and big nes big nes yeah big nes from block c ive managed to go a whole year without speaking to him why i asked he was brixton heavyweight champion and i once saw him knock a prisoner out with a single blow and no one was sure what the poor bastard had done to annoy him oh christ i said shaking under the shower ill never be able to go into the exercise yard again no no said jimmy big nes is telling everyone youre his new friend day thursday september pm i collect my supper from the hotplate but sergio avoids any eye contact as its wednesday you have to change your sheets blankets and towels after supper so i was too preoccupied to go in search of him darren popped in while i was making up my bed to attach nine small mirrors to the wall using prison toothpaste as an adhesive regulations allow you only one fivebyfiveinch mirror so heaven knows how darren got his hands on the other eight pm i go in search of sergio and spot him on the phone i return to my cell thinking hell probably visit me once hes finished his call he doesnt pm im exhausted and fall asleep fully dressed with the tv still on only later do i learn that it is an offence to fall asleep fully dressed for which you can be put on report am the cell is at last finished and no longer smells of paint locke has run a day and a half over time which is no more than one would expect from any selfrespecting painter and decorator darren comes in to pick up my washing sighs and declares the new decor reminds him of a s council house he leaves with his nose in the air and several bundles of washing over his shoulder am pottery is cancelled as once a fortnight the prison officers carry out a session of inhouse training which means were banged up for the rest of the morning i attempt yesterdays times crossword and manage to complete three clues quid turgenev and courtier i can only improve noon lunch when i go to pick up my meal from the hotplate sergio welcomes me with a broad grin so i assume that after all those phone calls he has some news however i wont have a chance to meet up with him until after ive returned from the gym pm gym its circuit day i try to keep up with minnie the traveler and manage to do ten pressups to his fifteen and maintain the same ratio for situps bench presses squats pull ups and back raises but lets face it hes only fortyfive and in the sixth year of an elevenyear sentence hes hoping for parole next year at the end of the session minnie nods hes a man of few words and a nod is considered a remarkable gesture for someone hes only known for a month pm board meeting sergio begins by apologizing for not reporting back last night but he had to call bogota six times and in the process went through nineteen phonecards ps to fund this he had to sell his radio a cassette player and an adidas tracksuit i hope i looked suitably guilty he tells me that the paperwork for the emerald is now complete insurance registration authentication certificate export licence and tax and its ready to be shipped his brother as you will recall is a senior civil servant and therefore plays everything by the book he has already told sergio that he has no intention of losing his job over one small emerald i feel even more guilty as i listen to the rest of sergios colombian report pm darren rushes into my cell a problem he announces mr meanwell has just witnessed him opening a registered parcel in reception it turned out to be a plate and bowl sent in by my son will prisoners are not allowed to send in gifts for other inmates as it might be construed as a bribe in exchange for drugs or protection darren warns me that mr meanwell would be calling for me at some point and perhaps it might be wiser if i were to go and bell the cat i shake my head meanwell is a wise old bird and hell work out that a plate and bowl doesnt constitute a bribe and in any case everyone is well aware of my views on drugs he will also realize that i made no attempt to hide the gift wills name was printed all across the box together with a compliment slip from my pa which would allow mr meanwell to place the offending plate and bowl with the rest of my confiscated kit downstairs if he was at all suspicious like nelson meanwell knows when to turn a blind eye pm exercise its the final evening outing the nights are drawing in and we wont be allowed out again after six i perambulate around the yard with steve not librarian steve who because hes a dcat prisoner has spent the day out with his family i ask him if he enjoyed the experience am to pm very much he replied but only thanks to some help from the police the police i repeat he explains one of the activities steve most misses while hes in jail is a regular swim so whenever he has a day release he and the family go off to the local swimming pool on this occasion they left their ford in the municipal car park and took the children to the pool when they returned his wife couldnt find her car keys until one of the children spotted them on the back seat steve ran all the way to the nearest police station explaining his dilemma exacerbated by the fact that if he failed to return to wayland by three oclock he would automatically lose his dcat status the police happily broke into his car and even phoned wayland to confirm what happened steve arrived back at the front gate with ten minutes to spare day friday september am i have now been a resident of wayland for a month and sergio will return to colombia in a couple of weeks time so with a bit of luck hell be deported around the same time as im being transferred to a dcat but will i also be in possession of an emerald am gym friday is special needs group and my four new friends alex robbie les and paul shake hands with me as they come through the gate again all four display different talents during the training session les can now complete metres on the rowing machine in ten minutes but can only manage one mile an hour on the treadmill whereas paul can do five miles an hour on the running machine but cant catch a ball robbie can catch anything but hates all the machines so only does weight training the instructors rightly tell us to play to their strengths which results in much clapping and laughter along with a huge sense of achievement jimmy handles them better than anyone he remembers all their names over twenty came this morning and they feel hes a real friend hed make a great pe teacher but i have a feeling that once hes released the lure of easy money may be more attractive he says hell never deal in drugs again but i wonder pm exercise cancelled because its raining pm sergio calls his brother in bogota but the line is engaged pm sergio comes to my cell and continues his tutorial on the history of colombia the political system is not unlike that of the united states with a president vicepresident senate and congress however there are two big differences the president and vicepresident have to come from different parties one conservative one liberal colombias idea of democracy whereas in truth the president has all the power the other big difference is that even a senator requires four bodyguards sergio tells me that one presidential candidate had forty bodyguards when he delivered a speech in bogota and was still assassinated pm sergio tries his brother again still engaged pm sergio continues his lecture explaining that the violence in his country makes it necessary for any presidential candidate to have an accommodation with the guerrillas or the mafia or the army or all three we sometimes forget how fortunate we are in britain our politicians only have to deal with the trade unions the cbi and messrs paxman and humphreys pm sergio tries his brother again still engaged pm according to sergio the civil service remains the only untainted profession although his brother is an adviser to several ministers he doesnt need a bodyguard because it is accepted that he will never take a bribe from either the mafia the guerrillas or the army the countryside he assures me is beautiful and the beaches that face both the pacific and the atlantic rival any that can be found in america or europe and as for the women day saturday september am since the age of twentysix ive been lucky enough to organize my own life so having to follow the same routine day in and day out weekends included is enough to make one go stark raving bonkers if i werent writing this diary and sergio didnt exist they would have had to put me in a straitjacket long before now and cart me off to the nearest asylum am gym i put myself through a tough workout and what makes it even tougher is that im surrounded by prisoners a third of my age at the end of the session i climb onto the scales to find ive put on a pound in the last week ill have to cut down on my chocolate intake one of the many disadvantages of being locked up in a cell for hour upon hour is that sometimes you eat simply because there is nothing else to do this is one of the reasons prisoners experiment with drugs and addicts need a regular fix in future i must show more selfcontrol if i dont buy it i cant eat it between each exercise ten minutes on the treadmill the rower and the bicycle i walk a complete circuit of the gym to get my breath back by now i know most of the prisoners and the workouts they do and usually acknowledge or encourage them as i stroll by as i pass jimmy he flexes his muscles and describes himself as a gay icon im seen by the other inmates as the geriatric icon today i spot a sixfootthree west indian of about twenty stone whos lifting massive weights on his own so i stop to watch him what are you fuckin staring at he demands once hes put the weights down just watching i reply then fuck off i know you talk to everyone else but you dont fuckin talk to me i cant stop laughing which doesnt seem to please him and has the officers on edge do you want your fuckin head knocked off he asks i dont think so ellis he looks surprised that i know his name not if youre hoping to be out of here in two weeks time he looks even more surprised that i know when hes due to be released he grunts turns his back on me and lifts kilos in prison what you know is every bit as important as who you know pm as i cross the corridor to join darren in his cell for a game of backgammon i spot sergio on the phone hes holding a stack of ps phonecards in his left hand by now he must have traded everything he owns lately his cell looks as if the bailiffs have paid a visit after three games i return to my cell in possession of another mars bar if i am going to lose weight im going to have to start losing at backgammon i glance to my left to see sergio furiously beckoning me i need another phonecard he says desperately i remove the one i always carry in the back pocket of my jeans and hand it over he smiles i return to my cell sit at my desk and wait sensing a board meeting is imminent pm sergio walks in pushes the door to if anyone enters your cell officer or inmate its against regulations to lock yourself in and turns on the tv a sign that means he doesnt want to be overheard he takes his usual place on the end of the bed as befits the managing director he opens his a pad the stone takes off he checks his watch in a couple of hours he cant resist a huge grin as he keeps me waiting i nod if i were to speak it would only hold up the inevitable repetition of the entire conversation he and his brother have just held and who can blame him however ill skip the next forty minutes and give you a precis of what has caused such a big grin sergios brother has in fact completed all the paperwork and booked the tiny package onto a lufthansa flight that leaves bogota for heathrow via frankfurt in two hours time am in bogota pm at wayland he has faxed all the relevant details to my office in london so theyll know when and where to pick up the gem sergio pauses at this point and waits for some wellearned praise he goes on to confirm that the emerald has come from the muzo mining district famous for the quality of its stones its carats and cost mountain price now all we can do is wait until i find out what value is placed on the emerald by my gemmologist sergio looks up from his notes and adds that his brother would like confirmation that the fax has arrived in my office right now i ask or when youve completed your report because i can see that hes only about halfway through the pages that are covered in his neat spanish hand he considers this for a moment and then says no ill finish first the second piece of news continues sergio turning another page unable to suppress an even broader grin is that liana his former school friend has tracked down four boteros in private hands in private hands he repeats with considerable emphasis and they could be for sale she will send the details to your office some time next week he checks his diary that will give you twelve days to evaluate them evaluate he repeats is that the correct word i nod impressed by the time you have decided on a realistic price i will be back in colombia and can take over negotiations he closes the a pad id better call my son i say aware the ball is back in my court any units left on my phonecard i ask returning to the real world pm i call james on his mobile and ask where he is in the car dad but ill be back at the flat in about fifteen minutes i put the phone down three units gone mobiles gobble units i return to my cell to tell sergio i wont know if james has received the fax for another fifteen minutes this gives sergio enough time to repeat the highlights of his earlier triumph not unlike replays of owens hattrick against germany pm i call jamie at the flat and ask him if hes received the fax yes he replies it arrived forty minutes ago and does it give you all the details you need yes he replies i put the phone down sergio leaves me as he has to report for his job behind the hotplate although he too has to return to the real world that grin just doesnt leave his face pm exercise darren and i are joined by jason conspiracy to blackmail on our afternoon power walk we pass shaun who is sketching jules with whom i shared a cell for the first two weeks hes now finished darren and dale and once hes completed jules hell only have jimmy to do so he should have a full house by the end of the week why do i have this feeling asks darren that you consider the prison service has only one purpose and that is to cater for your every need thats neither accurate nor fair i protest ive tried to organize my entire life around the schedule the prison service demands it makes it twice as difficult to carry out my usual routines but it has put another perspective on the unforgiving minute i wish i could work the system says jason they had me in for an mdt mandatory drugs test this afternoon a la ann widdecombe will it prove positive i ask no chance im in the clear what a nerve he adds suggesting that it was on the grounds of reasonable suspicion knowing your past record says darren well aware that jason occasionally dabbles in heroin how can you be so confident youre in the clear simple jason replies for the past three days ive been drinking more water than jeffrey i must have been up peeing at least seven times every night pm were banged up for fourteen hours after ive checked over the days script i turn to my letters i am particularly touched by a missive from gillian shephard she describes herself as your temporary mp she offers her support and goes on to point out that no one can suggest im after your vote after all members of the house of lords convicted prisoners and lunatics are not entitled to a vote she concludes theres only one category left for you to fulfil jeffrey pm i climb into bed and start to think about an aeroplane thats already halfway across the atlantic on its way to heathrow in its massive hold there is a tiny package no larger than an oxo cube and inside a tiny emerald that will either be on its way back to bogota in a few days time or hanging on my familys christmas tree come december day sunday september am the strangest thing happened last night and im going to have to follow it up today however in order for you to be able to understand its significance ill first have to explain the layout of the enhanced spur on a block the spur is lshaped with fourteen cells on each sprig if i look out of the window to my left i can see about five of the windows on the adjoining sprig around eight yesterday evening just after id finished writing for the day i rose from my desk to draw the curtains when i noticed a woman officer of about twentyfive years of age id better not describe her in detail chatting to a prisoner through his window i wouldnt have given it a second thought if she hadnt still been there an hour later now im unable to tell you any more at the moment because i was banged up at five forty last night and will not be let out until eight fifteen this morning i shall then approach the oracle of all knowledge darren and report back to you tomorrow i have a feeling hell know both the officer and the prisoner and more importantly be able to throw some light on their relationship jimmy carl jules shane and i go across to the changing rooms for the football match against lakenheath after last sundays victory and two good training sessions during the week the team are buoyed up and ready for the encounter in my role as match reporter i look around the benches and check to make sure i know the names of every team member the players are becoming quite nervous and start jumping up and down on the spot as they wait for the arrival of our coach to deliver his pep talk kevin lloyd appears a few moments later a look of despondency on his face im sorry lads he says but the games off a voluble groan goes round the changing room two of the opposition kevin continues failed to bring any form of id with them so we couldnt let them through the gates i would have accepted credit cards but they couldnt even supply those i am sorry kevin repeats and theres no doubt hes as disappointed as we are while the others go off for a further training session i have to return to my cell am i call mary who brings me up to date on the reinstatement of my dcat kpmgs report is progressing slowly she tells me and the police havent even decided if they want to interview you although the whole exercise is taking longer than she had anticipated mary says there is no reason to believe that they will find ms nicholsons accusations anything other than spurious i suggest that she goes ahead with the christmas parties that we always hold in december and let will and james act as cohosts i tell her to invite everyone who has stood firm and ignore the fairweather friends who have in fact turned out to be very small in number i add that if im in a dcat open prison by christmas ill call up in the middle of the party and deliver a festive message over the intercom pm im just about to leave for exercise when the spur officer tells me im required urgently in the sos office the word urgently surprises me as i havent heard it used for the past seven weeks i join mr king in his office and am introduced to a female officer ive never seen before am i at last to meet the governor no the officers name is sue maiden and she explains that shes part of the prisons security team she then tells me that it has been reported to her that ellis who resides on b block was abusive to me in the gym yesterday i repeat exactly what took place she then asks me if i want special protection certainly not i reply thats the last thing i need she looks relieved i had to ask she explains thats all i need i repeat you only have to read the story in the sunday mirror this morning about phonecards to see what the press would make of that understood but well still have to speak to ellis fine but not at my request i make clear she seems to accept this proviso and i depart to find the barred gate that leads out on to the exercise yard has already been bolted leaving me locked inside and unable to take my daily walk around the yard pm i spend the forty minutes with sergio in his cell he tells me that there is only one recognized carrier willing to fly in and out of bogota and then only on a thursday saturday and sunday sergio mentions that its not easy to attract holidaymakers to a country where there are forty murders a day in the capital alone he uses the rest of exercise time to give me a geography lesson i am shown in darrens times atlas hes playing backgammon where the emerald mountains are situated as well as the extensive oil fields in the valleys to the east i also discover that both the andes and the amazon make entrances and exits through colombia pm i drop into darrens cell to have a blackcurrant cordial and watch him play a game of backgammon with jimmy he tells me that my meeting with the security officer was timed so that i wouldnt be able to go out into the exercise yard as they felt it might be wise for me to cool it a little darren seems to know everything thats going on and i take the opportunity to tell him about my nocturnal sightings darren laughs youre a peeping tom he says that has to be malcolm macho malcolm hes even more irresistible than me chips in jimmy do i sense a good story for the diary i ask tentatively half a dozen says darren but not tonight because were just about to be banged up he cant hide his pleasure at the thought of keeping me waiting for another few hours pm once im banged up i start making extensive notes for my phone call to alison who returns from new zealand tomorrow i then turn to hamlet i am resolved to read or reread the entire works of shakespeare thirtyseven plays by the time they transfer me to an open prison if i succeed ill move on to the sonnets after a couple of acts i switch on the tv to watch the unforgettable john le mesurier in dads army what a distinguished career he had making a virtue of letting other people take centre stage not something ive ever been good at day monday september am tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow tomorrow i will need to book a call at seven in the evening with my son james to find out if the emerald has arrived i cant contact him today because on monday were banged up at fivethirty and hell still be at work in the city tomorrow macho malcolm leaves for his dcat prison and neither darren nor jimmy are willing to breathe a word about his sex life until hes off the premises however i can report that the woman officer who was spotted outside malcolms window was today seen walking down the corridor with him towards his cell but this is the stuff of rumours tomorrow i will be able to give you the facts as reported by darren and jimmy however darren did let slip that three women were involved he knows only too well such a hint will keep me intrigued for another night tomorrow as for today i rise a few minutes before six and write for two hours am pottery i take a grapefruit into art class and an empty jar of marmalade for keith kidnapping as part of another still life hes drawing for his a level course keith didnt even take up painting until he was sent to prison when he comes up for parole in six months time he will leave at the age of fortysix with an a level much credit must go to anne and paul who are every bit as proud of this achievement as keith himself keith tells me how sorry he was to read about my mothers death and goes on to say that he was in prison when his wife died of breast cancer at the age of thirtynine he then adds the poignant comment i shall not mourn her death until after ive been released shaun forgery artist confirms that hes given up on dale and will now concentrate on jules steve and jimmy we discuss how hell deal with the arrival on wednesday of his cache of special drawing paper oils chalks and pencils without the other prisoners becoming aware of what im up to we dont want to get our smuggler into any trouble and we certainly dont need any other inmates to feel envious envy is even more prevalent in prisons than it is in the outside world partly because all emotions are heightened in such a hothouse atmosphere and partly because any little privilege afforded to one however slight seems so unfair to others who are not treated in the same way i spend the remainder of the class reading a book on the lives of the two great female impressionists marie laurencin and berthe morisot pm gym once again i complete my programme in the allocated hour just to give you an update on my progress when i first arrived at wayland four weeks ago i managed metres on the rowing machine and today i passed for the first time when and if i ever get to a dcat establishment i can only hope they have a wellequipped gym pm mr chapman unlocks my cell door to let me know that mr carltonboyce wants to see me mr carltonboyce who seems to be the governor on my case tells me that he can do nothing about the reinstatement of my dcat until the police confirm that they will not be going ahead with any enquiry concerning the simple truth appeal however he adds once that confirmation comes through we will transfer you to an open prison as quickly as possible i am still receiving a pile of letters from the public every day he adds but they just dont understand that my hands are tied i accept this but point out that its been six weeks and the police havent even interviewed me he nods and then asks me if i have any other problems i say no although i have a feeling hes referring to ellis and the gym incident pm i call alison i make an appointment to speak to jonathan lloyd my agent at five tomorrow and my son james at seven i have to book time calls because as you will recall no one can phone pm banged up for another fourteen hours so once ive gone over my script i turn to my letters one of which is from a journalist how flattering the press can be when they want something pm i watch david starkey present the first of an engrossing fourpart series on the six wives of henry viii i had no idea that catherine of aragon had been made regent and conducted a war against the scots flodden while henry was away fighting his own battles in france or that they were married for over thirty years and of course would have remained together until death if she had only produced a son more please dr starkey i cant wait to learn about anne boleyn next week even i know that she was the mother of elizabeth i but not a lot more pm the lead story on the news is that john prescotts retaliatory punch during the election campaign is to be referred to the cps over the past few weeks several inmates have pointed out that they are serving sentences from six months to three years for punching someone after they had been attacked so theyre looking forward to the deputy prime minister joining us i have little doubt that the cps will sweep the whole incident under the carpet i say when i raise the subject with darren they didnt in your case he remarks true but it wont go unnoticed by the public that we can expect two levels of justice in britain as long as new labour are in power i just cant see mr prescott arriving at belmarsh in two sweatboxes perhaps i do the cps an injustice tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow day tuesday september am i suspect that tuesday september th will be etched on the memories of everyone in the free world as among the blackest days in history but i shall still report it as it unfolded for me in time sequence although aware that my earlier reportage may appear frivolous am pottery is cancelled because annes car has broken down so all the prisoners in the art class have to return to their cells the first irony back on a block everyone on my spur is shaking hands with malcolm who is about to be transferred to a dcat he comes to my cell to say farewell and hopes that i will be joining him soon as he knows spring hill is also my first choice when are group collecting you i ask they arent he replies now im in a dcat and past my fled i can drive myself over to aylesbury and as long as ive checked in by three this afternoon no one will give a damn no sooner has malcolm left the wing than jimmy slips into my cell im ready to talk now he says jimmy and malcolm are both dcats jimmy remains at wayland because his home is nearby and are the only two inmates at wayland allowed to work outside the prison walls every day both of them have a job maintaining the grounds beyond the perimeter fence during the week and at an animal sanctuary on saturday mornings the sanctuary is a voluntary project which concentrates on helping animals in distress the work ranges from assisting lame beasts to walk or birds to fly to having to bury them when they die every saturday morning at the sanctuary jimmy and malcolm join several volunteers from the local village among them one lady who has left malcolm in no doubt how she feels about him malcolm has the rugged looks of a matinee idol and possesses an inordinate amount of charm one of the tasks none of the volunteers relish is having to bury dead animals and percy the hedgehog was no exception everyone was surprised when the lady in question stepped forward and volunteered to bury percy malcolm gallant as ever quickly agreed to accompany her into the forest that bordered the sanctuary armed with spades they disappeared into the thicket fortyfive minutes later they reappeared but jimmy noticed minus their spades wheres your spade mate demanded jimmy i knew there was something else we were meant to do malcolm blurted out they both charged back into the forest and malcolm returned only just in time to be escorted back to the prison jimmy goes on to tell me that malcolm left wayland just in time because one of the ladies who served behind the counter at family visits has also just signed up to join the group on saturdays at the animal sanctuary not to mention the female officer who i saw standing outside his cell window for an hour two nights ago who is now thinking of applying for a transfer god knows says jimmy what malcolm will get up to in a dcat where the regime is far more relaxed is he married i ask oh yeah jimmy replies happily pm i am sitting on the end of my bed reading the times when darren bursts in without knocking most unlike him switch on your tv he says without explanation theyre running it on every channel together we watch the horrors unfold in new york i assume that the first plane must have been involved in some tragic accident until we both witness a second jet flying into the other tower of the world trade center to begin with i feel the commentators comparison with pearl harbor is somewhat exaggerated but later when i realize the full extent of the devastation and loss of life i am less sure the reporters have already moved on to asking who is responsible although i am mesmerized by this vile piece of history as it continues to unfold prison timetables cannot be altered whatever is taking place in the rest of the world if i dont report to the gym by three fifteen they will come in search of me pm much of the talk in the gym is of the carnage in new york and its consequences although several of the prisoners continue their bench presses oblivious to whats taking place in the outside world as soon as the hour is up i rush back to my cell to find that the pentagon has been hit by a third domestic carrier and a fourth commercial plane thought to have been heading for the white house has crashed just outside pennsylvania pm for several hours i sit glued to the television among the snippets of news offered between the continual replays of the two planes crashing into the twin towers is a statement by william hague he has postponed the announcement of who will be the next leader of the conservative party as a mark of respect to the american people the prime minister cancels his speech to the tuc in brighton and hurries back to downing street where he makes a statement fully supporting president bush and describing terrorism as the new world evil pm the sight of innocent people jumping out of those towers and the voices of passengers trapped on a domestic flight talking to their next of kin on mobile phones will be for me the enduring memory of this evil day calling my agent and my son james was to have been the highlight of my day it now seems somewhat irrelevant day wednesday september am yesterday was dominated by the news from america and what retaliation george w bush might take tony blair seized the initiative by calling a press conference at no for pm which would be seen by the citizens of new york just as they were waking i dont want to appear cynical but at the end of the press conference when the prime minister agreed to take questions did you notice who he selected from a packed audience of journalists the bbc andrew marr itv john sergeant cnn robin oakley channel eleanor goodman the times philip webster and the sun trevor kavanagh i sense alastair campbells skills very much in evidence only the major television companies and two murdoch newspapers however to be fair by recalling parliament blair looks like the leading statesman in europe and that on the day when the tory party are planning to announce their new leader am life goes on at wayland so i report to the art room for my pottery class our clandestine accomplice has successfully smuggled in the special materials that shaun needs to complete his art work for this volume am i call alison at the office for an update she tells me that the pressure has shifted onto kpmg to deliver an interim report so as not to keep me waiting until theyve completed the full investigation which apparently now includes some accusations ms nicholson has made against the red cross which have nothing to do with me cant spare any more units as i have to speak to james tonight so i say goodbye pm football waylands match against raf marham is to my surprise still on not that i expect there would have been many fighter pilots in the visitors team we lose despite jimmys scoring two goals three of our team receive red cards so wayland ended up with only eight players on the field having led at halftime by the way all three players deserved to be sent off as soon as i return to my cell i switch on the tv pm most of the muslim world are swearing allegiance to america as they must all be fearful of retaliation yasser arafat even gives blood to prove his solidarity with the citizens of new york the prime minister continues to underline his support for the united states as he considers the atrocities in new york to be an attack on the democratic world i suspect he views this as his falklands lets hope its not his vietnam pm after supper sergio convenes a board meeting item no he confirms that the suitcase and contents have been delivered to his friend in north london item no the emerald has arrived in london with all the correct paperwork completed item no a colleague of his brothers will be flying into london on saturday bringing with him the gold necklace a catalogue raisonne of botero and four photos of botero oils that are for sale he pauses and waits for my reaction i smile it all sounds too good to be true pm all the news programmes are replaying footage from every angle of the american passenger jets flying into the twin towers of the world trade center in new york all the commentators are in no doubt that the us will seek some form of revenge once they can identify the culprit who can blame them its going to take a very big man to oversee this whole operation president kennedy proved to be such a man when he was faced with the cuban crisis i only hope that george w bush is of the same mettle pm i phone james he tells me that hes tired hes just started his new job in the city because of the upheaval in the american market they expect him to be at his desk by am and he doesnt leave the office until after pm however he confirms over the phone that the emerald has arrived so out of curiosity i ask him what it looks like it looks magnificient dad is his simple reply but ive no idea if its worth ten thousand dollars when are you hoping to see the expert sometime this weekend i dont ask any more questions as i wish to save my remaining units for mary quite a lot seems to be happening this weekend mary will visit wayland on friday liana will have news of the botero paintings on saturday sergios friend flies into london on sunday by which time james should have a realistic valuation of the emerald i only wish i could read mondays diary now dont even think about it day thursday september am it was a clear cold night and for the first time two flimsy blankets were not enough to keep me warm i had to lie very still if i was not to freeze it reminded me of being back at boarding school as two blankets are the regulation issue i shall have to speak to darren about the problem im pretty confident he will have a reserve stock am i watch breakfast television while eating my cornflakes the news coming out of washington is that the state department seems convinced that it was as has already been widely reported osama bin laden who orchestrated the terrorist attacks we must now wait and see how george w bush plans to retaliate the presidents description of the terrorists as folks hasnt filled the commentators with confidence rudy giuliani the mayor of new york on the other hand is looking more like a world statesman every day when the report switches from washington to new york i am surprised to observe a pall of smoke still hanging over the city its only when the cameras pan down onto the rubble that one is made fully aware of just how long it will be before that citys physical scars can be healed am were banged up for an hour owing to officers staff training am pottery i make my way quickly across to the art class as i need to see shaun and find out if he now has all the art materials he needs im disappointed to find that hes not around so i end up reading a book on the life of picasso studying in particular guernica which he painted in support of his countrymen at the time of the spanish civil war i know its a masterpiece but i desperately need someone like brian sewell to explain to me why pm gym completed my full programme and feel fitter than i have done for years pm tagged onto the end of the news is an announcement that iain duncan smith has been elected as the new leader of the conservative party he won by a convincing margin of per cent to per cent for kenneth clarke a far better turnout than i had expected having spent years trying to convince my party that we should trust our members to select the leader the per cent turnout gives me some satisfaction however i would have to agree with michael brown a former conservative mp who is now a journalist with the independent a year ago you could have got odds of a hundred to one against a man who hadnt served in either margaret thatchers or john majors governments at any level ending up as leader of the tory party in pm i watch a special edition of question time chaired by david dimbleby i only hope the audience wasnt a typical crosssection of british opinion because i was horrified by how many people were happy to condemn the americans and seemed to have no sympathy for the innocent people who had lost their lives at the hands of terrorists my feelings went out to philip lader the popular former american ambassador as he found himself having to defend his countrys foreign policy i fall asleep angry day friday september am today is one of those days when i particularly wish i were not in jail i would like to be in the gallery of the house of commons following the emergency debate on the atrocities in america and attending the memorial service at st pauls noon watching television this afternoon i find myself agreeing with almost everything the prime minister says in his speech to the house iain duncan smith responds in a dignified way leaving the pm in no doubt that the opposition is to quote ids shoulder to shoulder on this issue it is left to george galloway and tam dalyell to express contrary views which they sincerely hold i suspect it would take a nuclear weapon to land on their constituencies with osama bin ladens signature scribbled across it before they would be willing to change their minds the service at st pauls sees the british at their best and like diana princess of wales funeral it strikes exactly the right note not least by the service opening with the american national anthem and closing with our own i am pleased to see phil lader sitting amongst the congregation but it is george carey the archbishop of canterbury who rises to the occasion he delivers an address that leaves no one in any doubt how he feels about the terrorists but also expresses the view that this is a time for cool heads to make shrewd judgements rather than macho remarks demanding immediate retaliation pm visit mary is among the first through the door into the visitors room her news is not good and she doesnt try to pretend otherwise kpmg are going at a snails pace making it clear that they have no interest in my plight and will deliver their report when they are good and ready they are hoping to interview me on monday week so it looks as if ill be stuck at wayland for at least another month i feel sure that is not what sir nicholas young the ceo of the red cross intended when he instigated an internal enquiry even if it will delight emma nicholson mary has so obviously done everything she can to expedite matters but as she says its an accountants duty to leave no piece of paper unturned we discuss our appeal mary describes it as our appeal partly i think because she was so offended by mr justice potts aiding and abetting mrs peppiatt when she was in the witness box while in my view not affording mary the same courtesy when she was put through a similar ordeal we talk about the boys how admirably they are coping in the circumstances and the fact that will is desperate to see me before he returns to new york thank god he wasnt in manhattan this week mary reports that my adopted sister elizabeth is alive and well elizabeth had been at work in the city when she heard the explosion and looked out of her window to see the flames belching from the world trade center there is a restrained announcement over the intercom asking all visitors to leave where did the time go i feel guilty about mary ive been unable to hide my disappointment about kpmgs lack of urgency she couldnt have been more supportive during this terrible time in my life and heaven knows what state i would be in without her love and friendship day saturday september am i call david and ask him to drive to sale in cheshire on monday and pick up a package which is being flown in from colombia that morning am no gym on saturday so i make sure im standing by the gate when exercise is called to my surprise dale is seated in the corner of the yard having his portrait finished as i pass he mumbles something about how much trouble he would have been in had he failed to show up two weekends in a row when i return to my cell after fortyfive minutes hard walking darren tells me that we probably covered about three miles i push open my heavy door to find my cell is spotless the room has been swept cleaned and the floor polished by darrens latest recruit all for ps no problems with the minimum wage at wayland especially when you can only pay in mars bars tobacco or if its a big deal a phonecard pm mr meanwell calls me into his office to let me know that an envelope containing the rules of backgammon has been opened and sent down to reception it will not be returned to me until i leave wayland as the item is on the prohibited list how can the rules of backgammon be on the prohibited list i ask the rules came in book form he explains and shrugs his shoulders if they had been in a magazine could i have had them i enquire he nods pm early bang up i channel hop so i can keep watching the latest news from manhattan i am moved by the sight of the new yorkers on the streets applauding their firemen as they drive back and forth to the world trade center americans have a tremendous sense of patriotism and awareness of the country they belong to it must have been the same in britain during the last war day sunday september noon not a lot to report except sergio is nervous about leaving he will be deported in twelve days time and we havent yet received a valuation for the emerald hes also waiting to hear about the second package which contains the gold necklace and cant wait to see the photographs of the boteros as well as the catalogue raisonne i spend a long time reading the papers and feel the coverage of all that has taken place in america this week elicited the very highest standards of journalism from the british press not always the case on a sunday day monday september am the news is still all about new york where mayor giuliani appears to be emulating his hero mayor la guardia everything had gone wrong for rudy giuliani this year he stood down from the senate race against hillary clinton when he was diagnosed with cancer and he then moved his mistress into gracie mansion to face the wrath of his popular wife and the big apples press in fact to quote the new york times he seems to have lost the plot and then without warning the city he loves is attacked by terrorists and all the talents boredom disguises suddenly return when i stood for mayor of london i spent a week in new york shadowing giuliani as he went about his daily work and quickly discovered that he has real power and a real budget to back it up the truth is that giuliani runs new york in a way ken livingstone can never hope to govern london tony blairs dream of emulating the americans with mayors in all our major cities would have been admirable if only he allowed the mayor to be backed up with finance and executive power livingstone can huff and puff but in the end only blair can blow the house down am pottery out of boredom i begin to annes surprise to work on a flowerpot or that is what ive told my fellow inmates its going to be first you take the putty run a circle of steel through it to cut off a smaller chunk and then roll it out to produce a long thin wormlike shape you then twist the long thin worm into a circle and several long worms later all placed on top of each other and you have a pot or thaf s the theory an hour later i have a base and five long worms the blessed release bell clangs am i phone alison to discover that the gold necklace the book on botero the photographs of botero oils and a sculpture have all arrived in cheshire via bogota pm gym once again i manage metres on the rower pm board meeting sergio has been on the phone to bogota for the past forty minutes armed with a dozen cards ps and the judicious use of an illegal pin number he can now afford to spend an hour phoning colombia his brother is waiting to find out if i have any interest in the boteros i assure him that as soon as ive seen the photographs i will make a decision pm im writing at my desk when i hear shouting and screaming in the corridor i leave my cell to investigate and see half a dozen prisoners standing outside a cell door at the far end of the corridor im told by darren that the occupant danny burglar will be released in the morning and some of his friends wished to give him a farewell present half a dozen inmates have filled a black bin liner with water and added tea bags sugar stale bread butter and beans they are now all peeing into it they then empty the contents onto the hapless prisoners bed just before we are due to be banged up this ensures that he will have to spend his final night cleaning up the cell if he hopes to be released in the morning pm dr starkey continues his excellent series on the six wives of henry viii tonight its anne boleyn although starkey spends the whole hour being fairly critical of the queen one cannot but admire the ladys last sentiment before being beheaded her short speech was full of grace with no fault placed at the door of henry viii she cant have been all bad day tuesday september pottery carry on producing long worms for my pot much to the amusement of the other prisoners all of whom show far more promise than i do craig gbh is making a horse for his mother lloyd drugs a heartshaped jewellery box for his girlfriend peter burglary another bowl for his aunt and paul murder yet another christ on the cross am its been a week since the terrorists struck new york and washington it now seems unlikely that any more bodies will be rescued from beneath the rubble although mayor giuliani is a long way off giving orders to stop the search while theres the slimmest hope that anyone might still be alive hes lost so many firemen policemen and city workers and was nearly killed himself that i cant see him calling off the search for at least another week this despite the fact that nobody other than the closest of relatives believes that anyone else can have survived am danny the prisoner who had his cell sacked last night is now bidding farewell to everyone on the spur as hes due to be released within the hour he seems to bear no grudges and i watch him shaking hands with jimmy who tells me later that danny was probably thankful that his departing gift wasnt physical as it was on mels last night jimmy doesnt go into any detail but does admit that mel had to spend his last few hours on the hospital wing am call alison davids picked up the package from sale and she has sent the botero details plus photos to sothebys for a realistic valuation with copies to me she has also dispatched the botero catalogue raisonne as a gift to the library at least that way i will get to see the great artists works rather than have the book confiscated and not returned until i am finally released alison has handed the necklace over to james who awaits my instructions still no valuation on the emerald pm nothing else worth reporting today except jimmy captain of everything has just returned from town leave and looks as if hes had sex sex is allowed when youre on town leave how could they stop it jimmy has been out so much recently that he almost treats wayland like a bed and breakfast motel still to be fair hell only be with us for another three weeks will he leave wayland before i do day wednesday september am things american still dominate the news as i feel sure they will for some time to come tony blair has seized the initiative and flown to berlin and paris for talks with the chancellor and the president in the times this morning peter riddell describes him as having a good war but the truth is that everyone is waiting to find out what george w bushs response will be to the talibans stonewalling am pottery i finish my masterpiece my tutor anne asks the rest of the class to gather round and help her decide what it is four opt for a flowerpot three an upsidedown hat and one inmate feels i should have pressed on and produced an umbrella stand am another welcome flood of letters today including one from john major and another from george carey see opposite both are handwritten and full of understanding and kindness mary tells me in her letter that shes been in touch with kpmg who are doing a very thorough job and refusing to be hurried david smith one of their senior partners plans to come and see me next monday together with my solicitor she feels as i have nothing to hide that i should agree to the meeting i had never planned to do otherwise noon lunch every day you select a number from the lunch list see opposite i always choose the vegetarian option for reasons i have already explained as i pass mr shepperson he calls out two which turns out to be a beef burger i point out politely that there must be some mistake he immediately checks the master list to discover that the mistake is mine ive circled two not five result no lunch today he makes no attempt to offer me an alternative because all the dishes are preselected he explains in any case that would set a precedent carl gbh goal scorer who serves the puddings on the end of the line offers me a second orange and turning to shepperson says his lordship has never been the same since i introduced him to cannabis this is greeted by cheers from the waiting queue even shepperson manages a smile pm supper this time i circled the right number vegetable hotpot and because mr chapman is on duty i end up with two portions day thursday september am during the past week george bush has been criticized mainly by journalists for not being able to string a sentence together but today he confounded his critics me included by delivering an elegant and moving speech to congress this was not only well written i read the full text as reproduced in the times but the speech writer had caught his voice because he delivered the text with such assurance meanwhile the prime ministers timing continues to be faultless he flew into new york following talks with chirac in paris and then was driven straight to ground zero he was shown round the smouldering site by mayor guiliani before attending a memorial service at st patricks i tune in four hours later to hear the presidents speech to congress only to find mr blair now sitting in the presidents box mrs bush on one side of him and mayor giuliani on the other hes done more to strengthen the special relationship in one week than anyone since the days of roosevelt and churchill am mr clegg arrives outside my door and stares into my cell he informs me that the decor as designed by shaun has not met with the governors approval the walls must be returned to their original colour by the end of the week but as the governor hasnt been seen on a block let alone my spur in anyones memory this seems a little unlikely however i go in search of locke am in my post among other things is a catalogue from sothebys new york for their latin american sale last may i walk across to sergios cell and its my turn to give him a tutorial i explain how an auction works and what is meant by high and low estimates on the righthand side of each page is a reproduction of a painting or sculpture on the left the artists name and any known provenance of the work we immediately check out the two oils two sculptures and five drawings by botero a sculpture of a reclining woman had a low estimate of and sold for a vast sculpture of a nude woman had a low estimate of but only managed whereas an oil painting of a bowl of flowers which had a low estimate of sold for the five drawings ranging in price from to failed to reach the hammer price and were bi bought in perhaps because the subject bull fighting would not have appealed to many americans we then carefully check the photos of boteros that arrived in the morning post and try to work out what their low estimate might be and see if we can spot a bargain there is a maquette of a nude woman for which im willing to offer two small oils and a large smiling cat and a magnificent portrait entitled the card players see plate section which we settle on at although the seller wants a million my bids are all low and although sergio will offer the sellers cash i doubt if well manage to pick up any of them as botero is after all an established international name however as sergio points out although christies and sothebys have offices in brazil mexico and argentina they have no presence in colombia which may provide us with a small edge in an overcrowded market he also adds that september th may have caused prices to fall suddenly well just have to wait and see if hes right when lock up is bellowed out i return to my cell pm i fall asleep dreaming of the card players i even know which wall i would hang it on in london day friday september am george w bush and tony blair officially name osama bin laden as the man behind the terrorist attack on the twin towers in new york although ships and planes are spotted heading for the gulf no one seems to know when any retaliation is likely to take place bush has warned the taliban give up bin laden or we strike the talibans response is that it would be an insult to allah but dont mention the fact that the leader of the taliban is bin ladens fatherinlaw when bush was told their response he appeared on tv offering million for bin laden dead or alive the moment i heard that i feared for the presidents life am gym alex special needs group does three sets of ten situps for the first time and because he cant speak gives me a thumbsup sign while robbie and les applaud him they are as yet unaware that i will also expect them to begin situps next week one of the few experiences i shall miss when i leave wayland if i ever escape will be these weekly sessions am when i return from the gym the newspapers are on my bed they are so full of news from both sides of the atlantic that i dont discover until page eleven of the times that the cps are not going ahead with any assault charges against john prescott one or two of the inmates mutter about one rule for new labour and another for the rest of us a senior officer is even more appalled by the pms flippant remark well thats john isnt it so much for well deal with crime and the causes of crime pm phone mary who tells me that the governor has sent all the prison service papers showing the stated reasons for my recategorization from dcat to ccat he wishes it to be known that it is not the prison service that is holding up my reinstatement she has other news but not on the phone day saturday september am gym metres on the rower in ten minutes three miles on the running machine in twentyfive minutes fiftytwo seconds and six miles on the bike in ten minutes making me feel about fortyfive until i see a west indian replace me on the running machine and do twelve mph for twenty minutes still he is a mere twentythree pm i call chris at the gallery hes unhappy about the boteros because he has only black and white reproductions i agree to do nothing until sothebys have authenticated them and come back with a low estimate pm i call james hes back in london and tells me that our expert has confirmed that the emerald was a good purchase for although he isnt willing to place a value on it i am relieved to discover that sergio isnt a crook and whats more mary will end up with a special christmas present i wonder where ill be this christmas day sunday september pm today is dominated by one incident worth recording in detail and it all began while i was in my cell reading the times i have already explained that during association a group of west indians play dominoes in the main room the amount of noise that emanates from each move would lead one to believe that a heavyweight boxing contest was taking place which is why a problem arises when a real incident occurs because the uproar can hardly reach a higher pitch however this time the noise was accompanied by the ringing of bells and officers running from every direction towards the association room it was like being back in belmarsh by the time i made an entrance the incident was well under control however several of the brothers still wished to give me their version of events it seems that one of the brothers had been moved from d to a block recently ostensibly because he had been bullied it seems that when he was out on a town visit to norwich a couple of weeks ago his mates gathered together a large sum of money so that he could pick up an order of drugs a problem arose when he returned that night and didnt have any of the gear with him his excuse was he didnt think hed get the skag past the guards however he couldnt come up with a convincing explanation for not being able to return their cash when he was found cowering in his cell with a cut below his eye and a broken nose the unit officer quickly moved him across to our block and they hoped out of harms way however during exercise yesterday the brothers on d block informed the brothers on a block how hed stitched them up and passed the responsibility of exacting revenge on to them back to the sunday afternoon game of dominoes where a row broke out with the culprit one of the players left the group walked across to the snooker table picked up a ball turned round and hurled it at him amazingly he hit the right man in the back of the head at thirty paces there were eleven prisoners seated around the table at the time the ball must have been propelled at about seventymiles an hour because it split the mans head open the pitcher ended up in segregation while the victim is on his way to the local hospital both will appear in front of the governor later this week the usual punishment would be twentyeight days added to both mens sentences which the governor can mete out without recourse to the courts and in a case like this an immediate transfer to different a or bcat establishments i go into great detail to describe this incident simply because those casually reading this diary might be left with an impression that life at wayland is almost bearable it isnt you can never be sure from one moment to the next if your life is in danger on this block alone there are a dozen murderers countless thugs and drug addicts with whom i have to coexist every day im not unhappy to see my door slammed shut tonight my meeting with kpmg and that an announcement is likely to be made in the next couple of days he confirms that they have been ready to move me for some time and they are only waiting for a call from the police i return to my cell aware that when kpmg finally announce their findings and the police confirm that they have dropped their enquiries that the press coverage will be about a hundredth of that created by ms nicholson the day after she had appeared on newsnight day tuesday september am burglars this is the cry that goes up from fellow inmates when officers appear on the spur to begin a spin cell search i didnt get to pottery yesterday because of my legal visit and it looks as if im going to miss it again today weve just been told to stay in our cells as a search is about to be conducted following the snooker hall incident on sunday i fail to see how a prisoner throwing a snooker ball at another inmate should result in the whole of a block being searched two days later however its shane gbh gym orderly who tells me that when they spun the assailants cell they found a nineinch blade hidden under his mattress and the governor has ordered a comprehensive search of the whole block searching cells takes the duty officers a little over two hours mr shepperson and a colleague spend ten minutes in my cell only to discover that i have two more towels than im entitled to and a tshirt that sergio has given me because hes leaving on thursday they dont comment on these indiscretions as they are obviously looking for more important items as i hang around in my cell i am amused to see the grass outside is littered with different objects that have been thrown out of the windows since the shout of burglars went up apparently its mainly drugs and other banned substances but despite a further search amongst the rubbish no other knives or blades are discovered when the spin is over im told that nigel gbh race relations rep known as the preacher see plate section has had a carpet removed from his cell and darren two pots of seagreen paint an officer confirms that no other knives were found on our spur which surprises darren although he wont tell me why the most common object removed from the cells turns out to be tv remote controls for some inexplicable reason remote controls are allowed only on d block the drugfree block result d blockers trade their remotes for drugs prison logic noon exercise after half an hour of power walking in the fresh air darren and i return to the block as he strolls back through the gate his eyes light on his two pots of seagreen paint standing in the hallway im afraid i cant resist it i pick them both up and deposit them back in his cell he immediately hides them in the dustbin room at the end of the corridor explaining that should any officer discover theyre missing the first cell they would search would be his and he could end up on report if he hears nothing for twentyfour hours hell feel its safe to retrieve them so much happens in prison every day that its not unlike a national newspaper yesterdays big story is quickly replaced by some new incident demanding the staffs immediate attention darren agrees its the first time ive been able to do something for him pm i call will to confirm that hes still planning to visit me on friday he tells me that dcs perry is off sick and his deputy is unwilling to make a decision while hes away so much for justice i begin to think that ill be in wayland for the rest of my life day wednesday september am pottery its annes birthday shes amused by my flowerpot weve all agreed now that it is to be thought of as a flowerpot and says that it must be left to dry for two weeks before it can be placed in the kiln another of the tutors has brought in a box of crayons for shaun when i leave the art room an hour later i place the crayons in a plastic bag which to my surprise the officers dont bother to look inside i then walk out onto the exercise yard and in front of several other officers stroll across to the window of shauns cell on c block and pass the crayons through the bars dropping them on his bed only yesterday we were all searched for a knife today prison logic i admit im only smuggling crayons but you would have thought someone might have just checked pm no gym because its rugby practice mr harley has selected a team of possibles v probables for the first match next week which he asks me to referee the standard turns out to be far higher than i had expected an afrocaribbean inmate picks up a ball that is passed to his toes at full speed and carves his way through a bunch of thugs and murderers to score a brilliant try under the posts it augers well for next week when we return to the changing room the young man tells me that hes never played the game before how much talent is there in this country that we just dont find out about let alone nurture another prisoner standing next to me in the shower is six foot nine and was one of the second row forwards surprise surprise hes more interested in talking about my trial which he describes as a diabolical liberty as i never discuss my case with other inmates i only listen i also got four years he said for burglary with five hundred and two yeah five hundred and two he repeats other offences to be taken into consideration day thursday september am sergio will be leaving for heathrow within the hour we agree that i will call him next tuesday at pm gmt two oclock in bogota he tells me that there is at least ps left on his bt phonecard which ought to be enough for him to let me know that he has arrived safely and put in my offer for the boteros could i really get the card players for am pottery shaun spends two hours with two tenminute breaks drawing juless body in a crouching position and wearing his grey prison tracksuit this is his best effort yet hell add the head next week he now has only steve conspiracy to murder library orderly and jimmy ecstasy and captain of everything left to draw however as steve rarely leaves the library jimmy is out all day working on the farm and shaun is due to be released in four weeks time this may prove a closerun thing i will not see the final montage until shaun has presented his portfolio to my literary agent jonathan lloyd pm exercise as we circumnavigate the yard darren tells me about a prisoner who was transferred to littlehey early this morning the governor considered that his life might be in danger if he remained at wayland he had already been shipped out of blunderstone prison earlier this month when it was discovered that he was being beaten up on a regular basis when he arrived here darren continues he claimed that he was in for punching a taxi driver which few of us believed it just didnt add up he added without further explanation by now weve completed two circuits and im none the wiser as to what this is all about but darren is enjoying keeping me in suspense the unnamed prisoner lasted on c block for only a few days before they torched his cell and set fire to all his belongings so he was quickly moved to a block but he lasted only one night before a delegation of prisoners paid a visit to the principal officer mr tinkler telling him that if the man was still on the block after the weekend they could not be responsible for his safety what is he in for i ask unable to contain my curiosity ah i see i still have your attention comments darren even if i havent learnt to curtail your impatience he pauses dramatically he has committed a crime for which his fellow prisoners would show no mercy darren covers a few more yards before he adds he kidnapped and raped a thirteenyearold girl so theyve finally moved him to a prison where he will be safe because hell only be locked up with other nonces pm george w bushs first act of war is to sign an order freezing all accounts to which osama bin laden has access its being reported on the evening news that clinton attempted to do the same thing when he was president but couldnt get congress to back him nothing worth watching on television so i return to the works of shakespeare tonight king lear if only the bard had experienced a few months in prison day friday september am gym its my weekly session with the special needs group i now have my own little class alex robbie les and paul we begin on the rower before moving across to the running machine and this week i ask them all to try situps a new challenge alex and robbie manage ten while les and paul find it difficult to do more than five but at least they now have a weekly target noon lunch looks disgusting so i dont bother i have a visit today so i can supplement my diet from the canteen pm fortnightly visit this friday my three visitors are my son will and two of my dearest friends chris beetles and godfrey barker ive decided to allocate the first half hour to will followed by twenty minutes with chris then another twenty with godfrey and then a final session with all three will starts by telling me about a call he received during the journey to wayland telling him that the kpmg accountants had just come out of a meeting with the police and had left them in no doubt that i was never involved with the collecting or distribution of any simple truth money donated to the red cross will goes on to say that he cant believe ill still be at wayland this time next week wills next piece of news is that he has a new girlfriend but as hes returning to america on thursday he cant be sure if its going anywhere im disappointed i cant wait to be a grandfather the rest of wills news is domestic and after thirty minutes he makes way for chris chris appears with a toasted cheese and tomato sandwich quite the finest delicacy ive eaten for the past seventy days im still not quite sure how he managed it i begin by briefing chris on shaun forgery and the sketches hes working on for this diary as shaun will be released in three weeks time ive asked him to visit chris at the gallery and present his portfolio chris explains that theres a recognized fee for the reproduction of an artists work but if i want to purchase the originals he will happily negotiate a fair price we go on to discuss botero chris feels that as the great man has such an international following the chance of picking up a cheap original even if sergio does know boteros mother seems unlikely i accept his judgment but still feel its possible sergio might surprise us chris shrugs his shoulders when he changes the subject to tottenham hotspur i quickly replace him with godfrey godfrey brings me a second cheese and tomato sandwich not toasted this time godfrey is a distinguished art critic academic and a friend of twenty years standing we discuss an important matter concerning mr justice potts and a dinner godfrey and his wife ann attended a couple of years ago when the judge made remarks about me which if true i believe should have disqualifed him from presiding over my case godfrey needs to check his diaries before he can confirm the exact evening the supper took place and the reasons why sir humphrey made the remarks he did godfrey promises to keep mary informed ann barker serves on the parole board and another member of the parole board was also present at the dinner thank god for friends who believe in justice the final session spent with all three of them is great fun not least because will brings me another cheese and tomato sandwich i didnt have lunch and now i neednt bother with supper godfrey tells me that he believes ids can win the next election chris pours scorn on the idea and is happy to stake a mars bar on blair who he believes has hardly put a foot wrong since september th lets see what he looks like in a years time counters godfrey i can only wonder where ill be in a years time the call for visitors to leave comes all too soon and i am painfully reminded how much i enjoy the company of old friends when i leave to return to my cell i am stopped and made to suffer the humiliation of a stripsearch two junior officers obviously think it will be fun to tell their friends at the pub tonight that they made lord archer take all his clothes off good heavens they discover i have a penis just like other inmates it spoils what had been a better day however their pettiness is not typical of the majority of officers at wayland pm jimmy is back from four days of home leave this is allowed for nonparole prisoners who have served a third of their sentence jimmys sentence was three and a half years mine four mr justice potts understood the difference only too well jimmy says he cant wait to get a good nights sleep hes had sex with two women in the past fortyeight hours one stupid but sexy the other an undergraduate who likes telling her friends shes sleeping with a convict he cant decide which of them to commit to when hes released in three weeks time darren offers him sage advice if you cant choose between them neither can be right pm for the first time since september th the lead story on the ten oclock news does not come from the other side of the atlantic it still involves terrorists but this time the report comes from northern ireland i wonder how long the problems of osama bin laden will remain paramount as one cant help remembering that saddam hussein is still on the loose i switch off the news and continue my shakespearean marathon by turning to richard ii day saturday september am jimmy now wants to escape hes due to be released in three weeks time but those four days on the outside have given him a taste for freedom he has no intention of returning to jail it was jimmys first offence and he swears it will be his last i have come to admire the way the prison service the probation officers and the parole board are able to assess which prisoners are likely to reoffend and which are not they probably make mistakes which will guarantee them unflattering headlines wishing they had chosen an easier profession but lets at least be thankful someones willing to do the job am during exercise darren tells me about a prisoner whos been shipped out this morning at short notice it seems that he was fast becoming the no drug dealer for the prison and was happy to exchange his wares cannabis cocaine and heroin for phonecards or tobacco however a problem arose because the drug baron on c block was only willing to supply his stock for cash paid into a private bank account on the outside let me remind you how this works prisoners will instruct a friend or relative during visits they consider the phone or letters too risky to place money into an account of an associate of the prison drug dealer who then supplies the gear when the drug baron on c block found his customers were moving their business to the new boy on b block because he didnt require cash something drastic needed to be done yesterday while his rival was in the gym he paid two other inmates cleaners on b block to torch his cell result the prisoner whose cell was torched was immediately transferred to another gaol this means that the drug baron on c block is able to continue his evil trade and will be released in a few weeks time supported by a healthy bank balance pm there is rarely anything worth watching on tv on a saturday night so i finish off richard ii or to be more accurate an assassin finishes off the poor fellow i last saw the play performed at the barbican with sam west in the title role i had been looking forward to his hamlet at stratford but it was not to be day sunday september am i call mary to be told that the police are dropping their enquiry having not even bothered to interview me mary is thinking of writing to baroness nicholson and demanding an apology i tell her its a waste of time as nicholson has neither the grace nor the decency to admit she made a false accusation ms nicholson is a wealthy woman it would be a noble gesture on her part were she to cover kpmgs costs rather than leave the red cross to foot the bill mary goes on to discuss a conversation shes had with godfrey he assured her that he is aware of the importance of any affidavit he might sign and the effect it would have on my appeal she also confirms that she is flying to washington on thursday and hopes that by the time she returns the following tuesday i will have been moved to an open prison am chapel the prison has appointed a new chaplain his name is nick tivey and from his accent i can only assume he hails from somewhere in the north of these islands he looks around thirty and tells me that hes served in two parishes as a priest before becoming a prison chaplain his sermon or chat to the inmates is very informal and more effective for that his theme is how jesus despised the pharaohs bigwigs and much preferred to mix with the sinners us applause breaks out among his congregation of seventeen nine black eight white which has doubled since i last attended chapel he must be doing something right if its only his second week pm i begin to read the tempest and am reminded of john woods consummate performance as prospero at stratford we are such stuff as dreams are made on and our little life is rounded with a sleep but not tonight because shane gbh gym orderly has his tv full on while he watches the sundaynight boxing he likes to join in by offering his opinion on each bout sometimes each punch at the top of his voice prick and wanker are his more repeatable expletives the boxing ends at am so i must have fallen asleep sometime after that day monday october am i mention to shane that he must have kept most of the spur awake until after one oclock to which he replies lets face it jeff im a fuckin yob and youll just have to fuckin well learn to live with it am pottery one prisoner knocks the trunk off another inmates elephant and all hell breaks loose a lot of oaths are uttered as the two of them face up for a fight while the lifers goad them on anne disappears into the next room and its some time before peace is restored i discover later that both inmates involved are due to be released in a few weeks time and neither would have wanted their sentence extended the lifers glower disappointed by the lack of action when the atmosphere returns to near normal i suggest to the two lads that perhaps they both owe anne our teacher an apology two older prisoners both lifers look on to see how the youngsters will react they immediately disappear into the next room and say sorry to anne she looks surprised the lifers nod in my direction i make no excuses for these two louts behaviour but how many of us realize just how lucky we are not to have been subjected to an upbringing where violence bad language and crime are the norm pm three members of the board of visitors come to see me theyve heard im leaving in the near future and i wanted a chance to chat to them the bov are all unpaid volunteers who give service without a great deal of thanks as both sides of the iron door are sceptical about their usefulness almost all the prisoners describe them as a complete waste of space with the usual adjective attached this isnt actually fair because these volunteers have brought about many improvements to prison life over the years and only last year convinced jack straw home secretary at the time to change his mind on a major decision that affected wayland i suggest to them that perhaps they should appear more often in the exercise yard once prisoners get used to seeing them strolling around they may well come up and have a chat and that might give inmates more confidence in them we then discuss several contentious issues in particular the daily gripe about being banged up early on a saturday sunday and monday when we are incarcerated for fourteen hours at a stretch they point out the problem of staff shortages no one likes to admit that there are only four officers on our wing at weekends officers at wayland are currently owed hours of overtime between them and i doubt if its much different in any other prison day tuesday october am the new probation officer asks to see me once ive settled in his office he explains that hes only going through the motions because if i move to a dcat in the near future i wont be seeing him again when he learns that im appealing against both conviction and sentence the meeting comes to an abrupt halt and i am sent back to my cell noon i phone alison to discover that tony mortonhooper has faxed mr carltonboyce governor in charge of movement with my preferences for a dcat latchmere house richmond spring hill buckinghamshire ford sussex stamford hill kent they all sound like minor public schools i know that they are unlikely to allow me to transfer to latchmere house as i dont fulfil their criteria and ford has already turned me down on the grounds that they couldnt handle the

thoughts about that the collection comprises around three hundred drawings and includes works by beerbohm vicky gould kal searle furniss steadman and scarfe amongst many others the collection also

to be transferred to a dcat the daily mail mentions five possible prisons so that they can eventually tell their readers they got it right they didnt none of them bother to say that the police have

in residence nine weeks and shes served the prison service for eleven years im not sure i have a great deal to offer her other than to confirm her worst fears i tell her that i believe every prisoner should leave being able to read and write and that the weekly pay for education ought to be at the same level as any job in the prison in fact i would go further and suggest that it would benefit society more if prisoners received a higher income for agreeing to participate in education rather than cleaning their spur or serving chips wendy tells me that she considers many people are unsuitable for prison and should not be mixing with hardened criminals she will be suggesting in her thesis the use of halfway houses especially as the prisons are equipped to handle only inmates with over presently convicted pm i call mary to warn her that im probably being transferred to a prison over a hundred miles away from london she tells me that ramona my solicitor has tried to phone wayland but the governor is refusing to take her calls which seems in line with her apparent policy of remaining anonymous day friday october am i turn up at the gym and wait for my little special needs group to arrive it will be the last time ill work with them without warning two drug officers appear by the side of the running machine and tell me that my name has come up on the computer for an mdt mandatory drugs test five names come up every day so i cant complain if after nine weeks its my turn im taken to the medical centre to join four other prisoners in a waiting room two look distinctly furtive while the other two appear quite relaxed when the officer puts his head round the door he asks if anyone is ready like a greyhound in the slips i am through that gap before anyone else can reply mr kelvin cross introduces himself and then proceeds to read out my rights before asking me to sign a green form see overleaf i ask for research purposes what would happen if i refused to give a urine sample or sign the form twentyeight days would automatically be added to your sentence i sign the form i disappear into the lavatory while one of the officers watches me through a glass pane after i have handed over my sample i comment that there is no soap in the wash basin mr cross explains that soap added to the urine sample would cloud it and as a further test is not permitted again for another twentyeight days any drugs could have cleared themselves through your system cant argue with that either by the time theyve finished with me its nearly eleven i return to my cell and make notes on the mdt experience only disappointed not to have been able to say goodbye to alex robbie les and paul pm the news is full of riots in pakistan anthrax in new york and food

truth campaign and they have remained friends ever since pm after a few games of backgammon with darren and jimmy i return to my cell to be banged up for another fourteen hours ive become hooked on who wants to be a millionaire i would have failed to make more than ps this week because i didnt know the name of the actor who plays the barman in eastenders however i was able to answer the ps question who is the current leader of the conservative party a michael howard b david davis c iain duncan smith d kenneth clarke the father and son contestants picked david davis hmm i wonder if this is an omen or a prophecy day sunday october am im called to the hospital wing to fill in some forms to confirm im fit to travel when i return to the spur darren tells me it shows that im being transferred tomorrow i find this hard to believe surely mr carltonboyce would have warned me i ask several officers but as no one has informed them either i assume darren must be wrong pm exercise i visit shaun at his cell window and talk through what work will be required for this diary just in case i am shipped out tomorrow one watercolour of the prison one pastel of a cell plus drawings of dale jimmy darren jules steve and nigel if i suddenly disappear shaun promises to deliver them to my agent just as soon as hes released day monday october am mr newson arrives outside my cell door to

in his office who confirms the news and adds that i must start packing immediately and if i dont youll be put on report and may have to stay here indefinitely and not necessarily on the enhanced wing so much for my socalled special treatment as regularly reported in the press i try to say goodbye to as many inmates as possible darren jimmy dale nigel jason jules monster and steve darren helps me pack my large plastic bag and then carries it down to the reception area for me there are three other plastic bags awaiting me in reception they are full of presents from the public everything from bibles to tea towels i thank darren for his kindness and help over the past nine weeks he smiles and offers one last piece of advice once youve settled in north sea camp contact doug hes the hospital orderly and can fix anything for you i try to thank darren inadequately the group guard who will accompany me to lincolnshire introduces himself as andrew and kindly carries two of the plastic bags out to the van so i dont have to make several journeys to my surprise im to travel to my dcat in a sweatbox as if i were a rapist or a murderer andrew explains that he has to drop off another prisoner on the way who is being transferred to a ccat near stamford why are you taking someone from one ccat to another i enquire were having to move this particular prisoner every few days andrew explains he keeps telling everyone that hes a supporter of osama bin laden and it seems that not every other prisoner is in favour of freedom of speech however it still remains our responsibility to keep him alive on the journey to stamford the bin laden supporter demands that the radio be turned up andrew tells him that its quite loud enough already for which i am grateful as its a long slow trek across norfolk and on to the plains of lincolnshire i enjoy seeing tall trees and acres of green english countryside even though its through a glass darkly we arrive at the bin laden prison where my cohabitant departs hes handcuffed and led away i can just glimpse him through my little window a round colourful hat covers his head and a black beard obscures most of his face we move off again but its another hour before i see a signpost north sea camp one mile i begin to think about starting all over again im somewhat fearful belmarsh was hell wayland purgatory have i finally arrived in heaven when the van comes to a halt outside the prison the first thing i notice is that there are no perimeter walls no razor wire no barred gates no arc lights no dogs not even any sign of a prison officer but when i step out of the van i still feel the terror that gripped me on the first day at belmarsh and then again on my arrival at wayland i walk into reception to be greeted by regimental sergeant major daff royal marines rtd weve been waiting for you for fuckin months archer what fuckin took you so long jeffrey archer
