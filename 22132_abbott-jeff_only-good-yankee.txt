jeff abbott only good yankee chapter one there wasnt much to begin with in mirabeau so i was awful surprised when someone started blowing up parts of town i mean we did need a little excitementbut no one in his right mind thought explosives were required the first local landmark to go was fred boolforss toolshed early one monday morning it popped open like a jackinthebox on firespewing trash back issues of playboy and freds unparalleled collection of borrowed lawncare tools fifty feet in the air no one was hurt but i think his immediate neighbors were pissed that their trimmers were returned in small pieces the police were investigating the remains of freds shed when pepper teppers doghouse got blown skyhigh i should explain that no one here calls pepper by her full name except her owner clyda tepper peppers the most spoiled orneriest french poodle you can imagine no wonder the french are so rude with dogs like that around pepper is clydas pride and joyand that woman has spent unholy amounts of money to make that canine look as stupid as possible its fortunate clyda never had children god only knows how she would have sent them dressed to school probably adorned with giant bows on their heads and asses clyda also spared no expense on peppers doghouse it was a miniature version of a french chateau complete with wood trim a slate roof and a little tiny flagpole with french and texan flags rumor had it that clyda had installed a little stereo system to play la marseillaise when pepper entered anyhow about three days after freds toolshed kissed the sky so did peppers chateau fortunately pepper was off at le pooch salon in bavary getting her nails clipped she was undoubtedly put out at having to sleep in a common dog bed clyda was sure pepper was the target of some anticanine campaign and claimed to see poodlehating iraqis lurking around every corner at that point with two pipebomb explosions in town people began to get a mite nervous myself among them my name is jordan poteet and i run the library in mirabeau i found myself checking if anyone had borrowed books on explosives or if any returned tomes featured wires sticking out of them with attached timers the answer was no i wondered if someone bore longburied hatred for clyda or pepper tepper or fred boolfors i didnt wonder long id spent the night at my girlfriend candaces house and i wasnt quite over the guilt i dont feel contrition about spending time with candace her company is pure pleasure but i felt guilty about not pulling my weight at home by staying out all night see i came back to mirabeau several months ago to help take care of my mother shes dying a slow death from alzheimers id given up a good career in textbook publishing in the faraway land of boston to come home to this little river town halfway between austin and houston my sister arlene who i just always call sister and i split duties on taking care of mama fortunately wed had the recent help of an inhome nurse so sister had been able to go off the night shift at the truck stop she cooked at and enjoy a more normal life but whenever i was away from the house and not at work i felt like a shirker even when i was lying in candaces arms it was a beautiful thursday morning with earlysummer light beginning to stream through the louvered shades in candaces bedroom the first rays fell across my eyes and woke me gently i could pick out the details of the room her white frilly lamp shade the clump of friends pictures on the wall i was glad it wasnt kodachromes of her parents staring down at us on the sweaty sheets the delicately flowered blueandyellow wallpaper the comforter that wed crumpled in the night men wont admit it but they love sleeping in a womans room theres an indefinable feeling of lying on a ladys sheets resting on a ladys pillow even breathing the air a lady breathes when shes in her private place i rolled against candace buried my face in her sweetsmelling brown hair and began to nibble at her ear she gave up playing possum i never should have let your long legs in this bed she said pushing me away playfully since shes barely five feet two and im a whole foot taller she cant push me too far its not my long legs you should be worrying about i said innocently hmmm is that so she kissed me and it turned into one of those fiveminute ignorethemorningbreath affairs full of heat and groans and rawedged laughter deep in the throat our relationship was new enough i told myself that this fervor made sense i kept waiting for the boredom to set in except for one other relationship monotony had always entered the picture but it hadnt yet with candace that worried me no end this could be love i thought of saying just that to candace but the words caught hard in my throat and instead i kissed her im a shower not a teller i broke the kiss and smiled down at her i probably should get over to the house and check on sister and i started but didnt get to finish i dont want to hear about your duties right this minute jordy you have your own duty right here she was righti was standing at attention so to speak i know honey but no buts look yall have that nurse now so quit worrying so much you and arlene are getting a break now you can enjoy it cant you i shrugged leaning back on the pillow im trying but its not easy even with all this generosity coming from bob don candace rolled over in disgust ive always counted patience as one of my few virtues jordy but you have just about exhausted mine with bob don goertz id learned a lot since i came home id learned just how exhausting it was to be a caretaker id learned being a librarian was a tough job that was underappreciated and id learned my daddy wasnt my daddy two months ago id landed in the middle of a murder investigation where i found myself a suspect along with bob don goertz mirabeaus reigning carandtruck czar one of the unpleasant secrets that had come out during that investigation was my mothers longago hell not that long ago im only thirtytwo affair with bob don when she and lloyd poteet were briefly separated i was the product of that affair and lloyd who i thought was my daddy raised me with kindness and love and never let me know since lloyd had died several years ago bob don had been aching to be a father to me now bob don was trying to make up for three decades in two months hed nearly killed me with kindness part of his help was hiring the nurse to take care of mama so sister and i could pretend we had normal lives candace had been a pillar during that tough time but i think she was sick and tired of hearing about bob don she spoke from beneath her pillow now what has he done he insisted on giving me some land several acres down by the river mirabeau sits on a curve of the colorado river pretty and lush and verdant the river winds through the gently rolling hills and the stately loblolly pines that encircle mirabeau and never fail to surprise folks who think texas is one big desert the eastern half of central texas is like a garden that god made just for us fortunate few that call places like mirabeau and smithville and la grange home a blue eye peered at me from under the pillow and him giving you land is a problem i feel funny about it i never owned land before what do i do with it well i own plenty and its no shame candaces folks are the biggest bankers in bonaparte county she works with me at the library on a parttime basis and fills the rest of her time with volunteer work the small salaries that annoy librarians are of little worry to candace what you do with land is simple you keep it and let its value climb until someone wants to buy then you sell it and make a little money off of it having completed her introductory lecture in candonomics she threw the pillow at me as i sat up and i caught it does your guilt about not being a poteet know any bounds i havent changed my name yet and i dont intend to i answered with dignity jordan poteet was hardly melodious but jordan goertz it sounded like a danish laxative well sugar if youre not coming back to bed go get the paper and scandalize the neighbors her smile was warm and inviting damn her for complicating my life more she was smart funny andwith her blue eyes thick brown hair and pert nosegorgeous well if she was a complication let my life stay forever difficult i leaned down and kissed her rosebud mouth how about i go get the paper come back in here open the shades and then we scandalize the neighbors mmmm maybe well make the society page i stumbled over to where id shed my clothes last night and kicked into a pair of jeans out of consideration to the bluehaired moral vigilantes of candaces neighborhood i pulled on a shirt i brushed my blond hair out of my eyes and opened the door the morning sky was hazy with summer clouds and the promise of later heat and humidity birds sang in the trees obviously early and already gorged with breakfast worms a gentle breeze stirred against me as i walked barefoot across the dewy grass i savored the early coolnessit wouldnt last long on a july day i saw the curtain in the house across the street dance back slightly then settle miss twyla oudelle undoubtedly had me in her binoculars as i made an immoral spectacle of myself appearing on candaces lawn fresh from a night of unblessed debauchery miss twyla was basically harmless and sweet but shed been one of my science teachers in high school and i felt a little selfconscious with her watching me on my girlfriends lawn i bent to get the paper wondering if i should turn and wiggle my butt at miss twyla it was just then that the first mailbox exploded across the street and two houses down a halfoval white mailbox burst open like a flower of dynamite i jumped up stunned staring at the wooden stump where the mailbox had been the percussive noise rang in my ears ill never admit to having catlike reflexes and i was so surprised i didnt move i just gaped at the chunks of hot metal that were now in the street i hadnt had the requisite five seconds to find my voice when the neighboring mailbox this one in miss twylas yard and right across the street from me detonated miss twyla was fond of country decor and shed mounted her olivegreen mailbox on an antique metal milk tank the cylindrical urn blew apart like a rocket running into the ground id halfway turned when i felt a hot pain in my arm and i fell to the ground i heard but didnt see the next two explode pain shot through my arm and i felt candaces hands on me her voice screaming in my ear she pulled me inside right before her own mailbox erupted and peppered her front door with shrapnel id suffered enough not from the pain in my shoulder or arm although id been hit by flying pieces of miss twylas milk urn my suffering was candace smothering me with the pillow of overworry id been rushed to the mirabeau hospital where i was pronounced damned lucky the shrapnel that hit my arm tore no muscle and severed no artery the wound was explored and cleaned candace had wrenched my arm pulling me into the house so i was awfully sore from my wrist to my shoulder when i woke up my arm was bandaged and slinged and candace was holding my hand it didnt take long for the police and the reporters to show up i had been the only person outside at the time and consequently was the only casualty and witness making me the hub of inquiry the attending physician made me stay an extra day to be sure i wasnt in shock when i got out of the hospital i wanted to see the mess that was in blossom street candace walked with me holding my hand as we surveyed the shattered stumps six mailboxes had exploded in their weird dance one right after another candaces fingers trembled against mine god sweetheart i think of what could have happened to you she said and i squeezed her fingers i didnt want to contemplate that myself i felt luckier than the guy who falls into the outhouse and finds a gold mine i poked a sneakered foot at the remains of candaces mailbox hell now i dont know where im going to have my dirty magazines sent i pretended to pout she laughed nervously and caught herself in time from giving my arm a playful punch jordy dear im so relieved youre all right miss twylas booming alto nearly made me jump miss twyla herself had toddled up behind candace she was still a large woman at seventy tall and fullfigured with her heavy plait of gray hair pulled back into a long ponytail no other elderly lady in mirabeau wore her hair like that and i always thought it looked great on miss twyla miss twyla hugged me hard and i embraced her back as best i could stepping back she turned her chocolatebrown eyes on me and set her big hands on her broad hips in her trademark khaki skirt and white buttondown shirt she looked as formidable as shed been when you screwed up your lab assignments jordy i cannot tell you how upset i am that my mailbox injured you i just feel terrible good god miss twyla thats not your fault we obviously have some lunatic running around town i tend to gesture when i talk and when i forgot motioning with my hurt arm i winced miss twyla frowned in sympathy maybe id get some of her famous pecanspice cookies out of this first a toolshed then a doghouse now mailboxes candace shook her head i dont get this at all whats the point maybe we just have an unambitious terrorist in our midst miss twyla conjectured or hes working up to something bigger the implication of that comment hung in the air candace squirmed and miss twyla frowned again one of mirabeaus police cruisers pulled up slowly in front of us driven by junebug moncrief our resident chief of police junebug and i grew up together in mirabeau and had been close as children wed drifted apart as teenagers and there had been an old competitive tension between us when id returned to town after all the hoopla over that murder in the library a couple of months ago where junebug had thoughtfully not arrested me although id been the prime suspect our friendship had started up again albeit a little uneasily hey jordy he nodded to me in his unhurried drawl how you feeling today he adjusted his eyeglasses to the light looking every inch a smalltown officer with his immaculately pressed uniform his brown burr of hair and his weathered stetson his face was a wellcrafted one strong with character and one that people trusted fine thank you so what was it dynamite tomahawk missile nuclear detonator junebug cleared his throat as unrushed as ever well the lady from the austin bomb squad is gonna come back out and take a gander looks like blasting caps with an attached timer and battery it left lots of fragments for the folks at the austin bomb squad to analyze i swallowed id heard that blasting capsusually used to set off dynamite chargeshad been found in the rubble from freds toolshed and the chateau de tepper along with the remains of an eightinch pipe bomb my spine felt a cold tickle like a ghosts nip although id already given junebug a statement he asked me to retrace my steps of that morningwhere i was on the lawn what i saw i told him omitting only that id seen miss twyla spying on me in the yard no need to embarrass my favorite teacher junebug jotted down more notes after id finished then asked me if id seen anyone near the mailboxes i said no now look here junebug candace intoned this has gone far enough jordy could have been killed just what are you going to do about this junebug began his monotonous answer which was what id already read in our local paper and i tuned out i wanted a tylenol and a cup of coffee then id go to the library surely that would make for a safety first day wrong you dont want former lovers to come calling its as awkward and messy as trying to change your oil with two left thumbs and you especially dont want an old lover showing up at work not when your current paramour is there to make the scene complete i was in my office planning the attack to weed rarely used books off our stacks we have to go through this agony at least once each year determining from our records which volumes have gathered the most dust and sparked the least interest we sell them to dealers hoping to make a little money back so we can buy more books lord knows our regular bookbuying budget isnt growing much i heard giggles out on the floor from my two newest staffers itasca huebler and florence pettus i didnt doubt that some interesting town gossip was being told i believe itasca has a satellite dish implanted in her beehive itascas in her forties a funny bigboned lady with a kind rosy face and a barbed tongue to rival my own florence is closer to my age a mother of two who somehow finds it hard to believe ill of anyone shed grown up poor and black in mirabeau odds that didnt favor success she ended up married to joe pettus owner of a big carpet store over in bavary florence worked at the library because she liked the people the children the smell of the books itasca was a tad more practical having already outlived and outspent two husbands i was grateful to them both thered been no fulltime staff when i took over as chief librarian and both women had learned quickly and worked hard i listened to the laughter crescendo then abruptly cut off no doubt itasca was flinging the latest mud and florence too embarrassed to tell her to stop had just murmured her standard line about getting back to work florence appeared at my door apparently barely able to keep the laughter in oh jordy you have a visitor out at the checkout counter who i asked she didnt say florence murmured great another book salesperson no doubt ready to pitch the latest bestseller that no small rural library could do without i put on a smile and sauntered outand saw lorna wiercinski perched on the checkout counter the shock value of seeing lorna was roughly akin to seeing jesus sitting there with a hi im back button i confess that my jaw moved up and down without any sound emerging im sure lorna appreciated that upclose view of my molars ive got something thats overdue tex lorna rumbled in her thick boston accent and yes rumbled is the right word lornas a big girl nearly six foot with long alabaster legs a broad slavic face deepset gray eyes an admirable bosom if size matters to you and a stunning mane of jetblack hair dressed in a miniskirted business suit with black pumps that made her as tall as me she would have gathered a crowd not merely stuck out in one she leaned back on the counter and fluttered her eyelashes i do declare she intoned in an awful pseudosouthern accent that boys got the vapors after a long arduous search i found my voice lorna oh my god i was always one for witty banter she smiled a rich luxurious smile id seen many times before it was her patented catwhoatethecanaryandthefish grin full of selfsatisfaction at her own cleverness its good to see you too jordan she crossed her legs and leaned forward still breathing tex keep those involuntary responses going babe and what the hell happened to your arm i told myself okay shes here just deal with it i stepped up and hugged her awkwardly keeping my slinged arm close by me i dont believe in just shaking hands with someone youve slept with albeit in the past for three years she hugged back a little too warmly for my taste when i pulled my head back she planted a kiss right on my mouth a friendly peck i could have dealt with lornas hello kiss melted toenails my eyes popped wide and i saw a grinning itasca and a frowning florence which of course following todays theme of keep jordy in trouble was when candace returned from reshelving the stacks to her credit she didnt scream or rage or faint oh no what she did was far worse she was icy calm and polite i broke the embrace and tried to think of a wellmannered way to wipe the kiss off my mouth and not insult lorna i instead sucked my offending lips into my mouth thinking that hiding them from view might lessen my culpability i looked instead like an old man whod had his dentures yanked right from his gums candace hi i said brightly she smiled her chilliest smile the one reserved for people who made a snotty comment about someone she liked i stumbled onward feeling totally uncool this is an old friend from boston lorna wiercinski lorna this is candace tullyum my girlfriend i gestured feebly toward candace no one could have ever deduced my taste in women from looking at these two lorna was tall where candace was petite lorna was dressed like a businesswoman in heat a la the heroine of some jackie collins miniseries candace looked like shed tiptoed out of laura ashley university with a bachelors in prim lorna was smiling candace was not if id had one ounce of sense i would have kept talking but i was a little too rattled by lornas unexpected appearance candy how nice to meet you lorna offered a hand candace smiled and took lornas hand she looked ready to keep it in a jar its candace ms weirdchintzy and how nice to meet you lorna ignored the mispronunciation jab after all candace had nearly gotten her name right youll have to forgive me ive taken jordan quite by surprise he certainly wasnt expecting to see me ive just arrived from boston since hes never mentioned youa glare went jordywardim not surprised how nice of you to visit and what brings you here candace asked i was awful interested in that question myself so were itasca and florence who edged closer i stopped by to donate some books lorna said innocently handing me a plastic bag i regarded it with suspicion shed always been one for yanking my chain peering inside i saw that lorna felt that the mirabeau public library was missing some key volumes the collected stories of eudora welty one of my personal favorites the tourists guide to new england andoh boythe kama sutra now would that go under sports or biology two of those might be for you jordan can you guess which ones lorna smiled since i already owned a wellworn copy of the welty it wasnt a hard guess itasca made a snatch at the bag shall i catalog those for you i yanked them back somehow keeping my smile in place ill do that later thanks itasca candace crossed her arms and one eyebrow went up questioningly i have a proposition for you jordan lorna beamed and the air temperature continued its downward slide id never thought of candace as possessive before but i knew her well enough to sense the seething under her calm exterior like i said before candace is plenty smart for an old girlfriend to show up all the way from new englandi took a deep breath do you now candace asked i drew closer to candace to show my allegiance she leaned unthinkingly im sure against my hurt arm i winced but let her stay lorna pulled herself down from the counter yes candy a business proposition she blinked as though shocked at the thought that she could have any other suggestions for me id like to discuss it this evening with you jordansay over dinner nothing wrong with mixing business with pleasure gosh lorna youve kind of popped up from nowhere and taken me by surprise i wanted to convince candace that i hadnt been expecting lorna cant you tell me what this is about lorna smiled at candace id prefer to discuss this privately with you and not during your working hours she glanced around the modest library not exactly like your old office is it tex i squirmed at the nickname up north it had seemed clever and given me the vaguest sense of home now it seemed silly no its a real different office its better if you ask me i hesitated well lorna why dont you come to the house we can talk there say at six i jotted down the address and directions for her fine jordan its wonderful to see you again by the way you never did say what happened to your arm i had a little accident i didnt feel like discussing mirabeaus mad bomber its okay hows your mother she asked unexpectedly lorna had been none too pleased that id left bostonand herto come home to take care of mama about the same im sorry well ill see you at six nice meeting you candy with that she turned nodded at florence and itasca and sauntered out the door like a hurricane moving in from the coast the only difference was that hurricanes are indifferent to the destruction and chaos they cause i turned to candace now listen to me candy how dare she call me that after i told her what my name was im no confection her voice was low and cool and anything but sweet im sorry you saw her kiss me she took me by surprise how stupid do you think i am jordy of course she took you by surprise that was all over your face and i could read it like a book or in this case a comic strip itasca walked up to me and very thoughtfully wiped lipstick off my mouth with a crumpled tissue she is always one for attention to detail even at the worst possible times i liked your friend she announced bluntly shooting a glance at candace im fond of itasca because shes smart and funny but i dont like her resentment of candaces money itasca hadnt been particularly supportive of my relationship with candace shes gorgeous and shes got style is that what you call style itasca her throwing herself at a man who left her months ago candace parried i handed over the bag of books and she peered inside how transparent she finally said your favorite writer a guidebook to her stomping ground and a sex manual honestly jordan is this the kind of woman you dated up north note she called me jordan big trouble ahead im sure she was just glad to see jordy the generoushearted florence piped up itasca rolled her mascaraencased eyes some people might be critical of a lady like her that takes what she wants itasca stuffed her tissue back in her purse and took the opportunity to reexamine her own makeup im not takes what she wants candace sputtered what on earth makes you think shes going to get jordy back itasca closed her compact with an authoritative air jordy didnt seem too broken up to see her did you honey three pairs of eyes trained on me and i felt as embarrassed as a preacher with a broken zipper look itasca youre as wrong as wrong can be candace im as surprised as you are to see her here those books are just lornas idea of a joke i cant imagine that she wants me back and i dont know anything about her business proposal florence attempted peace well now that she knows jordys involved with someone else im sure shell leave him alone excuse us please candace said taking my good arm and leading me back to my office she shut the door she crossed her arms uncrossed them and crossed them again just one thing you had no idea she was coming none and i dont know what this secret business proposition is about either when i left boston lorna worked for a consulting firm that specialized in realestate development i dont have any idea why she wants to see me shes a good kisser isnt she candace demanded of course not i bleated what did candace want from me an undying pledge of commitment we hadnt discussed future planstoo much had happened in those tense couple of months when wed come together and realized our feelings for each other after the double punch of a murder investigation and learning about my parentage long talks about the days ahead held little appeal i was concentrating too much on past lies and present woes look ill see her find out what this is all about if its just a ploy to get me back in her life ill swat her on the ass and send her on her merry way her frown didnt waver cmon you trust me to handle her dont you i asked whatever this is it isnt trouble weve already had our share of that today she nodded nearly imperceptibly then hugged me being careful of my arm and shoulder after a moment she let me go and went off into the stacks i sank down into the front desk chair my body and mind felt stunnedexcept for my lips which tingled from lornas kiss no trouble i told myself is going to come of this of course i was dead wrong it was trouble and in the worst way chapter two its nothing but damned carpetbaggers miss twyla fumed in my office for miss twyla to utter the word damned portended serious trouble shed rushed into the library late in the afternoon id felt tired and lethargic and my arm was awful sore i should have listened to the doctor gone straight home and pulled a pillow over my head right now all i wanted was some quiet an icycold celis bock and another tylenol if i didnt watch it id get chemically dependent and end up on donahue discussing my woes with nine million people librarians who are injured by prank bombs then have close encounters with exgirlfriends id do wonders for the shows nielsens no doubt only problem was id be the sole panelist i had been ready to call it a day when miss twyla arrived looking bad mad and demanding some of my time what was that about carpetbaggers miss twyla i leaned back in my office chair that dated from when vinyl was first invented and tried to find a comfortable position carpetbaggers miss twyla repeated im sure the term has more emotional weight with her than it does with me since i dont recall using the word except in a history paper would you care to explain have you had the pleasure of meeting miss lorna wiercinski and mr greg callahan miss twyla asked id had all sorts of pleasures with lorna but didnt care to discuss them with miss twyla yes maam i know ms wiercinski we knew each other in boston i havent met greg callahanwhos he i paused im supposed to meet with lorna this evening about a business proposal well hide the silver miss twyla advised those two are nothing but thieves they want our land jordy i had this sudden image of lorna bartering with chief manhasset tossing a few extra beads on the pile what land the land you and i and some others own that fronts down on the river they want to buy it up and build condos condos in mirabeau mirabeauans are house dwellers except for the hardy few who call the trailer park home and those who live in the towns one rather shabby apartment complex so this was the reason lorna was in town goodit had nothing to do with our former relationship then i remembered the kiss and lornas dictum that there wasnt a damn thing wrong with mixing business with pleasure i know its stupid whod want to buy a condo in mirabeau but thats what they want and weve got to stop them condos would ruin that lovely view of the river not to mention cause all sorts of nasty runoff into the colorado and possibly bring an undesirable elementweekenders miss twyla shuddered maybe that wouldnt be so bad miss twyla it could pull some money into town mirabeau wasnt exactly lacking in funds but aside from cotton and peanut farming cattle pig raising a couple of bedandbreakfasts a few odd service industries and some antique stores there wasnt much to hold folks which made me in reflection even more curious as to why lorna or anyone else would want to build condos its time for action miss twyla announced and if shed had a walking cane im sure she would have stamped it to emphasize her point im calling a meeting of all concerned citizens tonight those developers might think they can ignore me cause im old but theyre dead wrong it seems to me that the easiest way to stop them is just not to sell them the land the fire in her eyes scared me a little miss twyla was one of those old ladies who once theyve gotten their dander up arent likely to put it back down until theyve had their way plus most of the oudelles while respectable had turned out crazy in their later years miss twyla had taught chemistry at the high school and it always made us a tad nervous that she had so many poisons at hand of course jordy but we must present a united front ive gone to the county courthouse and found out who all owns the land these yankees are after its you me bob don goertz here she harrumphedhad the gossip about my relationship with bob don reached her we had made no formal announcements but junebug candace and a few others in town knew after clearing her throat she continued dee loudermilk and your uncle bidwell i groaned at the thought of meeting with that group first of all let me clarify that bidwell poteet is no longer my uncle although i may call him that just for purposes of torture uncle bid redefines the term smalltown shyster he is possibly the least ethical lawyer produced by the texas education system which has never been shortchanged when it comes to producing lousy lawyers but i liked dee loudermilkshe was the mayors wife and although her husband was deadly dull i enjoyed dees wry sense of humor i dreaded the thought of bob don and bid together bid enjoyed badmouthing bob don in his ever so subtle fashionas subtle as a skeeter bite on the end of your nose is this really necessary miss twyla maybe lorna and this greg callahan will change their minds about buying the land if they see the towns not behind them hardly miss twyla huffed theyve already offered me an obscene sum for my acres an obscene sum i could use that and im not ashamed to admit it id given up a lot careerwise to return to mirabeau and librarians dont get paid diddly sister wasnt exactly opening up a numbered swiss bank account with her earnings at the end of the road truck stop either i felt uncomfortable enough with letting bob don hire a parttime nurse to take care of mama condos on the river didnt sound so bad i have taken further action miss twyla stood and opened the door to my office nina please join us she widened the door slightly to admit a young woman my first thought was oh god shes one of those hippie herbalists mirabeaus had their share these folks generally women come out to small towns like mirabeau and set up shop selling herbs to the few tourists that wander off highway and stop in mirabeau god knows the locals wont buy their botanicals those folks who dont believe in herbal medicine wont touch them and those who do know where to find them in the surrounding countryside the woman looked a bit older than me perhaps in her midthirties she was plain and her attire didnt help much in my opinion her garba long shapeless beige dressgave her the look of a modernday shepherdess a series of sand dollars shells and beads ensconced her thin dark throat she could have decorated a beach all by herself her coalblack hair was cut short and not stylishly the dark hue of her complexion suggested hispanic ancestry and her black eyes gleamed with intelligence behind wirerim frames she greeted me with an earthy smile jordy this is nina hernandez shes an environmental activist from austin nina this is our town librarian jordy poteet jordy also owns some of the land that those yankees want i felt nina hernandezs eyes coolly assessing me as though measuring me for some internal scale of worth she gave my hand a twohanded shake i hope that you will stand firm mr poteet folks like intraglobal development will stop at nothing to get what they want intraglobal i take it that miss twyla has told you about wiercinski and callahan being in town you make them sound like foreign agents i said nina sank into a chair next to miss twyla dont underestimate these people ive dealt with callahan before hes cool ruthless and determined to win i wondered if she could be described the same way the intense gleam in her eyes screamed typea personality even if she was a tree hugger we already suspect that theyve been in touch with your uncle and with the mayors wife already how long have these folks been in town i asked lorna stalking mirabeau possibly exchanging gossip with my friends and familyhorrible thought i hope she spoke kindly of me wiercinski just arrived this morning callahans been here two days staying at the mirabeau b lamar bedandbreakfast nina jerked her head toward miss twyla like an officer commending a private we can thank miss twyla here for ferreting out that information miss twyla looked inordinately pleased with herself i had to admit that nina chose her allies well now mr poteet well have to mobilize to fight intraglobal callahan will certainly be rallying the forces of irresponsible development to combat us the beads around her neck jangled gently in odd counterpoint to her strident tone miss twyla told nina that i was to meet with lorna this evening nina eyed me like someone prodding daniel into the lions den i dont know much about wiercinski nina said half to herself but shes got to be tough if callahan hired her he chews broken glass for dinner now what youve got to do mr poteet is i dont usually interrupt folks but for her i made an exception i smiled look ms hernandez im sure your concern for mirabeau is genuine but ive known lorna wiercinski for a long time i will listen to her business proposition and then make my own decision she stared at me like id leaned over and spat in her face i suppose you want to give them the benefit of the doubt but let me assure you ms hernandez i dont take kindly to outsiders coming into mirabeauwhether to buy land from us or talk us out of selling itand then thinking were a bunch of hicks who cant think independently and need to be told what to do i stood and nodded at miss twyla who was looking a mite uncomfortable ill be glad to talk to you hear yalls side after ive talked to lorna lorna already on a firstname basis with the enemy are you mr poteet ninas smile faded yes maam i am i wasnt about to admit to having slept with the enemy but that doesnt mean that im not going to evaluate both sides now if you ladies will excuse me i have work to do miss twyla gathered her purse close to her jordy the meetings at eight tonight at my house i certainly hope you will be there ill consider it miss twyla i watched as the two women left marching arm in arm to defeat the forces of development that was all miss twyla needed another cause i sat back down at my desk but between thoughts of candace and lorna i didnt get much work done much to my surprise when i got home sister was getting ready to work a rare late shift she had promised to cover for a friend at the truck stop sister cooks the kind of comfort foods that truckers run speed traps for chickenfried steaks catfish thick jalapeno cornbread butter beans with chunks of ham its amazing that her twelveyearold boy mark and i arent fatter than hogs i found her in the kitchen sticking a pan of chicken enchiladas in the stove i leaned down and kissed the top of her head she straightened and forced a smile hey your arm feeling better shed been terrorizing the hospital staff into taking excellent care of me and now that her shock over my close call had subsided shed turned to her usual pastime teasing me if you were sleeping in your own bed you wouldnt have gotten hurt she yanked her white cooks uniform straight and ran a hand through her thick blonde hair shes still one of the prettiest women in mirabeau with her high cheekbones and determined mouth but she doesnt seem interested in getting hooked up again after the rotten way her husband abandoned her i wasnt surprised good thing your hooter didnt get blown off course small targets tend to survive very funny i enjoyed having sister tease me again shed suffered a shock weeks ago when id had to tell her about mama and bob don i suppose that technically we were only half sister and half brother now but when youve been raised together you dont feel much different about each other plus i wasnt about to start calling her half sister just doesnt sound right you know i quickly filled her in on what had happened with lorna and nina hernandez sisters lovely green eyes widened shed heard enough about lorna when i lived up in boston thats what you get for dating a yankee jordy she admonished me i beg your pardon sister looked at me like i was the town idiot for gods sakes you were the one that complained yankees were kind of brusque and rude and made fun of your accent that just shows how unpleasant they can be well this lorna ymcaorwhateverhernameis gets hold of a nice southern boy whos been raised right and is more than presentable im sure you treated her nicer than any of those yankee fellers ever did why wouldnt she track you down and tree you like a coon lornas not the tracking kind sister shes here aint she with that sister sailed out of the room in triumph you and clo can eat those chicken enchiladas for supper marks staying at his friend randys tonight ill be back at eleven the porch door slammed behind her i pulled a cold bottle of celis from the fridge and shook two tylenol out of a bottle gulping them down i sipped the beer you sure are stupid taking those with alcohol a voice rumbled behind me i put on my best smile and turned to face my own houses gentle ogre clo butterfield watched me her beefy dark arms folded across her ample chest her black face was set in half stern disapproval half amusement her saltandpepper hair was set in an improbable perm i shook the little bottle of capsules at her it doesnt say anything about that on the bottle i said defensively clo snorted deep and low like a bull scrutinizing an amateur matador everbody knows you dont take drugs with alcohol didnt they teach you nothin at college i pointed with the bottom of my beer bottle at the oven sister left some enchiladas cooking in there for our dinner thanks but i got a nose i can smell em she frowned at my arm and my sling cant believe the foolishness in this town some idiot blowing up mailboxes come on upstairs let me look at your bandage see if it needs changing i followed our angel of mercy up the stairs her white uniform tight across her heavy body hows mama i asked fine same as when you left here if clo disapproved of my nocturnal wanderings to candaces bed she wasnt going to say so outright i followed her down to mamas room and we both stood in the doorway looking in on my mother trapped inside her private shrinking world she sat in her bed a colorful quilt made by her own mother tossed lightly across her legs she didnt seem to feel the july heat clo had just washed and combed mamas hair and she looked like a small child fresh from an afternoon swim in the creek she stared like a blind person would at the small color television on her dresser she couldnt stand the volume turned up loud so the channel news anchor whispered his latebreaking stories to her uncaring ears her hand moved repetitively across the quilt caught in a loop of echoes she could not break my throat doesnt tighten anymore when i see mama like this ive learned to play the waiting game of alzheimers reluctantly acknowledging that she will never recover and waiting for the day when she breathes her last i sometimes hope for it so i can have more memories of her as she was rather than have them supplanted by memories of the shell she is now in the past mama would have been on her feet in a moment demanding to know why my arm was in a sling comforting me far beyond my need for it doctoring me herself making me laugh at her worry smothering her little boy with a nearly irritating level of attention now she stared at me through me no more seeing the sling on my arm and her nurse standing next to me than she did air itself clo spoke to her in a far gentler tone than shed ever used with me or sister anne jordys come home for supper mama didnt even nod she glanced at me as though i were a bothersome stranger and turned her attention to the television my throat tensed mamas not even talking as much as she used to when her babblings were annoying and id have to hold my patience to keep from pulling my ears off now the silence she offered was worse like the quiet of a grave i went over to her and gently squeezed her hand she kept watching the screen clo was undeterred ill feed you your supper in a minute anne im gonna take a look at jordy he hurt his arm out fighting organized crime i smiled but mama did not today she was uninterested in my adventures with clo following i went to my own room her ministrations did not take long she examined my stitches critically made a noise in her throat cleaned the wound with an antiseptic wipe from her nurses bag and put on a fresh bandage this damn world some say folks like your mama are crazy but someone who blows up mailboxes they the loony ones she pressed the bandage onto my skin werent you scared i was too surprised now today that was scary i told clo about lornas reappearance in my life candaces disapproval and my rocky meeting with miss twyla and nina hernandez dating yankees dont you know better than that she finally opined you dont think i was celibate all that time up there do you i eased my arm into a fresh shirt i think what you need boy is a little celibacy do you some good then you dont have womenfolk arguing over you celibacy never killed a man well i have a feeling that if candace has her way ill be home alone for weeks to come builds character clo rumbled she patted my good shoulder and moved toward the door ill go get annes dinner speaking of yankees i ventured my old girlfriends coming over tonight apparently she has a business proposition for me ill just bet she does clo nodded monkey business most likely i think ill invite her to dinner sister made enough enchiladas for us all clo didnt argue let me know if your shoulder bothers you any you staying here tonight i pondered the possibilities yeah i am i didnt imagine candace was particularly aching to have me climb into her bed plus i needed some time to think the doorbell rang i hate it when your past catches up with you chapter three lorna stood behind a big bouquet of brightly colored flowersa gift for mama the introductions were quick and to the point clo sized up lorna and the flowers made polite noises and excused herself to go feed dinner to mama up in her room lorna still wore her business suit and looked as uncomfortable as anyone in a suit in the dead of texas summer would be she stood in the middle of the living room shifting from foot to foot casting her eyes over the white wicker furniture the mural of family photos that covered one wall and the antique coffee table that seemed to hold a patina of dust as part of its finish i offered her a beer and she accepted thanks for the flowers i said my voice sounding awkward it was real thoughtful of you i headed into the kitchen youre welcome the old homestead isnt exactly what i thought it would be she called to me as i knelt before the fridge getting a couple of brews what did you expect i called back a ranch maybe like in giant not all these trees and greenery and rivers god knows its hot and humid enough wheres the tumbleweeds and the dust devils youre too far east lorna texas is big remember not all of it looks like the backlot of a john wayne movie i returned to the living room and caught her giggling over an old school picture of me i was smiling with my two front teeth noticeably absent toothless wonder with a cowlick you look like dennis the menace she said her clipped boston accent flattening the vowels and cutting words abruptly i hadnt heard anyone talk like her in quite a while and memories started crouching ready to spring i pushed them back i handed her a cold bottle of celis beer and she raised it in toast to seeing you again she said softly i quickly clinked my bottle against hers unsure if i should return the toast we settled on the couch she sipped cautiously and made a face whats this belgianstyle beer brewed in austin i said she sipped again held the beer in her mouth shrugged and swallowed it was an action so typical of her that i felt wed been apart mere minutes rather than months i forced my eyes away from her and stared at mamas empty chair until she spoke beljunstaaaahl beeeyur she repeated laughing my god i dont mean to razz you sweetie but your accents gotten wicked thick you sound like an extra from the dukes of hazzard did you pahk the cah out by the yahd i parried imitating her boston tones i didnt realize that was the kings english dripping from your tongue she laughed goodnaturedly a booming hearty sound lorna never did do anything halfway youre ragging back the old jordan i guess your little scarlett ohara didnt castrate you after all i shrugged enjoying the banter despite myself she doesnt want to lose a good thing shes cuteill give her that i thought she might stamp her foot and say fiddledeedee but she must be made of sterner stuff than i gave her credit for she sipped at her beer if id only had a camera to capture your expression when you saw me sorry if i shocked you but you know i always like to make an entrance you always prided yourself on surprising me lorna and thanks for the book donation she laughed again you know im devoted to fine literature and you still surprise me jordan staying here she glanced around the room dont get me wrong your mothers home is quaint are you really happy living here my face felt hot im allowed to pick on mirabeau but i dont like it when other folks do i love it here this is where i grew up dont get me wrong i admire you for wanting to help your family you always were a bit too noble for your own good its justit seems a step backward excuse me lorna rose and began striding around the room she paused at the coffee table first of all darling dont tell me youre readingshe paused to peer down at the newspaper and magazines on the coffee table the stars royal family special edition and southern living those are my sisters i protested i wasnt about to admit i flipped through tabloids for stories on my favorite royal fergie i like bigboned redheads in bikinis anyhow southern living has some good articles on refinishing furniture that you are even thinking of refinishing furniture shows how much youve slid jordan lorna opined i recall you were always one for cultural events darling whats on the bill this season at the mirabeau lyric opera the mirabeau symphony and the mirabeau avantgarde playhouse rossini beethoven ionesco theres no need to be nasty i snapped she sat down next to me that enigmatic smile still on her face no nastiness intended im sorry if i offended i think mirabeau is delightful but my god jordan your presence here just seems impossible why this is where i came from lorna id already spent most of my life here when you and i met but it didnt seem like you were smalltown oh yes you had that charming drawl to your voice but you were so athome in boston you seemed so athome with me i didnt have an answer for her she shrugged god i guess im lucky that i didnt find you in overalls out picking cotton and singing the yellow rose of texas she smiled at me her warm rich smile and patted my hand oh well you can take the boy out of the country but not the country out of the boy being at home obviously agrees with you tex you just look wonderful i am the exact same person i was up in boston and i wish you wouldnt call me tex it really really makes you sound like a yankee having scored a point against me she grinned again oh okay i certainly dont want to sound like a yankee but you do look great her gray eyes took on a wicked amusement leaning back against the couch she examined my backside still have a butt you could bounce a quarter off of i suppose youre running your ridiculous five miles per day she giggled are you still limber i hope you havent already read those books i brought you i threw out my back on page thirtysix i rolled my eyes standard lorna shifting a discussion of what had been between us to merciless teasing to patting my fanny shed been the most aggressive intimidating rousing lusty woman id ever known i wasnt about to let her work her spell on me why dont i get some guacamole and chips to go with the beer i offered escaping into the kitchen can i help lorna asked just make yourself comfortable i could hear her humming to herself as she examined more of the family photos as i mashed avocados i found my mind drifting back to our first meeting in many ways lorna was the type of girl you might meet in a barbut of course we hadnt i wasnt into guzzling chardonnay while surrounded by ferns wed met at an art exhibit at a posh gallery in bostons back bay neighborhood on newbury street brooksjellicoe the textbook publisher i worked for was publishing a volume on modern american art and one of the artists featured was fauve yes that was his name fauve one name like madonna or cher or liberace anyhow fauve was quite the respected creator of slabs of rock covered with paint i think they were supposed to represent anger or angst or angolai forget which the artbooks editor robert goldstein was a good friend and asked if i wanted to accompany him to this exhibit ive always liked music more than art but robert said thered be cute women and free food editors love free food and some of us like cute women too the exhibit was crowded people divided into chattering clumps animatedly debating art and music and who fauve was sleeping with i noticed how many folks were keeping their backs to the paintings after id seen a couple i didnt find that such a bad idea they were ugly and didnt have a lick of artistic merit plus i didnt want anything interfering with my digestion of all that free food id consumed i saw lorna before she saw me she stood nearby staring perplexedly at an expanse of craggy granite mounted on the wall the rises in the stone were painted pink and the valleys were a mix of blues and purples ill never forget what she was wearing charcoalcolored suit pants a tight white blouse with french cuffs and an orangecolored blazer with a huge silver pin on it her look was cool reserved and a little provocative at the same time her thick dark hair was corded into a braid thankfully with no bow on it she stared at the picture and i stared at her ignoring my friend roberts lamentations about the new england patriots and their losing ways i didnt see the heavyset lug until he was practically on top of lorna nearly knocking her over in a bear hug she wrenched free whirling god bertil you scared the crap out of me the man she called bertil was big around six foot four with a thick burr of blond hair and a vacant look in his watery blue eyes he placatingly placed his mitts on lornas shoulders sorry lorna didnt mean to startle you he was either swedish or drunk or both i see youre using absolut as this evenings cologne lorna observed now goodbye wait wait lorna dont go bertil lurched obviously having partaken too much of the grape he seized lornas arm and spun her back do you want to lose one of your meatballs she snapped i had started to move forward to help her when another hulking type this one a dark thicknecked fellow intervened pulling lorna and the swede apart let her go bertil the dark man rumbled oh great a male model to the rescue im safe as long as you dont get hit in the face lorna said she stepped back from both men why dont you both just leave me alone go spend the evening learning how to spell he ignored her determined to be a paladin this guy bothering you lorna he puffed up his chest pushing it within an inch of the infuriated swede maybe i should make sure he behaves like a gentleman you be a gentleman yourself trevor lorna demanded i dont need a bodyguard yeah trevor she doesnt need you bertil gave trevors chest a little jab with his finger listen here butthead i dont gentlemen gentlemen please control yourself the star of the exhibit fauve himself intervened he was a tall thin willow of a man wearing a ridiculouslooking copy of the smalllapeled gray suit the beatles favored back in the sixties a curve of hair hung artistically in his face showing his great sensitivity and a gentle nature fauve put a protective arm around lorna his hand perilously close to her right buttock and flexed his fingers as though ready to squeeze gentlemen really no need to fight ms wiercinski is my special guest this evening so i do hope that you wont resort to fisticuffs over her go sculpt fauve lorna blurted pushing his hand away i didnt see it at the time but i can imagine the glint that appeared in her eye they werent fighting over me they were discussing which of them hates your rock piles more what bertil exclaimed his jaw dropping i later learned bertil was a corporate art buyer whose boss was a close friend and admirer of fauves lorna trevors face turned pale i later found out that trevor was an aspiring painter who was panting to get under fauves wing she whirled leaving her wouldbe protectors squabbling in her haste to flee them she barreled right into me her eyes locked with mine but she lowered her gaze and pushed past me excuse me i followed her the din of trevor and bertils protestations fading with fauves outraged cries over their deplorable lack of taste i caught up with her as she left the gallery venturing into the cold march air of boston so much for culture she yelled at the night sky maam i called to her are you okay she paused and regarded me with her gray eyes look buddy i dont need any more guardians tonight i dont believe you do i smiled you handled the three artistic stooges in rare style she took a step toward me i take it youre not from boston style usually has just one syllable being teased about my accent always rankled me but from her it didnt seem too bad no not originally im from texas so why didnt you leap to my defense arent cowboys supposed to be chivalrous only to womenfolk that need our help you obviously didnt maam i turned maam into two syllablesand she laughed i tried not to waver on my feet a sure sign of nervousness this girl made me feel timid but i rallied my courage for those unforgettable gray eyes im fed up with spraypainted rocks wanna get some coffee or maybe a drink she considered me for a moment measuring me on the internal ruler that women must in these dangerous times i dont usually go out with men i dont know i offered my hand jordan poteet i never ever went by jordy up northi thought it sounded too hick she didnt laugh but she looked amused what a perfectly fantastic name definitely american unlike bertil trevor or fauve she took my hand and shook it holding it a moment longer than necessary as if taking my pulse im lorna wiercinski mispronounce it twice and die its not as american as your name but hey this is boston the great unmelted pot she pointed down the block theres a pub on the corner i know the owner so if you give me trouble hell kick the shit out of you we could have an irish coffee odd invitation but i didnt mind i offered her my arm judging by her expression it might have been leprous god help me just how much of a southern gentleman are you she laughed finally placing her hand on my forearm not nearly enough for my own good i answered it was the strangest date of my life we each drank three irish coffees sinfully rich with cream and whiskey then after two hours of laughing and talking she asked me back to her apartment it was an upscale condo not far from the gallery id wondered if wed end up in bed but she wanted to play poker with me and her neighbor mrs perkins shed suggested it id agreeda little too stunned to argue and shed gone down the hall to fetch mrs perkins shell be right over lorna said pouring us each a whiskey as soon as she gets her money and puts in her teeth i hope she doesnt get them confused hate to have her ante up her molars she laughed ill see your bicuspids and raise you an incisor as it turned out the poker game was fun and although i kept wondering what lornas bed felt like i didnt get to sample it mrs perkins claimed she was on a fixed income considering the neighborhood her fixed income was most likely a trust fund so i had to let her win her money back and we played into the wee hours when the amiable mrs perkins won the stunning total of twenty dollars she toddled off and lorna called me a cab would you have dinner with me tomorrow night i prayed this funny smart girl would say yes yes i would she answered almost shyly you see you passed tests number one and two first you didnt presume youd sleep here and second mrs perkins liked you she let you win at first so the gamed go on longer yes i think dinner is a real possibility our goodnight kiss was brief but sweet one of those you hold in your memory like a treasure and so it beganthree years worth of wonderful remembrances we discussed marriage once or twice but lorna was gunshy her own mother having been divorced three times said mother was somewhere in toronto with a much younger man who didnt believe in matrimony i wasnt sure i wanted to stay in boston and lorna seemed firmly planted in her native soil so the topic was dropped and we just enjoyed each other my return to texas to care for my mother was a bucket of ice water in lornas face i asked her to accompany me she said noshe couldnt do that and i left so much for us it hurt but i hadnt looked back lost in my memory i hardly noticed her hand close over mine as i finished stirring the avocado and spices lornas voice was low you havent calledor writtenin months i bit my upper lip i dont think youre here because i havent stayed in touch which im sorry for i guess i just thought it would be better if we broke cleanly i took the dip and a big bowl of tostadas into the living room lorna followed me so youre not coming back to boston ever babe what happens when your mother dies do you plan to stay here forever leave it to lorna to ask all the tough questions in the first five minutes i dont know ill worry about that when it happens spare me jordan thats never been how your mind works her voice was serious now and her tongue kept darting out to moisten her lips nervous i didnt want to ask you such a difficult question but i think i deserve to know its more complicated than just mamas illness lorna a lot has happened since i came back she sat down and scooped up guacamole on the corner of a chip so talk tell me so i recounted it all starting with beta harchers murder and my discovery that my daddy wasnt my daddy after alland trying to have a relationship with my actual father ill give lorna credit she stayed quiet throughout the story when i was done she took my hand my god baby i cant believe it im so so sorry are you okay i nodded im surviving but i dont plan on leaving town right when mama dies that may not be for a long time anyhow lorna and i have bob don to considerand candace too as soon as i laid eyes on her i could see you marrying that scarlett clone and playing the gentleman planter on her money so you know about candaces money a chip halted halfway to my mouth is this part of your landacquisition deal with intraglobal finding out whos got what where she looked startled then shook her head dark curls jiggling around her face im not surprised you know about the land deal i suppose word gets around in such a small town she opened her briefcase and began to shuffle papers perhaps its best we simply put our former relationship on hold for the moment it really doesnt matter im not here to lure you back to new england the truth is im here to offer you a reasonable purchase price for your land her shift in gears was so abrupt i was taken aback not like lorna shed already observed how id changed perhaps she had changed as well fine wed talk business surely that would be less stressful than the earlier topic us i know intraglobal development wants to build condominiums right an entire resort condominium community jordan lorna amended for me designed for residents who desire a higher standard of living that should narrow down the candidates i interjected but she pressed on and those from austin and houston who seek a comfortable weekend getaway on the shores of the colorado she began to spread out maps architectural drawings that included a golf course pool tennis courts and clubhouse construction schedules and environmentalimpact statements she told me in more detail than i cared to hear exactly what the development plans were it still seemed ludicrous and impossible lorna wiercinski who had shared my bed and my heart and my sense of humor for three years was here i listened to her overrehearsed presentation nodding over her figures blinking at her studies for the potential market the target demographic audience in the cities was excellent in her estimation smiling at her own excitement about the project and wondering what kind of money theyd offer i hadnt yet decided on a course of action in any case id hear both sides before parting with the title to my riverside acres id promised that much to miss twyla so thats basically ita condominium resort community that will both provide a solid growth pattern for bonaparte county and not interfere with the rivers ecosystem lorna im amazed you actually parroted your company spiel instead of slapping your offer for my land on the table and telling me i had five seconds to make up my mind does your boss have you on morphine she smiled a smile several wattages below normal and shrugged i know its so much more restrained than the real me ive got to do it that way greg says im too blunt otherwise scare people off this would be greg callahan yes i take it youve heard about him i opted not to share nina hernandezs lessthancharitable characterization of lornas colleague yeah his names getting around town lorna huffed i warned him to stay away from the local women excuse me gregs a bit of a ladies man he doesnt have your studly height but he has a hell of a lot more charm her voice lowered slightly to a tone i was ever so familiar with and i wondered just how much charm this greg had charms a passing commodity unlike height i said with a smile she examined me with mock gravity it seems to have passed you right by if i may say so you stopped long enough to look lookings free she replied scooping up more guacamole you cant find something worth having without doing a little windowshopping so how much is my land worth to you wed slipped into the gentle flirting wed done so well and so often back in boston we used to stay up late munching popcorn and watching videotapes of the thin man moviesand exchanging verbal salvos as if we were nick and nora i could hear clo rumbling around upstairs obviously preparing to join us and the chicken enchiladas smelled nearly ready i cant make the offer that has to come from greg maybe he can meet with you tonight lets eat first then discuss this further i called upstairs to clo then went into the kitchen youll stay for dinner of course i said i went into the kitchen and opened the oven door lorna leaned over my shoulder sniffing at the casserole dish maybe i will stay lorna peered at the bubbling mix of cheese jalapenos and tortillas that smelled like a corner of heaven it just depends on what the hells on the menu watching lorna eat her first bona fide mexican meal while juggling conversation with clo was a great entertainment value mrs butterfield jordan tells me you do a wonderful job with his mother try to so are you a lifetime resident of mirabeau lorna asked as she filled her plate with two thick cheesy chicken enchiladas yes clo had obviously taken her monosyllabic pill while upstairs she watched lorna guardedly and began to eat lorna gave me her dontwehavealivewirehere look and i smiled it bothered me though that i could still interpret lornas glances so easily under the circumstances it made me damn uncomfortable to have such easy nonverbal communication flashing about how readily could she read my face i suddenly felt as naked as a newborn so tell me mrs butterfield lorna attempted again you must get a tremendous amount of satisfaction out of nursing i see why you like him clo jerked her head toward me you talk just as much as he does with that she popped half an enchilada into her mouth and began to chew with great dignity that silenced lorna long enough for her to try sisters culinary treat she surveyed the spicy quagmire on her plate scooped some on a fork and popped it into her mouth popped is the correct verb as her eyes then proceeded to pop in surprise and she rapidly popped the top on a new bottle of beer and began to gulp down the icy brew clo and i smiled over the peppers on our forks and proceeded to eat them with great relish little sweat and no beer when lornas vocal cords quit smoldering she stared at me with one eyebrow raised its that war thing isnt it you lost so when one of us comes down here you try to rupture our internal organs with this texmex concoction clo made a choked chuckle and i was saved from replying literally by the bell i scooped up the phone receiver swallowed my mouthful of enchilada and said a hello jordy you must honor my request it was miss twyla and she was apparently reliving her previous life as a byzantine empress she clearly expected me to fetch every time she barked calm down miss twyla whats the matter the crowd will be such at tonights meeting that my little living room cant hold them all may we use the library instead i suppose so i checked my watch it was a little past seven still starting at eight yes dear nina tiny and i will call everyone and let them know of the change in plans excuse me did you say tiny is there yes jordy and what a wonderful help hes been im sure the meeting will be an orderly one with tinys help ill leave a note on my front door for those we cant reach by phone perhaps you can meet us at the library a little before eight certainly see you then i hung up oh great now miss twyla had gotten tiny parmalee involved my evening was complete i would spend my evening with my exteacher with a cause an environmentalist windbag who bossed folks around and the fellow whod bullied me and every other kid at mirabeau elementary id have to make sure id hidden my lunch money before i headed over to the library clo had finished eating and was rinsing her plate in the sink lornas plate was also clean except for the pile of sliced jalapenos shed pushed to the rim clo excused herself to check on mama i told her id be gone for a while but should be home by ten she agreed to stay with mama until i returned then went upstairs delightful woman lorna observed a graduate of the nurse ratched school i take it clo doesnt like yankees i dont get this yankee garbage why do southerners continue to mope about the war im a little tired of being referred to as a yankee and having it sound like ive got a venereal disease people down here dont try to get to know you before they make judgments sorry but no sympathy now you know what i went through in boston like the times folks made fun of my accent by repeating back everything i said all the times i was asked how many oil wells i owned all the times people wondered aloud if i was a member of the kkk i cleared our plates and began to wash them it wasnt easy using my one good hand but i managed she was very close behind me before i realized it then how about our own little appomattox i suggest an immediate peace treaty her palms generous as the rest of her slid up and down along my sides in a gentle rhythm my body began to respond before my mind did by that time her hands were in full exploratory mode and i dropped the plate id been trying to wash into the soapy lake of the sink lorna i whispered as i turned to her her mouth covered mine and goddamn it i let it ive no excuse it felt like we were back in her apartment in boston the everpresent noise of traffic outside her kitchen window but as hard as she was kissing me i was kissing back and cussing myself for doing so after several seconds i broke the kiss and turned my head my arm hurts when we get that close i didnt even touch your arm iminvolved with candace lorna i care about her i think im in love with her you think love isnt something you think its something you know she pulled back from me look jordan im not good at this confession stuff i dont lay out my heart very easily but i was wrong dead wrong to let you come back here without a fight what was i supposed to dosay no dont go take care of your mom what kind of selfish monster would i be if i said that i never loved you more than when you said you had to come back here to help your family everything you were willing to give up for the people you loved it just amazed me youre the most kindhearted man ive ever known she broke eye contact with me and stared at the floor i cant compete with a sick woman who desperately needs you i havent known what to do for months now i was paralyzed then i end up going to work for intraglobal and i nearly died when greg told me we were coming to mirabeau to do this deal i couldnt believe it the coincidence just seemed too great then i realized some things are just meant to be gods dropping you back in my lap jordan your land and the condo dealthey dont matter except that theyve allowed us to be together again i could still taste her on my lips turning away from her i wiped my wet hands on a dishrag for once in my life i was speechless in three years lorna had told me she loved me maybe once or twice she was not a woman given to emotional pronouncements i was even less likely to voice the lword and i couldnt believe id confessed a depth of affection for candace to someone else i couldnt still love lorna i couldnt i didnt need the complication so why did i suddenly feel so weakkneed miss twyla had provided me a cowards perfect escape route and i took it i have to go to a meeting at the library some folks arent much in favor of this condo development and want to hash it out im not taking their side yet but i owe it to them to hear what they have to say dont she reached out and turned my head back to her god help me i wanted to kiss her again listen babe i know this has to be a shock to you seeing me again like this but dont turn away please not again not when you can be so much more i dont know what you mean its incredible that youre taking care of your mom and that youve found your dad but what else does this place offer i expect you to want a hell of a lot more more more what i asked my throat feeling raw i dont need to be in the corporate game again to feel like im accomplishing something lorna i take care of my mother weve only had clos help for a few weeks i run a library and even a small ones a big concern and my relationships with candace and bob don have taken time and effort i think whats raising your hackles is that ive found a niche and it doesnt automatically include you lorna released a breath shed obviously been holding for several moments i see well i was right our relationship should be put on hold while were discussing business i apologize for kissing you and for resurrecting our past ill let you get to your meeting she turned on her high heels and went back into the living room thank you for dinner she called as i heard her shuffle papers back into her briefcase please give arlene my regards and tell her i hope to meet her while im in town i came into the living room not knowing what to say she finished her packing perfunctorily nodded and left the door slam echoed in my mind for a long while chapter four ive never been a fan of meetings but for miss twylas sake i put on my best publiclibrarian smile id heard lornas side of the development issueand fairness demanded i listen to nina id arrived in time to unlock for the three of them tiny parmalee stood close by nina hernandez and it wasnt hard to see why hed evinced sudden interest in riverfront development she was just the plain kind of woman that he always fell for every time i see tiny i recall our first instance of quality time hed always been bigger than all the other kids even since first grade hence his nickname hed also been dumber thats not a crime in itself but coupled with his stupidity was a particular brand of meanness tiny was damned unpleasant and he took comfort in that our first and only fight had been in third grade naturally it was at recess the only time in the scholastic day that tiny ruled as king the boys played softball or touch football and the girls played tetherball or tag chasing each other with screeches of delight it was the autumn of and mirabeau schools had finally settled into integration it had been a surprisingly easy process most people in mirabeau who objected and lets be blunt most people did had decided that it was inevitable and they might as well go along kids being kids necessity won out over prejudice to have two teams for softball during thirdgrade recess every ablebodied boy was needed so the whites graciously agreed to play with the blacks and the blacks graciously agreed to play with the whites tiny was not exactly on the cutting edge of societal change then or now if memory serves he objected to his team losing because of a run batted in by a boy named michael addy michael was a fair fielder but a great batter and his skin was as dark as an eggplants even in third grade tiny towered over the other boys and when hed decided to beat up michael for hitting in that run no one seemed inclined to interfere michael was the biggest of the black boys but still no match for a genetic oddity of size like tiny he had michael his nose bleeding and mashed in a headlock the black boys stood in a group of their own none daring to take on the giant the girls both white and black huddled together watching the dusty display of male violence with distaste and horror i clearly remember one of the black girls screaming at the boys to do something a few of the white boys stood in open approval of the spectacle while others stayed silent toeing the dirt of the field and no one including myself dared to fetch the teacher knowing what tinys ire would bring on us later i dont know what made me do it i was not tall in those days my growth spurt didnt hit until i was in high school i didnt care too much if the white kids and the black kids got along michael addy wasnt a friend of mine i only remember thinking that if my daddy found out i stood by while another child was beaten how disappointed and mad hed be i knew that from experience say it tiny huffed to the prisoner of his arms say it slow like i told you to to this day i can hear the crack of michael addys voice his throat trapped in tinys heavy arms a voice that begged for release imim a dumb nigger good now say it loud so everbody knows what you are i put my hand on tinys shoulder stop it the shock in the crowd was not nearly as great as the shock on tinys pug face he wore his hair in a crew cut then and his hair was so white he nearly looked bald he glanced at my hand on his stout shoulder what the hell you doing bo peep tiny had altered my surname to bo peep and got no end of amusement from this ingenious pun you made him do what you wanted leave him alone i tried reason you better let him go before the teacher gets out here tiny looked at me as though id just announced that he himself was a dumb nigger he dropped michael addy who promptly and wisely took the opportunity to put some distance between himself and tiny scrabbling across the softball field grass to relative safety you takin up for that nigger bo peep tiny squared his shoulders and looked down at me i suddenly felt very fragile but all of a sudden i was maddern hell tiny had never bullied me physically but id grown tired of that nickname and the way he pushed people around like checkers on a board just leave him alone he didnt do nothing to you i dont like losin to an uppity nigger you dont like losin period well everbody has to lose sometimes you cant always win i wanted to turn and walk away my speech complete but i knew that i could not turn my back on tiny parmalee he wiped a bit of spit off his lip his hand forming into a fist as he dragged it across his mouth you just love them niggers dont you bo peep i just dont like you pushing people and that was as far as i got before he belted me i fell to the ground my lip cut and bleeding instantly id never been walloped in the mouth before and damn if it doesnt hurt like the dickens instead of sitting there and crying about the agony in my lip like any sensible boy would have done i instead meted out more punishment for myself by tackling tiny low near the ankles he didnt have good balance because of his size and he fell fortunately not landing on me there was an ooh from the crowd and several boys from the safety of distance began yelling encouragement to me tiny only knew power not strategy and i didnt know much about either i had been in only one other fight in my lifeand id lost and my struggle with tiny quickly degenerated into rolling around in the gritty dirt of the batting area surrounded by screaming and cheering schoolmates who surged back and forth in rhythm with the fight like a fickle tide i was losing though wed tussled past the fence that marked the boundaries of the old baseball lot rolling onto unmowed grass tiny huffed and puffed like a dragon trying to rouse up a steamy breath of fire i could tell his anger was boiling over he should have dispatched me easily but i was quicker and stronger than he had figured if he didnt win soon his standing would fall in the playground and that he could not tolerate cussing he pinioned me on my back and his hands closed around my throat im agonna squeeze real hard bo peep unless you tell everyone what a niggerlovin faggot you are his eyes softened not in any mercy but in that he sensed victory a drop of his sweat fell into my eyes like chinese water torture his raggedy fingernails pressed crescents into my throat i thought about all of tiny parmalees weight crushing on my windpipe and tried not to be scared no i gasped no tiny leaned down harder on my throat and dark circles began to form over his face the screaming of my classmates was far closer but seemed to be growing distant i felt his fingers digging into my neck seeking out the air in it like it was an intruder and shockingly i saw the glint of murder in tiny parmalees eyes his rage was so intense that had we been alone im certain he would have killed me he was the sort of boy who would set a worm on fire and laugh at its wriggly dance of death i stared back into his eyes and he saw that i saw what he was the gaze between us as intimate as lovers his grip tightened my hands lashed out and my right one caught metal i had a vague memory of a stake thrust in the ground tied with a yellow ribbon at the top marking a corner of the softball field only an adrenal surge gave me the strength to pull the stake out and bring it down in tiny parmalees back honestly i didnt do much damage my aim was horrendous and i didnt hit his back so much as pierce his side it didnt even crack a rib though it cut through some flesh and bled profusely ive no doubt that it hurt like hell what undid tiny was his scream he howled as that stake scored him and his scream was like a girlshighpitched and full of powerlessness and fear breaking his throttlehold on me he reeled away holding his side and screeching at the blood that spilled from him he was the only one screaming on the playground now the other children were stunned into silence i didnt do a victory jig i opted to roll over gasp repeatedly and finally throw up in the mashed grass of the field i lay there unmoving until a teacher cradled my head in her lap and told me i was okay in the simple mathematics of recess and playground and combat that scream defeated tiny parmalee hed been the bully and the aggressor but hed been the one to capitulateand worse to scream like a girl id done the unimaginable in taking him on a few thought id cheated in using the stake but the bluish bruises on my throat spoke for themselves about the equality of the struggle we both were suspended for a week much to my fathers delight in that i had done the right thing in taking up for michael addy to my mothers horror in that id stooped to fighting and to my sisters embarrassment in that she had a crush on tiny parmalees cousin and id set back her campaign to win the boy our first day back the principal met us in the office and forced us to shake hands i coughed and did so averting my eyes from the bruises on tinys face had i really given him those or had his parents reacted differently to the fight than mine did tiny shook my hand and stared blankly into my eyes i dont want to hear anything about you boys fighting the principal chirped i dont want to hear about it happening here or away from school and rest assured if it happens i will hear about it it didnt tiny and i avoided each other like the plague if we passed in the halls we didnt speak or even acknowledge one another our friends tried to goad us into fighting again but we ignored them michael addy slipped a note to me in my math book one day that simply said thank you i ate the slip of paper before my teacher could see it michael and i ended up going through the rest of school together without mentioning the fight again michael went to texas tech on a baseball scholarship and now coaches for a highschool team in richardson a big suburb of dallas tiny barely finished high school did a stint in the army and now worked with his daddy a longhaul trucker so thats why i dont care much for tiny parmalee wed had no further runins and id only seen him once since i returned to mirabeau wed passed each other on mayne street as i went into a store and he was coming out hed given me the briefest of stares which i ignored now he was favoring nina hernandez with long goofy looks she didnt look too delighted with his attentions in fact she seemed downright apprehensive tiny ms hernandez i nodded as i unlocked the library doors nina smiled thinly and moved inside tiny lumbered near me and regarded my arm still in its sling heard you nearly got blowed up he said sneering there wasnt direct malice in his tone just a sort of general bullying that lay underneath like filth under a rug what a damn shame thatd be thanks for your concern i answered not wanting to waste much air on a response to him miss twyla prevented any further pleasantries by coming up to us both thanking me again for the use of the library the last folks to occupy the community room on the librarys top floor was a lamaze class so there were no chairs set up apelike tiny just popped the metal chairs open and set them wherever he happened to be i used my good arm to help nina drag the chairs into the proper positions i think your new assistant likes you i murmured to nina she stiffened as if id stepped on her toe mr poteet im sorry we got off on the wrong foot this afternoon its just that i feel strongly about stopping intraglobal and you should be as concerned about saving the river as mr parmalee is oh i am im just not so certain that our tiny friend is motivated by ecological desires i could be friends with her if she could take a little teasing tinys a fine man she muttered watching her new charge as he scratched his forehead while blankly surveying a map of the world that hung on the wall yes he is and dont worry about all his eccentricities hes a victim of society i meant it nicely but nina misinterpreted she snorted at me pushed her glasses back up on her forehead and went to confer with miss twyla so much for teasing by eight everyone had arrived aside from miss twyla nina tiny and myself there was a scattering of forty or so people who didnt own land by the river but had gotten riled up by miss twyla also present was our esteemed mayor and my boss parker loudermilk and his wife dee i remembered that dee owned some of the land that lorna and greg callahan wanted to buy parker ive no doubt was looking for whatever favorable impressions he could get out of the situation parkers not bad as bosses goas long as you watch your back i saw with some amusement that my old friend eula mae quiff had embraced this latest cause if theres action anywhere in mirabeau eula maes usually hovering nearby drinking it all in shes a bestselling romance novelist and my favorite of the town eccentrics and its a wide and varied choice tonight she wiggled beringed fingers at me while she chattered with miss twyla and nina i figured the outlandish dashiki she sported was to show her concern for the environment other cultures and general world harmony i took eula mae aside when some other folks began talking to nina and miss twyla what are you doing here you dont even own land on the river well pardon me squire poteet she sniffed running a hand through her graying curls i didnt know you had to have a title to the sacred acres to care about saving the colorado im not convinced the rivers in danger eula mae well our way of life is i dont want a bunch of snotty houstonians down here on weekends jamming up our streets and spoiling my view of the river she patted my good arm do you need the money you might get from the land sale sugar you just let me know ill be glad to loan you some cash is your hospital bill making you fret thats not the point eula mae we dont know much about what tactics this nina hernandez is going to use to stop this development i think she gets ornery if she doesnt get her way i just want for there to be reasoned discussion not a bunch of mudslinging and hysteria honey pie youre talking about money and people and land reasoned discussion isnt part of that equation look at all the problems theyve had over in austin with greedy developers from out of state look i know one of those socalled greedy developers that bigboned yankee gal with the polish name nothing got by eula mae and i didnt miss the amused glint in her eye teasing me is probably eula maes favorite pastime aside from ogling men and deciphering her royalty statements yes that would be her eula mae i glanced around to see if candace had arrived yetbut then i didnt know if she even knew about the meeting listen i know lorna and i dont think shed be involved with anything unsavory jordy that girl drips unsavory like weekold barbecue eula mae said itasca told me about her little entrance at the library and i can only imagine the two of you together actually its nearly romantic poor lonely southern lad cast adrift in the big heartless city ill guess you met her during one of those dreadful winters and needed a bedwarmer i bet that chest of hers could heat all of massachusetts yes eula mae actually talks like her books it can be real amusing as long as shes not talking about you and how does candace like your little visitor fine just fine i definitely didnt want to be discussing my love life with eula mae if i wasnt careful id read it again in the fat pages of one of her potboilers she patted my arm again i gotta go say hi to the terwilliger sisters sugar doll ill catch you later she toddled off in the direction of some of the elderly ladies that hovered near miss twyla undoubtedly members of our local widows and spinsters mafia if they were on miss twylas side i nearly felt sorry for intraglobal my former uncle bidwell poteet blessedly former since i found out that bob dons my dad meant that bid isnt my biological uncle also appeared scowled at the audience and broke into an unexpected grin when he saw me to my horror he made a beeline for me it was sort of like being hounded by a small smelly chihuahua uncle bid is hairless as far as we can tell and im not about to investigate past his pate and he always reeks of stale cigarillos well boy i see you nearly got yours he poked at my slinged arm try to hide your disappointment i answered dryly seriously jordy you are okay arent you his husky voice lowered and i thought it cant benot genuine concern for me i regarded him suspiciously maybe id misjudged the old toot yes im fine uncle bid thank you for asking his scrawny shoulders heaved in relief good if you died i dont know who youve got those riverfront acres willed toand having it tied up in probate right now could sour the deal for the rest of us your consideration for my wellbeing is touching like bad heartburn i glared down at him why do i have the feeling youd sell intraglobal your land even if they were building a nuclear reactor next to the town hell boy moneys money if you had one scrap of sense in that brain my brother wasted all that money eddicatin youd know that he jabbed a finger into my chest about as high up as he could reach get some sense in you jordy for once please sell to these folks and dont listen to that shellwearin austin hippie up there ill consider that as strongly as i do all other advice you give me i promised the insult went over his head since it didnt have far to jump all right then you got any questions on how to unload that land you see me his chocolaty dark eyes squinted at me i might just buy your land first you know then sell it to intraglobal ill give you a fair price think it over nephew he sashayed off greeting people who forced smiles to their faces and sat in the back row he mustve thought the seating chart was by iq i wasnt terribly impressed by this show of poteet family love if eula mae was right and this development had anything unsavory about it uncle bidd no doubt be nearby adding his own unique stench to the pot miss twyla called the crowd to order i took a seat near the back as miss twyla was explaining the purpose of the meeting candace slipped in and sat beside me she took my hand and squeezed it and how was your little dinner im not one for public affection but i kissed herand then wondered if she could tell my lips had been kissed fine she just mostly wanted to talk business i bet she did she gave me an enigmatic look and turned her attention to miss twyla i glanced around the room again bob don to my surprise was not present i thought for sure hed want to hear about a land deal that affected him personally and i felt momentarily stung hed given me this land and now the situation was getting complicated and he wasnt here to be with me maybe i didnt matter to him as much as i thought wrong hed been at the hospital when id gotten hurt i hoped our mad bomber didnt know about the meeting he could take out quite a few people with this gathering miss twyla ran the meeting like one of her highschool classes quickly calling it to order she summarized intraglobals intentionsand voiced her own and others opposition to the development after this brief statement she called nina hernandez to the front to tell everyone what the battle plan would be i grimaced at the idea of getting myself into any mess that required a battle plan ladies and gentlemen of mirabeau nina intoned with grandiose dignity i warn you now gregory callahan is not a man who will take no for an answer intraglobal has the resources and the money to get what they want regardless of whether or not you want this development in your backyard they will build without regard for the sensitive ecosystem that surrounds mirabeauhere i distinctly heard uncle bid snortand they will despoil the river the river that has nurtured the town of mirabeau for over a hundred and fifty years ive dealt with intraglobal before with their attempts to develop in other small towns in both the south and in new england she paused letting us realize that once again the battle was joined she produced charts bar graphs and tables of data on an easel to show just how much the river would suffer under intraglobals stewardship she spoke with conviction and assuranceand i found myself liking her more they ruin towns then move on they dont have to win again you can stop them she concluded excuse me mother earth a voice called from the back of the room but why the hell should we want to uncle bid being his usual charming self hed risen from his customary predatory crouch to his feet and you are sir nina asked obviously irritated at the interruption one could only hope shed sic tiny on uncle bid bidwell j poteet esquire attorneyatlaw bid purred in response and as one of the concerned landowners i dont see a single reason why we shouldnt sell intraglobal is offering good money for this land and the resort community could bring a lot of money into mirabeau there was a buzz of general assent from one corner of the crowd apparently some folks supported that view and i couldnt blame them nina wasnt fazed the reason mr poteet is the way that intraglobal does business they probably wont hire local contractors to build this development theyll bring in bigcity folks they target towns like yours that havent needed to have serious environmental controls yet and they get their plans approved before the voters can put any sort of ecological leash on them theyll build with no regard for what pollutants they spill into the colorado she slammed her hand down on the podium wed pulled out of storage we can stop them you dont have to have this kind of development we need development missy bid brayed back at her the miss twyla corps of supporters glared at him as one not this way miss twyla opted to enter the fray i dont necessarily think that development is wrong bidwell but we want to control how it happens not just sell our land to folks we dont know diddly about and let them ruin it and the river i raised my good arm excuse me ms hernandez i had dinner with one of the intraglobal representatives this evening she showed me environmental impact statements that indicate the effect on the river would be minimal nina smiled nicely at me those statements are prepared by intraglobal jordan they emphasize whatever intraglobal wants them to emphasize im sorry you were deceived well that shut me up i kept my mouth open for a moment in case inspiration hit but shut it when a sadeyed eula mae shook her head at my naivete the lord mayor of mirabeau not his official title but thats how he fancies himself parker loudermilk rose to his feet and cleared his throat he had plenty of cherokee in him and his complexion was dark his eyes brooding except when he had on his mayoral smile his daddy had been mayor for fourteen years and when he died no one else ran against parker it just seemed natural to have a loudermilk as mayor parker was not a tall man but he had the most erect posture id ever seen like someone had shoved a metal beam along his spine and i knew from city staff meetings that special cough of his meant all us peons better grovel in the mud i think ms hernandez that the fine citizens of mirabeau can rely on their elected officials to protect their environment your wife owns some of the land tiny called out then looked embarrassed his first venture at public speaking if id liked him id have been proud of him nina favored tiny with a gracious smile and turned back toward the mayor like he was cheese on a cracker and she was starving thats right mr mayor mrs loudermilk does own some of the involved land do you think that you can maintain your objectivity when greg callahan starts throwing money at yall mayor loudermilk huffed his thin politically weaselly face pinched tight he didnt like folks challenging him and i sometimes wondered if he didnt have a pronounced violent streak under that suave exterior id seen him break pencils with a smile in staff meetings when he thought someone was challenging his authority and i heard he ran his construction company like a military unit junebug and i joked about it after the meetings but i really didnt care much for the man it was a shame his daddy had been a real fine fellow i dont really need to worry about the money he might throw at me ms hernandez but i thank you for your concern for my moral fiber i saw dee loudermilk put a restraining hand on her husband as she rose to her feet she was prettier than parker loudermilk deserved a slight wispy blonde beauty with eyes of fierce hazel intelligence dee used to be like candace doing mostly volunteer work shed discovered art though a while back and had become a potter i had one of her own pots in my backyard an object of strength and sturdiness if not of beauty dees metaphysical stretches of the boundaries of ceramics escaped any meaningful interpretation from me i liked her a sight better than i did her husband its my land not parkers i had that land before we married so its not his concern dee said parker didnt look like he agreed with this economic assessment but he wisely kept his mouth shut dees voice rang out clear as a bell i guess it was used to outyelling her husband regardless im sure that loudermilk construction would be interested in bidding on the development work eula mae put in shes selfemployed and got more money than god so she doesnt have to be cordial to our elected officials parker bristled dee smiled at eula mae she was a better politician than her husband i wont sell until we know more about what these intraglobal people plan and thats a promise ill be glad to answer that for you mrs loudermilk a mans voice nasal in its northernness called out from the back of the room the voice belonged to a man in a tailored summer gray italian suit certainly the finest duds mirabeau had seen in some time the floral pattern on his tie would have gotten him thrown out of all the beer joints i knew of his hair was starting to thin with strands of blond still clinging to his freckled pate his face was intelligent with a rough sensuality to it that suggested he was a man who took a coarse and easy pleasure in life lorna stood to one side of him looking cool but perhaps a touch uncomfortable i saw her eyes seek me out and she stared hard at me for all of ten seconds i glanced away and saw that if i wasnt willing to return lornas stare plenty of other fellows were i hoped uncle bid seated right in front of her wouldnt drool the man on the other side of lorna was someone i knew freddy jacksill a local realestate agent he was sticking to lorna and the balding man like sap on bark i saw another form move behind the three from the stairs and find a seat a stunning young brunette i recognized as jenny loudermilk the mayor and dees daughter she looked like shed gotten her hand caught in the cookie jar hiding cash i didnt miss the glances that parker and dee exchangedor miss twyla and eula mae exchangedat this latest development this is a private meeting callahan nina barked the look she gave the man was one of pure loathing id appreciate it if youd leave this is a public building greg callahan id already guessed who it was answered smoothly um hes right nina i spoke up meetings held in the library unless previously approved are open to the public there no one could ever say i hadnt memorized the librarys bylaws these good people arent interested in your lies nina retorted tiny bolted to his feet presumably to play bouncer nina jerked a hand at him and he stayed put shes got him trained like a dog candace whispered to me lies ms hernandez im not here to lie greg callahan said smoothly my associate ms wiercinski along with our new friend mr jacksill thought that we ought to set the record straight he pointed an elegant pale finger at nina hernandez this woman is nothing but a radical and an environmental extremist a murmur ran through the sparse crowd wrong nina snapped back i have no political agenda my only desire is to protect the riverand to expose intraglobal for the wasteful pernicious business that it is i wouldnt quarrel with sensitive responsible development but you mr callahan have no regard for people or the land they live on ridiculous greg callahan sneered back i envied him his glare it was a right effective one youd throw yourself over a blade of grass to keep someone from building a patio ms hernandez and folks let me tell you it wouldnt make much sense for me to invest in riverfront property then trash the river would it now whod buy a single condo no one thats who he cast his penetrating blue eyes across the gathering investment ladies and gentlemen thats what this resort would be im going to spend so much on the riverfront that id ruin my own business if i polluted it he jerked his head toward lorna and freddy jacksill well be holding a meeting of our own to really tell the truth about intraglobal tomorrow night at the sitaspell cafe yall are all invited i thought he shouldve left that last part off texans do not take kindly to having their accents or regionalisms adopted by others miss twyla stood i wont be there ive already heard enough from nina to know ill never sell my land to you eula mae was not about to be upstaged and im going to put my considerable resources behind miss twylas campaign to save the river callahan smiled thinly there was the vaguest hint of malice lurking there perhaps youll change your mind ms oudelle ms quiff hed done his homework you had to give him that he nodded confidently at the crowd i urge everyone not to pay too much heed to ms hernandez shes a bit upset right now because this is her third attempt to interfere with intraglobals business and every time shes failed shes a loser until tomorrow night ladies and gentlemen he turned on his imported heel and strode out with the confidence of a rooster leaving a sated henhouse freddy jacksill stayed right in callahans personal space probably busily calculating the amount of money he could make as the local agent for helping intraglobal lorna hung back for a moment then left favoring me with another glance i patted candaces hand and whispered i want to talk to him i followed them out hearing uncle bid cackle see jordys chasing that fellow to sell him his land yall aint going to win i decided id worry later about setting uncle bid straightas straight as someone as crooked as he could get i hurried out the back entrance from the stairs the upstairs meeting room is accessible by a side door so folks can have meetings after hours without going through the rest of the library lorna greg callahan and freddy jacksill were standing by freddys taurus its rivertown real estate sign big on the driversside door greg callahan watched me as i ran up to them crickets chirped around us a deafening chorus of them in the live oaks that towered near the library the sun was setting and his eyes looked hard in the fading light i said lorna arent you going to introduce me to your friend lorna shuffled slightly i dont think she was happy with the upshot of our last conversation sure jordan this is greg callahan greg this is jordan poteet my old friend i told you about jordan fabulous to meet you greg shook my hand with what i considered an abundance of fake warmth fantastic town youve got here really homey and cozy thanks wed like to keep it that way greg fixed me with a smile now jordan i hope a smart gentleman like yourself isnt going to jump on this environmental hysteria bandwagon i assure you all the information that lorna presented you is absolutely valid were not going to shoot ourselves in the feet by ruining the river jordan freddy jacksill interrupted why dont you give me a call tomorrow and ill set up a meeting at my office where we can discuss intraglobals offer on your land i made myself smile at freddy i couldnt say i actually disliked him but he was one of those people who so nakedly curries favor that they annoy the living hell out of you he was in his midforties portly and not dressed in the height of fashion i always saw him on weekends squiring potential buyers usually young yuppie couples from austin who fantasized about country living well freddy that might just have to wait a spell im not sure i want to sell my land id prefer to give it some thought before i make any decisions greg smiled heartily and squeezed my good shoulder he didnt ask what had happened to my arm of course you would jordan and i know that a reasonable guy like you is going to make the right decision youre a clearthinker i resented someone who didnt know me making such gross generalizations i could be as muddythinking as they came if i put my mind to it my distaste for greg bolted in my chest why was lorna working for him i smiled politely well ill be glad to attend your meeting and hear you out i glanced at lorna youre very lucky to have lorna working for you shes a remarkable woman that elicited a smile from both lorna and greg isnt she though he said id be lost without lorna shes my details lady he grinned at her with a nearly proprietary air great well then ill see yall both tomorrow i shook hands and turned to leave and well see yall tomorrow too greg chirped i tried not to break stride yankees they never seem to get that yall is plural not singular someone needed to have a talk with greg on how not to alienate the locals i decided that if i chose to sell my land id coach greg on the intricacies of mirabeau etiquette i returned to an assembly that was frothy with outrage at anyone who might even glance askew at our beloved colorado river uncle bid and his supporters had departed candace leaned over and whispered to me so did you cut a deal not hardly that fellow is slicker than a watermelon seed well eula mae announced shes donating fifty thousand dollars to the antidevelopment cause good lord i whispered back i didnt know she had that kind of cash to burn i glanced over at eula mae she was absently twirling her hair with a finger i hoped she had the money to back up her promise the loudermilks were silent ninas voice droned on outlining how they would use eula maes seed money to raise a massive war chest to inform the public about the perils of intraglobals invasion the meeting didnt last much longer i didnt pay much heed i kept watching the obvious glares between the loudermilks and their daughter who had kept her seat in the back of the room something was amiss in mirabeaus first family jenny loudermilk tossed her rather luxurious locks in prime barbie style and ignored her parents miss twyla gave a final inspired speech on how we should ban together to fight this godless not quite sure where theology crept into the equation but miss twyla was on a roll development we will stop this miss twyla vowed whatever it takes we will stop this god was her timing lousy id escorted candace home we hadnt talked much i told her lorna had been mostly businesslike at dinner calmly outlining intraglobals strategy she didnt ask for an explanation of what constituted mostly her goodbye kiss was quick and dry when i got home i discovered clo in the living room she was watching her favorite program star trek you never miss that one do you clo i asked as captain kirk dueled a barbarian with a bad overbite that lieutenant uhura she looks just like my girl really i said clo had been tightlipped about her private life shed mentioned a granddaughter once shes dead now dead for ten years her voice was softer than usual slack without its stridency she stared at the screen watching the battle you see jordy i know what family pain is too your mamas asleep now if you dont mind ill sit here and watch the end of this its nearly over sure clo i hadnt expected such a remark from her she folded her hands in her lap as though keeping something in them for an angel and kept her eyes on the television i went upstairs washed my face and came back down to the kitchen for a glass of milk i sat there awhile feeling that if i went into my own living room id be intruding on her grief after a few moments i heard her click off the television i stood and went back to join her i walked clo out to her little ford tempo and watched her drive away only a goodnight passing between us i locked up left the porch light on for sister when she came in from her irregular shift checked on mamas gentle rasp took some more tylenol for my sore left arm and went to bed at some point deep in the nights belly a phone awakened me i finally answered it yes my voice creaked jordy this is chet blanton the name finally registered with mechet was the manager of the mirabeau b lamar bedandbreakfast and a library patron with a pronounced penchant for agatha christie im sorry to call you so late but its an emergency whatwhats wrong i managed to mutter my brain smogged with sleep i dont want to go into this over the phone but your friendshes in trouble please could you just come over chets normally hearty voice sounded pinched i sat up in bed wideawake i told chet id be there in a minute and hung up i stumbled into clothes eased my left arm into its sling peeked in to make sure sister was back from her shift her snoring was a dead giveaway and as though on autopilot drove to the mirabeau b lamar bedandbreakfast a police car stood in the driveway its lights flashing my wristwatch indicated two in the morning but i pounded on the door anyway chet met me at the door dressed in a rumpled robe his heavy face white whats happened is lorna okay i asked pushing past him shes okay i think follow me chet turned and we ran up the stairs of the elegant antebellum home hed converted the second story held the eight guest rooms in one of the rooms i saw lorna crouched on a bed one of junebugs deputies talking to her her face was in her hands and she didnt see me i noticed blood on her right hand oozing from a badly torn fingernail i moved forward for her chets arm stopped me you better see this he whispered steering me down one more room which one is greg callahans i asked he pointed two doors down the hall back toward the stairs number four the room he showed me was comfortable looking decorated in classy antiques and with a faint smell of fruit and potpourri and the gassy odor of death i stepped in and looked where chet pointed greg callahan lay sprawled on the persian rug his pale head bent at an unnatural angle his eyes staring up at the slowly turning ceiling fan hes drunk was my first irrational thought but there was no air of liquor i didnt start to gag until i stepped closer and saw the length of barbed wire cruelly and deeply twisted into his neck chapter five even after a morning of getting out of the hospital an afternoon of miss twyla and nina berating me and an evening of concern about lorna i couldnt rightly say id had the worse day in mirabeau that distinction rested with poor greg callahan i sat sipping a dr pepper in the small waiting area of the mirabeau police station lorna sat next to me holding my hand her own hand felt clammy one of the officers came in the door pinging as he opened it and i could smell the faint grittiness of rubber and gravel from the parking lot the summernight air was warm but i still had goose pimples from what id seen while the police began their investigation of the murder scene and the ambulance arrived to trundle off gregs body i got lorna down to chefs kitchen she had been silent as i seated her at the kitchen table and i wondered whether to get her whiskey or coffee suddenly she had screamed burying her face in her hands my god hes dead hes really dead she sobbed uncontrollably then and i just held her whispering into her dark hair that she was okay finally she believed me and stopped crying i held her and thought about what id seen in the few moments id had in gregs room i had carefully knelt by greg i saw the ends of the wire had been fashioned into loops probably for a better grip for the killer i swallowed death by barbedwire garrote was a sickening thought i forced myself to look at gregs savaged throat the wire had cut into his neck deeply and the barbs had left little tears in his flesh god like simultaneously being strangled and having your throat cut i could only hope it had happened quickly one of his hands lay open and i could see small wounds on his palm like stigmata i shuddered it must have been agony for him having that torturous noose tightening on his gullet and when he tried to pull the choking cord off getting metal thorns in his hands he was still in his suit and the dribble of blood from his neck stained his starched collar his blue eyes bulged the lids halfclosed i gingerly touched his wrist and felt the silence i stood wanting to get back to lorna i glanced around the room a halfempty bottle of whiskey stood between two used glasses on the desk was a scattering of loose change a receipt from the sitaspell cafe a closed laptop computer with some small disks stacked like playing cards next to it a sheet with the mirabeau b lamar stationery near the phone writing scrawled across it with doodles surrounding the text nina hernandezearth bitch below that a telephone number that was a mirabeau number i thought but whose i didnt recognize it but then id hardly memorized the phone book in my copious spare time goddamn it get the hell out of there i nearly jumped out of my skin i turned to face a very very irritated junebug junebug he rumbled forward grabbed my sore arm mind you my sore arm and hustled me out into the hallway chet looked shamefaced and sick i pulled my sling free from junebugs grip with what little dignity i could muster what do you think youre doing jordy tainting a crime scene tainting i was just looking what you were doing clueless was leaving hair and fibers and probably fingerprints that are now going to have to be weeded out in my sceneofcrime work junebug shook his head i opened my mouth to retort then shut it he was right id had no business in there my own curiosity and shock at seeing greg dead who id only talked with a few hours before got the better of me i took a deep breath and fought down a spasm of nausea youre right i apologize i didnt think i glanced down the hall can i go see lorna in a minute junebug whirled his sirens on chet you stand guard here till franklin tapes off this room no one gets in chet do you understand yes junebug chet said miserably fortunately franklin bedloe one of junebugs deputies galloped up the steps that moment and took over chet looked vastly relieved i stood in the hall waiting while listening to junebug chew out the officer sitting with lorna for not securing the crime scene the rookie tried to tell his chief that hed just been concerned about ms wirechinski he nearly had the name down but junebug wasnt having any of that i heard him speak in low kinder tones to lorna and she sniffled an answer we three civilians were relegated to the kitchen while the authorities took over lorna refused chets offer of whiskey but coughed out that she would like a glass of brandy one of the policemen sat stonily in our midsti guess making sure none of us headed for the border he gave lorna first aid for her injured finger while i watched after thirty minutes junebug came back in and said jesus christ jesus h christ chet ever the professional host offered junebug a drink he refused and watched lorna carefully ms wiercinski he finally said id like you to come down to the station with us and answer a few questions if you feel up to that of course mr moncrief she rose unsteadily then as if suddenly remembering that i was there took my hand can jordan come too of course junebug answered im not quite sure why hes here im an old friend of lornas we knew each other in boston i didnt want to go into more detail while chet was there hes a rotten gossip hes a good old friend to have junebug nodded and so we had ended up here junebug had asked us to wait in the lobby for a few minutes and had disappeared into his office i was dying to know what had happened but thought it wouldnt look too cool to be grilling lorna when junebug came back her fingers laced with mine and i didnt pull back my arm felt stiff and sore and i tried to keep the sling still and close to my body yall come on back junebug returned and escorted us into the stations one interrogation room i felt distinctly unwell i presumed wed get questioned in the less accusatory surroundings of junebugs office lorna and i sat on one side of the table junebug across from us he scratched his crew cut and blinked at our entwined hands he didnt comment but he was doubtless wondering what my relationship was with lorna now jordy maybe you can tell me what youre doing in the middle of this junebug said lorna glanced at me jordy ive never heard you called that before please lorna not now i took a deep breath and recounted chets phone call junebug listened without comment now ms wiercinski maybe you can tell me what happened lorna ran a thin fingernail across her bottom lip she briefly explained her and gregs presence in mirabeau okay about eightfifteen we went to the library because greg was upset wait a second maam whos we me greg and a local realestate agent freddy jacksill i had dinner with jordanone junebug eyebrow went up then settled back where it belongedand then id come back to the bedandbreakfast greg had already heard about the meeting and he was upset he abhors nina hernandez says shes an extremist who always gets in his way wait another second junebug exploded whats this all about lorna told him about the ongoing animosity between nina hernandez and gregs company junebug made notes okay he said so he wanted to bust up this meeting not exactly he just wanted to let people know that nina is dead wrong about intraglobal and clarify what we want to do here he wanted to announce his own meetingwhich would have been tonight how had he heard about the library meeting i dont know mr moncrief i guess freddy jacksill told him she went on to describe gregs arrival during ninas speech and the ensuing charges and countercharges i helpfully filled in what had happened before greg and lornas arrival and after you left the library junebug prodded greg was very confident that hed win but i could see that he was seething he really hates nina hernandez i mean he really hated her voice broke off as she corrected her tense junebug offered a tissue and she waved it away im okay anyhow after we left greg freddy and i came back to the mirabeau b i was tired and a little upseta glance at me spoke volumesand i wanted to go to bed this is my first deal working with intraglobal and im not accustomed to all this confrontational crap greg had calmed and seemed ready to celebrate he said that nina would mess up her campaign to stop us and wed be able to get the land for the river resort he wanted to have drinks with freddy and me but i begged off so he and freddy went into gregs room around ninethirty i went to bed she broke off sounding uncertain is that all maam junebug seemed to sense she was holding something back and his tone was pressing i dozed off but then i woke up i heard gregs voice yelling at someone whoever it was wasnt yelling back did he sound afraid i asked ignoring junebugs scowl at my intervention no more mad than afraid you didnt hear mr jacksill talking with him junebug asked no not that i remember what happened then i went back to sleep i woke up later maybe around midnighti heard a door slam down the hall but i rolled over and went back to sleep thena little before twoi woke up again im not sure what woke me up i just snapped awake a slamming door i thought chet had told me while we waited for the police to finish their preliminary examination of gregs room that lorna and greg were his only guests at the moment so it mustve been gregs door that she heard junebug listened to her carefully as though a clue might drop from her unsuspecting lips think again miss did you hear a noise someone crying out another door slam lorna pursed her lips i could see the effort of her recollection as she dredged through her shock im sorry i dont remember anything i think i woke because i was thirsty okay junebug said you were thirsty i decided to go down to the kitchen for some apple juice i opened my door and started for the stairs i passed gregs room and i could see that the door was ajar i she stared at her clenched fingers junebug didnt prompt her neither did i we both sensed that she had to tell this at her pace after a long intake of breath she continued i knocked at the door very softly i thought maybe greg fell asleep with it open but that would have been very unlike him he was a maniac about his privacy so i pushed at the door it was ink black inside what with the curtains down but my eyes were used to the dark now and i could see his bed hadnt been slept in so i stepped inside the roomi remember my hand went out for the light switch the lights came oni was looking at gregs bed i couldnt see his body from there i didnt know he was there and then these gloves closed around my mouth and my throat she took a long shuddering breath junebug leaned forward okay ms wiercinski please describe what happened very carefully take as much time as you need lorna her closed eyes tight lines nodded okay one glove went over my mouth because i started to scream the other went behind my neckshe pantomimed for usholding me at the base of the throat i just stopped dead because as they closed around me this voice whispered to me make a sound bitch and youre dead a mans voice or a womans i asked junebug didnt seem to object lorna shook her head i couldnt tellthe voice was a ratchety harsh whisper a mans i think maybe what about the gloves what kind were they thick coarse not like driving or dress gloves but like heavy work gloves of course i said whoever used that garrote on greg would have to protect his own hands from the barbs pulling it taut could be painful from the way the person was holding you ms wiercinski could you tell if they were bigger or smaller than you or around your own size junebug asked ignoring my valuable insight hed probably already thought of it anyway lorna shook her head i couldnt tellthe way he was holding me it was at something of a distance from him i wasnt pressed up against him ii thought of fighting but i was too scared i mean everything id heard of what youre supposed to dofight kick screammy mind wouldnt do it i just froze what happened next lorna swallowed heor shepushed me facedown on the bed i remember saying please dont hurt me he didnt say anything he blindfolded me with what i later found was one of gregs ties then he tied my arms together with the bedsheets he shoved another tie in my mouth as a gag and put a pillowcase over my head then he shoved me into gregs closet and said in that hoarse whisper you just stay right there i could hear the closet door shut and the key turn in the lock she sniffed i guess thats when you know youre staying in a real old housewhen you have keys for the closets i thought he was gone but i couldnt be sure i heard movements at different times so i just lay there for a while and i started to get panicky i was pretty sure hed left so i worked my way out of the sheets got the gag out of my mouth and took off the blindfold and the pillowcase i peered out of the keyhole but i couldnt see anything i started screaming and kicking on the door finally i kicked it loose i saw gregs body and screamed chet rushed in and got me out and he called the police ii asked him to call jordan junebug said nothing but tapped his pencil against his pad in an annoying staccato how long have you been in mirabeau maam only a day or so gregs been here a few days longer she frowned and you cant even say whether or not the person who grabbed you was a man or a woman how tall they were or nothing junebug demanded not with certainty lornas jaw set if i could tell you i would maybe you wouldnt junebug said we dont know you here id had enough look junebug ive known lorna for years and she is not a liar im not about to take this from someone named after an insect lorna stormed but junebug placid as ever raised a calming hand lets not dwell on this at the moment junebug drawled perhaps you can tell me who might have had it in for mr callahan lorna propped her elbows on the table and leaned into her open palms sorry mr moncrief about the insect remark i didnt mean it im extremely upset he nodded jesus i cant believe anyone would kill greg she looked over her polished fingernails at junebug my first guess would be nina hernandez i mean there was certainly bad blood between them and i did hear him arguing with someone but i didnt hear another voice maybe he was arguing with her on the phone i wondered if nina was big enough to strangle greg or manhandle lorna but i didnt say anything how had he gotten along with folks here junebug asked fine she said i mean some people didnt seem keen on his development plans for the river but i cant imagine someone would kill him over that he told me when i got here that hed met with some of the landowners already i supplied junebug with the names of those who owned the land that greg wanted he jotted them down carefully and tapped his pencil again look lornas been through hell youve got the tape of her statement cant you let her get some rest and have her sign it tomorrow ii cant go back there lornas eyes pleaded with mine of course not youll stay at my house youll be safe there one more question ms wiercinski then well be done i appreciate your effort in telling me all this junebug looked squarely into her gray eyes what kind of man would you say mr callahan was lorna snapped not the kind who deserved to die that way mr moncrief he was smart funny confident of himself he enjoyed life and i cant believe he got taken this way she dissolved into tears and her statement was over it was nearly five in the morning when i got lorna home we let ourselves in quietly trying not to disturb mama or sister that was in vain sister was already up she practically ran across the living room to me where the hell have you been i wake up in the middle of the night to check on mama and your beds empty i call candace and she doesnt know where you are she looked at lorna youre not candace whoops i made quick introductions explaining in as few words as possible that lorna had run into trouble and id had to dash out to render aid at the news of murder sisters eyes widened well of course you can stay here lorna ive heard so much about you but you know jordy doesnt talk much about boston anymore and i saw the lovely flowers you brought mama that was real kind of you she herded her charge into the kitchen giving me her patented wewilldiscussthislaterlittlebrother look jordy you might want to call candace im afraid ive worried her sick by calling her its still awful early i started but lorna looked oddly at me call her jordan shell be concerned put her mind at ease lorna didnt usually show solicitude for a rival wait a minute i reminded myself candace and lorna were not rivals my heart was with candace wasnt it of course it was i went back into the kitchen and tried to ignore the melting littlegirl looks that lorna was giving me im sorry to meet you under these circumstances arlene lorna said staring down into a mug of decaf coffee dont you worry about it lorna sister glanced up at me ill just get the guest bedroom ready for you clos been using it when she stays the night oh dont put clo out lorna began but sister interrupted dont worry im not shes not here tonight she doesnt usually work nights anyway its not a problem i picked up the phone and dialed candaces number one ring and she answered she didnt sound exactly asleep candace its jordy silence on the other end broken finally by where are you at home i had to go over to the mirabeau b lorna im not sure i want to hear this jordy listen greg callahan lornas boss got murdered i explained what had happened to lorna my god do you want me to come over are you all right im fine lorna needs some rest so do i sisters fixing up the guest room for her more silence oh how long is she planning on staying candaces voice sounded just a tad arid i dont know until the investigation is complete i suppose she cant very well stay where the murder happened can she maybe candace couldnt help herself i suppose not but she seemed tough enough to handle anything shes not so tough i dont think any of us are at a time like this i paused greg was only a little older than me candace to be cut down like that go get some rest sweetheart ill open up the library tomorrow and ill talk to you later the gentle click of her hanging up the phone was her only goodbye i slept like the dead and the dead populated my dreams i woke up around ten my body slicked in sweat my arms stretched out painfully in front of me fending off some dream assassin who carried a twisted length of wire in gloved hands i swallowed two tylenol took a shower shaved dressed and maneuvered my sore arm into its sling wondering if i needed to have the doctor look at it again i stumbled downstairs sister was working an afternoon shift so she was sitting in the kitchen sipping latemorning coffee with clo mama sat in her chair staring at dust motes in the air perhaps they sang to her or danced for her in the closed theater of her mind lorna i was informed by clo was still asleep clo and sister demanded more details i told them everything i knew they jumped on the case using deductive abilities garnered from watching too many bad mystery movies on tv strangled with barbed wire sounds like something an eyetalian would do clo theorized well all those yankee businessmen probably have mob connections sister opined wait though he was from boston and had an irish surname maybe it was a union hit like jimmy hoffa if theyd had enough time with the body they wouldve dumped him in the river clo made a noise of sad agreement i dont think someone would follow him all the way down to texas for a hit i said pouring myself a cup of coffee clo a death by garotting that would be quick wouldnt it i would think so cut the blood and air off real fast but i dont know clo sipped at her coffee you better hope its not no mobsters arlene they might want to hit that yankee gal next sisters eyes widened in horror good lord i never thought of that this was not a mob hit i insisted you two are just trying to scare each other and please do not refer to her as that yankee gal her name is lorna lorna did you make sure that candace knows how to spell it too sister snapped back shes never been one to skirt an issue although i might wish shed show a little interest in shyness now and then what does that have to do with anything i sputtered plenty that yankee gal comes to town sets up her hoops and you just start jumpin through them like clyda teppers poodle im real sorry her friend got killed but it does seem that shes leaning on you awful hard why didnt she move to another room at chets or to another motel i just wonder what candace thinks of you being so sweet to miss lorna shes fine with it i said in a low voice she understands that lorna needs me jordy youre as stupid as you are tall no woman understands an exgirlfriend needing her man sister sat back in her chair with grim satisfaction you know lots of men sure would like to date candace she got chased plenty before you moved back to town and i bet if you wander out of the picture that raced be back on in no time some men appreciate her even if you dont sister was spared the sizzling reply i was busily working on by the doorbell she leaped up to answer it clo talk some sense into that boy no way im staying free and clear i heard sisters muffled voice at the front door and she walked back into the kitchen frowning your father is here she said coldly i couldnt blame sister for not particularly warming up to bob don goertz after all our mother had had an affair with bob don and her adjustment to bob dons presence in my life had not been smooth however she was at least grateful to him for saving us all during that last bit of unpleasantness in town and for helping with mamas care bob don paid clos salary i went out into the living room and found bob don talking gently with mama he knelt by her a big blond man with a smalltown haircut he was dressed in his usual uniform of shortsleeved shirt tie khaki slacks and brown weathered cowboy boots he was holding mamas hand and using a soft voice he didnt use out on his car lot how you doin this morning annie sure is a nice morning and you look real pretty today clo must be taking good care of you she is bob don i said so hed know i was there he stood up absently patting mamas hand shed hardly looked at him she doesnt always register presences how you feeling today fine son fine he calls me son every now and then but im still not used to it i understand you had a helluva night i shrugged and indicated my arm between the semimad bomber an exgirlfriend coming back to town and a murder i dont know why people say they get bored in small towns bob don shook his head and sat on the couch i offered coffee but he declined i could hear that the chatter in the kitchen screeched to a halt no doubt clo and sister were more interested in other folks conversations we wont have to send sister to oldbiddy school to get her ready for her golden years you heard about all this i asked yep got a phone call early this morning from junebug wanted to know if id heard from this greg callahan fellow about selling him my land had you hell yes he came by the other day offering good money for my stretch of riverfront property i figured hed come see you too i was gonna call you about it but then you got hurt and i didnt want to mention it to you while you were in the hospital i shrugged again he sent in reinforcements i told him about lornas visit and last nights events i had discussed lorna with him a few weeks back during our first attempted fatherson dinner at the sitaspell were you going to sell to callahan i wanted to but gretchen thought we should hold out for more money bob don said let me digress for a moment about gretchen goertz gretchen is bob dons wife and theyve had about as happy a marriage as the royals gretchen used to drink pretty heavy but after it came out that bob don was my daddy i guess she decided to clean up her act so bob don wouldnt leave her shed checked herself into a clinic in austin dried out and had been sober for the past several weeks shed also been cloyingly sweet to me i didnt believe for a second it was because shed been dying for a stepson and was just showing her appreciation for my debut in her life i couldnt tell though if her kindness was because she was finally sober for the first time in years or because she wanted to stay on bob dons good side either way i avoided her as much as i could well it doesnt look like gretchen will get any money now i said who even knows if intraglobal will still be interested in building here after this mess good morning a voice came from the stairs it was lorna her hair a bit disheveled dressed in some old pajamas and a robe of mine god i hoped candace didnt see her in that bob don leaped to his feet hello there darlin you must be lorna im bob don goertz jordys daddy it sure is nice to meet you but im just sick that its under these here unfortunate circumstances lorna wasnt quite awake yet and in full command of her etiquette she stared i mean stared at bob don from the helmet of carefully coiffed hair to the scuffed tips of his wellworn cowboy boots youreyoure jordans father yes maam proud to say i am hes just the best boy a man could hope for you know he is as smart as a whip and got his mamas good looks and of course hes all educated i didnt want bob don quoting my resume for the remainder of the day and he will do so given the opportunity bob don i bet you lorna could use some coffee lorna that sound good wonderful she wiped sleep from her eyes regarded bob don anew and offered her hand forgive my rudeness im not quite myself this morning i am delighted to meet you mr goertz jordan told me all about you last night and its obvious he thinks youre a remarkable man bob dons eyes lit up like hed won the lottery and his mouth worked as he smiled at me all right so im not the most affectionate soul around he knew i cared didnt he i frowned and fled going to get lorna her coffee sister crossed her arms and grimaced at me as i came in well those two ought to get together like a house afire theyre both into trying to bust up relationships clo quickly excused herself to go use the rest room i poured a fresh cup for lorna and turned around lets get this straight sister right here right now i dont care if you like lorna i dont care if you hate lorna but she is a guest in this house and i think mama would be ashamed of you for talking trash like you are sister opened her cavernous mouth to respond but i didnt give her a chance to spew further venom and as for the other side of that little crack i will remind youonce and just oncethat you are talking about my father now his presence in my life may not set well with you but this is my house too and i will not have him badmouthed in it she shut her mouth and i paused for breath im not really used to giving my big sister that much sass and i waited for the imminent explosion id miscalculated im sorry she said and she sounded it im mad at him and i dont know how not to be mad at him i appreciate what hes done for us i do but when i see him i dont think about the good things hes done i think about all those years ago when he mustve tried to steal away mama from daddy daddy is dead mama is dead in nearly every way you have me you have mark we arent going anywhere okay and enough craziness is going on without you and me bickering she nodded unable to look at me for a moment i couldve hugged her and had a real kodak moment it got spoiled though by another ring of the doorbell i patted sisters hand went through the kitchen and out to the front door it was junebug which wasnt a surprise the surprise was that he was accompanied by a darkhaired woman i didnt know a smiling gretchen goertz and a frowning billy ray bummel mirabeaus pride and joy of the legal system chapter six jordy darling gretchen squealed throwing her arms around me it was so unexpected i sniffed her neck wondering if id smell a daub of bourbon junebug just told me about what happened last night you poor angel gretchen pulled back and patted my cheek you mustve been through hell but of course youve seen a dead body before still one just couldnt get used to it whats going on here i managed to say well jordy darling i was trying to track down miss wiercinski because i understood she might be continuing to represent intraglobals interests i thought she might still want to make an offer at our landbob dons and mine it was actually bob dons land not hers but gretchens always been a big believer in community property she glanced over at bob dons white cadillac chet blanton told me she was staying with you i had no idea bob don was already here is he meeting with miss wiercinski not exactly i smiled i think he came to see how i was she smiled back so she wouldnt look irritated of course jordy you would be his first concern excuse me billy ray bummel interrupted just where is this woman i looked down on billy ray with as much disdain as i could muster which in billy rays case is a great deal hes the kind of prosecutor whos an embarrassment to the legal world if billy ray had been prosecuting the nazis at nuremberg thered be even more old men speaking german in uruguay today he puffed out his very small unimpressive chest and lifted his briefcase i would lay odds the only briefs it ever contained were fruit of the looms he ran a hand through overoiled hair and adjusted his glasses so he could scowl at me better weve never been friends im here to see ms wytryski and i dont aim to put up with interference from you jordy its wiercinski billy ray and i wouldnt dream of interfering i dont need to you always manage to shoot yourself in the foot just right jordy please junebug said sounding tired we do need to talk to lorna he indicated the dark young woman standing next to him she was short a little heavy and had a look that hinted at deep intensity at whatever she did this is sergeant teresa garza from the austin police department bomb squad shes assisting us in dealing with the bomber she wanted to talk to you too jordy about the mailbox incident sergeant garza shook my good hand i surrendered quickly fine shes in here i brought the entourage into the house with me it made for quite a crowd gretchen made a beeline for bob don doing her best not to glare daggers at mama clo quickly whisked mama upstairs and stayed with her i dont believe id leave gretchen alone with mama not with all the pillows in the house against my will i introduced billy ray and gretchen to lorna at hearing that billy ray was the local prosecutor lorna flared good have you talked to nina hernandez yet not yet billy ray purred walking in a circle around lorna she shot me a quizzical look and i just shrugged he turned to bob don who was sitting on the couch with gretchen and how convenient that youre here mr goertz ill be wanting to have a word with you as well bob don looked surprised me you knew greg callahan didnt you billy ray asked you had business with him well yes id met him he wanted to buy my land he came by the car dealership day before yesterday told me about the development plans he had and offered me a price i told him i wanted to wait and see if jordy was selling his land too billy ray rocked back on his heels well mr goertz i just find all that highly interestin i wasnt about to stand mute while billy ray auditioned for lears fool in my own living room i also didnt care for the accusatory stare he was favoring bob don with do you have a point billy ray other than the one on your head i added to myself junebug said hey jordy why dont you go outside with sergeant garza and talk about thatll keep i snapped back i dont usually bark at the local constabulary but i wasnt about to leave bob don or lorna to billy rays tender mercies sergeant garza looked pissed but i didnt care this was about murder not blowing up mailboxes or canine chateaux junebug harrumphed listen billy ray i think that billy ray didnt give junebug a chance to cogitate undoubtedly our local paean to jurisprudence thought he was hot on the trail of a careerboosting case and he wasnt about to let common sense or decorum get in his way billy rays what folks around here call booksmart he mustve had one lobe working to get through law school even if he got his certificate by mail as it was rumored but he didnt have enough common sense to fill a thimble hes the type of fellow thatd poke his finger between a cottonmouths fangs to see if the mouth really was all soft inside you keep some of your land over by the river fenced off dont you mr goertz billy ray continued holding up a hand to fend off junebugs protest excuse me gretchen stood and looked down on billy ray imperiously are you interrogating my husband or accusing him of a crime because if you are you havent informed him of his rights and i will not stand for it i could have kissed the old battleax gretchen for gods sake bob don interrupted billy rays just asking questions he doesnt suspect me i dont have a solitary thing to hide not anymore i thought i heard sister mutter behind me but i didnt turn around to check bob don nodded at billy ray yes i keep barbed wire on that property to keep out dee loudermilks cows i dont have fencing on the side of the property thats next to jordys he beamed at me no fences between this father and son i thought to myself thats highly interestin billy ray loved that pet phrase thin barbed wire aint it i saw where this was going and felt myself go pale bob don shrugged i guess why because mr goertz the wire that was in greg callahans neck matches a length of wire thats missing from your fence same length same type wait a second i said how do you know this the wheels of justice move quickly poteet billy ray bummel smirked the lab over in bavary identified the type of wire that killed callahan last night and this morning junebug got a call from the mayor complaining that dees calves were getting loose because bob don hadnt fenced correctly on one section we checked out that section and theres a big old yank of wire missing isnt that a coincidence probably not i retorted maybe the killer cut that wire maybe he didnt but bob don didnt cut that wire and he didnt kill greg its ridiculous what motive would he have jordy you stay out of this sister began but she hushed when i scowled at her well a little bird told me that miz goertz here was seen having lunch with mr callahan yesterday maybe mr goertz didnt appreciate having his wife wined and dined by a goodlookin young feller like that gretchen gave billy ray a glare that wouldve frosted a fireant mound i dont know who your little bird is billy ray but its chirping the wrong song yes i did have lunch with mr callahan yesterday at his invitation he wanted to talk to me about the land purchases he hoped i would be able to convince bob don to sell to him it was purely a business lunch and he conducted himself like a gentleman the entire time gretchen took bob dons hand and i ought to whack you one for suggesting different billy ray bummel why ive half a mind to call your mama and tell her how youve been treating decent folks with your snide accusations billy ray bummel did for once look a little pained probably no one hed tried to browbeat had threatened to call his mother on himand if youve ever seen mother bummel you know thats not an idle threat excuse me mr bummel lorna had finally decided to get involved in the fracas i dont see what motive mr or mrs goertz would have you know that nina hernandez loathed greg why arent you off questioning her billy ray repulsed by hurricane gretchen turned his own bluster on lorna its real easy to keep pointin fingers at ms hernandez when youre the one who knew the deceased best id like to know more about your relationship with callahan miss whychintzy wiercinski lorna corrected a nervous tongue darted out over her lips i dont know what you mean about a relationship i worked for greg he was my employer and that was it know when someone you know intimately is lying theres that subtle shift in the air like when the airconditioning comes on in a house thats been closed up too long you cant always tell when a loved one is lying right to your face because you want to believe whatever garbage theyre feeding you but its a damned sight easier to tell when theyre misleading some other fool i caught my breath sure that lorna was fibbing billy ray wasnt deterred mr blanton seemed to think that perhaps there was a bit more to it lorna iced mr blanton is mistaken she glanced over at me her eyes played along my face just what is the purpose of all this billy ray i demanded are you just spending your time going around blindly accusing people of charges how industrious of you ive got to ascertain the facts of this case poteet billy ray answered a sudden odd pleasantness in his tone i want to know just what mr goertz mrs goertz and ms wiercinski know about this case and i dont intend to put up with interference from you his little eyes they dont need to be big because his brain can only handle limited information at any given moment focused on me you knew the deceased as well care to comment on that i met him once last night very briefly he never called me or contacted me about my land he was letting lorna handle that did you think he and your exgirlfriend were having an affair good lord of course not i stormed would i have cared i wasnt sure i wondered if the sudden pang in my stomach was what lorna had felt when shed learned about candace and me so you say billy ray smirked again but i already know what kind of temper you have poteet junebug put him on a leash i said im not going to have him come into my home and make totally unfounded accusations against my friend and myi nearly said father but some internal editor cut me offother friend i tried not to look at bob don i didnt want him to think i was ashamed of him but i also didnt want to share my paternity with a trashmouth like bummel i told you i wasnt having an affair with greg lorna shot me a look is this what your judicial system is like down here theyll never catch gregs killer come along billy ray junebug said with a touch of resignation and infinite patience as our assistant da began to bristle lets go talk with miss twyla and her houseguest he nodded at sergeant garza jordy would you ride over there with us and answer some questions for sergeant garza sure as long as i dont have to listen to billy rays exercises in fiction i said bob don and gretchen quickly said that they had to be going lorna looked lost and sister stared at me with her arms crossed i sighed and headed out the door being interrogated by teresa garza was a sight nicer than being questioned by billy ray bummel first teresa garza acted like she knew what she was doing second she was polite third she didnt conjectureshe just asked finally she had a soothing voice on the drive over to miss twylas house i answered sergeant garzas questions as best i could sitting in the back of junebugs cruiser with her and billy ray up in the front being unusually quiet i provided as many details as i could muster youre the only person thats actually witnessed an explosion she told me no one saw mr boolforss shed or mrs teppers doghouse blow up she made me go over the details of what each blast looked like the pop of the mailbox the flash of light and the concussive noise that trumpeted the detonation she gently touched my sling youre very lucky jordy if you had been by one of those mailboxes you could have been more seriously injured or even killed billy ray coughed i know if candace hadnt pulled me inside when i fell i would have gotten a back load of shrapnel i paused what kind of person does this maam why would they blow up mailboxes on candaces street a cold thought touched me could someone on that street have been a target garza shook her head her hair was cut professionally short and mousse stiffened it into immobility i doubt it although its hard to say but this has all the classical marks of a prankster the explosives are homemade are put in places that dont have high traffic and are set off when people generally arent aboutalthough this last incident certainly came close to violating the pattern she frowned that bothers me where would someone get explosives around here junebug cleared his throat parker loudermilks a partner in that construction company over in bavary he knows all about explosives he observed quietly as he turned into miss twylas driveway this charge against authority was too much for an eggsucker like billy ray chief moncrief im shocked and the mayor being your boss why i ought to it was just an observation billy ray junebug said innocently made me wonder if perhaps junebug wasnt going to seek higher office next election to my great annoyance i was not invited in to see billy ray grill nina hernandez junebug handed me over to sergeant garza and i walked with her examining where the exploded mailboxes had stood garza told me the blackened posts of wood and twisted metal had been sent to her office in austin for analysis a total of six had exploded isnt blowing up mailboxes a federal offense i asked if they blew up post office property yes she answered but i dont think well have to get the fbi involved yet my worry is that no one in mirabeau is turning up as having purchased explosives you can check that garza nodded yes the atf has all the records of explosives purchased in the country theyve been running the names of everyone in mirabeau through our systems and the only ones that have been coming out are people with legitimate commercial reasonslike mr loudermilkfor having explosives were checking them out but none of them seem to be good suspects i still cant believe this is happening in mirabeau she shook her head most small towns never have to deal with this kind of activity for that matter neither do most big cities she pointed at where candaces mailbox had stood blasting cap i think with a battery attached and definitely with a timer from your description someone wanted them to go off in a row like firecrackers youre lucky it wasnt one of the pipe bombs our boys been packing those with potassium chlorate sugar and powdered aluminum that would have taken your head off i was only half listening instead i was staring at candaces shrapneled front door one windowpane had been broken and she hadnt gotten it fixed yet i thought shed come out and see us but then i remembered she was at the library doing my job while i was holding lornas hand i blew a long breath between my lips what a mess no sergeant garza we dont have to deal with explosives i said we just have to deal with the billy ray bummels of the world he is a piece of work she agreed politely i wonder i stared down blossom street at the six empty spots where mailboxes should have stood wonder what if theres any connection between these pranks and greg callahans death i squinted into the afternoon sun and rubbed my sore shoulder the two tylenol id taken earlier were wearing off and billy ray had given me a headache why would you think that jordy garzas tone sounded guarded well just cause mirabeau is a small town and we dont usually have murders or bombings but now were besieged by both seems kind of an odd coincidence dont you think teresa garza favored me with an indulgent smile junebug warned me he said you have a tendency to stick your nose into crimes around here i cant help it if ive gotten involved in some unfortunate incidents and i dont have any intention of trying to figure out who our mad blitzer is i shrugged i just wondered if odd events that happen close together were related dont they teach you wildhaired imagination at the bomb squad maam she laughed yes jordy they do but they also teach us to deal in facts i dont know enough about the callahan case to see any connections i shrugged again i suppose i just like for everything to be in its place or maybe i just find it a tad more comforting to think weve got one nut running around town rather than two any further conjectures were silenced by miss twyla joining us she was carrying a tray of freshly made lemonade and she invited us to sit with her under the shade of her back porch i watched sergeant garza eye the expanse of miss twylas backyard amused at her reaction there were a flock of plastic pink flamingos herded around a birdbath an odd sculpture that dated back a couple of oudelle generations an oldfashioned tornado shelter and a lush garden of vegetables and herbs we thanked her and drank heartily say what you will lemonade that comes out of a can just cant compare with the real stuff tart and sweet like candace when ive teased her a little too much sergeant garza its just awful that jordy was hurt miss twyla looked mournful do you think the police will be able to catch thewhat is it you call them on tvthe perp garza shook her head im sure that chief moncrief will get to the bottom of this and id like to talk with you as well ms oudelle see what you can tell me about this incident miss twyla sipped her lemonade id be delighted to help people think old ladies are nothing but nuisances and id like to prove em wrong ask away my jordy all these questions flying about my little house poor nina is just being hounded by that dreadful mr bummel i shook my head look miss twyla i know youre fond of nina and all but she did have the best motive to kill greg callahan and i for one have never considered you a nuisance someone who nurtures the earth the way that nina does could not cavalierly take a life miss twyla answered she refilled garzas glass from a beautiful cutglass pitcher the ice popped as the cool liquid poured over it and miss twyla paused as though listening to her lemonade besides nina and i were up late plotting our strategy to defeat intraglobals land purchases nina suggested if the town is against the development the landowners who are inclined to sell might be less likely to do so my garden club is going to donate at least ten thousand dollars and although i loathe the idea of using the profits of trashy literature eula mae has generously offered fifty thousand the womens guild is planning to hold car washes and bake sales to help raise money thats a chunkachange miss twyla i said but i dont think its going to be enough to counter intraglobals coffers we were also going to appeal to the honor of our citizens who owned that land miss twyla intoned i thought it most likely that your uncle bidwell would sell that land to intraglobal i hoped you and bob don would at least listen to our side of the story the loudermilkswell theyd find it politically unattractive to sell if we roused the town against the project if they didnt sell and i didnt sell and if you or bob don didnt sell then their project would fall apart and theyd leave mirabeau alone you were saving that money for bid i said laughing despite myself well youre right we couldnt match whatever obscene amounts of money intraglobal would offer but we could turn the town against the development using that money educate people about why we need the river more than we need a bunch of silly condominiums moneys the key to stopping intraglobal nina says anyhow as to your suspicions of nina she and i were up late discussing our plans and we went to bed around eleven i am a very light sleeper and i didnt hear her leave during the course of the night maybe she left very quietly i suggested oh i even hear you and candace coming and going at times miss twyla answered and i started blushing before shed finished her sentence then realized she meant arrivals and departures besidesand her oldmaidish face made a pout of distastei understand the poor yankee was strangled with barbed wire most gruesome dont you think jordy and certainly not very ladylike sounds like a crime a man would commit id been so involved in trying to help lorna i hadnt given the various aspects of the crime much consideration strangulation with wire death closing around your throat implacably mercilessly when i thought of what greg must have suffered the lemonade in my gut threatened mutiny once before id had hands closing around my windpipe i recalled tiny parmalee trying to squeeze the life out of me on that longago playground jordy you okay teresa garza leaned toward me you look sick im fine i said i struggled to regain my composure tiny parmalee had been sticking to nina hernandezs side like a familiar to its witch no woman in town would have much to do with him if she gave him the slightest encouragement would he do her bidding or even do her dirty work killing a man with barbed wire didnt seem to fit nina but the idea of it slipped onto tiny like a wellworn glove god nina might not even have encouraged him he might have taken it onto himself to remove anyone who annoyed nina i imagined the faint little neurons in his dense brain firing off the clever idea to get rid of greg callahan and win ninas heart tiny saving the fair environmentalist damsel from the firebreathing developer i could just see it tell me miss twyla did tiny come over last night after the library meeting i made my voice sound what i hoped passed for normal oh yes jordy hes been so helpful and dedicated i know that not everyone in town likes tiny but he has really a good heart inside i think the poor soul is just misunderstood hes become terribly fond of nina miss twyla proffered the pitcher to me but i shook my head there was already a sour taste in my mouth she continued he came over for a little while and just sat while nina and i talked poor nina was sure he was getting bored so she told him to go home andwell im sure she didnt mean it cruelly but that shed call him when we had ahem something you can do like stuffing envelopes im afraid the poor dear didnt take it very well he left in a bit of a huff to go prove his worthiness by crushing the life out of greg i thought then chided myself i sounded like billy ray grasping at straws but it was far easier to imagine tiny committing a brutal murder than it was bob don or lorna i was quiet so garza finally got the opportunity to inquire about the destruction of the mailboxes miss twyla had no details to add to my account when they finished talking billy ray junebug and nina came out onto the porch nina looked exhausted as she leaned against the wide white wicker chair that miss twyla sat in today she wore a faded greenpeace tshirt with the logo of the famed rainbow warrior vessel on it and snug wellwashed khakis her hair had the look of having nervous fingers run repeatedly through it and she appeared tired nina dear miss twyla said now that ive helped the authorities id like to take a nap if you dont mind miss twyla nina glanced at me no doubt wondering why i was there of course dear would you like some lemonade before you lie down no maam im fine nina glanced over at billy ray unless you have any more questions for me no miz hernandez i dont believe i do not just at this moment billy ray flipped through some notes but you wont be leaving town without telling chief moncrief now will you of course not greg callahan being dead doesnt mean that intraglobal wont still be after that land lorna wiercinskis still here so intraglobals still here and im staying as long as this river is threatened then well know where to get in touch with you junebug countered shell be here miss twyla interjected her voice just a little sweeter than her lemonade jordy sergeant garza if yall will excuse us she got up and herded nina into the house the rest of us headed for junebugs cruiser junebug slowed me down a bit letting garza and billy ray get ahead of us he leaned in close against my sore arm i dont want you to run straight home i need your help at the station and i dont want billy ray to know about it okay i nodded and silently got into the cruiser wondering what i had just volunteered for chapter seven when we got to the station billy ray bummel didnt tarry long he sallied forth to terrorize other suspicious residents of mirabeau teresa garza said she needed to head back to austin and asked junebug to give her a call if he needed more help or if another prank occurred thanks teresa for coming out here junebug mumbled he seemed suddenly embarrassed and i noticed sergeant garza was smiling at him in an enigmatic way the air was charged between them i stood there in glee watching junebug redden slightly under my gaze teresa garza gave his hand a quick squeeze thanked me for my time and headed out the door we watched her drive off my what was that all about i inquired nothing he said lets go inside and talk this was simply too good to resist and in many ways im a slave to my lower drives why junebug one might think you were setting off these charges yourself just to get her down for these little visitsi mean investigations all right jordy ive known teresa for a long time she requested this assignment because she knows i need the help besides the austin bomb squad provides assistance to several surrounding counties and dont tease me you know better than anyone that these bombings arent any laughing matter we went back into his office and i watched him try to putter away his embarrassment by shuffling large piles of papers she has lovely eyes i observed to myself one pile of papers tumbled into further disarray damn it junebug muttered under his breath i always end up paying for being your friend dont i he hadnt called me a friend in years and i sat for a moment enjoying it men arent always big on acknowledging who their real friends are when theyre sober i decided id tortured him enough and stopped short of asking him to bring teresa to have dinner with candace and me you wanted my help with something i asked he scratched his brown burr and gave me a look of utter resignation you know a lot about computers dont you i guess i mean i know how to use one and most of the common software packages i cant write programs though why i leaned back in my chair well i dont know diddly about computers nelda and franklin use one for office administration and we got the tlets system tied in with dps but ive never learned much about em i need your help i didnt want billy ray to know about it because he just got a home computer and hes been bragging plenty about how much he knows about em they havent yet made the computer billy ray can figure out i said it would have to have buttons for chimp fingers and a builtin drool cup what do you want me to do teach you the basics what kind of computer does nelda use or do you want to learn a different one what i want junebug answered is your help and your silence i want to find out what was on greg callahans laptop computer it took longer than i wouldve imagined it would namely because i had to explain to junebug each and every step he knew a little more than he gave himself credit for but not enough to make himself useful we started off in his office with the door shut gregs dark laptop and the pile of inch diskettes that id seen in gregs room sat there can you find out whats inside all this junebug asked well let me ask you a question have you dusted the keyboard no franklin bedloe one of my deputies he knows about them he said wed damage the hard part hard drive the fingerprint dust might very well do that but i need to type on the keyboard to see whats inside why dont you want to have franklin or nelda do this anyhow because i told em id do it junebug snapped back he usually talks in this languorous drawl so you forget he has a temper im gonna catch the son of a bitch who killed that poor man that awful way in my town anyhow you can teach me the basics while you do this kill two birds with one stone i shook my head at his foolish pride okay so how do i avoid getting my prints on the keyboard he left and returned with evidence gloves those clear kind you see cops handling the murder weapon with on tv i slipped them onto my hands damn theyre tight of course my hands are enormous anyway bull you got the hands of a hamster i never saw such a tall man with such little hands and you know what they say about men with little hands yeah they have to help their friends with little peckers figure out computers i answered okay why dont we see whats on these diskettes first have you dusted these nope okay ill make copies of the diskettes so you can dust the originals i thumbed through gregs diskettes oh this is interesting ones marked loudermilk files what do you imagine could be on there and wheres loudermilk files thats what i want to know junebug said sounding just a tad impatient i glanced through the rest there were six diskettes in all three unmarked the one marked loudermilk files another labeled mirabeau project estimates and another titled financial junebug followed me like a puppy while i found some blank inch diskettes in a box in the supply office he seemed calmed when i pointed out that gregs diskettes were made by one manufacturer and were colored blue while the stations were colored tan no danger of getting them confused on neldas machine i quickly formatted my disks so they could receive data then copied gregs six disks i carefully labeled each of the copies so it matched the original junebug watched fascinated by this simplest of computer tasks he slid the originals back into an evidence bag as i finished with them okay lets snoop i said as i loaded up the first of the copied disks choosing loudermilk files nothing i tapped keys then turned back to junebug sorry it looks like the disk is blank what did you do wrong he wailed no listen i didnt do anything wrong theres just no information on this disk zilch i sat back in the chair rubbing my arm id taken it out of my sling to type faster and it felt rebelliously painful better than yesterday but still not well maybe hed labeled it but didnt format it it might have been that he was planning on putting files on it he hadnt created yet or maybe it was erased junebug mused can you tell that from the disk someone probably can i cant if they just erased the stuff on the disk it would still be formatted to receive information or they could have formatted over the information that would completely destroy whatever was on the disk crap can you tell if someone reformatted it to ruin whatever was on there junebug asked theres probably a way but i dont know it i confessed youd have to send the original to a business that specializes in data recovery they have programs and means of getting back stuff that gets accidentallyor maybe on purposedeleted but theres only so much they can do junebug gave a long sigh lets check the others the story repeated itself five times each of gregs diskettes was blank so what happened to them he said half to himself one greg or someone put these labels on perfectly okay blank disks but never put information on them to me that doesnt seem likely i never label a disk until ive put information on it or the disks did have stuff on themat least the ones that were labeledand someone has either erased or destroyed the information i stopped and turned to him but if someone wanted to get rid of the information why not just steal the disks and destroy them later maybe they didnt want them on their person and if they can destroy them by using the computer they dont need to steal them there might be the risk that the data could be recovered though i scratched my nose with one plasticsheathed finger but like i said i dont know how much the datarecovery folks could do maybe it was enough to destroy the stuff on these files you said that there would also be information on the hard disk on his machine junebug said lets look at that god i hope it hasnt been erased i can copy whats on the hard disk onto diskettes if you like or we can look directly onto his hard disk junebug considered better make the copies i did so there were plenty of files on the hard disk so at least it hadnt been erased we both confessed to skipping lunch so junebug called the dairy queen and ordered two country baskets with strips of fried chicken peppered cream gravy buttery texas toast and french fries cholesterols not something we worry about what with all the fresh air we get i finished up the copying while we waited for the food to arrive dairy queens dont usually deliver but junebugs a special customer what with being the law when the food came we wolfed it down like a couple of good bachelors the feeding frenzy completed we took the several disks that held the contents of gregs hard drive and went back to neldas computer i slid the first disk in and accessed its contents there were a lot of spreadsheet files and wordprocessing files and i went to those first youre sure were not breaking the law by doing this i said i mean if you find evidence in here youll be able to use it right yes dont you worry about it just dont erase anything he leaned over my shoulder as i typed unless hes passworded the files i should be able to see everything here i said if hes put a password on any of them theyll be locked he made a noise in his throat and i got to work the first files i looked at were wordprocessing files i preferred to deal with language over numbers first the files were organized into directories letters memos reports i peeked first in letters and looked at the contents then began opening each file to read it couldnt we print out copies junebug asked yeah but lets skim through the stuff first and see whats most interesting then we can print hard copies there werent many letters and they all seemed to do with the condo project in mirabeau there was a letter to the lower colorado river authority asking for a list of any environmental requirements that developments on the river had to adhere to regardless of any local or county regulations a letter to chester blanton at the mirabeau b lamar bedandbreakfast requesting reservations for gregory callahan and lorna wiercinski a letter to frederick jacksill of rivertown real estate of mirabeau confirming him as their commercial realestate agent in bonaparte county another letter to martin h noone attorneyatlaw in bavary seeking a bid on legal services for land purchases in mirabeau the letters were written in a nononsense corporate style id become awfully familiar with in my days in the business world all square and boring junebug murmured over my shoulder i nodded and opened another file marked zadichi junebug and i had each read about three sentences into the letter when we said oh shit in near synchronization the letter read brennan street boston massachusetts mr gary zadich chemsolutions inc portofcall road deer park texas dear mr zadich i believe that the purchase of land in mirabeau bonaparte county texas will proceed according to our timetable the land is zoned for both commercial and residential use private homes and commercial farms are already side by side and there are very few controls set on which businesses may operate on the river the land is ideal for your needs as a chemical waste storage facility labor in the area is cheap the slow economy and local unemployment should prevent any grassroots campaign against your facility of course i will be reselling you the land as soon as title clears undoubtedly some environmentalists will be deeply upset at the idea of a chemical waste storage facility on the river but i think the community will welcome business of any sort these bumpkins need the money i will contact you again as soon as the purchases are complete or if i run into any difficulties sincerely gregory callahan holy shit junebug crumpled back and collapsed in his chair bumpkins bumpkins i exploded that smarmy little bastard does he think we all just fell off the turnip truck we are not idiots junebug he doesnt know who hes dealing my voice trailed off as i remembered that the source of my ire was in the past tense shit he was going to buy up that land then resell it to some chemical dump how could he do that i took a long breath i dont knowmaybe declare insolvency say that his other investors pulled out of the project and he had to sell the land voila heres this chemical waste company that needs some land and oh i just had to sell it to them maybe its not even the chemical company itself but another company owned by them so the folks who want to protect the river dont know junebug nodded grimly and then that company dangles the promise of new jobs god knows we need em what with so many family farms having troubles hes right some folks would even be willing to put up with a chemical site on the river if it meant food on the table he paused and rubbed his chin but others would do anything to keep a chemical dump off our river i heard everything that he was saying but i had my mind elsewhere lorna did she know about this had she lied right to my face telling me all about their delightful little condominium development while knowing they were going to sell the land right after they got it i felt a slow burn of anger oh lordy i heard junebug say if anyone here found this out theyd have a helluva motive to kill him i blinked at junebug well this should clear lorna right this gives a lot of folks in mirabeau a motive and if she knew about this what motive would she have i was babbling and i knew it i fought back an urge to push my fist against my mouth god if she had lied to me about this for the sake of profit junebug saw my vexation he put a steadying hand on my shoulder cmon jordy lets look at the rest of the files believing in the innate goodness of people most of the time i kept hoping wed find another letter from greg to mr zadich calling off the collective lie to mirabeau greg apparently was not innately good there were drafts of letters to the city council in mirabeau explaining that the condo deal had fallen through due to investor withdrawal and that he was actively seeking new investors followed by another draft that claimed he couldnt find any investors and so was selling the land to another commercial concern that commercial concern was no doubt chemsolutions near houston but the letter didnt state that the financial files lent heartbreaking support to the letters there was a set of spreadsheets for the condo project this was probably what greg planned on showing the landowners another set worked out gregs profit on selling the land to chemsolutions with money thoughtfully laid aside for any messy legal actions as we read each file i felt slightly ill id felt sorry for greg callahan at first but my sympathy was now tempered with the knowledge that he mustve been a supreme bastard there was only one other file that was on the disk and it didnt work with neldas spreadsheet or word processor it was a calendar program the kind that businesspeople use to set up appointments i donned my gloves again went back to gregs computer and copied the entire calendar program over along with the associated files i then installed the program on neldas machine and we began to look through gregs last days the past week and a half were all that were there apparently hed spent most of those days in boston in a few meetings with names that meant nothing to us hed taken one side trip to houston apparently the day before he came to mirabeau that day was marked meet with zadich confirm deal junebug busily jotted down all the information into his notes hed spent three days already in mirabeau not counting today his schedule at least as marked down in his calendar went like this tuesday july meet with noone bavary go to county courthouse bavary lunch with mayor loudermilk mirabeau meet with twyla oudelle landowner meet with f jacksill mirabeau meet with dee loudermilk landowner wednesday july meet with b poteet landowner meet with b d goertz landowner meet with j bavary thursday july remindercall gary with update on progress reminderlorna arrives austin airport coming in with rental carleave j poteet to her meet with f lunch with chamber of commerce mirabeau meet with b d goertz meet with lorna after her meeting with j poteet meet with j thursday had been his last full day in mirabeau before he died his plans for that day had been friday july breakfast with l and f close deal with b poteet lunch with mayor solve any problems with to and nh he hadnt lived for that breakfast with i guessed lorna and freddy or presumably to give a bunch of money to uncle bid or to solve any problems with miss twyla or nina i scanned back over the list and gregs penchant for abbreviations some were obvious j poteet being me and i wasnt very pleased at the idea of being left to lorna f being freddy jacksill to being twyla oudelle but who was j another abbreviation for freddy or someone else altogether a name or a profession maybe even junebug i thought for a moment then dismissed it we finished and i felt a craving for a cigarette i used to smoke a pack a day but then i got into running up in boston so i quit repeatedly id started up again with all the stress id felt when i moved back to mirabeau candace hated cigarette smoke so id sworn off for the past three months i needed one now though i borrowed two cigarettes and a book of matches from the dispatcher and junebug and i sat outside in the lateafternoon shade of a liveoak tree behind the station having ourselves a good old think the summer air heavy with humidity draped over us my shirt started clinging to my back well ninas reasons for killing him certainly have gone up if she knew about that letter i said blowing smoke above my head nasty habit i reminded myself but it did make me feel better as soon as my arm was healed id have a good solid run to make up for my vices junebug scratched his chin but why kill him over it if she knew about the letter and the plot with this chemical company why didnt she just blow the whistle she couldve humiliated him and exposed him for a crook i think nina would find that a sight more fulfilling than killing him that made sense i pictured nina and greg bickering at the library meeting and her smugness when she challenged him i thought that she might rather see him squirm than see him dead but shed do just about anything to help protect the river i considered the ember at my cigarettes end including murder thats a bit of a stretch dont you think shed faced off against him before and lost i paused i wonder if he tried this same scam somewhere else but she had confronted him over this same chessboard wouldnt she know his tricks junebug shrugged that bears looking into but maybe hes done regular land development before this and just decided to turn crooked with this deal i think we better try and find out more about greg callahans business deals i gotta go make some phone calls he stood and dusted off the back of his blue uniform pants so who do you suspect i jumped up to my feet everybody and nobody junebug said i dont suspect you though youll be pleased to know my gratitude knows no bounds well neither does mine thanks for helping me with the computer i think ill quietly sign up for one of those introductory courses over at bavary community college now that youve got me on the basics can i call you if i need more help with it sure junebug we shook hands and he went back into the station i stomped on what was left of the cigarette picked it up and thumbed it in a trash can and headed to my car lorna had a lot of questions to answer i tore off down the street ready to go confront her but as i drove off i caught sight of tiny parmalees battered red pickup truck coming up quick behind me chapter eight tinys pickup resplendent with its battery of dents smokespewing pipes and oversized confederateflag decal in the back window along with what looked like a deer rifle stayed close behind me all the way home i felt a childish fear id never forgotten how tiny had nearly crushed the life out of me at little provocation my fear though quickly changed to anger as his truck followed barely two feet behind my own back fender i took a deep breath i wasnt a little kid who could be pushed around again and i wasnt about to let a bluntheaded bastard like tiny parmalee intimidate me id seen too much pain in life and backing away never got a soul anywhere his grimy truck finally backed off as i pulled into my carport and he stopped in front of my house i wondered for one moment if hed come out swinging and how i was going to handle that with only one good arm if he did attack me id be at a serious disadvantage i decided then and there that the best defense would be a solid kick to his beer gut followed by another boot to the groin and a judicious retreat into my house not a polite way to fight but mannered combat takes two gentlemen id just emerged from the car when tiny slammed his door shut and came lumbering across the lawn at me his whitish hair gleamed like a bald dome in the summer sun his eyes were a thin watery blue but they were narrowed in anger one hand was already in a fist hey he yelled stopping a few feet ahead of me get something straight you shithead you leave nina alone excuse me i answered pulling my arm close against my body and tensing my legs i havent even talked to nina today whats your problem my problem poteet is you you think nina killed that yankee son of a bitch you told miss twyla that obviously one had to be careful what one suggested to miss twyla i never said that she did well not exactly i just asked miss twyla where nina was last night and she told me if you think someones bugging nina you need to go see billy ray bummel and junebug i wanted to take a step back but i didnt you dont do that to a bully and tiny parmalee had changed very little since those schoolyard tussles he had been angry then with no outlet for releasing it other than torturing other kids he was angry now and still hadnt learned how to deal with wrath look tiny its obvious that you care about nina i understand that what the hell do you know about me he asked drawing a heavy hand across his lip you dont know shit about me mister or about what i think about nina he shook his head you think youre so smart poteet you always have always looking down on me always thinking im just nothing but a big stupid shit im not im a hell of a lot smarter than youll ever give me credit for okay youre smart who killed greg he took one step forward and pushed a finger toward my face i smelled the nauseatingly sweet odor of a thick wad of chewing gum he had in his mouth and i saw the bulge it made in his unshaven cheek just stay away from nina stay out of this whole mess just ship that yankee bitch of yours back where she belongs and keep out of mine and ninas business since i didnt know what constituted his and ninas business and i hadnt interfered in any way that i knew of i very much disliked his jabbing his finger at my nose not to mention him calling lorna names this is not a joke tiny this is a murder someone killed greg and whoever did that is going to pay for it nina and greg didnt get along at all so shes going to be investigated by the cops dont take it so personally i mean youre sure shes innocent arent you he wasnt expecting that the finger receded from my personal space yeah i am he said slowly as though id asked a trick question so then you and nina have nothing to worry about i didnt add my thought unless you strangled him you animal tiny blinked repeatedly she didnt do it maybe ill find out who did if the cops keep suspecting her i didnt think tiny would make much headway as a detective but i kept my mouth shut is that all yeah just stay away from nina and quit fillin folks heads full of foolishness about her back on the familiar territory of threat making he regained his confidence he turned his back on me and headed back for his truck tiny he paused while climbing into the truck yeah dont ever follow me that close again or ill shoot out your tires understand me he wasnt expecting that id threaten back in any way and to my surprise he smiled coldly ill remember that slamming his door hard enough to shake the truck he started the engine and roared off leaving a bloated cloud of exhaust in his wake i exhaled a long breath hed been pissed but he hadnt beaten me up unless of course he was out to seek vengeance against junebug and billy ray for suspecting his inamorata of being a bloodthirsty garroter i went into the house quietly it was nearly three in the afternoon and i felt exhausted i needed a nap i wasnt going to get one eula mae and lorna sat on the couch smiling tightly at each other i felt id walked onstage halfway through a death scene hey yall whats going on i said those tight smiles of theirs didnt budge an inch hey sugar pie i just thought id stop by and see how miss lorna here was doing eula mae got up her layers of necklaces tinkling as she moved and gave me a perfunctory kiss on the cheek i was not swayed you sure yall arent squabbling over that land deal i asked eula mae pressed a wellmanicured hand to her violet peasant blouse showing her freckled cleavage to best display honey we havent even talked about that stuff its so trivial in the light of poor mr callahans murder lornas smile faded as soon as eula mae wasnt looking at her ms quiff was kind enough to invite me to come stay with her she thought i might be underfoot here eula mae rolled her eyes at me before turning them glistening with kindness and sympathy toward lorna sweetie the way you phrase things i simply thought that it might be nicer for you to have a little more room what with this house being so full of jordy and arlene and mark and anne and clo being over so much i frowned slightly at eula mae who did not appear to notice being busy closely examining the setting of one of her many rings i decided on the gentlemanly approach how kind of you eula mae and how unusually generous of you she bristled a tad at that and i grinned but i think lornas just fine right here eula mae shrugged the field of battle abandoned youre right jordy i mean you are spending most of your time at candaces so there is plenty of room here for dear lorna well nearly abandoned she leaned down and pattedor lightly slapped depending on your point of viewlornas leg if you change your mind sweetness you just call eula mae youll always be welcome at chez quiff i steered the unwelcome wagon firmly to and out the door the full blast of the afternoon humidity and sunlight hit us and we both blinked against the glare she shrugged off my light touch and frowned at me when id shut the front door jordan poteet are you thinking with your loins these days whats wrong with you have you totally forgotten your manners you could strip the flesh from my bones eula mae hissed and id still have more class than that nasalvoiced little minx in there good lord turning down my heartfelt invitation in her hour of need and not even nicely telling me she was sure candace had sent me over here she was near fake tears did candace send you over here of course not eula mae stomped her foot i am capable of independent thought mister you forget ive made my money from knowing all about love that was a tempting statement to twist around on her but i kept my mouth shut i wouldnt have gotten a line in anyway i know exactly what that womans up to you dont give a man the kama sutra if you just want to be pen pals especially the new edition eula mae continued and its the way she looks at you i saw it last night at the library when she came in she only saw you jordy the way her eyes narrowed i figured the poor child was astigmatic or in heat and she dont wear glasses eula mae i appreciate your concern honestly but youre getting carried away jordy darlin she took my arm listen to me that girls still in love with you its as plain to me as it is hidden to you youre sweet as pie but dense as fudge when it comes to women sometimes i know she has feelings for me eula mae i wasnt about to tell the human pa system here about last nights afterdinner kiss forewarned is forearmed she intoned ive made it clear to her im not about to tumble back into her bed she knows i have feelings for candace eula mae raised one plucked eyebrow and does candace know of course she does eula mae made a noise in her throat fished her keys out of her denim skirt pocket and sauntered off to her purple bmw with the romwrtr vanity license plates i watched her roar off eula mae was obviously not spending nearly enough time in front of her word processor and was inventing romantic fictions in real peoples lives as compensation of course candace knew i loved her and i wasnt going back to lorna nosireebob lorna was stretched out on the couch the back of her hand resting gently against her forehead her long legs lay along the cushions ideally formed and with the beginnings of a tan her khaki shorts were snug and short her neonaqua tshirt pulled taut across her breasts shed been sweating and there was just a hint of a sheen at her throat her waist which had always fit perfectly against the inside of my arm was encircled with a colorfully stitched cloth belt shed pulled her thick yank of hair back and fastened it into a ponytail with a bit of ribbon and a lank of it lay on her shoulder i watched her breathe and she kept her eyes closed id stormed in ready to confront her about gregs lies and now i found myself not wanting to have this conversationjust wanting to watch her doze the way i used to on lazy sunday afternoons in new england has the wicked witch of the south ridden off with her flying monkeys lorna asked hey there eula maes harmless and shes my friend i sat down on the end of the couch pushing her feet up to make room her skin felt annoyingly good i get the distinct feeling she doesnt want to be my friend despite her ohsokind invitation to stay with her what was all that about your harmless little friend sauntered in like she owned your house told me in nicebut no uncertainterms that you really didnt want me here and just seemed flabbergasted i wasnt packed and ready to go i think she even hinted that your mother might be inclined to go into homicidal spells without reason at any given moment eula maes bark is worse than her bite well mines not where is everyone i asked your sister has gone grocery shopping she made some comment about not expecting another mouth to feed lorna sounded a little cross and i couldnt blame her sorry about that just ignore her shes basically decent when she isnt being catty lorna shrugged i have far more to worry about than being on arlenes shit list your mothers upstairs taking a nap i checked on her a few minutes ago i did meet your nephew mark by the way he stopped by for lunch and hes off swimming with some friends she opened one gray eye and watched me past her raised knee probing my ribs with her wriggling toes she said you dont want me to go do you jordan i took a long breath that depends on how you answer my questions that got both those gray eyes open what did you know that greg was running a land scam that he was planning on reselling the land he wanted to buy for condominiums to a chemical dump site i watched her face as i spoke for any betraying flicker her mouth worked her jaw closing and opening on empty air what do you mean i told her again she pulled herself into a sitting position how do you know this it wasnt an answer to my question but i told her about finding the files on gregs laptop jordan i swear to youi swear on our friendshipthat i didnt know anything about this we exchanged stares then she lowered her eyes i feel like an idiot and you dont believe me she said how could you not have known lorna she shook her head her eyes staring off into her memories i didnt know i felt that you werent being entirely upfront this morning with billy ray and junebug when they were asking about greg youd better tell me everything you know i did tell you she said her eyes still watching something in her mind and not me absently she picked at the bandage on her finger no lorna i know you well enough and i dont think you did now what exactly did you do for greg i handledi didresearch for him on properties around the country that met certain criteria that he had ididentify the properties and then hed see about acquiring land there and investors to build on the land i didnt deal with any investorsi never met them i felt a sudden anger so you just happened to identify mirabeau as the town to fit gregs needs how convenient i didnt do it just to see you again despite what your enormous ego might say she retorted then looked contrite im sorry i dont mean to be a bitch im just shocked she swallowed and went on i set up these databases for him of towns all over the country then id run queries on the database finding out which ones had the attributes he looked forriver site slow economy proximity to a major metropolitan area lots of towns qualified and hed go check them out he justpicked mirabeau and you didnt help him make that choice you know if id still wanted you i would never have let you leave boston i didnt have to get a job with greg to try and get you back her voice grew sharp youre just so full of yourself jordan i can afford to be a little arrogant i snapped back letting the pain talk before my brain edited im not the one who looks like a landscam artist what he was doing was horrible lorna and you were helping him i didnt know honestly i want to believe you desperately i dont think youre a liar but right now im not a liar then what were you hiding when you were talking to billy ray maybe you knew about the land resale all along what else was going on maybe you and greg were lovers fine ill tell you her voice took on a strained sad tone she coughed once as though the words were slabs in her throat greg and i were lovers for a short while after you left but i cooled it down because i knew it was a mistake to get involved with my boss it was the stupidest thing id ever done but you broke my heart when you left and i was entitled to make stupid mistakes satisfied she bolted off the couch in tears and stormed out of the room hello sister trilled as she came into the kitchen laden with groceries i quickly offered to help and she looked at my bad arm with a raised eyebrow dont bother jordy wheres lorna shes resting upstairs shes not feeling well i didnt feel too hot myself oh dear sisters voice just dripped concern i think she needs a little company to brighten her day thats why i invited candace over for dinner i whirled to face her sister smiled like an angel just getting her wings i spent the rest of the afternoon lying on my bed hearing lornas vague movements in the next room thinking about all the hell thatd broken loose greg might not have done anything outright illegalthat would be for a court to decidebut he was obviously an unsavory character he didnt deserve what had happened to him but hed obviously chosen a bad path even now thinking about his savaged throat made my bile rise i closed my eyes and images danced behind my lids wire taken from the fence that bisected the loudermilks property from bob dons ending up in gregs neck gretchen in gregs company that mysterious phone number on the pad in gregs room greg being lornas ex or maybenotexlover gregs longstanding animosity toward nina tinys fury at the thought that nina could be accused the erased diskettes gregs neatly arranged files that indicated he was out to defraud the people of mirabeau with this condo development the letters hed already drafted to send to the city council even before his deals were done his many meetings with people in the town miss twyla the goertzes parker and dee loudermilk freddy jacksill uncle bid he hadnt met with me and i felt pert near left out and who was the j he met with at the end of each day it hadnt been me i wondered idly if it was jenny loudermilkshed come in right behind greg at the library meeting or another abbreviation for freddy jacksill they were the only people connected to the case that i could think of of course it could be someone else entirely and to add to all this the bombings tomorrow i decided id have to talk with mr freddy jacksill and the loudermilks i took some more tylenol wondering if you could get addicted to the stuff and rewarded all my hard thinking with a predinner nap i could have killed my nephew mark hed ended up getting invited to stay at a friends for hamburgers for dinner leaving me alone with three women all of whom had their eyes on me for different reasons it was really more than any one man should be expected to bear sister was the congenial hostess being as sugary to me and lorna as twodayold sweetpotato pie shed insisted on doing all the cooking while leaving candace lorna and me out in the living room with a lifepreservershaped tray of cheese fruit and chips i felt like the dip she brought in our beers and patted lorna on the shoulder lorna i know youre probably not feeling like partying very much but trust mea relaxing evening with friends will make you feel better try and put all this dreadfulness behind you for just a few hours good thing lorna wasnt diabeticsisters cajoling tone would have put anyone into a sugar coma lorna wasnt fooled for an instant thats awfully sweet of you arlene and inviting candace too so i can make a new friend here in mirabeau well really you shouldnt have i managed to choke down a chip i could see the evening unfolding like a bad horror movie candace and sister or at least sister had connived not to leave me alone with lorna not knowing that right now i was a bit tiffed at lorna sister wasnt about to have her baby brother get into a mixed marriage and marrying a yankee would be considered just that in mirabeauwe didnt trust genes that hadnt been in nearby pools for several generations and she was kind of stuck on the idea of me and candace staying on a steady course candace had either gotten dragged into this or was a coconspirator but she was the person i was happiest to see and lorna god help me lorna saw right through sisters charade and had determined to be as affable at least outwardly as sister was being she wouldnt look at me given her latest confession but when shed come down to dinner shed given me a sideways hug and patted my shoulder i admit i had no clue as to where i stood with her or whether i believed she didnt know about gregs fraud i shouldnt be mad that she and greg had been lovers but i did feel a vague tug in my gut at the thought had she felt the same when shed found out about candace at least i comforted myself id had better taste in companions far better i thought with a smile as i glanced over at candace she was wearing an outfit of hers id always liked a simple blueandwhitestripe tanktop dress i glanced over at lorna shed changed into a boston marathon tshirt deliciously snug over her chest and long navy walking shorts both these women were beautiful in different ways any man should have delighted in their company but the tension hung in the air like a hanged mans ghost theyd spend the whole evening fighting over me a slight grin touched my mouth id never had two women fight over me before itd be hell to sit through but it might also be kind of funat the least a boost to my benighted ego i sat on the couch with the tray of food before me lorna had gracefully maneuvered to sit by me and candace had retreated to a nearby wicker chair sister had already fed mama and put her to bed so she wasnt there for me to talk to i find it a comfort to talk to mama sometimes even if shes not paying me a bit of heed you must stay busy here in mirabeau candace lorna purred i mean what with helping jordan out at the library that takes a lot of my time yes candace concurred and i do volunteer work for the daughters of the republic of texas chapter and the bonaparte county literacy program and the mirabeau historical society how sweet lorna said of course thats not really like having a career dont you get bored not really candace smiled tightly and youre right its not like a career im not shackled to it but then you dont get all the rewards from a career candace leaned over and patted my knee in a most proprietary way my work brings me all sorts of rewards god they were just going to snipe at each other all night over little old me i tried not to smirk after delicately arranging some cheese on a cracker lorna eyed candace and me so what do you guys do for fun in town if its just having sex spare me any gruesome details candace might have taken slight umbrage at being referred to as a guy but she wasnt put off by lornas ribaldry oh no we watch tvcable is a necessity if you live out here we go into austin to shop sometimes go over and eat in la grange or smithville tv huh does he make you watch all those old spy shows with him lorna asked leaning forward this had been a particularly annoying habit of mine foreplay had often consisted of wrenching the remote control out of my hand oh yes candace laughed he still loves to watch the avengers i think hed like me to go as emma peel for halloween and he could be john steed i just told him i wasnt about to cavort around town in a black leather jumpsuit with a sixties hairdo no sir he tried that on me too like he wouldnt look ridiculous in a bowler lorna giggled plus you know jordan he can be clumsiness personified hed poke someones eye out with that umbrella steed always carried she sighed no i always picked out our halloween costumes and every year he was an absolute baby about it i dont think this is really i began but candace cut me off what did yall go as sex toys lorna whispered back shooting a cautionary glance toward the kitchen where we could barely hear sister humming a trisha yearwood song with no regard to key lorna really i tried candace exploded in laughter oh my god i know isnt it horribly tacky but candace you have to understand the crowd we ran around with up there they were awfully full of themselves jordan and i liked to let a little of their stuffy air out so i went as a vibratorbasically i wore a long silver gown with speed settings on my front and an old football helmet with halves of golf balls glued on it oh my god and jordan was a dildo lorna managed to finish she was howling as hard as candace i wasnt howling at all i started a very detailed examination of sisters cheese tray this had ceased to be amusing how candace wanted to know just basically put a phallicshaped cylinder around him and he was set i did make him wear a beanie on his head for that special pleasuring sensation you wouldnt believe how cute he looked i think i still have a picture of him back home the cackles followed me as i escaped into the kitchen so much for their bickering over my studly form sister glanced up from her chickenfried steaks sizzling in the skillet with a heavenly aroma whats all that screeching sister obviously anticipated a catfight between my two paramours i hope youre satisfied i snapped theyre laughing at me i managed to make it through dinner but more than once i wondered if my steak knife would provide me with a fast death if i fell on it i did enjoy sisters food chickenfried steak surrounded by a delicate golden batter topped with rich cream gravy blackeyed peas cooked with peppers and bits of bacon steamed summer squash from sisters own garden with just a hint of rosemary thick slabs of homemade jalapeno cornbread with butter melting inside each slice for dessert we had warm gooey homemade pecan pie with blue bell vanilla ice cream on top the ladies drank iced tea with lime slices and i stayed with beer hoping to numb the conversation between candace and lorna it almost didnt matter who was saying what how long did it take you to get used to the snoring ages even though he claims he never snores yeah right i hope he picks up after himself better actually no he still believes that clothes that land on the floor have life and walk to the hamper under their own power i know but he says hes tidy at work well he is usually of course hes the worst flirt at work with all the old ladies they just love him didnt you ever want to snip out that tongue though i got tired of always having to engage in repartee not to mention what you just said his innate need to flirt really oh but you got used to it didnt you i always thought that it was kind of cute sister tried to dam the flow more dessert girls no thanks no arlene thank you god and have you ever dated a guy that liked war movies so much i always wondered if that meant jordy really wanted a military career but hes not good at taking orders or at giving them laughter from both sides i started counting the nuts in my pie hoping to find a big one i could choke on and did you ever see a man with so many damn books no its like having another library at home and god help you if you interrupt him when hes wanting to read he gets awful moody lord and those depressing books all those murder mysteries that actually scared me when we started dating i thought it was a little morbid at least he wasnt in a civil war phase god forbid he starts reading bruce catton again you wont see him for weeks sounds like football season when the cowboys are playing you better not talk during a cowboy game or laugh at him when the cowboys score and he does his little victory dance i have never minded being laughed at for that i exclaimed finally rousing to defend myself i looked at sister for help she seemed unduly interested in the crust of her pie picking at it like an archaeologist clearing dirt from an artifact hes not a bad dancer as long as the music has a very strongbeat and youll need steeltipped shoes to protect your feet well he did do a little striptease dance for me on my birthday that was just adorable all he kept on was a rose in his mouth and his cowboys baseball cap i hoped that all the blood in my body was not rushing to my face i wanted enough left to have a proper heart attack i wondered what it would take to shut them up the explosion shushed them a few moments later the roar of a blast maybe two streets over a faraway chorus of screams and moments later the cry of sirens chapter nine it was easier to run across the lawns to the smoky haze in the sky than drive it was only two streets over sister stayed with mama lorna candace and i dashed through the darkening yards the summer sun just setting to the west the earlyevening moisture sticking our clothes to our skins folks were pouring out of their houseschildren scared but excited parents with frantic looks the elderly with worn eyes and unsteady limbs candace and lorna followed me as i made a shortcut through a couple of backyards and came out onto mockingbird street a block down from the bedandbreakfast one roomsized portion of the beautiful old house was gone from the second story as though a hand had come down from space and torn it free smoke gouted from windows on the top floor broken glass and hunks of burned brick lay scattered across the yard one mirabeau police department cruiser was already in front its siren blaring at the burning building like a dog barking at a stranger in the distance i heard the whine of our one fire truck my god lorna exclaimed reflexively she grabbed hold of my slinged arm i hardly noticed the pain chet oh my lord candace cried she ran toward the police cruiser and we could see chet huddled in the backseat coughing one of junebugs officers franklin bedloe was barking into his radio calling for backup fire trucks from bavary i glanced back at the house the fire was spreading and my heart sank that house is one of the most beautiful in mirabeau and one of the oldest i looked up at the smoldering chunk that wasnt there anymore if i figured right the room that had been blasted into oblivion was gregs lorna beside me saw it too my god she yelled what the hell is going on in this goddamned town of yours we didnt have a chance to discuss it there wasnt much of a summer wind but one burning shingle sailing in the sky could destroy other homes touching them with the plague of fire lorna and i helped hubert moore a neighbor of the bedandbreakfast hose down his little antiques shop to keep it from burning even with only one good arm i can still aim a garden hose one fire truck arrived and began containing the blaze quickly joined by two others from bavary junebug and his officers began clearing people back from the heat exhausted i sat down on the curb lorna next to me i didnt see candace in the milling crowd in the street i did see our honorable mayor parker loudermilk and his wife dee watching the fire dee looked cold despite the heat her hands hugging her elbows back in a sec i said to lorna i went over to approach the loudermilks and barely caught a hiss from parker to dee you just keep your mouth shut and get jenny home what was that about i wondered as i tapped parker on the shoulder he fairly jumped whirled and put on his best political smiletempered you understand by the unfortunate circumstances jordy terrible shame about the mirabeau b isnt it parker wiped a sooty hand across the back of his mouth its awful i glanced back over at the blaze i know junebugs doing the best that he can to stop this bomber parker but people are getting really scared now someone couldve been killed tonight dee made a noise in her throat and looked away from the heat and smoke im going to go find jenny she said in a strangled voice and turning she wove into the crowd parker didnt look happy and he glared back at me his politicking forgotten i was after all his subordinate on the governmental food chain are you questioning my commitment to catching the bomber jordy his voice held the faintest threat of malice and there was a rigidity in his expression that i didnt like i blinked of course not parker im just telling you that people are frightened out of their wits just look at them he glanced around at the crowd with annoyance theyre like vultures on a dead coon he grunted theyre your voters parker and if you dont remedy this situation theyre going to vote someone else into office notice that i would not make a good politician with such blunt statements his lips thinned and he glanced down at the ground but when he looked back at me the public mask was securely in place parker pointed at my sling smiling beatifically i know youve already been hurt by all this we are going to catch whoevers responsible assuming that this is the work of the bomber and not just a regular fire or a gas explosion his eyes traveled back to the dancing flames even in the fading light i could see a fascination in his eyes as the blaze flickered its losing its battle jordy do you see it the fires dying there was an odd tone to his voice almost remorseful i snorted a gas explosion now would be an awful coincidence parker i think that parker loudermilk wasnt particularly captivated by my thoughts he squeezed my shoulder in the fatherly way favored by smalltown politicians i think they all must be sent to a school for that and said appreciate your citizenly concern jordy dont worry were on top of this he spun on his heel and headed for the police cruisers im sure that will be a great comfort to chet i hollered after his back but he ignored me childish of me to do that i suppose but i didnt really think that parker cared too much about what happened to anyone but himself despite the summer warmth and the heat from the fire i felt a tremor of cold watching him leave abandoned by the gentle patronage of our mayor i plunged into the crowd searching for candace and lorna i saw miss twyla nina and tiny all sitting in tinys pickup truck watching the crowd i thought of waving at miss twyla but didnt want tiny to fancy i was waving at him i found lorna standing with dee and jenny loudermilk i could see jenny was crying unless she had an unsuspected emotional attachment to antebellum architecture it wasnt the destruction of the mirabeau b that had reduced her to tears lorna looked lost so i collected her and headed up the road i glanced back at the loudermilk women they both appeared upset as hell what was going on in that family candace was sitting on a porch two houses up holding chets chubby hand eula mae never one to be away from the excitement was holding his other hand he was fighting back tears as the main chimney in the house shuddered and fell apart scattering soot and brick and a hundred and sixty years of history chet what happened i squatted across from him his heavy face glanced at me as though he hadnt known me for years ii dont know i mean he coughed again as though trying to clear his mind and his throat candace patted his back lorna came up to us kneeling next to candace eula mae stared daggers at lorna but lorna ignored her chet wiped tears from his eyes id just gone out to the backyard to put seed in the bird feeders and there was this horrible explosion i ran back into the house i tried to get up the steps there was all this white smoke but suddenly fire broke out and the heat the smokethey drove me back so i ran i just ran chet was anyone else in the hotel he shook his head ive only got one couple staying and they went over to bavary about ten minutes beforehand to eat at one of the german restaurants i havent had any other guests check in since mr callahan died and lorna left he broke down crying now holding candaces hand why why why would someone do that i stood staring up at the charring building the firefighters seemed to have it under control now but the old house looked gutted the fire was retreating but already sated with a diet of fine antiques expensive fabrics handwoven carpets and the dark memory of gregs murder i noticed that one of the fire trucks was maneuvering for a position closer to the west side of the house and several people were moving a car out of its way the car was a teal ford taurus with rivertown real estate emblazoned on a magnetic sign on the drivers door debris from the explosion covered the car having thoroughly dented its hood and starred the windshield i watched the volunteers move the damaged car and i wondered where its owner was id been meaning to talk to freddy jacksill about his deals with greg we sat for another hour watching the fire die neighbors offered chet a place to stay and he accepted mutely taking a flask of whiskey from one fellow and disappearing into a house across the street the cop cars and fire trucks stayed their lights whirling in a redandblue dervish it was as though no one quite wanted to go home lorna and candace decided to head back to the house i told them id be there shortly i thought they might not enjoy talking about me so much when i wasnt around but theyd have to make do junebug was talking with the firemen and franklin bedloe watching the house a few heavily suited firemen came in and out of the smoldering remains i wondered how compromised the structure was if the timbers would give way and collapse at any time much of the house still stood but it looked weak behind its smoky veil junebug nodded at me as i came up hey jordy i guess you heard it all huh were you at home i nodded yeah and chet told us what happened you think its the bomber i mean couldnt it be a gas leak or something it was a gas fire but we think the gas line was ruptured by the explosion that in turn caused the fire he sighed this doesnt exactly fit the bombers pattern though does it hes just been blowing up little diddly things not taking out buildings maybe i said i remember reading about pyromania in college in a psych class and i wonder if the impulse to blow up things is connected to a pyros impulse to set fires i remember that they said they tend to start off small and work their way up to bigger targets they say that about serial killers too franklin bedloe offered helpfully goddamn it thats all i need junebug muttered i already got a killer and a terroristintraining all i needs a serial killer i guess sergeant garza should know about this i suggested quietly junebug didnt smile i dont care much for seeing teresa under these conditions im just thankful no one was hurt yeah i answered then glanced back over at the fire trucks youd think freddyd see about getting his car out of here his insurance agents going to have a hissy fit when he sees all that damage junebug shot me a look then followed my pointing finger toward the wrecked taurus he glanced back at me have you seen freddy i shook my head no not today i paused then looked back at the remains of the bedandbreakfast oh god you dont think the blaze had died down long enough for some of the firefighters to try to go up to the second floor it held they built houses to last back in the olden days the search was short they found freddy at the top of the stairs and along the secondstory hallway and in gregs room and on what was left of the ceiling whatever caused the blast freddy jacksill had been right next to it when i got home candace and lorna had filled sister in on the explosion sister was nearly frantic and had called my nephew mark home to stay marks thirteen a bright independent boy whos never quite recovered from the desertion of his daddy who vamoosed to play cowboy in the rodeo all those years ago hes dark like his daddy but smartmouthed like sister and me weve had a rocky relationship at best but hed finally grown to accept me as a more or less permanent part of his life when i came into the living room thirsty and wanting a beer mark was animatedly telling lorna how id saved his life a few months ago lorna raised an eyebrow at marks highly embellished story i had no idea you were such a hero she said big hero i nearly got a bunch of folks killed including myself try scaredshitless hero uncle jordy was cool mark bragged he was in the newspaper and everything he was obviously still hoping that nintendo would take heed of my adventures and fashion a video game on me we still hadnt heard from them i told them about freddy jacksill being torn apart in the explosion and the blood drained right from sister and lornas faces lorna was quiet but sister didnt hold back that does it mark there are some extra loonies in town and youre not going anywhere youre staying right here where its safe maybe its not safe arlene lorna said quietly she stood and looked at us all a wild fear in her gray eyes my god first greg now freddy is someone killing everyone that had anything to do with the land deal what if they come after me next that was a distressing possibility several terrified looks crossed the room i felt the tug of panic at my heart candace as always was the rock look lorna well get you some protection okay jordy why dont you call junebug and see about getting an officer to stand watch here im sure itd make lorna feel better lorna gave candace such a look of gratitude that i felt like hugging them both thats a great idea candace im sure he can spare someone i said and went to make the call junebug said hed send over franklin bedloe to serve as a guard he also told me that teresa garza was going to come back to town tomorrow to look over the damage at the mirabeau b lamar he sounded exhausted so i wished him a quick goodnight i think he wasnt the only one wornout the folks in my living room looked like death warmed over candace announced that she was ready to turn in she wished mark sister and lorna a good evening and thanked sister for the dinner i offered to walk her out to her car she leaned against my good arm as we approached her mercedes the faint glow in the sky that had come from the burning antebellum home was gone replaced by a smudge of smoke that stars shimmered softly behind thanks for the suggestion about getting protection for lorna i said she slid her hand into my back jeans pocket as we walked protection for all of you while shes in your house candace answered softly she wasnt looking at me but staring down the street im sorry eula mae decided to interfere and try to get lorna to go eula mae loves to get involved in her little causes im just sorry i always seem to be one of them eula mae would never admit it jordy but she loves you like a little brother shes always going to interferethats how she shows her affection i nuzzled her neck and how do you show your affection she put a hand up to my chest and pushed me away but gently i dont exactly feel like a public display of affection when youre going back into that house where youve ensconced your old girlfriend wait a minute honey you know that its for her own good i dont doubt lorna does anything thats not for her own good candace said dryly she slid her hand out from my back pocket where it had felt ohsocomfortable and crossed her arms youre not jealous of her candace you cant be shes funny shes smart shes gorgeous shes loud too but ive seen the way that you look at her youre still attracted to her and please dont insult my intelligence by denying it okay i wont yes i find her attractive but not as attractive as you im not good at undying protestations of love and i felt coltish and awkward lorna and i are past okay for gods sake dont you trust me around her i trust you but not her she shook her head what is the hold she has on you jordy shes conceivably putting your whole family in danger by staying here and yet you roll out the red carpet if you trust me then you shouldnt have a problem with this my heart ached at the pain on her face okay i love you enough to trust you around her but i still dont have to like her staying here shes my friend and im not going to abandon her right now thats right put everyone else ahead of your own interests candace yanked open her car door i didnt have a decent reply so i stayed silent she stood on tiptoe i leaned down and we exchanged a quick dry kiss sleep well she said and drove off i love you enough to trust you around her shed said she told me shed loved me but id been unable to reciprocate the words my front teeth gnashed on my lip still warm from her kiss and i turned and went back into the house mark had been dispatched to bed his complaints about being treated like an infant filtered down from upstairs sister softening toward our guest in light of this latest trauma had kindly offered to run lorna a bath the gurgling noise of the water in the pipes reminded me of when mama had run baths for sister and me when we were little this activity was usually followed by her chasing a naked me around the house and forcibly putting me in the tub lorna was sitting staring down at a colorful quilt that my grandmother schneider had made decades ago her fingers traveled across the patterns and stitches as though tracing a road on a map this is really lovely jordan she said not looking up at me youre lucky to have such keepsakes in your family the wiercinskis were never big on keepsakes are you okay lorna i asked her voice had taken on a distance i didnt like i am i think i am she looked up at me i could still get lost in the whirlpools of her eyes i dont know what to think greg being dead and all his lies now freddy being blown to bits in gregs room it makes no sense we need to talk sister came halfway down the stairs peering over the railing i drew a bath for you hon its nice and warm well talk when youre done i said she nodded and went upstairs the doorbell rang and it was franklin ready to watch over lorna and the rest of us i invited him inside how does this work franklin you want to sleep on the couch or do you sit out in your cruiser and watch the house or what i never guarded anyone like this before he confessed i think itd be okay if i stayed down in the living room if thats all right by you he didnt look pleased at the prospect of spending an entire night in his police car i couldnt blame him sister showed him where all the sandwich fixings were in the fridge now you just help yourself if you get hungry franklin i made that chocolate pie myself and you just cant get better franklin looked pretty pleased at the provisions and promised hed clean up any mess he made sister warned him repeatedly not to shoot mama in case she wandered downstairs in the night franklin assured her he wouldnt i took two beers upstairs to lornas room when she finished her bath she had toweled her long hair as dry as she could but it still hung in a damp cascade around her shoulders the hot water had pinkened her skin so she looked more relaxed than id seen her since shed got to town she wore a simple white robe that fortunately went down to her knees i remembered a red silk one shed had far skimpier that used to fall off at my touch i was glad she hadnt packed that one for this trip we need to talk lorna i handed her a beer she nodded and sipped at her celis bock first of all i believe you when you say you didnt know about gregs plan to resell the land to the chemical company she gave me an unreadable look it means so much to me to have your trust jordan her voice wasnt unreadable it dripped with sarcasm that word trust again i tried not to visualize candaces wounded face in the moonlight look i was upset you can imagine how i felt especially when it seemed youd lied to me about using my land i still dont see how you could have thought id lied she snapped lets not argue i pleaded we need to work this mess through now what was your impression of freddy jacksill lorna paused and took a slow sip of her beer you know i remember being surprised when i found out you were originally from a small town you were worldly in certain respects but freddy was exactly what you expected from someone from a little town he was anxious to be the biggest fish in the bowl more blustery than selfassured he was very eager to please greg keep him happy im sure that greg filled freddys head with all sorts of garbage about how much money was to be made when intraglobal acquired the land whos going to take over gregs assignments at intraglobal now that hes dead lorna opened her mouth then closed it again well no one i mean maybe me but the companys nothing without greg unless doreen miller wants to keep it going i dont think greg was working on any other deals right now surely theres another senior person she shook her head greg didnt like to discuss it when he was out closing a deal but hes intraglobal all by his lonesome its basically a oneman consulting service with a silent partner her names doreen miller she put up a bunch of the money for greg good lord lorna the name intraglobal makes it sound like theyre two steps shy of world domination not a oneman shop she smiled i know i told greg it was a little misleading but he said it made us sound more professional have you talked with this doreen miller told her about gregs death lorna shook her head i dont know how to get in touch with her greg said she was old boston money ive never met her odd and odder i thought greg never said that he was a big company but id always had the impression he was we better see about tracking down this doreen miller junebug said he was going to be calling up to boston ill tell him he needs to find ms miller as well lorna nodded her number must be in a file on gregs laptop somewhere i didnt remember seeing it but id doublecheck anyway one more question what was going on with the loudermilk women when you were standing with them jenny looked like she was crying and dee looked upset lorna shrugged i dont know i met them both briefly when i got into town greg introduced me to them they seemed kind of twitchy she paused theres an undercurrent of bad feeling between them jenny was sassy to her mother a couple of times while i was at their house but dee just ignored it typical teenandmom strife i guess i didnt answer lost in thought until i noticed lornas hand idly playing along the bedspread weaving through the two feet of space that separated us youve been exceptionally kind to me jordan i suddenly felt nervous well sure lorna glad to i dont excel at playing the helpless female neither does candace maybe thats why you like hershe reminds you of me i definitely wanted to skirt this discussion i stood maybe so lorna listen its been an exhausting day lets get some sleep i moved to the light switch raising one hand in a quick wave of farewell not going to tuck me in she asked coyly she didnt sound so tired anymore and her modest white robe had somehow shaped itself to the curves of her generous body i stared down at the floor no like you said youre not the helpless female good night lorna and with that i made my escape to my own room like a nervous teenager dashing home without a goodnight kiss sleep didnt come easily i lay awake rehashing all that had happened earlier first of all why was freddy jacksill in gregs room or near gregs room the room had been yellowtaped as a crime scene was freddy simply curious or had he had some business in gregs room he hadnt wanted anyone to know about could he have been involved in gregs scam surely not i thought it would have ruined his business in town i needed to know a little more about freddy jacksill and the explosionif it was indeed the work of mirabeaus mad bombersuggested two possibilities first freddy was the bomber and had planned to blow up the mirabeau b or gregs room to be more specific and the bomb went off prematurely i thought i could dismiss that theory freddy wouldnt know squat about explosives second the bomb had been placed in gregs room and freddy was just unlucky enough to be there why bomb gregs room perhaps because of its sudden notoriety in town it presented itself as an appealing attentiongrabbing target why were the bombings happening anyway clyda teppers ridiculous doghouse fred boolforss townfamous shed without a single tool that belonged to him not to mention that legendary collection of playboys a series of mailboxes exploding in a synchronized dance there was a strong air of desperate theatricality about the incidents like a child who throws a particularly creative temper tantrum so hell be paid extra attention the loudermilks troubled me too an air of unhappiness hung about that family as though theyd recently suffered a loss dees being upset parkers weird watching of the fire jennys cryingperhaps i was conjuring up my own theories about the loudermilks on flimsy suspicion but my intuition registered that something wasnt right in the mayoral mansion i gave up worrying about all these folks and finally drifted off to sleep ive never been a light sleeper so i dont know how long lorna had been lying next to me in the dark hollow of my bed her fingers awakened me rubbing slowly in an arc from my waist up to the basin between my shoulder blades a kiss touched the tender joint where neck meets back i jerked awake aware of her presence and my own involuntary response i usually sleep in the buff so i yanked the sheets up to protect my modesty my arm throbbed when i leaned against it lorna what the hell jordy can i call you that since everyone else does she said her face very near to mine i cant sleep im scared and im lonely i need to feel you near me i resented the position shed put me inor wanted to put me in its not a good idea lorna really no one has to know candace is okay i dont want to hurt her but i have needs too i cant be alone right now you know how good we are together she was pulling at her own robe with one hand and pulling me toward her with the other i pushed back no its not true that no one would know i would know im sorry things havent worked out between us but im not risking what i have with candace just because you want a roll in the hay now go back to sleep and well talk in the morning in the darkness i couldnt see her face clearly but her silence spoke for her good night jordan i hope you never need anyone the way i needed you right now her voice was like ice on my skin when she left the room i rolled oversomewhat painfully until sleep finally claimed me again i tried not to think of all those wonderful nights in boston chapter ten when its a pleasant morning mama likes to sweep the back porch the exercise is good for her the doctors say and i think she might get a vague comfort out of doing a job well alzheimers patients use simple repetitive actions as their own security blanket as though cleaning a porch for six hours replaces having a life full of fear and love and joy and sorrow the next morning i found lorna sitting on the back porch with an unusually dapper mama talking to her while mama clenched her favorite broom as i poured myself a cup of coffee i could hear lornas voice through the screen door of course jordan isnt the easiest person to love i guess you know that he likes his own way sometimes and he can get a little sharptongued my mother never could stand him she thought he was a real hick despite his urbanity when he lived up north i hope youre not offended by that mrs poteet the gentle swishing of the broom against wood was the only answer mama had been unusually quiet since lornas arrival i paused by the door not wanting to listenbut not being able to help myself this sounded like the lorna of old the one who lived behind the bravado and the one id been missing i think i understand now how jordan felt when he lived up north missing home doesnt sound so silly anymore of course he had you and arlene and mark to come home to ive got a sick fern and a pile of bills i coughed loudly in the kitchen and slammed a cupboard door letting her know i was around suddenly i didnt want to hear much about lornas lonely life up north maybe it was lonely now only because greg was dead she met my eyes as i came out onto the porch with the coffee then glanced up toward heaven gorgeous day isnt it was all lorna ventured by means of conversation i had to agree with her the saturdaymorning sky was a faultless blue shimmering toward white in the earlymorning warmth it was going to be another hot summer day without a hint of rain or at least for the next five minutes they say if you dont like the weather in texas wait five minutes and itll change summer afternoons often brought quick drenching showers when moist air pushed in from the gulf afterward it was like being in a sauna your clothes adhering to your skin in the heavy humidity it wasnt raining now though and i blinked up at the fine blue sky it offered a conversational refuge yes its real pretty i stared down into my coffee cup i wasnt going to ask her how shed slept im going to have to go into the library can you entertain yourself for a while im quite good at that lorna tucked her feet under her bottom she glanced over at mama maybe ill just stay here and keep your mother company she blinked at me im sorry i never got to meet her before she got sick me too i think yall would have liked each other i didnt know what else to say i didnt believe that myself mama would have thought lorna far too brassy i feared i finished my coffee i got to go ill talk to you later here you are sister strode out onto the deck nodding a good morning at lorna are you ready to go over to the cemetery cmon mama lets go marks in the car i felt like id walked onto a stage and i didnt know my next line cemetery freddys funeral surely isnt today is it sisters green eyes steeled jordan michael poteet you have forgotten that today is the anniversary of daddys death six years ago i thought wed go over this morning before work and put flowers on his grave she glanced at lorna i guess youve had too much on your mind oh god sister im sorry i totally forgot yes lets go and do that now my face felt hot with shame and embarrassment daddys death had just about killed me hed been my best friend my pal my mentor until the cancer took him in a slow agonizing embrace i couldnt believe i had forgotten especially in light of learning that bob don was my biological father ive got an order waiting for us at neubergs florist sister said ushering mama inside and pausing on the doorway lorna im sure you understand that the family needs some privacy right now franklin said he could stay on guard until eleven then theyll have someone replace him of course arlene you guys go on to the cemetery ill be fine she forced a smile and followed us inside the mirabeau cemetery lying far from the river on the east side of town is beautifully maintainedan expanse of clipped grass marked by marble monuments to lives once lived a gravel road cuts a circle through the middle beyond it lie the oldest graves those with solely german names denoting the earliest bavarian colonists who settled the river land the dead here start in the s and in a back corner lie markers with only first names those of the few slaves that lived in this section of bonaparte county and only found equality in their cold coffins i parked my chevy blazer near the poteet section there were at least twenty tombstones with that surname my mothers people the schneiders outnumber the poteets considerably and there are even some of them in the old german section i have not ever looked to see how well represented bob dons people are my its going to be hot today sister fanned herself with a brochure from the florist as i struggled to pull the wreath out of the back shed abandoned her earlier frostiness to me but i sensed i wasnt entirely out of the doghouse mark stood holding mamas hand mama seemed to know she was around old friends and happily gossiped with the breeze we walked over to daddys grave looking lonely in its plot of poteet land his own parents were a bit farther away and the plots next to himthe ones reserved for mama me sister and markwere of course empty i wondered if he missed us as much as i missed him sister and i set up the wreath steadying it against the granite marker sister inspected the grave making sure no fire ants had desecrated our fathers rest i stepped back to admire our handiwork sister frowned at me as though id missed a cue well arent you going to say anything she demanded what you want me to make a speech i pointed at the wreath doesnt that say enough she stared at the flowers and her tears came quickly she cried silently for several minutes mark leaning against her in comfort mama watching a pair of bees dance above her husbands stone i crossed my arms stared down at my shoes and kept my own thoughts finally sister wiped her face sniffled and said mark take your grandmother to the car i need to talk to uncle jordy a minute aw mom its hot in the car here turn on the air conditioner i tossed the keys at mark and he went knowing she would brook no argument mama laughed as they stumbled among the graves winding their way back to the road look sister im sorry i forgot you just tell me jordy i need to know are you forgetting about him does he not matter to you anymore now that youve got a new father i blinked of course he matters to me how could you ask that i could never forget daddy you did today i realize that all this mess with lorna has you distracted but you dont ever talk about daddy anymore we used to laugh about his old aggie jokes the way he could impersonate cousin pearl how he taught us to play baseball when we were kids you dont ever mention that now i shook my head this is crazy is it youve got a new father one thats just chomping at the bit to be the worlds greatest dad to you i dont have that luxury ive buried my daddy i dont have a replacement waiting in the wings no onenot even bob doncould replace daddy sister bob don may want to be a father to me but hell im still not used to the idea of him being my father if you think this has been hard on you you dont have a clue what its been like for me i knelt by daddys wreath and fingered the ribbon of bluehis favorite colorthat hung from the circle of flowers and my having a relationship with bob don if i choose to have onedoesnt mean ive betrayed daddy im not so sure i believe that jordy i stood have you forgotten that mama mark and i would probably be dead if it wasnt for bob don no i havent forgotten have you forgotten that your precious bob don slept with our mother when she was married to daddy hardly i patted my chest you wouldnt have me to torture if he hadnt and thats the man you have as a father now she wiped her tears and pointed down at the grave we stood arguing over im angry im angry the man who could have broken up our parents marriage wants to be in our lives and dont say its just your life its mine too youre my brother and i love you but im furious and ive got every right to be i shrugged i dont know what to say to you i dont know what i even want from bob don im certainly not prepared to dismiss him from my life you cant ask me to do that no i dont expect that i heard the distant whine of a car and saw a steelgray cadillac seville churning dust along the cemetery road god does he have radar sister asked we watched bob dons caddy park behind my blazer he got out of the car smoothing his crown of hair into place carrying a large bouquet of flowers my god he remembered and you didnt sister walked in bob dons direction as he tentatively approached daddys grave hi bob don im sure you and your son would like some time together he heard the hardness in her voice im sorry arlene i didnt mean to interrupt give jordy a ride to the library would you i have to take mama home she didnt wait for a reply i remained silent as he laid the flowers on daddys grave the only noise the retreating engine of my car as my sister gunned it down the cemetery path thanks for coming i said at a loss for original conversation im a little surprised youre here id planned to stop by today but i called and lorna said yall were out here i hoped you wouldnt mind me coming out while you were here i dont mind i cant speak for my sister he tucked his hand into the back of his wellworn khakis she still aint used to me thats okay itll take some time yeah but she has to be willing to give you that time bob don shes not exactly comfortable with what you represent in our familys past boy you are the biggest brooder i ever saw bob don smiled up at me shielding his eyes from the morning glare ive always believed that a man should go on with what life dealt him and try not to fret about it so much the thought rose in my mind unbidden maybe thats why you could wait until my mother was crazy and my daddy was dead to tell me the truth it wasnt fair hed only been holding up his end of a damnably hard bargain i dont mean to be a brooder i suppose i have more than my share to fret over arlene messing with your head no lorna and candace i kicked at the grass i got women troubles bob don i got one in my house that needs me and one thats pretty upset about the situation you love that lorna bob don has never been one for beating around bushes i did once i think im not sure i dont know what love is now that boy is unadulterated bullshit bob don put his hands on his ample hips and shook his head at me excuse me nobody who was raised with as much love as you could say they dont know what love is your mama loves you he pointed down at lloyd poteets grave and you cant tell me that man didnt love you god he loved you and your sister and your nephew love you and i do believe miss candace tully loves you youve known more love in your life than most jordy so dont try telling me that you cant figure out what to do about them gals cause you dont know what love is youre just goddamned lazy he imitated a drawly rasp of a whine on the last few words that i was sure represented my voice i started to parry with a sharp reply but ended up staring down at daddys grave bob dond scored a hit against me and i knew it i ran a finger along the clayred granite top of daddys marker the stone beginning to heat in the rising temperature do i love lorna im sure i did once once aint now no its not a lots changed im not sure what i want if i was back with her you could go on back to big ol boston town and not fret no more about having a new daddy and a sick mama bob don awkwardly put a beefy hand on my shoulder and as i looked into his face i saw that folks had been wrong i wasnt the spitting image of my mother there was a lot of his face in minethe wide eyes the gentle taper of the nose the high cheekbones and the ruddy skin standing over my daddys grave i nearly shuddered at the shock of the realization im not interested in ducking my obligations bob don i wasnt suggesting you were god knows im not one to accuse some soul of avoiding responsibility but i think i know what that yankee gal means to you your old life back with none of these complications you may love candace and your mama but they make life a little harder to live can you take me to the library im running late now and if i lose my job my life will be complicated for sure glad to son he glanced down at the double spray of flowers on daddys grave see lloyd im doing my best to take care of him now just like i promised i spent the rest of that saturday morning doing library business drafting a grant application for more government money the competition among rural libraries can be intense ordering some new childrens books thats our fastestgrowing sectionwere a fertile bunch in mirabeau and getting advice on how to heal my arm from our elderly patrons many of whom still believe that a shot of whiskey mixed in a dollop of honey will cure pert near anything id called junebug earlier in the morning and told him what lorna had told me about gregs business and his silent partner doreen miller he hadnt called back with any news eula mae and nina hernandez stopped by to festoon the library bulletin board with colorful flyers that proclaimed join save our river ecology sore contribute and protect mirabeaus future i hope i observed acidly while watching eula mae indiscriminately shoot the cork with a staple gun that those flyers are printed with nontoxic inks on recycled paper of course they are nina retorted she seemed to have recovered from her interrogation after gregs murder and to be possessed of a new zeal to defeat the landacquisition plans i winced as they stapled right over my poster for the summer reading program i dont think theres much chance of intraglobal continuing with their plans for mirabeau greg callahan has one silent partner that no one can find yet and shell probably want to pull out we arent taking that chance eula mae smirked if its not intraglobal itll be some other scumsucking outfit of posteighties yuppies looking for one last frontier to ruin nina and i are amassing a goodsized war chest to fight development on the river just how big has this gotten eula mae she is one after all to throw herself entirely into a project lucky shes never developed an interest in quicksand weve raised nearly fiftyfive thousand dollars eula mae said the pride evident in her voice with more pledged on the way were going to hold a big dance over at the veterans hall and weve got people going doortodoor to solicit contributions and and you are about to staple those to the bricks give me that i wrested the staple gun from her overeager hand before she could attach the next notice to a spot beyond the bulletin board well arent you a mite grumpy things tense over at the chateau de yankee amour eula mae asked sweetly grabbing the staple gun back from me everything is fine i replied dont yall have somewhere else to go or someone else to bother i cant believe miss twyla is letting the two of you run this i usually have a saints patience with eula mae but today i felt decidedly heretical miss twyla has her mind on strategic matters cmon nina eula mae said shaking her head sadly at me jordy is just upset hes not going to be able to sell that land of his now of course hes probably getting ready to go back to boston anyway where im sure theyre used to having nasty polluted rivers with that parting shot she left the field an equally haughty nina in tow with the sore sisters dismissed id just finished eating a ham sandwich id fixed in our little back kitchen when gretchen arrived i cant say i wasnt pleased to see gretchen shed gobbled that annoying billy ray bummel like a freetail bat on a skeeter and i had to like her a little for that even if the rest of the time she could be a bitch she paused in front of my desk dressed nicely in a chambray skirt and white dress shirt turquoise and silver dripping from her neck wrists and ears her graying hair had that justdid look jordy how are you fine gretchen and you i wiped away the last of the crumbs on my mouth since i didnt have a napkin i had to use the back of my hand one gretchen eyebrow arched and i tensed myself for criticism as though she could say anything about my bad manners id seen her stinking drunk better than this morning i thought you might like to know that oaf billy ray was just out at our house grilling bob don he is absolutely fixated on that wire that the killer used to strangle poor mr callahan i blinked he cant think bob don had anything to do with this its ridiculous the ridiculous is billy rays specialty gretchen snorted hes totally ignoring that the fence isnt just on our property its on the line with the loudermilks property thats true i nodded but maybe hes already questioned the loudermilks about it i seriously doubt that parker loudermilk says jump and billy ray says how high even though billy ray doesnt work for parker he just cant stifle that suckup reflex of his i thought for a moment why are you telling me this gretchen she was coming to me as an ally but shed certainly never encouraged my relationship with my birth father before i was suspicious it would be just like gretchen to pretend to make pleasant overtures to me then slap me silly when i let my guard down if bob don had told her wed had a hearttoheart out at the cemetery shed be envious as hell gretchen is the kind of lady that if you had a heart transplant shed want one too her lipsticked mouth thinned into a red line thats a mean thing to ask obviously i want you to know that theyre bothering yourbob don she still couldnt say the words your father hadnt been able to since the night shed drunkenly meanly informed me of my parentage she set her blue leather purse on my desk i just thought you might like to know so you can give him a call or maybe you can get billy ray to lay off him thanks gretchen i will call him i glanced around the library on such a fine summer day we were nearly deserted except for permanentfixture old man renfro in the corner reading a collection of wallace stevenss poetry can i ask you a question im just curious why you had lunch with greg callahan the day he died i understand he was supposed to have lunch with the chamber of commerce that day she measured me with a long stare there was something dull still in her eyes even if shed laid off the liquor im not sure after all those years of drinking that a person could just spring back to life i had to admire gretchen though she could take up for herself yes he did mention that he was supposed to have lunch with the chamber of commerce officers but theyd had to cancel i dont know why he ran into me outside the sitaspell and asked me to lunch youd met him before she smiled why yes hed come out to the house to offer bob don money for our riverfront land really bob don said that hed come and seen him at the car dealership he was looking for bob don so he came out to the house first her words spilled out quickly too quickly so i sent him over to the dealership i just wondered its really none of your business though who i have lunch with but he didnt know many folks in town and he ended up murdered im sure the police have already questioned you oh that idiotic friend of yours junebug honestly i do wish that bob don would run for mayor someday so hed fire that incompetent hes not incompetent or is he just an idiot because hes my friend she smiled back on familiar territory with the battle lines drawn between us you as always have a high opinion of how much you bother me you dont bother me little boy little boy was her favorite nonendearment for me and i knew when she used it that i was hitting nerves she fumed on you think im the queen bitch in town anyway no matter what i do i come here to tell you that bob don might need some support and you attack me no i dont think you are the queen bitch gretchen and i didnt attack you i forced myself to take a long breath cant we try and make peace please i know you dont like me being in your and bob dons lives much and im sorry that it upsets you but i am here im here to stay the words came easily far more easily than they ever could talking to one father over another fathers grave if youre so proud of having bob don as your daddy why havent you announced it to all the world her bottom lip curled you sorry hypocrite you accuse me of interfering with your relationship with my husband and then you dont have the nerve to own up to what youre defending you really are just a little fraud she leaned down into my face and i could smell the vaguely unpleasant odor of sweat under powder what did that yankee gal see in you anyhow what does someone who counts in this town like candace tully see in you i know what bob don sees in you gretchen someone to feel sorry for she stiffened and drew back i felt bad for taunting her about her problem but shed hit a raw nerve with me and id lashed back without giving much thought as long as youre casting aspersions why dont you look in your own house for someone to grill her voice had a hollowness to it like her throat had been drained of blood yeah right like id believe anything you say shed rip lorna to shreds if she thought it would hurt me she shrugged makes no never mind to me little boy but you might want to be more careful about who you have taking care of your precious mama what did you say that snooty nurse of yours i saw her talking three days ago with greg callahan in his car i didnt know who he was then of course but i recognized him when met him cause i wondered why clo butterfield was sitting in a car down in the town square with a richlookin white fellow youre making this up her smile was pure enjoyment im afraid not he was probably wantin to know just how poor you are so he could entice you to sell him your land i mean clo butterfield could probably tell him just how much financial strain youre under you got to depend on bob don to pay her measly old salary if clo was talking with greg im sure theres a good reason i couldnt think of one though and why hadnt she mentioned it ask her gretchen suggested unhelpfully but if you fire her dont be expecting bob don to hire you another one youre lucky hes even willing to put up the money for your crazy old mother anyway i stood feeling heat in my hands i think thats enough gretchen maybe you should go gretchen tucked her purse back under her arm im sorry i even tried to talk to you about bob don i can only tell him that i once again made an effort to be friendly to you and you pushed me away she turned on her heel in a way im sure shed mastered from watching soap operas and took her leave whisking arrogantly out of my office i could only imagine what sort of version of this incident bob don would hear gretchen was right on one point though i hadnt publicly owned up to bob don being my dad and he was caught between two people that he cared about who obviously had nothing better to do than snipe at each other i made myself sit down clo with greg what the hell was that about or was it just a lie on gretchens part to rile me up i picked up the phone and dialed bob dons number he answered on the first ring his drawling voice sounding tired bob don hey its jordy hi son how are you im fine listen gretchen was just by and said that billy ray was giving you a hard time about that wire you okay oh im fair to middlin i think hes figgered that i didnt have anything to do with that poor fellers murder once he saw that callahan was going to offer me fifty thousand for that land he realized i would have been a sight happier with callahan alive fifty thousand wow i wondered if my land somewhat smaller in size than bob dons lot would have fetched such a high price gretchen told you they were bothering me that was decent of her to come by and see you his voice held a shred of hope that thered be peace between his wife and son i opened my mouth to tell him how charmed id been by sweet gretchens visit then shut it yes it was thoughtful you are trying arent you jordy to get along with her sure bob don good cause ive been awful worried about her i been wondering if shes been nippin a bit when she gets upset i cleared the stone from my throat you mean drinking yeah i dont have proof but after callahan got killed she seemed a little tight but i couldnt smell it on her breath and i couldnt find a bottle anywhere so i couldnt say anything it mightve been nothing she just mightve been upset its unnervin when someone you just met dies youre right about that i murmured great gretchen might be leaning back toward the bottle and here i was giving her a little shove i hoped i hadnt upset her too much with our bickering the last crisis bob don needed was gretchen tumbling out of sobriety bob don asked about lorna and mama i assured him they were fine he invited me to have lunch with him next week and i accepted well goodbye son i enjoyed our talk this morning you call me if i can help he finally said i will thanks goodbye i hung up he called me son all the time and i called him by his christian name i couldnt call him dad id already had a father id loved and lost i abhorred the prospect of hurting bob don but i couldnt help myself bricks walled in my tongue anytime i thought of referring to him in fatherly terms i went back to my work rolling my eyes at the administrivia involved in grant writing and wondering if robbing banks would be simpler junebug called me later sounding bone weary on the other end of the line teresa examined the house today shes pretty sure that freddy was holding the explosive when it went off it was about a inch pipe bomb and we think it was in a briefcase he paused chet might be able to rebuild but its going to be a long process he might just tear the mirabeau b down and start again i swallowed that house had been a part of growing up for every native of mirabeau and i couldnt imagine some new building in its place i concentrated on what junebug had said about freddy so what the hell does it mean that freddy was next to the bomb i asked hes the mad bomber and he blew himself up i cant see freddy doing anything to hurt realestate prices and terrorism does have that effect on the market unless he wanted to blow up the mirabeau b to build a fastfood restaurant junebug didnt laugh at my tasteless humor i dont know i also am trying to track down that doreen miller lorna told you about havent found her yet i got the boston police going through intraglobals offices but they havent found anything doesnt seem like mr callahan kept too many records odder and odder well what about gregs lawyer that martin noone fellow or this gary zadich that greg was going to sell the land to i talked to zadich today he says he never even heard of greg callahan or intraglobal but im not sure i believe him he sounds like a houston wharf rat to me i got the chief over in bavary talking to mr noone but he says he only met once with callahan to discuss being the attorney of record on the deal he doesnt know anything about callahan or intraglobal junebug paused i did learn a singularly interestin fact though did you know tiny parmalee worked with explosives when he was in the army now i know the department of defense needs more careful monitoring i muttered are you serious yep i think sergeant garza and i may have to have a few talks with ol tiny tiny parmalee as the bomber itd never occurred to me frankly i didnt think he would know lickety about pipe bombs or blasting caps apparently i was wrong i suddenly remembered his gibe at me at the library about nearly getting blown up my mouth felt dry and i switched topics im wondering something junebug if you can tell me there was that phone number written on the pad in gregs room did you find out who that belonged to there was silence on the other end yeah but i think i better keep that close to my vest oh come on i helped you with that computer stuff im just curious as to who greg was calling if hed been having little teteatetes with clo god only knew who else in town hed been visiting perhaps he and sister had gone canoeing on the river or hed taken mama to the movies in bavary im counting on your discretion jordy junebug warned you got it i practically leaned into the phone which is why i know you wont ask me again goodbye the phone clicked in my ear which was good i didnt want junebug to hear what i called him i finished my days work on writing the grant request and left the library in the hands of florence pettus on an incredible summer day like today it was as empty as last years bird nest then i headed toward freddy jacksills office hed ended up dead as well and i wondered if i could piece any of this jigsaw together if i started in his corner rivertown real estate stood in a corner spot in mirabeaus downtown block right off mayne street it occupied the bottom two floors in a faded redbrick building like several of the other buildings in downtown mirabeau it had carved into its stone signifying the year the town began its one and only major growth spurt being a saturday there wasnt much activity going on in the business district except for a few old men sipping cold dr peppers in the shade of the hardware store a closed sign hung lopsided on the door but i could see freddys partner linda hillard on the phone at the front desk i tapped and she waved at me still speaking into the phone trying the doorknob i found it unlocked and stepped into the welcoming coolness of airconditioning linda was practically barking into the phone in her raspy smokers voice yes miz tyree i understand that you were supposed to close on your house this monday but freddys dead maam and we may just have to push it back i havent been able to find your file a moments silence yes miz tyree i know that life goes on linda made an obscene gesture toward the receiver while still keeping her saleswomans smile firmly in place yes ill call the title company and see if we can proceed on schedule yes miz tyree ill call you back later goodbye now linda slammed the phone down and muttered mean old bitch she didnt seem to notice that id come in for a moment as she ran her hand through her short red hair and adjusted her tortoiserim eyeglasses then she glanced up at me and managed a smile linda keeps our romance section at the library circulating pretty well my favorite librarian how are you fine thanks i wanted to stop by and say how sorry i was about freddy oh thanks jordy i shouldnt even be here but freddy had so much business going on all over the county that ive been on the phone all day calling his accounts i just cant leave em dangling my competitors over in bavary might pick them up and i cant afford that dont i sound awful she blinked back tears behind her thick glasses freddys dead and im worrying about stupid old land i have just become every negative realestate stereotype i sat down next to her no you havent all you can do right now is cope and do your best she gestured to the back of the office i got some coffee brewing and my mama brought me a fresh peach pie this morning want a piece i nodded and followed linda back to the small kitchen area of the office i suppose youre here for the same reasons that miss twyla and the loudermilks have been bugging me all morning not to mention that crazy tree hugger from austin uh i dont know i did want to talk to you about greg callahan linda made a face as she cut two goodsized wedges from the pie the crust looked that perfect brown you only get with homebaked pies and my mouth began to water im tired of hearing about him im starting to think he was nothing but a crook why do you say that linda i asked carefully obviously junebug hadnt yet spilled gregs land scam she placed a plate of pie a dessert fork and a linen napkin in front of me linda is a details person then turned back to the coffee machine decaf okay with you im too hyper to drink octane fine i said i think greg might have been a crook too he tried to buy your land right well his colleague lorna wiercinski made a pitch to me about it i knew her in boston no need to tell linda more she was a gossip thats why i was talking to her oh that tall girl shes a looker i thought callahan might be chasing after her but i didnt know lord knows freddy wouldve liked to get to know her better lindas hazel eyes misted poor freddy i guess he wont get to annoy any more women old sweet thing never did get flirting down right and poor sugar thought this intraglobal deal was his lucky ticket he kept hinting about how much money hed make even after poor mr callahan got killed i sipped at my coffee it tasted slightly smoky and stale i tasted the peach pieperfection sweet and sticky and crisp did you spend much time around callahan it was a simple question but it seemed to require ample consideration from linda and several chomps of pie i didnt see too much of himhe was freddys pet project freddy had this image of getting some huge commission off the land sales and didnt want me horning in she coughed as though attempting to dislodge further information from her throat i pulled i thought there was something shady about him too linda it didnt require much of a yank to get her talking again she leaned forward as though the remains of the peach pie might have ears not as much shady as lecherous i think he was stirring up a mess at the loudermilk place i bit my bottom lip it had been obvious during the fire that jenny and dee loudermilk were both unusually distraught and parker had seemed angry with dee telling her to keep her mouth shut i thought something was going on between all of them when the mirabeau b was burning down i confided parker seemed awful mad at dee but i didnt know why my tidbit sparked lindas interest she toyed with a slice of peach on her plate well he ought to be mad at that daughter of his too shes nothing but a conniving little slut what you mean greg was chasing after jenny and dee i forgot to lower my voice and although the office was empty linda shushed me chased and caught i do believe but im not certain wait a second linda he wasnt even here that long and he wasnt even that goodlooking i was still irked that lorna had taken greg for a lover so my memories of him were not kind ones how on earth did he seduce a mother and a daughter in that short time linda shrugged well organized or well something i dont know i just know that i caught freddy admonishing him to stay away from dee and jenny if he didnt want to sour the land deal i slumped well thats hardly evidence of an affair linda give me more credit than that jordy callahan was using the phone plenty to sweettalk jenny loudermilk i well accidentallythe word was ever so slightly emphasizedpicked up line four when i was trying to hit line three last monday morning and heard greg asking jenny to meet him how do you know it was jenny he kept calling her jen babe as soon as i heard that petulantly whiny voice i knew it was her and what were they meeting for to talk linda made it sound like it was illegal and they had to be careful so they didnt get caught he said that in particular i mulled this over linda took my silence as judgment look i dont usually eavesdrop i was just protecting this agency i didnt like freddy being so involved with greg anyhowwe hardly knew anything about him he seemed too polished too perfect in how he presented himself not a wart on the man she sniffed i mean you could ask jenny or dee they might know if he had any warts have you told all this to junebug i asked linda glanced down at the remnants of her peach pie yeah but he didnt seem too interested in it i leaned back in my chair assume i told myself for one moment that what linda says is true greg sleeps with jenny greg sleeps with dee does either woman know about the others involvement and what about parker what would he do if he thought either his wife or daughter had been seduced by this yankee interloper and if freddy found out about gregs alleged misconduct with the ladies loudermilk could that give parker a motive to silence both men freddy had said hed make money even after greg was dead i remembered parker loudermilks dark eyes the consuming blaze dancing in the black ballroom of his irises his comment on the fires momentarily satisfying beauty and i felt a chill in my heart chapter eleven jenny loudermilk answered the front door and no one could lean more provocatively into a doorway than she did she seemed determined to live up to lindas image of her she was real pretty like her mother except darker like her dad a lock of luxuriant brown hair hung down over one eye she was wearing a tshirt one size too small and beneath the fabric the swell of breasts looked perfect snug jeans finished her wardrobe her feet were bare and her toenails were immaculately painted a shade of dark scarlet the whole stance had the air of notsosubtle calculation hello miss loudermilk are your folks at home she regarded me with a bored eye moms out back throwing a pot daddys not here though youre the library fellow right yes thats right jordan poteet i offered her my hand she took it limply gave it a shake and then trailed her fingertips along my fingers when she let my hand go my fingers felt itchy but i kept them still i was just having a drink you want one i thought she meant drink of water but i realized with a jolt that she meant alcohol the glassiness of her eyes looked like it had been poured from a bottle of wine i dont think that i should drink with you i doubt your parents would approve im sure i sounded like a total prude but what else was i supposed to say call me oldfashioned but i dont hold with teenagers getting drunk in the middle of the day and i would hazard a guess that drinking with my bosss daughter is not de rigueur in mirabeau government yes im a hypocrite i drank beer as a teenager but i only did it while sitting in the back of a pickup truck i certainly didnt invite folks in for cocktails she opened the door wider what would you know about what they approve of believe me theres not much she turned and walked away her gait slightly unsteady i stepped inside the foyer and shut the door behind me my first sensation was of antiseptic even the air smelled as if itd been scrubbed the loudermilk place was big parkers construction company was one of the most successful in the tricounty area and loudermilk money was old money the foyer i stood in had a fancy swirled marble floor in gray and white and the wallpaper of gray black and silver stripes looked expensive one entryway opened into a living room that hadnt seen much living it was decorated with glazed pots of all shapes and sizes no doubt the product of dees hands and wheel shed painted them with all sorts of figuresstylized antelopes in graceful leaps egyptian letters i recognized the ankh the symbol of life and native american totems lifted from other cultures i thought without a single symbol from her own heritage maybe our culture was just uninteresting to dee i reflected not even a pot with the fighting bees of mirabeau high on it id stepped away when i noticed the shards in the corner one of the pots had fallen smashing into bits on the hardwood floor it was a shame it looked like it was a real pretty one with geometric shapes in red and green painted on it i wondered why no one had cleaned it up in this immaculate house jenny saw my eyes staying near the shattered pot what can i say she shrugged im a klutz i glanced elsewhere the other entryway opened into a formal dining room with an impeccably tasteful cherry dining table and a huge china and silver cabinet you coming or you just gawking jenny loudermilk bleated back at me i cut through the dining room and found her in a spacious kitchen it gleamed whitethe appliances the floor the lights jenny perched on a bar stool elbows leaning on the spotless formica kitchen counter a fashion magazine open in front of her a tall clear drink with ice and a fat wedge of lime sat in front of her sitting in its own puddle of condensation i picked up the glass and sniffed it gin and tonic and good gin from the smell arent you a little young for tanqueray i asked trying to sound jovial but undoubtedly sounding like a stern nerd she shrugged im a little young for a lot of things but that never stopped me she took the glass back from my hand and sipped pretending not to watch me over the rim im very impressed with how adult you are i said she ignored the sarcasm or maybe she just didnt give a shit what i thought that seemed a distinct possibility for this little poseur she sucked on a piece of ice then dropped it back into her glass so why do you want to see my mom she overdue with those dr seuss books she borrowed for me actually i was curious as to how you were doing you seemed awful upset at the fire last night i pulled up a stool and sat down she examined the freefloating morsels of lime pulp in her drink it was upsetting seeing that beautiful old house burn down i didnt think you were the type to care much about antebellum architecture it was the wrong thing to say what the hell do you know about me anyhow mr poteet where do you get off coming in and telling me what i care about jesus i get enough from the king and queen her dark eyes flared in outrage flinting like struck stones i raised a hand in pretend surrender hey look im sorry i didnt mean anything jenny snorted and sipped at her drink again i thought maybe you were still upset about greg callahan i ventured or your mother and greg callahan i added silently her fingers had been sliding up and down the cool wet length of the cocktail glass and they braked she stared at her hand and did not look at me what is any of this to you i dont want my friend lorna getting hurt whoever killed greg and freddy might come after her next youd gotten to know greg callahan right someone here killed him and we have to find out who she was quiet again as silent as a statue look mr poteet just leave it alone okay im not going to weep anymore for him i weep for him what was he to you the words tasted terrible in my mouth but i had to know he was just a friend a business associate of moms he wanted to buy moms land and you got all worked up over a man you hardly knew ii cried because im just not used to death okay it shocks me older people get jaded about it but us kids were different it nearly rang true i remembered my first funeral my grandmother schneiders when i was twelve and fighting back unexpectedly hot tears simply at the sight of her closed coffin but a tone in jennys voice was too calculated she would not have made for a good actress despite her poses your father didnt seem too upset i remembered the excited glow in parkers eyes as he watched the fire he likes burning jenny shrugged he gets a boner lighting a fire in winter if it was intended to shock it did i didnt go around talking about my folks sexual responses much when i was a teenager i was too interested in my own i suddenly didnt want to be around jenny loudermilk anymore she looked unutterably sad to me sitting alone in this huge cold house a little girl drinking hard liquor to show how mature she was trying to engage in witty repartee that she was sadly illtrained for if youll excuse me ill go have a word with your mother i stood and pushed the stool underneath the counter she wont like being interrupted when shes throwing pots jenny warned me coming a little unsteadily off her stool you better not i think i better and i think you better go sleep off this little afternoon drunk youve enjoyed i went out the back door toward a small potting shed decorated on the side with fanciful paintings of children gathering mushrooms bright beds of wildflowers surrounded the shed bestowing a rustic charm they usually only talk about in magazines as i knocked on the door i could see jenny loudermilk watching me from the curtained breakfast nook i rapped again on the door i could hear a gentle humming noise from within and then dee loudermilks hardedged drawl come in i entered the dark pottery studio dee loudermilk sat hunched over a whirling wheel shaping a mound of clay into something that looked like a cross between a vase and a lozenge her hands moved with infinite patience up and down the spinning clay and i saw they were very like her daughters hands moving up and down on the glass of cold gin i stared spellbound and dee one lock of light hair hanging in her face glanced past her errant strand at me shut the door please and push the hair out of my face if you dont mind she said and i obeyed it was an oddly intimate moment as i gently moved her hair back behind the delicate shape of her ear i stepped back uncomfortable with the sudden closeness between us she wasnt bothered thanks jordy she said with a workmans bluntness i usually wear a kerchief but i couldnt find mine today the humming id heard was the whirr of her potters wheel powered by electricity rather than her sandaled feet i watched in respectful silence as she finished molding the small pot its gentle curves taking shape under her claysmeared fingers finally when it had spun long enough she slowed the wheel to a stop then pried the new vase free with a flatedged knife she stood and began to wash her hands at a soapstone sink that sat in a corner how is ms wiercinski holding up i heard she was staying at your place she kept her back to me and i could appreciate again what a fine figure of a woman she was attractive in her dirty chambray shirt and argilsmeared black jeans with the smell of wet clay and light sweat about her it wasnt hard to see why greg mightve liked her yes shes there shes holding up well i hope shes more likable than callahan dee said still soaping her hands clean didnt you like greg one bubbled hand found the faucet and turned the water on higher she didnt look up at me i didnt know him very well he tried to get me to sell him land but i wasnt interested how often did he meet with you about your land i asked sitting on an empty stool now why would that be any of your business dee asked reaching for a clean towel her hands free of dirt and soap looked as though they had been freshly sculpted from some rare pink stone i didnt feel like pushing dee loudermilk shed tell me in no short order to get the hell out if i stepped over the line i tried not to fidget on the stool stared into her dark blue eyes and decided on the direct approach gossip around town suggests that greg callahan was chasing after you did you know that i decided to leave jennys name out of it for the moment funny i used to enjoy gossip i dont find it nearly as interesting these days dee leaned against the gray soapstone sink surveying me with eyes that betrayed nothing i dont usually listen to rumor either but someone has killed two people here dee and they were both on one side of the riverfront development deal my friend lorna might be the next target if you know anything about greg callahan or anyone who might have wanted him dead and youre not telling ill have junebug over here so quick your headll spin faster than your potters wheel she surprised me by laughing my goodness threatening the bosss wife youve got more guts than i gave you credit for im not trying to be impertinent dee i figured youd appreciate me not beating around the bush she smiled does candace know you feel so strongly about protecting lorna wiercinski she might keep a closer eye on you if she did look i barely knew callahan hed already offered you money for your land right in the area of fifty thousand i guessed that her land close in size to bob dons lot would fetch the same price yes thats right it wasnt going to be enough to make me sell and how did mr callahan take that i didnt tell him my decision he was dead before i got a chance to dee stared away from me at the smears of white clay on her workbench she moved away from the sink and got out some liquids and brushes pulling a stool over to the workbench she began to apply a glaze to a bowl she glanced back up at me i dont know why youre wasting time here none of us had a reason to kill greg callahan you should be off talking to that nutty miss twyla or that oaf tiny parmalee theyre the ones who were against him you dont know anything about freddys death either no i do not dee answered in a measured nearly soft tone i had to strain to hear the sweep of her brush made a delicate mark on the bowls surface like an angels fingerprint you seemed terribly upset at the fire thats a stupid comment jordy we all were upset at another bombing taking place she glanced at my arm in its sling i mean when we think we nearly lost you to that lunatic her tone didnt sound like my loss would be a grief for her parker seemed to enjoy watching chets house burn her brush hesitated over a dark crescent of watery glaze shed just applied to the pot parker has a strange sense of humor you really shouldnt pay him mind she completed her glazing and went over to another workbench with a cabinet next to it jenny seemed terribly upset as well shes a teenager dee answered pulling on a heavy pair of rugged work gloves and she gets upset easily hexing her fingers inside the gloves she opened the cabinet and rummaged inside i was about to tell her how upsetand drunkher daughter was when dee turned back to me her hands spread apart like she was measuring a caught fish and metal sparkled like stars between her palms the length of silvery barbed wire glinting in the bright sunlight from the studios window isnt it lovely jordy she asked a half smile on her face i stood quickly nearly falling over and toppling the stool staring at the strand of death in her hands it was just like the wire in gregs throat dont be afraid silly god but youre jumpy just like parker she moved over to the pot shed thrown sitting down again i stayed on my feet where did you get that i managed to ask at the store just like everyone else dee answered she began to wrap the wire around the pot itself pressing the barbs into the material so the wire held thatsthats an odd decoration for a pot i croaked and not in very good taste right now dee itll be lovely when its done you have a lot of that wire on hand i cleared my throat knowing that it wasnt about to be ripped at least for the moment and righted the chair id knocked over sure i do lots of southwesternstyle pots for that crafts store over in bavary barbed wires a big decorating item there you can get pottery sculptures all sorts of stuff like that so the killer wouldnt necessarily have had to cut the wire from the fence that bisected dee and bob dons land he or she could have filched a length from dees studio dee knew it was here and presumably so could parker and jennyor anyone who bought dees ceramics of course it wouldnt be filching if dee herself took it to wrap into gregs neck like soft clay im sure you mentioned to junebug that you had that kind of wire on hand didnt you she shrugged he didnt ask i didnt volunteer i shook my head are you just trying to make yourself look bad is this some game to you she finished setting the sharp wire into the pot and stepped back to admire her handiwork of course its not a game jordy a mans dead isnt he two men dont forget freddy poor freddy he was really an oaf wasnt he youre ice do you know that i suddenly wanted to be away from dee loudermilk you make that pot right after a man is strangled with wire i think thats sick arent you the sensitive boy then leave jordy no one asked you here anyway why dont you run back to your little friend junebug moncrief and tell him what ive been up to she smiled hollowly at me im a loudermilk see if hell do anything about mean ol me i opened my mouth then closed it not cooperating with junebug in his investigation isnt going to help your husband she laughed im not a good political wife and parker knows that i could frankly not give a rats ass about him being mayor if i did id have him fire your ass in a minute youre not exactly behaving like a loyal employee but maybe its good for old parker to have a thorn in his side do you give a rats ass about your daughter shes in there i didnt get a chance to finish my sentence as parker loudermilk barreled into his wifes studio looking for all this world like his senses had fled him he stared hard at me venom contorting his face jordy what are you doing here the breath that powered his voice was ragged with fury his eyes slid to dee who stood calmly by her wheel arms crossed over her breasts just talking with dee about all the goingson in town i offered it sounded idiotic but i frankly didnt have a witty excuse available would you mind leaving he asked the politician in him kicking in belatedly i mean i need to talk with dee privately and im sure you must have work at the library to do his dark eyes darted to her and lingered i saw the folds of flesh in the corner of his eyes crinkle in annoyance when he saw her standing disinterestedly watching us he might be the mayor but id had enough yes i think i will leave yall are just too strange today for me first dee makes a big production of letting me know that shes got a bunch of the same kind of wire that killed greghe swallowed hard at that little announcementand your daughters got a solid drunk on in the house ive had my fill of loudermilks today thank you kindly i turned to go goddamn you parker roared and i whirled back thinking he was coming after me but he wasnt he was after dee seizing one of her arms and shaking her hard her eyes were frozen on him unblinking like marbles left in sand i had no wish to get involved in their domestic squabble but i couldnt very well walk out when it looked like he might hit her i grabbed his shoulder said hey parker calm down thats when he spun around and belted me hard i landed on the floor you dont know how much getting hit in the face hurts its a lot trust me parker dee shoved past him to kneel by me i was busy working my jaw it seemed okay my eye though sure was sore oh arent you tough dee spat at her husband who stood staring down at me with a look of utter blankness hitting a man whos got his arm in a sling and hes a librarian too i decided to ignore that implicit slur against my profession and my manhood as i got to my feet my left eye tingled as though announcing that its skin would soon darken like an overripe plum i was still so surprised that i hadnt even gotten ticked at parker i just thought the mayor hit me dee steadied me what the hell is wrong with you parker she snapped have you just totally lost your mind parker loudermilk continued to glare at me but his fingers unfolded out of fists finally his wellworn mask of local government slipped back into place he smiled nearly beatifically at me then walked out of the studio tell me hes not going to get his gun i said to dee holding my good hand up to my eye this investigating crap could get you damaged if not outright dead no hes not going to get a gun she answered but i saw her delicate teeth biting the top of her lower lip she looked worried which did nothing to reassure me lets get a cold compress on your eye dee helped me into the kitchen we heard the squeal of tires in the driveway parker leaving i guessed jenny wasnt in the kitchen i sat on a stool while dee wrapped a baggie of ice in a dish towel and pressed it against my eye i was feeling betterso well in fact that i wanted to kick parker loudermilks ass for him dee pressed the coldness to my face another lock of her blonde hair dangled before her face and i wanted to push it back behind her ear the way i did back in her pottery shed i didnt im sorry jordy but maybe you shouldnt go around asking so many questions i saw her eyes dart around the kitchen again as if looking for something she might be passed out but i dont think shed drunk that much i answered guessing that she was looking for her daughter jennys much like her dad prone to stupid decisions but i really dont want to talk about my daughter with you she pushed down hard on the ice over my bruised eye does that feel better not when youre trying to drive it through my skull like that i answered i pulled on her hand to ease the pressure and she let go of the compress entirely i took hold of it and watched her walk to the sink you know its not like i barreled in here guns blazing and accusations flying i said well maybe i did but that was beside the point your daughters drinking heavily and your husbanda public figureis belting city employees what are yall trying for a guest spot on oprah im sorry that parker hit you he doesnt deal well with anger her back was to me and i saw her chambray shirt wrinkle and smooth as her back tensed no i guess not but never mind his behavior to methat i can figure out whys he so mad at you hes not mad at me hes mad at the world she ran water in the sink and rinsed her face no hes mad at us jennys voice came from behind me she walked slowly and steadily around me pulling the ice down from my face thatll turn cool colors itll go with everything her words didnt slur but i could see the effort in her face to enunciate thats a real comfort i answered jenny watched her mother who had turned to face us is this how the end starts mom id like to know so i can get my frontrow seat jennifer louise go upstairs youre drunk you and i will talk later dees voice was as hard as fired clay no jenny said not even looking at her mother but staring at me gregs friend shes your exgirlfriend right i nodded jenny i said go upstairs dee yelled thats where i hide the liquor now mom she retorted are you sure thats where you want me to be i stood up keeping the ice pressed to my swelling face this has all been charming ladies but im frankly tired of this bullshit ive already gotten my eye punched so i might as well go for broke rumor has it that you were both sleeping with greg callahan i turned to dee now hes dead and your family is falling apart your daughters drinking and your husbands pissing mad and beating up innocent librarians what am i supposed to think dee maybe that hunk of wire in gregs neck did come from your studio i sounded cruel but this dancing around the sour core of what might have happened with them had grown tiresome i held my breath waiting for her reaction dees mouth pale and unlipsticked worked as though trying to form words a vague smile haunted her face jenny didnt wait for her mother leave her alone she didnt kill greg jennifer louise hush right now dee came forward in a burst of motion like a runner exploding from the block she seized her daughters arm i told you to go upstairs how long are we going to protect him mom jenny screamed i cant do this anymore i cant the slap against jennys face reverberated in the tiled kitchen she stared at the hardwood floor and a thin dribble of blood formed on her lip she shuddered mommy dee whirled on me you out now i lowered the ice from my face yall are without a doubt the most screwedup family ive ever seen i glanced over at the stunned teenager jenny you okay she didnt answer if you dont leave im calling the cops dee said taking a step toward me good idea lets have them all over i shook my head at her jennys words ringing in my ears how long are we going to protect him mom whatever the hell mess yall have gotten yourselves into dee get out of it now let me help you i dont need help i need for you to go goodbye jordy she put her crying daughter under her arm like a bird protecting a wobbly nestling and escorted jenny out of the kitchen i left keeping the bag of ice and the dish towel it was wrapped in they owed me that much surely and i drove to the police station just as fast as i could chapter twelve just what the hell did you think you were doing jordy junebug barked shaking his head at my black eye never mind me i said wincing as dr meyers probed at the bruise why dont you go talk to our fruitheaded first family i swear those loudermilks redefine dysfunctional youll have a nice shiner for a few days jordy but theres no permanent damage dr meyers shook his gray head at me honestly arent you too old for this my behavior is beside the point i stressed keeping my voice polite its our mayor whos the threat to society dr meyers smiled hed been mirabeaus favorite doctor for nearly thirty years you look more like youve been threatened by society what with your arm and your eye youre gonna be the poster boy for people who stick their noses into police business junebug snapped hold still while i get my camera doc see if you can knock out a couple of his teeth for completeness all right are you going to do anything about what i told you about the loudermilks junebug sat down across from me depends you want to press charges against parker jesus this is going to be a mess the mayor smacking around his staff hes probably going to lose the next election over this you sound heartbroken as to pressing charges im not sure right now id just like to give him a shiner and call us even i dont think thatd solve anything junebug coughed not to mention that a boxing match between the mayor and the chief librarian could lower civic morale i ignored his feeble attempt at comedy look he went after dee he went after me hes beyond his boiling point and we need to know why maybe he and dee are having problems junebug stood to look out the window and maybe that problem was greg i said have you found out where any of them were the night of the murder dee says they were all at home well id ask miss jenny again if i were you she made some remark about protecting him and i think theyre covering for parker my guess is that jenny thinks her father was involved with gregs death and shes incapable of keeping up the charade dee i dont get if shes covering for parker whyd she show me that wire junebug kept staring out the window maybe shes tired of covering for himbut she wants us to figure it out so she doesnt have to tell on him he looked back at the window i stood what is it junebug youve given me a lot to think about jordy now you go on home let me know if you want to file assault charges against parker go home listen i think that he turned to me like a father admonishing a wayward lad go home jordy or go to the library someplace thats safe i think youve gotten into enough trouble for the day i tried the library first because on the way home id remembered a resource i should have remembered before when i was begging junebug to tell me whose phone number was scribbled down in gregs room the library was still open and florence pettus yawned at the counter looking surprised to see me and my shiner jordy what happened to im fine i lied hurrying toward the reference stacks i walked into a door i found the book i was looking for next to a collection of mirabeau phone books that went back to the first telephone in the town i pulled down the reverse phone book and found the slip of paper in my wallet where id scribbled down the number from gregs notepad if you havent seen a reverse phone book theyre great fun they list phone numbers according to the number not by the person you can look up any phone number and find out who it belongs to i felt like an idiot for not remembering sooner that we had this reference book in the library but what with all the emotional confusion going on between lorna and me and the subsequent bombing itd slipped my mind i found it edward and kathy johnson over on heydl street i didnt know them i went back up to the front counter and checked our rolodex of librarycard holders no edward johnson but there were two kathy johnsons that had cards and one had the heydl street address i quickly flipped through the rest of the johnsons and found two other cardholders at that address brice johnson age seventeen and becca johnson age sixteen i sat back who were the johnsons and why on earth did greg have their phone number i was reaching for the phone to call home when i saw nina hernandez come in she eyed me warily and walked over to the counter i take it you and eula mae have covered every square inch of town with yalls flyers i asked hello jordy you look a bit worse for wear she studied me i do hope tiny didnt do that to you hardly nina but i suppose its not an unlikely guess hes already threatened me once about you she shook her head tinys sweet just overprotective and im afraid hes a bit smitten with me very it makes one wonder what lengths tiny would go to to win your affection she frowned sorry tiny hes a doer not a thinker did you know he nearly strangled me once in a rage when we were children she gestured at my slinged arm and my black eye you seem to be very beloved in this town maybe if you kept your nose out of peoples business you wouldnt need higher healthinsurance premiums she had a wicked grin im not the one who came from out of town to stir up trouble nina you are im not jousting with you jordy i didnt come to stir up trouble i came to stop it but you werent counting on tiny hes not stable nina you should know that before you get involved with him i nearly blurted out that junebug suspected tiny of being mirabeaus munitions marauder but i bit my lip instead she sniffed disdainfully her motto of loving all of earths creatures apparently didnt extend to tiny parmalee im not involved with him but i cant help what he feels or thinks about me ive made it clear to tiny that ill be leaving mirabeau soon and im not interested in a relationship with him i almost felt sorry for tiny notice the almost so what can i help you with miss twylas not feeling well and she asked me to return these books for her i glanced at the stackolder phyllis whitneys with the latest potboiler thrown in for a modern touch and a stephen hawking to appeal to her scientific side she didnt want them to be overdue miss twyla is very civically minded is she okay shes fine and hopefully she can worry about overdue books more than the river being plundered now that callahan is dead i leaned back in my chair you must have hated him extraordinarily i mean to have fought him more than once i didnt care about him one way or the other i just wanted to stop intraglobal i remembered the rather surprising news of lornas that intraglobal was a threeperson shop do you know who doreen miller is her lips thinned no i dont well she was gregs silent partner in intraglobal you know that intraglobal wasnt a big company right small companies can do a lot of damage to our ecosystems jordy its a lack of responsibility not a lack of money that plunders our environment i just wondered if you knew who she was or where she might be found last i heard they were having trouble tracking down this woman to tell her about greg and id forgotten to ask junebug if hed made any progress on that front id call when i got home sorry i cant be of help the only person connected with intraglobal i ever dealt with was callahan until he hired wiercinski she crossed her arms and looked down on me with her wirerim glasses speaking of her is she planning on staying and developing the land in that same grossly irresponsible way that greg suggested junebug had asked me not to say anything about gregs fraud to buy the land and then resell it to the chemical waste company i didnt want to tell nina anyway she would have just crowed over her moral superiority in opposing greg no nina i said my voice sounding tired lorna wont be trying to develop the land im sure the whole deals off really i wouldnt be so sure wiercinski strikes me as the type of woman who wont quit easily nina was right enough there i forced myself to shake my head at her i dont think lorna will have any interest in land development in mirabeau pardon me if iand the others like miss twyla who are concerned about thisdont exactly relax our vigil weve raised a substantial sum to stop them in no short order thanks to miss twyla and eula mae even if wiercinski leaves town well be ready for any other unscrupulous developers that try and ruin the river whatever nina but the deals dead as dead as greg as dead as poor freddy ill tell miss twyla you asked about her good night jordy dont get hurt anymore her beaded necklace jangled as she left i watched her leave the faint smell of her citrusy perfume lingering on the air i thought that seeing my bruised eye would elicit shock from lorna what i wasnt expecting was the absence of a cop car in front of our house and then seeing lorna and candace sitting in my living room in front of a laptop computer that appeared to be hooked up to my phone in some crazy way and lorna crying while candace handed her tissues and patted her shouldera bit reluctantly i thought after exchanging a what the hell happened to your eye and why the hell are you carrying on so i sat down with a dr pepper and heard what theyd been up to i feel like an utter fool lorna wailed blowing her nose loudly and liquidly into a tissue candace gave her another reassuring pat but frowned at me i know candace has a big sweet heart but she looked right then like shed rather be swallowing glass than comforting my exgirlfriend why not to ask would have been anticlimactic youre right greg mustve been a huge fraud lorna gestured at the laptop candace was kind enough to bring over this computer from the mirabeau historical society its got a modem so i tried to dial into intraglobals files in the boston office from here i wanted to go through all gregs homeoffice files and see what i could find outsee if maybe there was something thatd point us to doreen miller or to how he was planning on unloading the land he was going to buy here but nothing im locked out of everything files that used to be there are gone and files i used to be able to get into are locked when was this done i asked who knows she sat back from the computer a disgusted look on her face greg mustve done it after he and i came down hereor maybe doreen did it after greg got killed and she heard about it from the boston cops she mustve wanted to be sure we couldnt find out about the land fraud she mustve not known about the files on gregs laptop down here i dont even know if the boston police have found doreen lorna i said if they had i didnt know if theyd examined gregs computer filesbut surely they would have gone through his office if doreen miller was a partner in the fraud she could have destroyed the files to cover gregs tracks i bit my lip could someone have done this from gregs laptop was it hooked up with a modem i asked i became aware that candace was staring at me a pensive look on her face i suppose lorna said slowly his did have a modem i didnt have a laptop down here but his machines at the police station and how would anyone here know the passwords she shot the finger at the machine this is so frustrating would you mind telling me where your guard is i asked i thought someone was going to be here to relieve franklin candace cleared her throat lorna stopped frowning for a moment and looked at my knees standing next to her at the table i decided i didnt need a guard not with you here so i sent him on his way youre not mad are you lorna honey what you need is some nice relaxing chamomile tea jordy dont yall have some in the kitchen i know your mama likes a cup now and then uh yeah i think so good well make lorna some tea come help me find it candace seized my wrist in a death grip and pulled me along into the kitchen i glanced back at lorna she was staring intently at the uncooperative screen i pulled free from candace after shed dragged me into the kitchen she rattled the teapot under the faucet turning the water on full blast she jerked her head toward the living room and whispered she did it excuse me i wondered why we were whispering she did it candace repeated she destroyed those files pardon me what the hell are you talking about i saw her do it candace hissed i saw her select a bunch of files and delete them i was getting us cokes from the kitchen while she was trying to get into that boston computer and when i came back there was this box on the screen that said delete selected files and she pressed ok i saw it all over her shoulder and she nearly jumped out of her chair when i came up behind her it was only after that that she started whining about all these files being missing candace are you sure yes goddamn it im sure she switched off the faucet and banged open a cabinet still speaking in a soft but smoldering tone i have been around a computer before jordy she destroyed those files are you still going to stand by her side now and defend her to the death i cant believe this believe it jordy and now shes gotten rid of her guard you think maybe thats so she can skedaddle out of here when she wants to or maybe she just wants to shame you into protecting her precious self candace went back to the kitchen door and stuck her head into the living room now all smiles you want some cookies with that tea hon too bad candace had to go lorna said munching on a peanutbutter cookie her head leaning back on the couch yeah it is i stared out at the earlyevening haze of heat crickets and katydids raised their voices in the backyard singing their midsummer oratorio celebrating their brief lives i tried to turn back to lorna but i was having trouble facing her candace had left shortly after serving lorna her tea id walked her out to the car still stunned by candaces accusation she wasnt very happy with me for not throwing her testimony in lornas face and seeing what stuck to those gray eyes and high cheekbones why dont you confront her i had demanded im not the one protecting her candace had snapped back god what does she have to do commit a crime in your presence she is trouble jordy and i am sick and tired of you taking up for her i only loaned her the computer to help her since you believe in her so much and what does she do possibly commit another crime with it i only get played for a fool once by lorna jordy you ought to adopt that motto for yourself this is awfully circumstantial candace please i think lorna could climb up on the water tower with a rifle blow away half the town and youd still cling to her innocence she got into her mercedes slamming the door you come see me when youve decided what to do im washing my hands of this whole affair jordy and that had been the end of the conversation id skulked back to the house feeling the slow throb of a headache in my temples assume candace was right why had lorna destroyed those files to get rid of information what kind that she was in on gregs fraud that shed been in touch with the chemical waste company in houston thatd planned to turn mirabeau into another love canal shed stoutly proclaimed her ignorance of gregs duplicity but maybe those files had been humming in computer memory in faraway boston and shed had no way of getting to them until shed talked candace into getting hold of a laptop with a modem and of course suspecting lorna of being a liar now meant i might have to suspect her of worse of far far worse i forced myself to turn back to her she was licking the crumbs from one of sisters homemade peanutbutter cookies from her fingers she caught my eye and smiled feeling better i heard my voice ask sure am i think your sisters cookies have medicinal value lets put one on your eye and see if the discoloration goes away i nearly laughed it was the old lorna the lorna i could laugh with and tell my secrets to and trust surely candace was mistaken i knew candace wouldnt have fabricated the story about the files she was not a liar right now i didnt know if i could say the same for lorna why dont you sit down jordan youre going to pace a hole in that carpet sorry its been an eventful day im restless well i think i should call junebug and let him know about those files and see if he tracked down doreen miller she lurched off the sofa and headed for the phone i sat down on the warm couch cushion shed vacated my arm hurt and so did my eye and most of all i felt mad at my own inaction i wanted to talk to sister but she was working the night shift at the truck stop again covering for a friend who was taking care of a sick kid mark was upstairs watching tv with mama i was basically stuck here alone with lorna until the doorbell rang followed by the gentle twisting of a key in the lock yall home clos voice carried into the living room great now i had two visitors in the house that i had a ton of questions for and no easy way to ask them hi clo i called feebly waving a hand from the couch what are you doing here she hovered above me peering down at my face she wasnt in her nursing whites good lord what happened to your eye the mayor slugged me this announcement would have elicited shock from anyone other than clo she examined the eye critically muttered fool boy under her breath and sat down arlene told me she had to go into the restaurant last minute so i thought id stop by and see if yall needed any help with anne she leaned close to me lorna still here i forced a smile on my face yes she is would you mind stepping outside with me for a minute please a frown creased her face and she slowly rose to her feet whats wrong she asked i didnt answer her as she followed me out onto the back porch thunder rumbled distantly and i wondered if we were likely to get one of the tempestuous summer evenings that would keep a lightning show going the entire night one to shake the floors and the walls the air was heavy with the promise of storm i gestured to one of the porch chairs and she sat still frowning anne all right yes mamas fine i cleared my throat but didnt say anythingi didnt know where to start i decided with someone as blunt as clo the blunderbuss approach would work i was told by someone that you were having a discussion with greg callahan sitting in his car a couple of days before he died i just wondered why clos face didnt betray any reaction to my announcement i wasnt surprised she would make a worldclass poker player if she ever decided to take up the game who told you this does it matter youre not denying it i didnt think anything i did outside of this house was any concern of yours her voice held a grating edge that suggested i was on thin ice look clo youve always shot straight with me before please dont stop now her gaze rested on the newly mowed grass of the backyard she wasnt going to look me in the face anymore i dont have to answer this jordy she stood youll have my resignation in the morning or should i send it to mr goertz since he pays my salary i stood to face her goddamn it you are stubborn look the man supposedly didnt know very many folks in town he talked with you privately i assume from your attitude he hadnt stopped you for directions to the dairy queen now hes dead i held up my hands wait now two men are dead youre in this house taking care of my mother i think i have a right to know why you were talking to him clo unless youve done something wrong its not an unreasonable question she sat considering her fingers folded into the shape of a steeple and she rested her thumbs on her heavy chin the chittering of the nights creatures rang in my ears and sitting like that she looked like a statue of some forbidding unforgiving goddess if she couldnt tell me this i could never trust her again with the simple duties id seen her perform so often braiding mamas hair coaxing her to rest during her fitful spells washing her face with the gentlest of strokes the steeple of her fingers folded she looked at me with eyes of complete candor he wanted to talk to me about you jordy he stopped me on the street introduced himself to me said he knew you and said he had a business proposition for me i decided to listen to him he sat me down in the car i was kind of nervous about that but i figured i could handle him we talked for a long while he wanted to know about my kids and he told me he knew times were hard for people even honest hardworking folks like me he wanted to know how much free run of your house i had i got pretty suspicious at this point and started to leave then he offered me five thousand dollars i decided to listen some more to what i asked my breath caught in my throat he wanted me to put a bag in your attic a bag i dont understand i didnt either till i looked in the bag had chemicals and wires in it she didnt blink and rods that looked like sticks of dynamite my god he wanted you to put a bomb in my house not a bombthe makings of a bomb it wasnt all hooked up together she let out a long unhappy sigh i told him no way no way in hell he offered me ten thousand i said no not any business of mine he reached in his jacket and i thought for sure he was getting a gun to shoot me dead but he pulled out a thousand dollars a thick wad in twentydollar bills he pushed it in my hand and said wed never talked he said if i did talk keeping the money wasnt going to pay for the trouble id buy myself my god he wanted to make me look like the bomber i stared at her what did you do she surveyed the lawn again i kept the money i was afraid to say anythinghe frightened me there was something about his eyes a blankness behind them that made me all shivery and jordy a thousand dollars is a lot i guess i cant buy back your trust with it i thought he wanted to pull some mean prank on you because of you and lornas past i thought maybe he was involved with her or maybe i thought hed be gone soon and i could just take the money and put it in my granddaughters college fund but then he turned up dead and no one at all had to know hed given me that money i figured it was okay cause at least he couldnt hurt you like how he wanted to i didnt have to say anything and i could keep the money at least i thought i could she shook her head i aint cut out for this shit i can always keep other peoples secrets but never my own i was hardly listening to her greg had wanted to frame me as mirabeaus least favorite explosive personality why what on earth did he have to gain i looked over at clo id been staring off at the wall as she talked a hot anger boiled up in me this woman who had cared for my mother for me our familyshed taken money from a man who wanted to implicate me as a criminal and not said a word and if he hadnt died i guess you would have just stayed quiet about it my voice was cold her stoic mouth trembled for a moment i dont know what i would have done jordy she fumbled in her purse and drew out a roll of crisp bills i cant spend it i cant put it in the bank i cant even put it into dianes college fund diane was clos granddaughter a pretty precociously bright girl of ten its like blood money i wished id never stepped out of the car with it her thick hand closed around the roll shook in anger i didnt feel much sympathy for her i think you better go clo im sorry that our family wasnt worth more than a thousand dollars to you she threw the money in my face the rubberbanded wad of cash bounced off my forehead if i hadnt been so numbed by her news i imagine it would have hurt i wish i had your smug superiority but i dont she was screaming now and tears made her voice ragged instead i got one son to support cause he cant find work and a grandbaby to raise cause her mamas dead i dont get to sit behind a library desk all day on my ass i have to take care of people that are going to die soon and i try not to love them but i do people like your mama im sorry i made a mistake but i made it only you can forgive me for it i aint gonna forgive myself anytime soon i glanced up lorna leaned in the kitchen doorway a shocked look on her face and mark stood stockstill on the stairs his mouth gaping i didnt know what to say i felt the molten pain of betrayalin my gut in my heart in my head my mouth was dry ii suppose you should tell junebug about this maybe greg knew who the bomber really was all right i will her tears were gone wiped away on the back of her hand i suppose you dont want me around here no more like i said ill send my resignation to mr goertz sisterd kill me if i let clo go but what was i supposed to do this woman was caring for my mother yet shed stayed quiet for money knowing that i or my family might be in danger from greg callahan the trust id felt for her lay shattered i think that would be best clo im sorry im sorry too jordy more than you will ever know she glanced up at mark tell your mamaw goodbye for me sugar pie she turned to lorna you be glad that mans dead miss he was nothing but trash through and through lorna didnt answer i didnt look up as the front door closed behind her i was still staring at the thousand dollars at my feet lorna had more presence of mind than i did she picked it up using a towel and dropped it in a paper bag junebugll probably want it she said i nodded hating greg hating myself and wondering if i should let lorna keep a hold on that money i took the bag from her and said ill keep it for him she nodded and went back into the kitchen mark had vanished upstairs i went to go lie down on my bed i closed my eyes try not to think about clo the sharp sting of betrayal still hurt was i being unfair could i forgive her i rubbed my eyes through closed lids if candace was right lorna was betraying me in a way possibly worse than cloyet id given clo who had confessed a tonguelashing and id given lorna who hadnt a peanutbutter cookie i wasnt being entirely fair by being understanding toward one and damning toward the other i rolled over and called the police station according to junebug the boston police had found an address for a doreen miller but she apparently was no longer in residence they were still looking for her he had not offered an opinion about the passworded and destroyed intraglobal computer files i could only imagine what he would make of clos tale i tried to be analytical greg wanted me to look like the bomber why what was his connection to the bomber i drew two quick blanks discarding the notion that he considered me a serious rival for lornas affections unless hed been madly in love with her and we hadnt known it had he planned on blackmailing me into selling my land that wouldnt have worked him using some manufactured secret against me it made no sense my black eye hurt and i resisted the urge to rub it greg asking clo to plant phony evidence against me had nearly eclipsed my misadventures with parker dee and jenny id never seen a whole family of suspects before but then im not a cop and candaces accusation against lorna not to mention that tiny parmalee with all things considered was the only person vicious enough to do these crimes anyway and could not be eliminated from the running and neither could his probable puppet master nina hernandez and how did poor freddy jacksill getting blown to smithereens in gregs room tie in he mustve known something about greg and gotten killed for it something greg did here in town and no one wanted knownwas there a reason not only that freddy got killed but that he was murdered in gregs room my headache was not ebbing with all this arduous speculation i kept thinking about lorna and those files a rap at the door interrupted my completely chaotic train of theories uncle jordy mark stuck his head in lorna wants to know if you want some dinner yeah i guess ill come down in a minute and fix something you better shes talking about cooking something called bread dressing but it doesnt have cornbread in it sounds real gross it is trust me its not like dressing youre used to ill be down in a minute a stray notion hovering on the edge of my speculations crowded to the front of my brain for attention the odd phone number in gregs room that id traced to the johnson family hey mark do you know two kids at the high school named brice and becca johnson a little older than you mark nodded brice is a geek hes going off to major in chemistry at a amp m this fall chemistry interesting major you could blow up a lab if youre not careful i shook my head chastising myself for chasing at shadows what about becca johnson mark shrugged shes real pretty usually nice she can be a little stuckup i bit my lip you ever see either of them with jenny loudermilk it might make sense she was the only other teenager in the stew oh yeah she and jenny loudermilk are best friends theyre always hanging out together i rolled over and reached for the phone i drummed my fingers against my cheek and then decided i dialed the johnsons number it barely rang before it was answered a young mans voice slightly nasal becca is she okay i was taken aback um no this isnt becca i take it shes not there no shes not the boy hesitated whos calling um brice yeah this is jordy poteet i was calling for becca because im a friend of jenny loudermilks and theyre all at the hospital im manning the phone here in case folks call the hospital yeah hey sorry to be the one to tell you jenny took an overdosethey think its valium and booze shes in the hospital oh my god is she okay i gripped the phone harder mark stared at me his dark eyes wide i dont know i dont know if shes going to make it or not beccas down there now thanks brice thanks very much i hung up without further ado in the middle of this sweltering evening i felt cold down to my bones chapter thirteen the crowd to watch over jenny loudermilks life had gathered in front of the malfunctioning television in mirabeau hospitals secondfloor waiting room mostly teenagers with a scattering of parents sat watching the distorted colors on the screen you could see the shameful thought in the adults faces thank god its not my child the kids themselves looked numbed as though shocked at the thought of their own mortality parker and dee were not there i wavered in the doorway that led into the waiting room hesitant to intrude on their grief i felt terrible that girlher drinking her attitude it was all a cry for attention a cry for help i could have tried harder to talk to her instead i taunted her watched her mother slap her and left i didnt know a soul in the room believe it or not i dont know every person in mirabeau gingerly i approached one of the parents a portly woman who kept wringing her hands as if wanting to rub the flesh off her fingers she watched me walk toward her no doubt i looked a sight with my slinged arm and my black eye excuse me is there any news on jenny i asked softly the woman shook her head the corners of her lips tugging downward im afraid not dee is in with the doctor now were just hoping that dee found her in time could you tell me which of the girls is becca johnson she nodded and pointed at a girl sitting on the dingy plaid sofa a people magazine open and unread in her lap the girl rested her chin on her hand staring off into space ignoring the other kids around her she was strikingly pretty with a thick mane of black hair and wideset green eyes that penetrated like light shining through an emerald her skin was flawless the kind that most teenagers only dream of and her lips were full without being comic she was already beautiful and had the promise of even greater deeper loveliness as she aged i could almost wish to be sixteen again looking at her i thanked the woman and knelt by becca she nearly jerked startled out of her reverie by me who looked more like a patient than a visitor on closer inspection i saw she looked exhausted becca my name is jordan poteet i wondered if i could talk to you privately for a minute its about jenny youre not a doctor are you she asked no im not but i need to speak with you about jenny please its important she watched me with those spectacular eyes i guess i wasnt found wanting she tossed the magazine to one side and got up telling one of the other girls that shed be back in a few minutes we went silently to the cafeteria where i offered her a cup of coffee she opted for a diet pepsi instead and we sat down at a glaringly orange plastic table i dont know why hospitals filled with the injured and the worried buy furniture in colors designed to shock and nauseate becca sat across from me folding her hands rather primly she left her soda untasted and watched me there wasnt just beauty there a keen intelligence gleamed from her there would be no kidding around with this girl i understand that youre jennys best friend i said yeah weve been close since the second grade good then im sure youre very concerned about her yeah so what did you want to talk about mr poteet i plunged ahead telling her in detail my adventures at the loudermilks at no point did she interrupt or ask for clarification but i could see that she was shocked when i finished she tapped a fingernail against the garish tabletop before answering wow mr loudermilk gave you the shiner heshes got a temper i believe parkers got a violent temper and you think jenny was hiding something about him becca watched her polished fingernails instead of my face i dont think i know and i think you know too green ice looked into my face what do you mean i was there right after greg callahans body was found at the mirabeau b your phone number was written on the notepad by his phone ive also heard tell that greg might have been romancing both jenny and her mother that could have given parker or dee a potent motive to kill greg i wasnt about to suggest to jennys best pal that jenny might be a murderer as well now jennys turned to drinking and taking valium there are some connections here becca and i want to know what they are she didnt look at me havent the police already talked to you they mustve contacted your family she kept her eyes glued to the table i told them i didnt know any reason why greg callahan would have our number there is a reason now for jennys sake cant you tell me becca johnson slid back into the hard orange plastic of the cafeteria chair she popped the top on her warming can of soda and sipped taking her time to answer me finally she said i dont want jenny to get into trouble hon jennys already in trouble big trouble i think you know that if youre a friend youll help her get out of this mess why should i tell you anything mr poteet her right eyebrow arched because the truth has to come out now becca i softened my voice jenny said to her mother she couldnt keep protecting himwhoever him is and i think its her father im going to wager the pressure of that secret is why she poured those valiums into her palm and washed them down with a bottle of gin if the secrets out the pressures gone theres nothing to hide nothing to hide becca echoed she ran a finger up and down the condensation of the can in eerie imitation of jenny and her glass of gin earlier in the day well i asked her tongue covered her top lip for a moment and she glanced around quickly to assure herself no one could hear us the only other people in the cafeteria were two older black ladies laughing quietly in conversation by the cash register the words came slowly like paste squeezed out of a tube greg was seeing jenny he had been since he got here they met when he came out to talk to mrs loudermilk jennys impulsive about men she has a bad thing for older menshes dated a guy in his late twenties over in bavary no one else knows about that but me she shot me a look that said and you better damn well not tell either or get any ideas in your head about her theres no reason to discuss her past relationships becca im not going to judge jenny anyhow she ended up going to his room at the mirabeau b and well she blanched they got intimate and her parents didnt know i asked she shook her head she wouldnt let him call her at home so hed call me and leave messages for her he used the name don miller so i just told them don was a friend from over in bavary i met through school just a friend not a boyfriend so they didnt ask about him except my mom teased me about how much this boy don was calling me hed call and tell me where and when jenny could meet him and then id call her and give her the details she stared into space above my shoulder i told her this was stupid really stupid falling for a much older guy who wasnt staying in town but he kept telling jenny he would be coming back to mirabeau a lot what with the condo resort getting built don miller not too far off from doreen miller i leaned forward there is no condo resort becca and i told her of gregs fraudulent plan to resell the land to the houston chemical waste company her face hardened that son of a bitch i was right about him then why did you help her she smiled ever so slightly because it mattered to her and shes my friend and there was something terribly silly and romantic about them i mean you knew it wasnt going to work but they had all this passion she paused but her parents found out how i dont know jennys not a good liar so they probably caught her in a contradiction or they got careless around town and someone ratted to mr and mrs loudermilk what about the possibility of dee having an affair with greg how does that strike you her eyes met mine it strikes me as possible isnt that awful mr poteet i guess i should think better of my best friends mother and mrs loudermilks always been good to me but yeah i could see her doing it she does what she wants i think that whole family does after all theyre loudermilks and shes a verybecca paused searching for the right word touching person i dont mean emotionally touching but physically i could see her having an affair just for the sheer pleasure but if she did fool around i think shed make sure no one ever caught on shes tough i thought of the look of ecstasy on dee loudermilks face as the wet clay spun into texture and shape beneath her smeared fingers i nodded jenny never mentioned anything about her mother and greg and if she had known im sure she would have said something to me we dont have many secrets from each other so do you know anything more about the loudermilks yes she said staring down at her soda can she finally looked up at me again when her folks found out her father was furious hes scary i dont know how mrs loudermilk took itjenny said she didnt seem upset at all she was trying to defend jenny against her dad mr loudermilk she broke off for a moment then surged on bolstered by some inner courage hes one of those men everyone says nice stuff about but i dont think many people like him and hes never made me feel entirely comfortable theres something a little bent about him i thought again of the odd joy in parkers eyes watching the mirabeau b burn and of jennys snide comment about her father getting excited by fire not to mention the hairtrigger temper and the violent streak i had to agree with becca that parkers bathroom didnt appear to be fully tiled this will sound really strange becca but did jenny every say anything about her father and the bomber becca blinked no not that i remember i mean the bombers been all anyones been talking about she narrowed her eyes at me why you dont think that mr loudermilk he could be he owns a construction company hes worked with explosives and he really seems to enjoy watching fire i noticed it when the mirabeau b burned and jenny commented on it to me i paused and the room of the man who was having an affair with his daughter gets blown up is that supposed to be coincidence becca took a long studied breath god i never thought of that when mr loudermilk found out it was late thursday night after theyd had that meeting at the library about the land development i was there i said whoever ratted on jenny did it after the loudermilks got home but i guess that theyd seen her arrive at the meeting with greg and that just added fuel to the fire no puns intended jenny and her dad had a big fight and then he stormed out jenny said her mom didnt fight with hershe was stonecold icy to her jenny called me and i said i hoped that her dad had gone for a drive to cool off and not to go confront greg she was supposed to have met greg around midnight but she was arguing with her parents and there was no way they were letting her out of the house lorna had heard a door slam down the hall around midnightan irate greg returning from a lonely rendezvous or angry that his young lover hadnt shown up i mean becca continued greg was guilty of statutory rape well when i said statutory rape jenny just had a cow she said she was going over to the mirabeau b and make sure her father hadnt hurt greg she hung up on me i got worried that jenny would go over there find her father and greg fighting and thered be a big scene she stopped to rub her eyes god this was only a couple of days ago and now it seems like years and years ive hardly slept since what happened i dont live far from the mirabeau b so i snuck out and walked over i thought if there was trouble i could at least be there for jenny if her parents knew how i helped her id be in deep shit with them but i wasnt really too worried about that i thought jen needed me i got there and saw mr loudermilk barreling out of the side door of the bedandbreakfast wait a second becca what time was this very late around two interesting that was around the time lorna had ventured into gregs room gotten tied up and locked in a closet she hadnt mentioned hearing an argument then though did that mean that parker loudermilk had silently killed greg callahan then left anyway he was hurtling out of there just as i saw mrs loudermilks car pulling up i dont think he saw them hed parked behind the house he got into his own car and left i nearly came out of the shadows then but i wanted to see what was going to happen maybe if mr loudermilk and greg had already had it out then i wouldnt have to get involved i still didnt want the loudermilks to know how id helped jenny and greg get together they might not want jenny and me to be friends anymore she sighed sounding older than she should they sat in their car for a minute or two then slowly drove off im sure the loudermilks would be very upset if all of this about jenny and greg came out especially if parker murdered him over it i didnt voice that thought however did you approach jenny no she confessed i went home to bed i still havent even told jenny that i was there i licked my dry lips did you see if parker was carrying anything a pair of gloves or a bag of some sort she closed her eyes in concentration her face as still as a statues caught in a representation of eternal thought he didnt have a bag or anything but he was shoving something into his pockets as he left i couldnt see what it was gloves i thought maybe a pair of work gloves to protect his hands from the prick of the barbed wire parker would have had time to drive out to dees land cut the barbed wire or even take the barbed wire from dees studio go to gregs room kill him tie up lorna and leave parker loudermilk was at the murder scene about the time that lorna had gotten grabbed and locked upand a time that fit for greg to be murdered and jenny loudermilk reading the account of her lovers murder in the paper mustve felt crushed under that knowledge what had dee told her when jenny found out greg was dead keep your mouth shut about where your father was last night what could jenny have thought about her erratic father except that he was a killer alcohol hadnt made her pain go away so shed supplemented it with something stronger i felt a surge of pain for jenny loudermilk and indignation toward greg callahan and the loudermilks it didnt answer one question though why had freddy jacksill been blown to bits outside of gregs room becca i made myself ask how did you find out that greg was dead and what was jennys reaction to his death i saw it in the paper and as soon as i heard i called jenny she sounded like a dead girl on the phonetired like her mind had been shut off i tried to give her comfort but she didnt want to talk to me she didnt want to talk about greg she stared down at the table embarrassed by her emotion i tried to tell her that i was at the mirabeau b that night but she hung up on me when i mentioned greg and her father i guess she just wanted pills and booze becca buried her hands in her face and when junebug came to talk to you she looked at me through her fingers tears streaming down her face ii dont like mr loudermilk very much but i couldnt think he was a killer my god ive known him practically my whole life and hes the mayor hes jennys dad i figured it had to be someone else i leaned back against the creaky plastic of the chair and closed my eyes for a minute dee mustve known that parker killed greg when she heard about gregs death i tried to imagine her response cover the precious loudermilk ass shed sworn jenny to secrecy then why had she shown me the barbed wire in her studio showing me the wire pointed more fingers at her family not fewer i opened my eyes and made myself swallow past the heaviness in my throat unless she was sending us a signal maybe she was afraid of that vaunted temper as well but wasnt willing to risk herselfor her daughterby coming forward if the police fingered parker she wouldnt have toat least not until the trial when he would safely be in jail i could understand dees fear but i thought shed taken the wrong tack the tough cool dee might be able to keep a horrifying secret but jenny pulled between loyalty to her father terror over what she thought hed done and grief over her dead lover hadnt coped with the pressure okay becca i know this has been tough is there anything else that you can tell me did you see anyone else around she shook her head no i didnt i was just glad there hadnt been a scene on the front lawn i went straight home she wiped sweat from her palms on her faded jeans you really think he did it dont you its possible becca i wont kid you i think jenny must know did she ever have a problem with booze or pills before becca shook her head not really i mean we drink beer every now and then at a party but neither of us is much of a drinker i dont like having to pee as much as you do when you drink beer and i dont think jenny likes it she just drinks to be cool suddenly tears filled her heartbreaker eyes god i dont want to lose her i took her hand and she squeezed my fingers i think you just did a lot to help get her back lets go see how shes doing then maybe you and i can go see junebug moncrief together she wiped her eyes and nodded we left the cafeteria she walked with perfect posture she wasnt going to show weakness not in this case a doctor i didnt know was with dee and the others in the waiting room dees eyes went to becca as we walked back in and then fastened on me her eyes reddened by tears stared into mine parker was nowhere to be seen mrs loudermilk please hows jenny becca attempted but dee cut her off jennys not doing well hello jordan dees voice had a forced calmness to it dee do you know where parker is she shook her head no i dont why has he left town dee i forced myself to ask she took my arm and steered me away from everyone else to the water fountain i saw becca and the gathered parents watch for a moment then turn away to talk in quiet tones she sagged then a little of the loudermilk pride seeping out of her god im a stupid bitch stupid stupid stupid i placed cautious hands on her shoulders look i know you saw him at the mirabeau b that night she stiffened under my palms but didnt look at me i guess you think i was protecting him she said in the most toneless of voices her shoulders shuddered and i steadied her no i think you were trying to protect yourself and your daughter but for gods sake why didnt you just tell the police youd seen him there hesmy husband and hes a dangerous man when hes crossed i thought the police would figure out hed killed greg on their own and that wayhed never blame jenny or me we wouldnt be the ones to turn him in has he beat you dee or jenny she looked up at me with old old eyes oh no hes not the type to beat hed just kill us straight out if he wanted to i went downstairs to the main hospital lobby becca didnt want to leave while jenny was still in bad shape and i was loath to try to convince her to do so and after my talk with dee i felt sick and shaky i could only imagine the guilt she felt over jennys suicide attempt i found a pay phone and called bob don but there was no answer i called junebug he sounded exhausted no ones seen parker hes vanished ive got everyone looking for him to try and let him know about jenny you sure you dont want to press charges against him yes i do and you might want to as well after eliciting a promise that he wouldnt be mad at becca for not immediately coming forward i relayed her and dees stories i heard junebugs breath hiss out in a long sigh what a goddamned mess and him being mayor too this is just the sort of crap that those tabloid shows love to gobble up well if you decide to run for mayor i guess it would help if your opponent was serving time i quipped humor seemed out of place but i needed to avoid thinking about jenny even if just for a moment honestly junebug who cares we just need to find him lets say jordy that youre right and parker killed greg still doesnt explain about what happened to freddy i took a slow breath look ive wonderedand dont say that im crazyif parker might have something to do with these bombings yeah i made that joke about him owning the construction company but listen junebug i saw that man watching the mirabeau b burn the look on his face was downright eerie like he was getting nearly sexual pleasure from it and his daughter told me he has a love of fire then he ought to be setting fires not exploding bombs and why kill freddy i cant explain everything right now i answered in a huff youve got to find parker to get all the answers god junebug muttered and i could imagine him shaking his head in disbelief what the hell gets into folks why do they think murderins gonna solve a single problem i got to get a search warrant out for his house and his business lord have mercy will this be a mess i leaned against the cool concrete wall of the hospital lobby i think im going home any luck on the boston side nope doreen miller seems to be made of air junebug coughed like he was coming down with a summer cold and you know the whole setup with intraglobal seems fishy their office space was leased in the name of michael beasley whos michael beasley hes listed as some officer of intraglobal i called lorna a few minutes ago and she claimed she never heard of him i thought of those files that candace claimed lorna had obliterated was lorna covering up for someone herself this mysterious michael beasley am i the only one who thinks this is getting goddamned complicated i asked no jordy youre not what was lorna doing when you called she said she and mark were watching a movie she was wondering when you were going to come home shell have to wait a bit longer im going over to see candace i think thats a real good idea jordy junebugs voice sounded odd what do you mean by that just a good idea iwell hell it aint none of my business say whatever youre going to say hewett i call him by his first name whenever i get impatient with him dont take her for granted jordan he snapped back thats all im saying lornas a nice girl and all but candacewell candace is special my jaw worked i hadnt ever expected to hear such words regarding candace from junebug i mean they were friends and had known each other a long time but i never thought that he thought she was special yeah junebug she is special ive always thought so good im glad to hear that well if we find parker ill give you a call thanks i hung up and stared at the phone for a moment then i hurried out into the hot summer night chapter fourteen the lights were on in candaces house and music drifted from the back porch i paused at the side of the house listening to marychapin carpenters sweetedged voice sing a lament of forsakenness not a good sign candace always played marychapins inyourface songs when she was feeling mad i tended toward chris isaak and when we were feeling romantic well there was no one who could hold a candle to patsy cline i thought i probably wouldnt be hearing patsys elegant voice tonight she sat on the back porch sipping sangria shed probably mixed herself the musk blaring without too much concern for the neighbors i rapped on the porchs screen she frowned at me and leaned over turning the music down low have they carted her off yet to the hoosegow are you here to have a celebratory drink with me candace asked dryly i sat down beside her on the porch swing easing because of the soreness in my arm no shes still there ice barely rattled in candaces glass as she sipped her wine she set down her glass went into the kitchen brought out another glass and poured me some sangria she handed it to me and watched me take a sip sitting down again next to me she said jordy we need to have a serious talk i know would you like to go first or should i the rim of the glass was against my lip and i kept it there afraid to drink afraid to talk i had a sudden fear shes had enough of this mess enough of me and shes getting out i sat frozen not wanting to hear her not wanting to say what was in my heart i will candace swirled her sangria in her glass i take it you still havent talked to lorna about all her lies no i see since lornas still roaming free why are you here i told her quickly about jennys overdose and clos duplicity she didnt say anything or look at me watching the fireflies pirouette under the shadowy trees finally she spoke clo is not the villainess here shes a good person and the best goddamned nurse you could have ever found for your mother this i was not expecting listen candace she lied to us she was practically in cahoots with greg callahan to frame me this is the way that it always is with you jordy she said softly her voice an arid whisper above the wind that moved through the trees like a dancer through a crowd the trust starts you let yourself really get close to someone and then you find fault with them and you get the hell out that way you dont have to deal with them anymore i dont know what youre talking about you make it sound like i was in love with clo or something trust and love are different things i think although trust is a simple kind of love thats something men just never seem to get candace shifted in her chair and sipped at her wine she looked at me with her piercing blue eyes you havent really trusted anyone since you found out that bob don was your daddy jordy i drank down some of the wine before answering her collecting my thoughts that is absolutely ridiculous is it i dont think so sure youre upset with clo but having her gone means one less emotional connection in your life looking at her situation it would not be hard to forgive her you keep alternating between thinking lorna is as innocent as the newdriven snow and thinking shes guilty as sinmaybe even gregs killer youre always bickering with gretchen god forbid you make peace with her and attempt to have a fully mature relationship with your father and your stepmother and as far as you and i go im really tired of only being your stout support she set her sangria down on the porch table and her gaze held mine you could have been killed when those mailboxes blew up i came within inches of losing you and you didnt seem to notice how upset i was now you run off helterskelter sticking your nose in where it has no business being and i wait for you to get hurt worse like that black eye what if it hadnt been parker loudermilk beating you up but that crazy tiny parmalee and now youve got your exgirlfriend who i know is a liar shacked up in your house trying to win you back and im just supposed to sit here not be bothered by this unholy mess and watch shes not trying to win me back i answered automatically i breathed in as soon as i said it trying to suck the words back into my throat lorna had tried i closed my eyes i hadnt even thought what wear and tear these past few days had been on candace yes she is jordy im not a fool shes still in love with you my only consolation is that shes even more messed up than you are so i dont think shell succeed she loves you and shes more afraid of that than anything else a thickness sat in my throat one i couldnt swallow past or cough up believe me i tried she did try to get me back she wanted me to go to bed with her i told her no i told heri told her that im in love with you id never said those words to candace i was afraid and there always seemed tomorrow i wanted to reach out for candaces hand feel her warm fingers against my palm feel her life and god i didnt want her to turn away from me goddamn you jordan poteet she whispered if you were going to tell that to someone dont you think it should have been me yes i should have but im not good at this love crap candace i dont know how to do it right i mean be a couple be in love i felt like a dunce the uncoolest person to ever draw breath youre such a man hopeless she shook her head you dont have to do love jordy its not like lunch or scoring well on a test you just have to love dont you see the difference i didnt answer and she reached over touching my chin gently and turning my face back to hers youre scared to death of me arent you is that why lorna still beckonsbecause you dont have to love her the way you love me she makes life easier an odd tightness collected in my chest the mysteries of women and love demanded bravery i never thought of it that way candace studied me then you go and think about it some she stood up collecting her pitcher of wine and her glasses i watched her go inside then come back to the door good night jordy i stood wait a minute i told you that i loved you and you dont have anything to say to me you didnt tell me you loved me jordy you told me youd told your exgirlfriend you loved me come back and sit a spell with me when youve learned the difference and the door shut in my face firmly with a click that kicked at my heart it couldnt be true i was not that messed up i wasnt cutting myself off from folks look how many of them i still had in my life candace was nuts or drunk then why did i feel like id been pierced with a cold steel sword and laid open like a surgeons practice cadaver i leaned against my car still parked out in candaces driveway the night air growled like a restless giant and high above heavy clouds dangled ready to answer a prayer for rain i wished the goddamned downpour would just come come and drench me in the street wash me clean of all my sins and failings the clouded sky mocked me rumbling flirtatiously not offering even a meager drop miss twylas house across the street was dark except for one kitchen light poor miss twyla i thought alone in this world and i realized with a start that if i didnt have candace id feel a loneliness that sister or mark or bob don would not be able to fill id never had a successful relationship before and now the one i considered good was crumbling like stale tobacco between my fingers because i was scared and i was letting lorna call the shots i glanced back at candaces house was she watching me from a window all the curtains were drawn i hoped she was i hoped she still had enough patience in her heart to want to watch me leave the light over at miss twylas went out she and nina must be retiring to bed exhausted from planning their battles against lorna and adding coins to their war chest i had my own battle to fight and those two would just have to stand in line i got in my car and drove back to my house letting my anger and resolve boil she was still up watching the news when i got home a bowl of popcorn sat in her lap and she was slowly nibbling she was in a tshirt and shorts and looked far far too much at home in my house well hello she said as i walked in we gave up on dinner for you mark and i scarfed a frozen pizza and your mother had some tomato soup arlene called shes not going to be back until around two in the morning do you want anything i walked past her snapping off the giddily grinning meteorologist describing the storm alert we were under until three am yes i do i want some answers uh okay she said setting the bowl of popcorn aside whats wrong whats wrong lorna oh thats rich thats really rich you waltz back into my life try to get me back into your bed your boss gets murdered another guy gets blown up a girls tried to kill herself the woman i love is ready to drop me and you want to know whats wrong the words stung her she stared up in defiance what is your problem are you laying all the blame for this on me why not i shot back because gregs the one that stirred up everything she retorted i wasnt the one who got someone pissed enough to kill me im pissed enough right now lorna i took a deep breath you destroyed some of the files you accessed using candaces computer i know you did you lied to me and you could have destroyed evidence in a murder case why those files lorna her dark eyes bored into mine i didnt destroy anything jordan quit your lying what did candace manufacture this little story obviously she wants to turn you against me shes pretended to be my friend but she really loathes me i can tell she thinks shes better than me her tone turned ugly if youre the liar i think you are she is better lorna looked away from me her eyes traveling across the wall of photos of sister and me in our youth youre so goddamned smug so superior in your smalltown lightness you do belong here jordan not in the real world you live in some ozzie and harriet fantasy of what life should be like no i dont i live in the real world i live in the world of busting my ass and taking care of my family and having my friends and just trying to get by and i dont lie to people i told you i didnt destroy any files you know there should be backup tapes of any of intraglobals files lorna most companies do that i laughed hollowly but then intraglobal isnt most companies is it most companies arent committing fraud most companies dont have folks who do work for them getting blown up like poor freddy most companies dont have silent partners who conveniently disappear her eyes widened i leaned down into her face like this doreen miller that they cant seem to find where is she lorna how can you work with greg and not know her i leaned back on my heels unless youre doreen miller youre nuts her tone was outraged even if i was in on gregs fraudwhich i wasntit wouldnt be much of an out for me would it since the cops are looking for her theyre looking for her in boston not here and you never did answer my question about the backup computer tapes or did you destroy the evidence on those backups before you came down here im not doreen miller ive never even met her never talked to her candace and i are going to go to the cops here and in boston candace will tell them that she saw you destroy those files i took a step toward her look lorna whatever mess youve gotten yourself into ill try to help you ill help you as much as i can but ive got to know the truth otherwise what can i think i lowered my voice i dont want what im saying to you to be true but it could be you couldve killed greg did you know what he was up to did he threaten you if you told on him lorna for gods sake she was shaking her head at me her lovely gray eyes wide in the dim light from the lamp mama used to read her books by my god you do think i killed him as long as you dont tell me the truth i have to assume the worst no matter what i once meant to you i could barely hear her question no matter she held her breath for a moment then let it out in a long hiss i am many things jordan but i am not a killer i didnt kill greg and i sure didnt kill freddy indecision framed her face and she pressed the back of her hand against her mouth the last time id seen her do that was when shed gotten the phone call that her father had died im afraid you wont believe me i dont want you to hate me jordan i sank to the couch lorna for gods sake i dont hate you i dont understand you anymore but i dont hate you she leaned against the back of mamas chair her fingers left long red lines across her cheek as she dragged her hand down her face i found files in the computer back in boston copies of letters letters from me to gary zadich the guy that owns the chemical company in houston the one you said greg was going to sell the land to so you had known you had been in touch with him no someone faked those files jordan i never saw them before i never heard of gary zadich or of any plan to resell the land but those letters in the computer were going to make it look like i had someones trying to set me up i stood in the gentle quiet of my living room listening to her trying to weigh her words how do i know that youre not making this up lorna that youre just trying to cover your tracks why didnt you just leave the files alone and tell the cops that theyre faked i was afraid i checked the files they were created long ago but they were in gregs directories ones id never seen before until i started trying to track down what he was up to i made a mistake i panicked i got rid of them she paused dont you believe me for gods sake jordan this is me you know me better than anyone else how could you think i would lie about this i dont know what to think anymore i said sitting down my stomach felt tied in knots i stood back up we better call the cops again and tell them this let junebug decide if she was lying or not i didnt want the responsibility anymore the phone rang just as i was reaching for it hello the voice was breathless with fright my god jordy this is twyla oudelle i need help and i cant get ahold of junebug tiny is and the phone went dead i held the receiver in my hand feeling coldness creep over me miss twyla miss twyla there was not even the normal hum of the dial tone i hung up and tried to dial miss twylas number there was only mocking silence i tried to call candaceshe was only across the street no answer either she wasnt at home or didnt want to chat my heart pulsed in my throat mark i bawled he came running down the stairs disheveled with sleep look theres something wrong at miss twylas see if you can get hold of junebug hes probably still out looking for parker loudermilk im going over to miss twylas im coming with you lorna said i didnt bother to argue with her all the fight was out of me horrible thoughts played in my mind on the short drive over to miss twylas like a bad bmovie festival tiny strangling miss twyla with the phone cord he might have yanked from the wall tiny snapping ninas thin neck with a flick of his wrist i thought of that faraway day on the playground his weight against my throat him trying to shift the life out of me with slow resolve you better stay in the car when we get there i said to lorna my anger with her temporarily eclipsed by my concern for miss twyla and nina tiny can be trouble you sure you trust me to stay in the car i might try to hotwire it and steal it her voice was back to the peculiarly northern brand of sarcasm that she could excel in for gods sake jordan dont be both judge and jury of me if we could get out of mirabeau for a while talk about us theres no us lorna i pulled up in front of miss twylas darkened house i couldnt help but glance across the street to candaces it was darkened too and her car was gone lorna stayed silent we got quietly out of the car me taking along a flashlight i always kept in the glove compartment she wasnt going to wait in the car and i didnt argue i wasnt used to sneaking up on houses but i had toiletpapered many a one in my roguish youth so i made a beeline for where i thought the bedroom window was i kept an ear up to the glass but heard nothing i considered shining my light into the room but decided that might be a bad idea especially if tiny was waiting inside i gestured to lorna and we carefully cut around to the backyard it was dark back there the outline of the fixtures of miss twylas backyard hardly visible the scattering of pink plastic flamingos that miss twyla goofily referred to as her pets the low shadow of her tornado shelter its doors a slight bulge out of the grass the silhouette of a vaseshaped birdbath the dark hulk of her house i began to move toward the back door not yet turning on the flashlight not wanting to advertise our presence yet i didnt want to think about miss twyla lying inside maybe dead i had taken about four steps toward the house when lorna whispered jordan here i turned back to her and in the darkness she grabbed my arm her hands fumbling for mine seeking the flashlight i turned it on and she pointed the beam toward her own feet shed been wearing opentoed sandalsnot always a good idea in yards round here because of the threat of fire ants but you couldnt expect lorna to know that and i saw with horror that blood smeared her toes a wet blotch of red stained the lawn lornas hand tightened over mine oh god jordan lets get out of here she pleaded not without miss twyla you go on back to the car or go over to candaces and see if you can get junebug i shoved my key ring at her holding out candaces key uhuh i dont want to go off alone i slipped the keys back into my pocket and played the light along the freshly mowed grass there was a thin trail of blood leading to the doors of the tornado shelter id sat through enough horror movies at the old drivein over in bavary to know what not to do namely go down into that shelter where something from another planet was eagerly awaiting an opportunity to eat my face off how many times had i sat watching those movies seeing the hero or heroine act like an idiot my lips pleasantly bruised from making out with my date during the dull parts here was my conclusion if theyre stupid enough to go into that attic thats dripping blood then they deserve to die and those foolishly bold characters almost did always find a terrible demise my hand tightened on the flashlight and i thought of miss twyla her unconditional kindness her erratic and always amusing demeanor her bold assertions about the vitality of the elderly her outlandish lectures in her laboratory classes during my student days her special reputation in town as the last of those crazy oudelles of all the folks in town shed called me when she needed help i moved to the shelter doors the light showed they were unlatched as i reached to open the door and pull it back lorna grabbed my arm again this is nuts lets get out of here please i said you could go im finding miss twyla god youre stubborn lorna breathed in my ear but she didnt leave the door fell back against the ground with a thud darkness as black as the devils soul beckoned i shone the light down the ten or so steps that led to the concrete floor blood speckled the two bottom steps i played the light along the wall of the stairwell i couldnt see a lightbulb or a switch by the doors i took a tentative step in lorna right behind me behind her thunder rumbled as though the storm had finally and inopportunely decided to make its debut after several other tentative steps i was at the bottom of the shelter the oudelles in their eccentricity had spared no expense on their tornado shelter i remembered the shelter out at my grandparents farm the floor and walls had been dirt more a burrowing hole in the ground than something fit for people to occupy for a long time it had always reminded me of a grave waiting to be filled the walls of miss twylas shelter were concrete block with cots and shelves lined with food in case the main house was destroyed in a twister i played the light and found a door in die wall slightly ajar i had taken two steps toward the door when i smelled it the sickeningly sweet odor of bubble gum i whirled as from a darkened corner of the room a fist lashed out catching me squarely in the chest i coughed and stumbled my light dancing around the room but catching tiny parmalees brutal face in its beam he struck me again backhanding me hard shoving me through the ajar door that led into the inner room i landed on my back skidding in the darkness into a piece of furniture my arm throbbed and my chin felt numb hearing lorna scream i yanked my arm from the sling trying to get enough breath to get to my feet id made it halfway when a light snapped on and nina hernandez stood with a gun pointed at my head from the opposite side of the narrow room a shrieking lorna was thrown down on top of me i pulled free of her and stood in a crouch trying to absorb what i was seeing this inner room was larger than the outer room and it held far more interesting secrets nina with a handgun not looking like she cared a great deal about the mirabeau ecosystem at this moment tiny smiling down at me hate in his eyes miss twyla sitting in a chair next to where nina stood her mouth chin and nose bloodied her hair hanging in her face her eyes angry and along the wall shelving that held boxes of wires pliers a canister marked kcio potassium chlorate sacks of sugar batteries watches and eggtimers a dusting of finely powdered aluminum and a stack of metal pipes oh my god i steadied lorna who had stopped screaming and was fearfully watching ninas gun nina held that gun rocksteady and the small dark bore locked on my head miss twyla are you all right i managed to cough out yes jordy thank you for asking at least one of my former students is behaving like a gentleman she shot a daggered look at tiny who seemed inordinately pleased with himself smiling like a badly carved jackolantern obviously you dont want to make any sudden moves nina said to me ill shoot you before you get across the room and even if i miss you i shoot miss twyla you dont want that do you jordy you wouldnt really really hurt miss twyla would you sugar pie tiny rubbed his lip with the back of his hand i mean you didnt really want to slap her like you did nina favored tiny with a look the painted angels on the sistine chapel might give to devout worshipers of course not tiny dear but lets not forget that were dealing with dangerous criminals what i asked stupidly lorna leaned hard against my back hiding behind me dont try to fool tiny jordy hes far too smart for you he understands how miss twylas gone crazy bombing places around town and how lornas the same kind of con artist that greg was it took a couple of seconds to register how could she know oh god youyoure doreen miller i heard myself say she didnt give me a direct answer instead she smiled at tiny who stood near the doorway she fired twice in rapid succession one bullet exploded into tinys left shoulder founting blood and the second hit him in the right side vanishing into his big frame the double roar was deafening in the enclosed space lorna didnt scream but she seized my shoulders in a death grip tiny collapsed against the wall a look of bewilderment on his face and tumbled to the floor i couldnt tell if he was still breathing miss twyla stood her fists clenched and nina motioned for her to resume her seat the smoking end of the gun waving gently miss twyla sat but her anger was a physical presence in the room why nina why hes the most dangerous person here miss twyla i mean after you she laughed mirthlessly and tinys done his part for me lorna had gone and knelt beside tinys slowly stirring form hes still alive she moaned hell die soon enough bitch nina snapped youll be past worrying about him i took a long breath let me guess as doreen miller you planted those files that made lorna look as if she knew about gregs land fraud shes your fall guy unfortunately now she has to be a dead fall guy you betrayed me miss twylas voice was low the voice that only outraged old southern ladies can muster it could frighten a tyrant i brought you into my home to fight for a cause i believed in and you lied to me you stole from me and then used me to kill another human being miss twyla i said watching the gun that still aimed in my direction i think i know the story now ninas real name is doreen milleror at least thats the name that greg knew her as the land resale to the chemical waste company is just a fraud a cover greg and nina are scam artists they come to a town they create a crisis greg threatens development that could ruin the river nina heads up the opposition rallying folks and their finances against what greg proposes they specifically target towns where both development is needed and environmental concerns could run high thats what greg had lorna looking for when he hired her after theyve squeezed money out of both sides they vanish taking the money with them then they set up office somewhere else and start again maybe they set up a fall guy to take the blame thats what happened here i pointed at nina you faked the files on gregs laptop that said he was going to resell the land to the chemical waste company and you faked the same files on the computers up in boston to let lorna take the blame no matter how much that waste company denied that theyd ever heard of intraglobal folks wouldnt believe them so you sail free with all the money miss twyla and eula mae raised vanishing off into the night and lorna looks like the fool and the criminal she is a criminal nina smiled there are more files up there she doesnt even know about that will make her guilty of land fraud posthumously of course why did you kill greg lorna demanded her fright had evaporated at least on the surface and in her face i saw the anger of a cornered animal that is tired of being toyed with and wants the fight profit margin sweetie greg was getting greedy and i just didnt want to share the pots anymore dont feel bad about himhe was all for you being the patsy when we blew town i took that nice little length of barbed wire i got from dee loudermilks property and ended my partnership with him and left lorna alive so you could have your blame fall squarely on her shoulders i said but what about freddy freddy got nosy and freddy got greedy since he was already stupid he got dead nina said icily he made the mistake of overhearing a phone conversation between greg and me and trying to get money out of me he was too idiotic to see that if id killed greg cause i was tired of sharing i wasnt about to split the pot with him she shrugged i conned him i told him he needed to plant more evidence in lornas room in a suitcase that would make lorna look like the solely guilty party and make it easier for him and me to take the money all it took was a timer and freddy was history i just borrowed one of miss twylas contraptions i shook my head remembering linda hillards talk about freddy getting rich too many people now nina you act like you intend on killing us all this many people therell be an awful lot of questions i can handle that jordy im used to vanishing and for all the money im getting out of the intraglobal accounts and that dingbat eula mae trust me your lives are worth it she straightened her shoulders as tiny stirred and groaned well have to make this look good for when the fire investigators get here obviously tiny and miss twyla were unhinged her little pranks just got more destructive and you and lorna bravely tried to stop them everyone knows what a nosy snot you are so no one will be very surprised i think maybe one bullet in you jordy will be enough she wasnt prepared taunting me for miss twyla to throw herself at her gun arm one bullet smashed into the concrete flooring as the old woman tried to grab the pistol away from nina lorna and i from different corners of the room launched ourselves at nina i saw miss twyla fly off shoved hard against the shelving by the spitting con artist and then the gun whirled toward me there was a flash and i felt agony in my leg far worse than any i felt beforelike a sharp hot stab with a needle thatd been sitting in fire turning molten i screamed and fell to the floor holding my thigh blood seeped over my fingers i heard shrieks and i managed to get my head up to look half making my peace with god in case a bullet slammed into my head or detonated one of miss twylas playthings lorna and nina fought for the gun lorna with an obvious height and size advantage the gun spurted fire once striking the ceiling lorna shoved hard and the gun broke from ninas grip skidding toward miss twyla i pulled myself painfully toward it i heard lorna scream goddamn you and glanced back my former ladylove belted nina with a strong right hook wincing as she did so ill kill you for what youve done to us you shot jordan you bitch nina fell to her knees lorna lorna miss twyla barked out i glanced over my shoulder miss twyla had the gun in her hand aimed steadily at nina i nearly collapsed with relief move away from nina now dear miss twyla ordered lorna took a reluctant step back i could see that her face was scratched and her hands flexed into fists nina stared at miss twyla hate in her eyes dont move nina i will shoot you i breathed a huge sigh wincing at the burning pain in my leg this whole nightmare was over yall go on go ahead and get out miss twylas voice was preternaturally calm after the echoing hell of gunshots in the enclosed space lorna i found my voice go call the cops get an ambulance for me and tiny i tried to stand but fell into a crouch lorna was at my side instantly both of you go miss twyla ordered again dont wait for an ambulance and take poor tiny with you through my haze of pain even that request sounded odd i dont think we should try to move tiny miss twyla and as i said it i looked up at her she still had the gun leveled at nina with one hand but in the other she pulled two wires from a box keeping the ends of the wires separated with two fingers youll have to dear neither nina nor i will be leaving miss twylas voice was firm the same one shed used on us in that longago chemistry class when we got too boisterous i didnt comprehend at first the pain blocking my thoughts but lorna did she stood oh miss twyla no let the police and the judges do their job you dont have to do this but i do dear miss twyla insisted she nodded toward nina who had begun crying and shaking she killed freddy using one of my projects thats my fault dont you see that i must pay for that and im not going to take a chance on a jury letting her go its so much better this way dont you see go lorna i said see if you can get tiny up the stairs and go no i wont you crazy bitch nina managed to whisper she sat huddled on the concrete her eyes wide and staring at miss twyla hurry dear miss twyla sounded almost sad my hand is getting tired and when these wires touch thats it lorna go trust me my voice didnt sound like my own but it was please ill be okay she stumbled over to tiny talking to him trying to pull him to his feet suddenly she sobbed and let go of his arm hes dead hes dead oh how awful miss twyla murmured poor misguided thing then go dear you help jordy no i shook my head and spoke through clenched teeth im not leaving without you miss twyla you just get that into your head i turned to lorna just go and call junebug indecision played on her face i motioned toward the door she turned and ran i turned back to miss twyla her gun still steady on nina miss twyla now you just listen to me the police will be here in a minute ninas not going anywhere not with you holding that gun on her so you just put those wires away oh no jordy dont you see how much better it is this way now that ive been found out her tone indicated id made a perfectly stupid suggestion i just couldnt abide all the talk id have to hear about how crazy i was i never wanted anyone to get hurt and i was so careful but then you were injured i just started my little projects as a game because i did get so bored and to show little old ladies could do so much more than attend quilting bees and bake sales were all so underestimated dont you think nina nina pulled her tearstreaked face from her hands staring at the gun and then turning to me talk her out of it for gods sake shes crazy miss twyla please please just put the wires down and come with me youre not well you dont want to do this youre not thinking straight because nina hit you i attempted to hobble toward her jordy youre always so optimistic never seeing the ugly side of life miss twyla smiled gently at me but this is going to happen im not going to some crazy farm and nina has to pay for what she did so you get going you have a whole life to live now go im not leaving until you promise you wont put those wires together promise me a sob escaped me and i leaned down clutching my leg my jeans were bloodsoaked and i felt dizzy you dont want to bleed to death like poor tiny miss twyla advised she sighed very well if thats how it must be i promise so get going she made her promise and god i wanted to live as if of their own accord my feet turned and began a slow hobble toward the door my breathing shuffled along with my feet dont leave me nina screamed dont leave me here with this fucking crazy woman her screams turned into a sobbing wail of hysteria i didnt stop i glanced back at miss twyla when i reached the door both her hands were still steady and she smiled kindly at me if something should happen think of me often jordy and be nice to my memory i do like daisies so maybe if youd remember to put them on my grave id be most appreciative i saw with mounting horror that reason had left those eyes i mouthed the words you promised at her and she nodded silently i stumbled past the doorway pulling myself up the stairs in agony a shriek of sirens sounded above in the real world where men and women loved and fought and ate and lived i felt like orpheus crawling from some dank hell except i had no eurydice to bring home with me behind me i could hear ninas inchoate scream words that could haunt a man for a lifetime jordy jordy please please dont leave me here rain kissed my face as i pulled myself out of the shelter it was pouring and hard behind the shimmer of water i could see the flash of junebugs police sedan i screamed his name lornas name and ignoring the pain in my leg tried my best to run arms found me pulled me ahead lorna junebug oh god i screamed please miss twylas down there and shes lost and then the world exploded chapter fifteen youd think theyd put interesting pictures on hospital ceilings or at least mount the televisions so a soul can lie on his back and watch the baseball games unfold between the tiles not that it would have made much difference i didnt want to look at pictures or watch the austin news play by talking about all the goingson in the formerly tranquil town of mirabeau i had enough pictures in my mind to make a film one i could spend my life watching again and again and again no sequel needed on the back of my eyelids i could still see junebug and lorna hurrying me away from the backyard shelter which exploded in an unholy blast quickly followed by a second more violent detonation as though demons were breaking through the mantel to wreak havoc on mirabeau the forced thrown the three of us to the shuddering earth and id seen the tornadoshelter doors cartwheel free from the opening disintegrating into flaming splinters lornas arm had closed around me pulling me ahead my leg in fresh agony and then id fainted not to ruin my manly image but see how you hold up after a night like that id become dimly aware of candace and lorna both in the ambulance with me one of my hands in each one of theirs they were arguing about me i could tell from their tone of voice that didnt really make me happy i passed out again the next day blurred image after image i was in a bed i was aware of my sisters crying id know her sobs anywhere having made her cry a fair amount as a child and there was a voice telling her that my surgery was successful and i was going to be okay she was told that she neednt carry on so as soon as the shock wore off id be just pert near perfect again i slept some more once i was sure miss twyla was in the room with me if she was i was probably dead which was confusing since i was still in the hospital i suppose theres not a great demand for hospitals in heaven i called for her reached out for her begging her not to do this foolish thing but she vanished before my eyes a gentle forgiving smile on her face i called for her again and candaces kisses were on my cheek the fragrance of her perfume in my nose the gentle spill of her hair across my eyes so i kept my eyes shut i didnt want to see nina if i opened them begging me for her life i never did see her but one night a dream of tiny fought through the painkillers a shocked and disappointed look on his face as the woman hed loved emptied his life for him i woke a sob in my throat i had never liked himhell part of me had abominated himbut i could have wept for him then he didnt deserve the cruelty hed been given the days passed i didnt talk much not to candace not to lorna not to sister not to bob don not to eula mae they all tried to smother me with love which i pushed away like an irritating blanket clo visited at least once doublechecking me everywhere not trusting the nurses on duty to do their job right apparently she ran off a sheepish billy ray bummel when he made an attempt to see me i gave my statement to junebug and signed it his friend from the austin bomb squad teresa garza was there and i remember her squeezing my hand when i had to describe my final words with miss twyla i could only imagine what miss twyla had thought when the bomb at the mirabeau b had gone off and shed sat numb with nina and tiny in his pickup truck watching the town deal with the disaster did she try to delude herself at first that perhaps it was a gas explosion or did she know from the beginning that someone had taken one of her little projects and used it to murder someone why hadnt she come forward pride shame or considering recent events a need to extract her own revenge i asked junebug those same questions and went back to sleep only later did sister tell me that after id slumbered my old friend sat by my bed quietly watching me for the longest damn time the doctors came and went as well saying my leg was healing well from the surgery and it was too bad id broken it when id tumbled to the ground coming down on it at a bad angle im not sure they believed me when i told them my black eye and gashed arm didnt result from the explosion at miss twylas maybe thats when they sent the psychiatrist in id just as soon not talk about that part it was painful to me and like most men i dont believe in sharing every thought and feeling that i have the psychiatrist was a pleasant young fellow with a mightily suppressed drawl who was bound and determined to make sure i didnt feel guilty about leaving miss twyla and nina i met with him a few times and let him think he was making progress i heard hospital gossip that he was also treating parker loudermilk for his tendencies to resort to violence when angry i thought parker would make a prize project for him far more interesting than me sister told me jenny had recovered from her suicide attempt i closed my eyes that girl must have been in hell sister said everyone said jenny was doing so much better now that she knew her daddy wasnt a killer i tried to take some pleasure in that but it was fleeting she still had parker for a dad which i felt was not an optimal situation dee visited me once bringing flowers in a pot shed made herself i was glad to see this pot had no barbed wire candace told me that parker had admitted to finding greg dead apparently nina must have killed greg shortly before the loudermilks arrived according to junebug parker said hed gone over there with a gun thats what becca had seen him stuffing back in his pocket when he fled the scene i didnt want to think about him anymore i suspected the voters of mirabeau would soon give me a new boss so i sat in this introspective stupor for the days that i was in the hospital not talking much nodding smiling closing my eyes letting myself be fussed over by the women in my life i was glad when i got to go home and finally get some rest everything else of interest happened one saturday afternoon when id gotten back weary of my own bed id used my crutches to get down to the couch where id built my empire of tattered paperbacks and bowls of popcorn watching old movies on cable out of harmlessstyle spite i picked up a little silver bell that sat on the coffee table and rang it it was no lovely french chambermaid who answered my call but rather a frowning clo heavy arms crossed over her barrel chest what do you want now your damned old pillows been fluffed enough i didnt want anything from you i just wanted to talk for a second i gestured toward the chair would you sit down she sat warily im glad that bob don hired you to look after me and still help with mama i ventured i know we exchanged some harsh words i think i had a lot of reasons to be angry with you and you with me she stared down at the floor but thats past you made a mistake in judgment ive made several myself lately so im not inclined to be critical so if youre still willing to be around here after im back on my feet will you take care of my mother she nodded and stood that all you wanted to tell me yeah i eased back onto the pillow and fumbled for the remote control id muted gary cooper in sergeant york on american movie classics while id made amends with clo i wasnt expecting it when she leaned down kissed my cheek and hugged me it was so unlike her i forgot to hug back now you keep that tv down she snapped once my head was back on my pillow im on my break in the kitchen and i cant read the national enquirer with all that jabbering i didnt know you could read i quipped gruffly more relieved than id ever admit that my relationship with her was back to normal i hadnt had long to enjoy the movie when gretchen came calling she came into the living room carrying a huge bouquet of flowers that could hide a beehive she set them down so the giant blossoms blocked my view of the tv and made herself at home in mamas chair curling up like a cat before the mouse hole im sure youll forgive me for not coming to see you in the hospital jordy but the doctors said you needed your rest oh i did dont worry about it bob don was there practically around the clock her smile pasted on for the visit winced well dear were all just so relieved that youre okay i must admit that im a bit surprised to see clo still working here id heard you werent very happy with her oh i wasnt for a while but im less happy with you gretchen her smile stayed pasted on whatever do you mean i mean that ive given this some thought when i found out that greg had offered clo all that money to frame me i thought there must be some reason he really wanted to get me in trouble i wasnt suspicious that he was committing fraud until after he was dead so the land deal wasnt why he wanted me out and when i found out he and lorna had been lovers briefly i thought he considered me a potential rival but now i know that he was setting up lorna to take the blame for his scam so he wouldnt have cared about winning her and i dont think that a con artist would have easily parted with as much money as he gave clo just to get me out of the picture it just started me wondering who else might have paid cold cash to get me in such an embarrassing amount of trouble i wasnt sure that she was still breathing i dont know what any of this has to do with me jordy she tried to laugh and leaned over to rearrange the flowers youre the only person that came to mind gretchen the only one who would have had the money and the desire to see me humiliated with that sort of accusation of course being accused of being the bomber wouldnt have held up im sure truth would have won out in the end you got upset when billy ray mentioned in front of me that youd been seen having lunch with greg what did you tell him that for his land deal to work hed have to get me out of the picture thats not true but you mustve made him think so anyway he was a crook to the bone im sure once he knew what your goal was he probably suggested the plan of action maybe he even suggested planting the bomb makings im not sure id credit you with that much imagination she stood her frozen smile now thawed into a grimace obviously you suffered some sort of impairment to your reason after that blast how unfortunate so whyd you tell me about clo talking to greg when the plan didnt pan out because you figured at that point that she intended to keep the money and you wanted to cause more pain to me by exposing her of course with you blowing the whistle no one would expect that you were the troublemaker behind it all and with greg dead no one could rat on you this is ridiculous i dont have to come over and hear this abuse when i came to visit you on an errand of mercy she fumbled in her purse for her keys of course you have no proof of this no i dont gretchen i said softly but dont think you can ever hurt me again you cant so just give up this stupid war against me you ever ever try anything like this again and i will nail your ass to the wall you try to hurt me or anyone in my family or anyone i care about i will ruin you in this town utterly completely totally as long as we understand each other i think well be fine she toyed with one of the pillows on the couch and i thought shed like nothing better than to shove it over my face and watch me squirm for air for a while instead she patted my cast a little harder than necessary you take care jordy im sure youll be feeling much better about all this unpleasantness real soon her departure left me feeling more energized than i had in days i sat back and watched gary cooper keep the world safe for democracy i dozed for a bit then there was the clatter of footsteps and mild cursing on the stairs lorna coming down carrying a suitcase i hate goodbyes she tossed her bag on mamas chair and sat down next to me gently pushing my leg out of the way she examined my cast gingerly i didnt write enough i shouldve written more no i think youve written more than enough i couldnt see her scribbling from here but i knew what it said to jordanbe on your feet soon so you can chase me around all love lorna candace had seen it but not commented i figured the firestorm would erupt as soon as lornas plane left oh id planned on writing lots more like in letters and cards but im starting to think thats not a good idea she took my fingers interlacing them with hers why not because they have such a distance to them upclose communication is far preferable dont you think she was leaning her face close into mine her gray eyes as intoxicating as always i shook my head i think cards and letters and phone calls have a lot to recommend them its a good way for old friends to keep in touch she tugged at the bottom of my tshirt but were more than old friends arent we wont we be still no lorna we wont i hated having to say it to her but it was true id made my choices to stay in mirabeau and have a relationship with candace i couldnt choose otherwise she leaned back i knew you were going to say that she let go of my shirt just dont give me that line that a part of you will always love me its true though but i wont say it if you dont want me to no i dont she smoothed her pants legs with her palms not looking at me im sorry if ive hurt you what do you know about hurt you got enough painkillers here to numb king kong you aint feeling any hurt country boy her voice was teasing light i wondered if she was hiding behind mild flirting shielding herself from disappointment i reminded myself that was her problem not mine whatever you say lorna she looked at me then tears welling in her eyes i didnt have a handkerchief to offer her but she leaned down and kissed my forehead with sudden speed as though she were afraid id refuse i wouldnt have not for the world i better call junebug hes giving me a ride to the airport in austin i think hes got a hot date with that bomb sergeant hes warm for have a safe trip so much hung unsaid between us but that was the nature of broken relationships they werent concluded as neatly as business meetings now dont talk off junebugs ear the whole way there hes not used to that annoying boston accent of yours he might find it cute jordan the same way you did ill weave a spell on him with my wicked new england charm and before you know it ill be a mirabeau housewife mrs junebug moncrief i dont think the wiercinskis would be quite prepared for that she stood by her suitcase and picked it up goodbye lorna there was a range of emotions in my voice as it said those two words some i didnt care to identify i just kept thinking this is right for you both you know it this is me riding off into the sunset her voice sounded a little ragged i know ride careful now she picked up her suitcase and without a backward look walked outside a minute or so later i heard a car pull up doors slam junebugs drawl answering some tease of lornas and then the distant whine as the sedan pulled away i sat with my eyes closed i had cared for her i still cared for her in that i wanted her to be happy but i didnt want her for myself i knew what i wantedall the craziness all the aggravation all the passion clo would you bring the cordless in here please i need to make a call she brought it in fussing at me that id skipped the nap i needed every afternoon and surely wasnt going to get it by prattling on the phone all day she was still complaining as she went upstairs to check on mama i dialed the seven numbers slowly she and i hadnt talked much since id returned from the hospital apparently words had been exchanged in the ambulance between her and lorna that made each others company unbearable but we hadnt had a chance to fix what had gone wrong between us that didnt matter though what mattered was the loving pressure of her hand on mine as id faded in and out at the hospital the homemade peanutbutter fudge shed snuck into my room for me the gentle kiss of her lips on mine when she thought i was numbed entirely by the medications she agreed hesitatingly to come over when she arrived clo suddenly remembered shed promised to take mama over to eula maes for a visit we watched her bustle out candace sat down on the side of the couch brushing her heavy brown hair over her shoulder we made small talk about my broken leg my messy coffee table the merits of gary cooper as an actor as he mutely eliminated half the kaisers army on the screen if gary could perform heroic deeds maybe i could too deep breath candace yes her hand was buried in the bowl of popcorn but her eyes came back to me they looked like bits of blue heaven i took her other hand in mine interlocking my fingers with hers i love you kisses are better than painkillers for easing what ails you
