laurell k hamilton danse macabre book of the anita blake vampire hunter series to jonathan who comforts me while i weep who holds me close while i scream who understands why i rage because he knows how to weep understands that pleasure can come in a scream and has his own rage to battle they say opposites attract but not for me it was the middle of november i was supposed to be out jogging but instead i was sitting at my breakfast table talking about men sex werewolves vampires and that thing that most unmarried but sexually active women fear most of all a missed period veronica ronnie sims best friend and private detective sat across from me at my little fourseater breakfast table the table sat on a little raised alcove in a bay window i did breakfast most mornings looking at the view out onto the deck and the trees beyond today the view wasnt pretty because the inside of my head was too ugly to see it panic will do that to you youre sure you missed october you didnt just count wrong ronnie asked i shook my head and stared into my coffee cup im two weeks overdue she reached across the table and patted my hand two weeks you had me scared two weeks could be anything anita stress will throw you off that much and god knows youve had enough stress she squeezed my hand that last serial killer case was only about two weeks ago she squeezed my hand harder what i read in the paper and saw on the news was bad id stopped telling ronnie all my bad stuff years ago when my cases as a legal vampire executioner had gotten so much bloodier than her cases as a private eye now i was a federal marshal along with most of the other legal vamp hunters in the united states it meant that i had even more access to even more awful shit things that ronnie or any of my female friends didnt want to know about i didnt fault them id rather not have had that many nightmares in my own head no i didnt fault ronnie but it meant that i couldnt share some of the most awful stuff with her i was just glad wed made up a longstanding grumpiness in time to have her here for this particular disaster i was able to talk about the bad parts of my cases with some of the men in my life but i couldnt have shared the missed period with any of them it concerned one of them entirely too much she squeezed my hand hard and leaned back her gray eyes were all sympathy and apology she was still feeling guilty that shed let her issues about commitment and men rain all over our friendship shed had a brief disastrous marriage years before i met her shed come here today to cry on my shoulder about the fact that she was moving in with her boyfriend louie fane dr louis fane thank you very much he had his doctorate in biology and taught at washington university he also turned furry once a month and was a lieutenant of the local wererat rodere their word for pack if louie wasnt hiding what he was from his colleagues wed be going to the big party afterward she said he teaches peoples kids ronnie he cant afford to find out what theyd do if they found out he had lycanthropy college isnt kids its definitely grownup parents wont see it that way i said i looked at her and finally said are you changing the subject its only two weeks anita after one of the most violent cases youve ever had i wouldnt even lose sleep over it yeah but your period is erratic mines not ive never been two weeks late before she pushed a strand of blond hair back behind her ear the new haircut framed her face nicely but it didnt stay out of her eyes and she was always pushing it back never i shook my head and sipped coffee it was cold i got up and went to dump it in the sink whats the latest youve ever been she asked two days i think five once but i wasnt having sex with anyone so it wasnt scary i mean unless there was a star in the east i was safe just late i poured coffee from the french press which emptied it i was so going to need more coffee ronnie came to stand next to me while i put more hot water on the stove she leaned her butt against the cabinets and drank her coffee but she was watching me let me run this back at you youve never been two weeks late ever and youve never missed a whole month before not since this whole mess started when i was fourteen no i always envied you the regularasclockwork schedule she said i started dismantling the french press taking out the lid with its filter on a stick well the clock is broken right now shit she said softly you can say that again you need a pregnancy test she said no shit i dumped the grounds into the trash can and shook my head i cant go shopping for one tonight cant you make a quick stop on the way to jeanclaudes little tкteаtкte tonight its not like this is the main event jeanclaude master vampire of the city of st louis and my sweetie was throwing one of the biggest bashes of the year to welcome to town the first ever mostlyvampire dance company he was one of their patrons and when you spend that much money you apparently get to spend more to throw a party to celebrate that the money was helping the dance troupe earn rave reviews in their crosscountry tour there was going to be national and international media there tomorrow it was like a big deal and i as his main squeeze had to be on his arm smiling and dressed up but that was tomorrow tonights little gettogether was sort of a prelim to the main event without letting the media know a couple of the visiting masters of the city had snuck in early jeanclaude had called them friends master vampires did not call other master vampires friends allies partners but not friends yeah ronnie im riding in with micah and nathaniel even if i stop nathaniel will insist on going in whatever store with me or wondering why i dont let him go i dont want any of them to know until ive got the test and its yes or no maybe its just nerves stress and the test will say no then i wont have to tell anybody where are your two handsome housemates jogging i was supposed to go with them but i told them youd called and needed me to hold your hand about moving in with louie i did she said and sipped her coffee but suddenly me being nervous about sharing space with a man for the second time in my life doesnt seem like such a big deal louie is nothing like the asshole i married when i was young and stupid louie sees the real you ronnie hes not looking for some trophy wife he wants a partner i hope youre right i dont know much today but im sure louie wants a partner not a barbie doll she gave me a weak smile then frowned thanks but im supposed to be comforting you are you going to tell them i leaned my hands against the sink and looked at her through a curtain of my long dark hair it had gotten too long for my tastes but micah had made me a deal if i cut my hair hed cut his because he preferred his hair shorter too so my hair was fast approaching my waist for the first time since junior high and it was really beginning to get on my nerves of course today everything was getting on my nerves until i know for sure i dont want them to know even if its yes anita you dont have to tell them ill close up my agency for a few days well go away on a girls retreat and you can come back without a problem i pushed my hair back so i could see her clearly i think my face showed what i was thinking because she said what are you honestly saying that i dont tell any of them that i just go away for a while and make sure that theres no baby to worry about its your body she said yeah and i took my chances by having sex with this many men on a regular basis youre on the pill she said yeah and if id wanted to be a hundred percent safe id have still used condoms but i didnt if im pregnant then ill deal but not like that you cant mean youd keep it i shook my head im not even sure im pregnant but if i was i couldnt not tell the father im in a committed relationship with several of them im not married but we live together we share a life i couldnt just make this kind of choice without talking to them first she shook her head no man ever wants you to get an abortion if youre in a relationship they always want you barefoot and pregnant thats your mothers issues talking not yours or at least not mine she looked away wouldnt meet my eyes i can tell you what id do and it wouldnt involve telling louie i sighed and stared out the little window above the sink a lot of things to say went through my head none of them helpful i finally settled for well it isnt you and louie having this particular problem its me and and who she said who got you knocked up thanks for putting it that way i could ask whos the father but thats just creepy if you are then its this little tiny microscopic lump of cells its not a baby its not a person not yet i shook my head well agree to disagree on that one youre prochoice she said i nodded yep i am but i also believe that abortion is taking a life i agree women have the right to choose but i also think that its still taking a life thats like saying youre prochoice and prolife you cant be both im prochoice because ive never been a fourteenyearold incest victim pregnant by her father or a woman whos going to die if the pregnancy continues or a rape victim or even a teenager who made a mistake i want women to have choices but i also believe that its a life especially once its big enough to live outside the womb once a catholic always a catholic she said maybe but youd think being excommunicated wouldve cured me the pope had declared that all animators zombie raisers were excommunicated until they repented their evil ways and stopped doing it what his holiness didnt seem to grasp is that raising the dead was a psychic ability and if we didnt raise zombies for money on a regular basis wed eventually raise the dead by accident i had accidentally raised a deceased pet as a child and a suicidal teacher in college id always wondered if there had been others that never found me maybe some of the accidental zombies that occasionally show up are the result of someones psychic abilities gone wrong or untrained all i knew was that if the pope had ever woken up as a child with his dead dog curled up in bed with him hed want the power controlled or maybe he wouldnt maybe hed believe that it was evil and hed pray it into submission my prayers just didnt have that kind of punch to them you cant mean youd actually have this thing baby whatever i sighed i dont know but i do know that i could never just go away get an abortion and never tell my boyfriends never tell them that one of them might have made a child with me i just couldnt do it she was shaking her head so hard that her hair fell around her face covered the upper half of it she ran her hands through it sharply like she was pulling on it ive tried to understand that youre happy living with not one but two men ive tried to understand that you love that vampire son of a bitch somehow ive tried but if you actually breed actually have a baby i just dont get that i wont be able to understand that then dont then go if you cant deal then go i didnt mean that i just meant that i cant understand why you would complicate your life this way complicate yeah i guess thats one way of putting it she crossed her arms tight over her chest she was tall slender and leggy and blond everything id wanted to be as a child she was smallchested enough that she could fold her arms over her breasts instead of under them something i couldnt have done but her legs went on forever in a skirt and mine did not oh well okay then if youre going to tell them tell micah and nathaniel and get a test and test yourself i told you i dont want anyone to know until i know for sure she looked up at the ceiling closed her eyes and sighed anita you live with two of them you sleep over with two more of them you are never alone when are you going to have time to run in and get a test let alone have the privacy to use it i can pick one up at work on monday she stared at me monday its thursday id go fucking crazy if i had to wait that long youll go crazy you cant wait nearly four days maybe my period will start maybe by monday i wont need it anita you wouldnt have told me if you werent pretty sure you needed a pregnancy test when nathaniel and micah get back theyll jump in the shower well get dressed up and go straight to jeanclaudes there wont be time tonight friday promise me that friday youll get one ill try but besides when you start asking your lovers to use condoms wont they figure something out jesus i said yeah i heard you say if youd used condoms youd be safe dont tell me that youre not going to want to use them for a while could you really have unprotected sex right now and enjoy it i shook my head no then what are you going to tell the boys about this sudden need for condoms hell micah had a vasectomy before you even met him hes like supersafe i sighed again youre right damn it but you are so pick up the test on the way to the thing tonight no im not going to rain all over jeanclaudes meeting hes planned this for months you didnt mention it to me i didnt plan it he did the ballet isnt really my thing truthfully he hadnt mentioned it to me until they were coming to st louis but i kept that part to myself it would just give ronnie another reason to say that jeanclaude was keeping secrets from me hed finally admitted that the masters of the city all coming here had been something he hadnt planned at least not from the beginning hed just negotiated it so the vampire dancers could cross many different vamp territories without problems jeanclaude agreed the meet was a good idea but he was also nervous about it it would be the largest gathering of masters of the city in american history and you dont bring that many big fish together without worrying about shark attacks and how will mr fangface feel about being a father dont call him that sorry how will jeanclaude feel about being a daddy its probably not his she looked at me youre having sex with him a lot why isnt it his because hes more than four hundred years old and when vampires get that old they arent very fertile that goes for asher and damian too oh god she said id forgotten that you had sex with damian yeah i said she covered her eyes with her hands im sorry anita im sorry that its weirding me out that my uptight monogamous friend is suddenly sleeping with not one but three vampires i didnt plan it that way i know that she hugged me and i stayed stiff against her she wasnt being comforting enough for me to relax in her arms she hugged me tighter im sorry im sorry im being a jerk but if its not the vampires then who else but your houseboys i pulled away from her dont call them my houseboys they have names and just because i like living with someone and you dont dont make that my problem fine that leaves micah and nathaniel micah is fixed remember so it cant be him her eyes went wide that leaves nathaniel jesus anita nathaniel as the fathertobe a moment ago i might have agreed with her but now it pissed me off it wasnt her place to disparage my boyfriends whats wrong with nathaniel i said and my voice was not entirely happy she put her hands on her hips and gave me a look hes twenty and a stripper twentyyearold strippers are the entertainment at your bachelorette party you dont have babies with them i let the anger seep into my eyes nathaniel told me you didnt see him as real as a person i told him he was wrong i told him you were my friend and you wouldnt disrespect him like that i guess i was wrong she didnt back down or apologize she was angry and staying that way last time i checked nathaniel was supposed to be food just food not the love of your life i didnt say he was the love of my life and yeah he started out as my pomme de sang but that doesnt but she interrupted me your apple of blood right thats what pomme de sang means i nodded if you were a vampire youd be taking blood from your little stripper but thanks to that bloodsucking son of a bitch you have to feed off sex sex for gods sake first that bastard made you his blood whore and now youre just a she stopped abruptly a startled almostfrightened look on her face as if she knew shed gone too far i gave her a flat cold look the look that says my anger has moved from hot to cold its never a good sign go on ronnie say it i didnt mean it she whispered yeah i said you did now im just a whore my voice sounded as cold as my eyes felt too angry and too hurt to be anything but cold hot anger can feel good but the cold will protect you better she started to cry i just stared at her speechless what the hell was going on we were fighting she wasnt allowed to cry in the middle of it especially not when she was the one being a cruel bastard i could count on one hand the times id seen ronnie cry and still have fingers left over i was still angry but i was puzzled too and that took a little of the edge off shouldnt i be the one in tears here i asked because i couldnt think of what else to say i was mad at her and id be damned if i would comfort her right now she spoke in that breathless hiccuping voice that serious crying can give you im sorry oh god anita im sorry im just so jealous i raised my eyebrows at her what are you talking about jealous of what the men she said in that shivering uncertain voice it was like she was someone else for a moment or maybe this was just part of ronnie that she didnt let people see all the damned men im about to give up everybody everybody but louie and hes great but damn it ive had lovers i hit triple digits i wasnt sure that being able to number your lovers at over a hundred was a good thing but it was something that ronnie and i had agreed to disagree over a long time ago i did not say look whos the whore or other hurtful remarks i could have made i let all the cheap shots i could have made go she was the one crying and now im giving it all up all of it for just one man she leaned her hands against the cabinet as if she needed the support you said sex with louie was great i think youve used words like fantastic and mindblowing she nodded her hair spilling around her face so that i couldnt see her eyes for a moment it is he is but hes just one man what if i get bored or he gets bored with me how can just one be enough the last time we were both cheating a month after the wedding she looked up at that last remark her gray eyes wide and frightened i made a small helpless gesture and said youre asking the wrong person ronnie id planned on monogamy it seemed like a good idea to me thats exactly what i mean she wiped at the tears on her face in harsh angry motions as if the touch of them made her even more upset how is it that you my girlfriend who had only three men in her entire life ends up dating and fucking five men i didnt know what to say to that so i tried to concentrate on the hard facts six men i said she frowned at me her eyes taking on that look that meant she was counting in her head i only count five youre leaving someone out ronnie no and she started counting on her fingers jeanclaude asher damian nathaniel and micah thats it i shook my head again i had unprotected sex with one more man last month i could have said it differently but maybe if we got back to my personal disaster we could stop talking about ronnies penis envy she needed more therapy than i knew how to give lately she frowned harder then she got it oh no no she said i nodded happy to see from her expression that she got the full awfulness of it you just had sex with him once right i shook my head no over and over again not just once she was looking at me so hard that i couldnt hold her gaze even with the tear tracks drying on her face she was suddenly ronnie again ronnie had a good hard stare i couldnt meet it and was left looking at the cabinets how much more than not just once she asked i started to blush and couldnt stop it damn it youre blushing thats not a good sign she said i stared down at the countertop using my long hair to hide my face her voice was gentler when she said how many times anita how many times in the month youve been back together seven i said still not looking up i hated admitting it because the number alone said louder than any words just how much i enjoyed being in richards bed seven times in a month she said wow thats i looked up and the look was enough sorry sorry justshe looked as if she wasnt sure whether she was going to laugh or be sad about it she controlled herself and finally sounded sad when she said oh my god richard i nodded again richard she whispered his name and looked suitably horrified it was worth a little horror richard zeeman and i had been offagain onagain for years mostly off wed been engaged briefly until i saw him eat someone richard was the leader ulfric of the local werewolf pack he was also a junior high science teacher and an allaround boy scout if boy scouts were six foot one muscled amazingly handsome and had an amazing ability to be selfdestructive he hated being a monster and he hated me for being more comfortable with the monsters than he was he hated a lot of things but wed made up just enough to have fallen into bed in the last few weeks but as my grandma blake told me once was enough of all the men in my life the worst possible choice to be the father would be richard because he of all of them would try for the white picket fence and a normal life normal wasnt possible for me or him but i knew that and he didnt not really not yet even if i was pregnant even if i kept being pregnant i wasnt going to marry anyone i wasnt going to change my living arrangements my life worked the way it was and richards idea of domestic bliss was not mine ronnie gave an abrupt laugh then swallowed it i was glaring at her come on anita im allowed to be impressed that youve managed to have sex with him seven times in the space of a month i mean you dont even live together and youre having more sex than some of our married friends i kept giving her the look that makes bad guys run for cover but ronnie was my friend and its harder to impress your friends with the scary look they know you wont really hurt them the fight was dying under the weight of friendship and of my problem being more immediate than her years of issues unresolved ronnie touched my arm oh it wouldnt be richards youre having sex with nathaniel at least every other day sometimes twice a day i said she smiled well my mythen waved her hand as if to keep from distracting herself but the odds are that its nathaniels right i smiled at her you sound happy about that now she shrugged well a choice of evils ya know thanks a lot ronnie you know what i meant she said no i dont think i do i think i was ready to be angry about her thinking the men in my life were a choice of evils but i didnt get a chance to be angry because two of the men in my life were coming through the front door i heard them unlocking the door before it opened and their voices came raised and a little breathless from the run theyd been able to run faster and farther without me along i was after all still human and they were not standing between the island and the cabinets we couldnt see the door but only heard them laughing as they came toward the doorway to the kitchen how can you do that ronnie asked voice soft what i asked frowning you were smiling i looked at her you smiled just at the sound of their voices even with everything i stopped her with a hand on her arm one way i knew i didnt want them to find out about the maybebaby was by overhearing a conversation their hearing was a little too keen to risk it and here they came my two livein sweeties micah was in front looking back over his shoulder still laughing talking he was my height short slender and muscular in that swimmer sort of way he had to have his suits tailored because he needed an extrasmall athletic cut you didnt get that off the rack hed come to me tanned and stayed that way from jogging outside mostly shirtless all summer and autumn hed added a tshirt to the shortshorts today his hair was that deep rich brown that some people get after starting life as very blond his dark hair was tied back in a low ponytail that couldnt hide how curly it was almost as curly as mine hed taken off his sunglasses so when i moved into his arms i could look up into his chartreuse eyes yellowgreen leopard eyes in his delicate face a very bad man had once forced him to stay in leopard form until when he came back to human he couldnt come all the way back we kissed and our arms just seemed to automatically glide around each other to press our bodies as close together as we could with clothes on hed affected me this way almost from the moment we had seen each other lust at first sight they say it doesnt last but we were six months and counting i melted against his body and kissed him fiercely deeply partly it was what i always wanted to do when i saw him partly i was scared and touching and being touched made me feel better not long ago id have been more discreet in front of company but my nerves just werent good enough to pretend today he didnt get embarrassed or tell me not in front of ronnie the way richard would have done he kissed me back with the same drowning intensity his hands holding me like hed never let me go we drew back breathless and laughing was that for my benefit ronnie asked and her voice was not happy i turned around still half in micahs arms i looked at her angry eyes and suddenly was ready to be angry back not everything is about you ronnie are you telling me you kiss him like that every time he comes home the anger was back and she used it hes been gone what an hour ive seen you greet him after a days work and it was never like that like what i asked voice sliding down if she wanted to fight we could fight like he was air and you couldnt breathe him in fast enough micahs voice was mild placating trying to talk us both down did we interrupt something i turned to face ronnie squarely im allowed to kiss my boyfriend the way i want to kiss him without getting your permission ronnie dont try and tell me you werent rubbing my face in it just now with the show go get some therapy ronnie because i am fucking tired of your issues raining all over me i confided in you she said voice strangled with some emotion i didnt understand and you put on a show like that in front of me how could you oh that wasnt a show nathaniel said from just inside the doorway but if its a show you want we can do that too he glided into the kitchen on the balls of his feet showing both the grace of his dance training and that otherworldly grace of the wereleopard he pulled his tank top off in one smooth gesture and let it fall to the floor i actually backed up a step before i caught myself i hadnt realized until that moment that he was angry with ronnie what little cutting remarks had she been making to him that i hadnt heard when he told me she didnt see him as real hed been trying to tell me more than i had heard that id missed something big was there in his angry eyes he tore the tie from his ponytail and let his anklelength auburn hair fall around his nearly naked body the jogging shortshorts just didnt cover that much i had time to say nathaniel and he was in front of me that otherworldly energy that all lycanthropes could give off shivered off his skin and along my body he was fivesix just tall enough for me to have to look up to meet his eyes his anger had turned them from lavender to the deeper color of lilacs if flowers could burn with anger and force of personality nathaniel was in those eyes and with that one look he dared me challenged me to turn him down i didnt want to turn him down i wanted to wrap his body and that skincrawling energy around me like a coat lately almost any stress seemed to feed into sex scared sex would make me feel better angry sex would calm me sad sex would make me happy was i addicted to sex maybe but nathaniel wasnt offering actual sex he just wanted as much attention as id given micah seemed fair to me i closed the distance between us with my hands my mouth my body the energy of his beast spilled around us like being plunged into a warm bath that had a mild electric charge hed been one of the least of my leopards until a metaphysical accident had taken him from pomme de sang to my animal to call i was the first human servant to a vampire to gain the vampire ability to call an animal all leopards were mine to call but nathaniel was my special pet wed both gained from the magical bonding but hed gained more he lifted me up using just his hands on my thighs even through my jeans he made sure i knew he was happy to be pressed against my body so happy that it forced a small sound from me ronnies voice came harsh ugly like she was choking on her anger and when the baby comes are you going to fuck in front of it too nathaniel froze against me micahs voice came from behind us baby that one word fell into the room like a thunderbolt except that afterward the room was quiet so quiet that i could hear the blood pounding in my head nathaniels body was so still against mine that if i hadnt felt his pulse against my hand it would have been like he wasnt there i was afraid to move afraid to breathe it was like a moment before a gunfight when you know its going to happen that anything any movement will set it off and you dont want to be the one that makes that happen nathaniel looked down at me and the look was enough it broke the unnatural silence and sound spilled around us micah said did ronnie say baby yeah i said baby her voice was ugly with anger nathaniel let me slide to the floor his hands going to my shoulders his eyes were so serious that i had to fight to keep meeting them i did it though my eyes flinched as if the force of his questions were a light too bright to meet are you pregnant he asked voice soft im not sure i said and i gave ronnie the glare she deserved i was going to wait until i was sure before i told any of you guys but i had to tell someone i thought hey ill tell my best friend but i guess i was wrong the kiss with micah may not have been for my benefit ronnie said in that ugly voice that i didnt recognize as hers but your pet stripper and you that was for my benefit i turned so that i was facing her nathaniel at my back youre jealous of the men in my life yeah i get that now she opened her mouth closed it and said i guess thats fair i tell your secret you tell mine i shook my head me telling nathaniel and micah that you are jealous of how many men are in my bed that isnt the same as you telling them that i may be pregnant i had a mean idea so i said it but it might be close if i told louie that you were jealous of my boyfriends does he know that you can number your old lovers in triple digits yeah it was mean but shed earned it only family can fight as dirty as best friends she paled a little and that was enough to answer the question he doesnt know i said and made it a statement i think he deserves to know nathaniel said and again there was that tone in his anger that said it was more personal than it should have been between them id planned on telling him she said when he asked and he moved around me so that he was facing her i glanced at micah and he shook his head as if he didnt know what was going on either good to know we were both confused when youd moved in together married him or never were not getting married she said in a voice that was just a little desperate as if her fear was washing her anger away she rallied then you did that little show with anita to rub my face in the fact that im about to become monogamous youre always doing shit like that and how many times have you said oh its anitas little stripper or pet stripper or hows tricks or my personal favorite youre damned cute for a walking talking beefsteak or is that beefcake jesus nathaniel i looked at ronnie did you say all that to him the anger faded around the edges as she finally looked uncomfortable maybe but not like he makes it sound then why didnt you say it in front of me i asked if there was nothing wrong with saying it why not in front of me or me micah said i would have told you if shed been saying things like that to nathaniel why didnt you tell me nathaniel i asked he gave me his angry eyes i told you she didnt see me as real as a person but you didnt tell me what shed said i needed to know he shrugged shes your best friend and youd just made up after a big fight i didnt want to start another one i was just kidding around ronnie said but the tone in her voice said she didnt believe it either i looked at her how would you feel if i said stuff like that to louie you cant call him a stripper or an exprostitute because hes not the moment she said it her face showed me she knew she shouldnt have i didnt meanshe began but it wasnt me that put her in her place it was nathaniel i know why you call me names he said and he moved in closer not touching but invading the hell out of her personal space i see the way you watch me you want me but not like anita does you just want me for a night or a weekend or a month then youd be done like youre always done with everybody i know why you dont want to commit to louie id never seen him like this relentless i actually made a small move as if id stop him but micah caught my eye and shook his head his face was serious almost grim i guess he was right nathaniel had earned this and ronnie had too but it wasnt going to end anywhere i wanted to be he said again i know why you dont want to commit to louie she said in a small weak voice why because it torments you to know that you will never know how i am in bed oh she said in a voice that was almost her own so im not wanting louie because youre such a stud not me ronnie but the next me the next guy you get obsessed about not love obsessed but iwonderwhathedbelikeinbed obsessed and youve always been beautiful enough hot enough to get anyone youve ever wanted right she stared at him as if he were something horrible he prompted her right she nodded and whispered yes you knew anita wasnt fucking me so you thought if she didnt want me maybe it would be okay but i didnt pick up on any of it i ignored the hints so you started to get mean about it maybe you didnt even know why you were doing it he leaned in so close that she moved back until her butt hit the cabinet and she had nowhere else to go you kept belittling me in front of anita and worse behind her back as if youd convince her she didnt want to keep me that i wasnt good enough to keep real enough to keep have you ever set your sights on anyone and not fucked them at least once she gave a little trembling shake of her head she was biting her lower lip and tears gleamed unshed in her eyes then suddenly anita is going to keep me and you dont poach your friends guys that is a rule you thought i was just food and you could have me at least once suddenly im a boyfriend and its against your rules to try for me but you still wanted me just once just once to feel me inside you i called it then enough nathaniel enough my voice was shaky this had gotten so ugly so fast how had i missed it nathaniel moved back from her slowly and said i used to believe in women like you ronnie i used to think that anyone who wanted me that badly must love me at least a little he shook his head but people like you dont love anyone not even themselves nathaniel micah said as if hed been shocked by that one too nathaniel ignored him you need to find out what youre running from ronnie before it ruins the best thing youve ever found she spoke in a harsh whisper you mean louie he nodded yeah i mean louie he loves you he really truly loves you not just for a night or a month but for years part of you wants that or you wouldnt still be with him she swallowed hard enough that it sounded like it hurt im scared he nodded again what if you love him what if you give him your whole heart and then he dumps you the way you dumped so many others she gave that trembling nod of hers again yes you need help ronnie professional help i can recommend someone i knew nathaniel saw a therapist but id never heard him talk about it with anyone before not like this ive been with her for a few years shes good shes helped me a lot his face was gentler than it had been ronnie looked at him as if he were the snake and she were the helpless little bird he went to the corkboard above the phone there were business cards pinned to it important numbers notes he took one of the cards down he walked back over to ronnie and held it out to her if she cant take you shell know someone good who can ronnie took the card carefully just by the corner as if she were afraid it would bite she gave him wide frightened eyes but she put the card in her jeans pocket she let out a deep breath and turned to me im sorry anita im sorry about everything she looked at nathaniel then back at me and now im going to leave the mess behind and let you guys clean it up like ive always done i am sorry and she walked out we all waited until we heard the door close behind her the three of us stood for a few seconds in silence waiting for the shock waves to settle but of course there were other problems than just ronnies issues micah turned to me and said are we in a mess im not sure yet i said but you think youre pregnant he said i nodded i missed last month id planned on finding out for sure before i told anyone i sighed and crossed my arms under my breasts i havent bought a pregnancy test because i wasnt sure how to take it without one of you finding out nathaniel came to stand beside me but to one side so he wouldnt block my view of micah anita you shouldnt have to go through this alone at least one of us should be holding your hand while you wait for the little strip to turn colors i looked up at him you sound like youve done this before once she wasnt sure it was mine but i was the only friend she had to hold her hand i thought i was your first girlfriend she found out id never been with a girl so she took care of it his voice made it seem utterly matteroffact i wasnt very good at it but she came up pregnant it was probably one of her customers but it could have been mine customers micah made it a question she was in the game like i was then i knew the game meant shed been a prostitute but the game usually meant when he was on the street hed been off the street by sixteen how old were you i asked thirteen he said the look on my face made him laugh anita id never been with a girl but id seen a lot of men she thought i should know what its like to be with a girl she was my friend protected me sometimes when she could how old was she micah asked fifteen jesus i said he smiled that gentle almost condescending smile that always let me know what a sheltered life id led and she got pregnant micah said softly nathaniel nodded the odds were that it wasnt mine we had sex twice once so i could see if i liked it the second time so i could get better at it his face softened in a way id never seen before you loved her i said voice as gentle as i could make it he nodded my first crush what was her name micah asked jeanie her name was jeanie i almost didnt ask but it was the most hed ever talked about that part of his life so i asked what happened i held her hand while the test turned positive her pimp paid for an abortion i went with her me and another girl he shrugged and the soft light faded in his eyes she couldnt have kept it i knew that we all knew it he looked suddenly sad lost i wanted to take that lost look out of his eyes so i hugged him and he let me and he hugged me back what happened to jeanie micah asked he stiffened in my arms and i knew then it would not be a good answer she died she got into the wrong car one night and the date killed her i hugged him tighter i am so sorry nathaniel he hugged me one fierce tight hug then he moved back enough to see my face i was thirteen and she was fifteen we were street hookers we were both drug addicts there wasnt going to be a baby his eyes were so serious im twenty and youre twentyseven we both have good jobs money a house ive been clean for three almost four years i pulled back from him what are you saying im saying we have choices anita choices that i didnt have the last time my pulse was in my throat threatening to choke me even if i am and it took me two tries to say pregnant im not sure im keeping it you understand that right my chest was so tight i could barely breathe its your body he said i respect that im just saying that we have more than one way to go here thats all it has to be mostly your choice yes micah said youre the woman and like it or not the final choice has to be yours your body your choice nathaniel said but we need a pregnancy test we need to know were running late now i said you guys need to shower and we have to go to jeanclaudes place can you really just go to the cocktail party with this hanging over us nathaniel asked i have to he shook his head its fashionable to be late and once he knows why jeanclaude wont mind buti said hes right micah said or am i the only one that thinks i would go crazy smiling and nodding tonight and not knowing i hugged myself tighter but what if its positive what ifi couldnt even finish it then well deal with it micah said whatever happens anita it will be okay i promise nathaniel said it was my turn to look into his face and realize how young he was we were only seven years apart in age but they could be an important seven years he promised it would be all right but some promises you cant keep no matter how hard you try that tight feeling climbed up my throat and spilled out my eyes i started to cry and couldnt stop it nathaniel wrapped his arms around me held me against his body and a moment later micah moved in behind me they both held me while i cried my fear and confusion and anger at myself selfloathing didnt even begin to cover it when the crying slowed and i could breathe without hiccuping nathaniel said ill go out and get the test micah can shower while im gone i should be back in time to clean up and well only be a little late i pushed myself away enough to see his face but what if its a yes i mean how can i go to the party if its a yes micah leaned over my shoulder putting his face next to mine you dont want to know he said because youll find it easier to pretend tonight if you dont know i nodded my cheek sliding against his ill get the test nathaniel said and well use it later tonight after the party but we are getting one or two to take with us for someone who was supposed to be a submissive his voice held no compromise it was simple fact what if someone finds it in our stuff i asked anita youre going to have to tell jeanclaude and asher sometime nathaniel said only if its positive i said he gave me a look but nodded okay only if its positive positive it seemed like such the wrong word if i was pregnant it was definitely a negative a really big scary negative an hour and a half later we were parked in the employee lot behind the circus of the damned nathaniel had helped me with my eye shadow he could blend about a dozen different colors and make it look like i wasnt wearing anything yet make my eyes look amazing he did his own eyes for the stage so he had the practice my dress was actually a skirt outfit black stiff material so that the gun in its holster at the small of my back didnt show through the dark cloth nor did the knife in its spine sheath my hair hid the hilt id left my cross in the glove compartment because the chances of no one accidentally using vamp powers on me tonight were between zero and nothing yeah they were our friends but they were still masters of the city and i was the executioner someone wouldnt be able to resist trying me out just a little like someone who shakes your hand too hard but this handshake could make the cross burn against my skin i did not want another crossshaped burn scar both the men were in italiancut suits tailored to their bodies nathaniel was in black with a lavender shirt shades paler than his eyes his tie was rich purple silk hed braided his hair so that it gave the illusion that his hair was short until you saw the braid waving around his ankles his black leather shoes gleamed the cuffed pants long enough to hide the fact that he wore no socks micah was in charcoal gray with a thin black pinstripe his shirt was a green with yellow undertones almost the same shade as his eyes depending on how the light hit the shirt it brought out either the green or the yellow of his eyes so that the color of his eyes changed with almost every breath it was a nice effect i was wearing jogging shoes but there was a pair of fourinch black heels in the overnight bag fourinch spikes with open heels and laces that wrapped around my ankles when jeanclaude couldnt persuade me into a skimpier outfit for the night wed compromised with the totally impractical shoes though strangely they werent uncomfortable they looked like they should have been but they werent either that or i was getting better at walking in high heels jeanclaudes fault id put the shoes on when we reached the bottom of the stairs before we saw our guests i had a key to the new back door of the circus of the damned no more waiting around for someone to let us inside yea id actually turned the key and felt the lock click over when the door started opening inward security was pretty good at the circus of late since wed made a deal with the local wererats but it wasnt a wererat that opened the door it was a werewolf graham was tall enough and muscular enough to make it impossible to move through the door without brushing him he stood for a moment looking down at me at us i guess though it felt more personal than that his perfectly straight black hair managed to fall decoratively over his brown eyes and still be very very short on the bottom so the strong line of his neck was left bare and strangely tempting his eyes tilted up at the edges and i now knew that he had his japanese mothers eyes and hair but the rest of him seemed to have been copied from his exnavy and very nordiclooking father graham was the only one of the lycanthropes id ever known to have his parents visit his place of work since his usual job was security at guilty pleasures a vampire and furry strip club that had been an interesting night i thought for a moment graham would stay in the doorway and make me push past him i think for a moment so did he i was almost sure he would have moved given us room but micah stepped up just a little in front of me give us some room graham he didnt say it mean or even call any of that otherworldly energy he even made it a little bit of a request but grahams face darkened just the same i watched graham think about it think about not moving he was already dressed in what all the security would be wearing tonight black slacks black tshirt though the shirt should probably have been a size larger the one he was wearing looked like it was having trouble holding on as if one flex too many and it would shred micah looked fragile beside him micah let down some of his careful control he let just a whisper of the power that lived inside him breathe through the night my skin shivered with it his voice came lower deeper an edge of growl to it we are nimirraj and nimirra and you are not move i am wolf and not leopard you have no authority over me he actually tensed as if he were bracing for the fight id had enough but i have authority over you graham i said his eyes did not move from micah as if i werent a threat there were so many reasons graham had not made the leap from bodyguard to breakfast snack for me his ignoring me pissed me off and the first thread of anger brought my own version of the beast that warm prickling thread of power breathed over my skin and danced around the men around me i was not a true shapeshifter because i couldnt shift but i carried four different strains of lycanthropy in my bloodstream if you catch one type of lycanthropy it protects you from any other strain you cant carry more than one disease at a time but i did a medical impossibility but blood tests dont lie i carried wolf leopard lion and one mystery strain that the doctors couldnt identify running through my veins that and some metaphysical impossibilities meant i had power to call power to use up to a point nathaniel rubbed his arms and said easy anita he was right because i couldnt shift it was possible to call the beast but impossible to finish the call so it was like having a seizure not pleasant and id ruin the dress but i was tired of graham tired of him in so many ways the energy had made him look at me and for the first time i saw him remember that i was something besides a piece of ass he wanted and hadnt had yet i am the lupa of your pack graham until richard picks another mate i stepped up and micah moved back so i could do it i kept moving pushing my power into that tall muscular body so that it was graham who moved out of my way but i will always be bolverk of the thronnos rokke clan graham i will always be the doer of evil deeds for your ulfric your wolf king i am the executioner of bad little werewolves who dont remember their place i think youve forgotten that id backed him up among the boxes in the storeroom his head actually hit the lone light that hung from the ceiling the light swung and filled the room with shadows and darkness i could feel that part of me that had begun life as richards beast but now somehow was mine pacing just below the surface of my mind it was as if my body were a cage in the zoo and my beast paced the narrow confines of its prison paced and did not like it trapped so trapped and so wanting to break free i staggered micah and nathaniel caught me before graham could reach me micah growled dont touch her nathaniel said shes called wolf if another wolf touches her right now it will make it harder to control i clung to them my two cats i put my face against the warmth of micahs neck and drew in a deep breath of his scent but underneath the warm scent of him the sweetness of his cologne was the nosewrinkling musk of leopard it helped chase back the wolf helped me fight free before things got out of hand graham dropped to his knees head bowed forgive me lupa i forgot myself size doesnt make you dominant graham power does you are submissive to me in our pack you are always submissive to micah because he is the leader of another people that has a treaty with the wolves you will treat him accordingly or it will not be as lupa that i talk to you next but as bolverk he looked up startled as if he hadnt expected me to say that last hed been playing and id upped the stakes so high he didnt like the game anymore maybe if i hadnt been so tense about the maybebaby i wouldnt have invoked bolverk or maybe i was just tired of graham once nathaniel moved from pomme de sang to my animal to call then id needed a new pomme de sang as my animal to call he was bound metaphysically too close to be just food jeanclaude and some of the other vamps had put their heads together and finally realized that there was a reason that an animal to call human servant and pomme de sang are three separate jobs the first two are so closely bound to you metaphysically that though they can feed you its a little like eating your own arm you can do it but it has a price it fills your belly but it also takes energy from other places it was actually elinore one of the vamps we invited in from england to join our vampire kiss who figured out why i was having to feed so often from all my men because almost all the men i was feeding the ardeur from were bound to me metaphysically jeanclaude as my master richard as my ulfric and jeanclaudes animal to call we were a triumvirate of power but we needed fuel from outside that triumvirate sometimes id accidentally made another triumvirate of power with nathaniel as my animal to call and damian as my vampire servant another impossibility and again they werent a complete meal so no matter how much i fed off any of them i just didnt stay filled up asher jeanclaudes secondincommand and our sweetie was a full meal requiem would probably have been a full meal if id allowed myself to have fullblown intercourse with him byron had been emergency food and frankly just wasnt enough my type to be a permanent part of my bedroom he enjoyed sex with me but he liked boys better i dont mind not being someones main squeeze but being the wrong sex that just made my head hurt jason jeanclaudes pomme de sang was great but he couldnt feed both me and jeanclaude every day i needed to find someone else to fill the spot or maybe a couple of someones until i got more control of the ardeur graham had been one of the local men that jeanclaude had encouraged me to interview as my new pomme de sang jeanclaude thought that if id interview them a little more intimately id have a new pomme by now hed called me stubborn asher had called me foolish to refuse to sample such bounty maybe it was foolish i hadnt told ronnie that all the men in my life had given me a short list of other men to try out shed have freaked even worse than she already had because if louie had been that generous with her shed have been a happy camper but ronnie wasnt me and what might have made her happy just seemed to confuse me of all the men who had come to my bed to sleep and cuddle graham had been the most pushy hed made it clear he wanted more from me than i wanted to give of course if i hadnt been so stubborn hed be in the running for wouldbe daddy the thought made me cold down to my toes lets hear it for not fucking everyone who bunks over i beg forgiveness lupa his face still showed the shock of hearing me invoke bolverk but the words were not begging words not really to beg forgiveness among the wolves meant only one thing something closer and more intimate than i wanted from graham but if i refused the gesture then it would be a breach between us one that could grow and eventually harm richards pack shit then beg graham my words didnt come out uncomfortable they came out angry anger was always my shield i was trying to learn other things to hide behind but anger was still my tried and true and for that moment it worked he stood and standing he towered over me so broad so muscled so big but there was fear in his face finally he believed that i might if he pissed me off enough hurt him that i might have the right to hurt him it was not a bad thing to see fear on his face he was overdue for it wed tried being nice micah nathaniel and me but some people wont take nice treatment if a person wont take nice there are always alternatives he could have used the submissive gesture to take me in his arms but he did it the way it had been shown to me he touched my face lightly with his fingers just enough to steady himself if wed been in public he would have laid a very light kiss against my lips but we werent in public so it got to be more interesting he leaned over me and the prelude was too like a kiss for my comfort it made me want to back up but i was dominant to him a dominant does not back away from a submissive no matter how much bigger he is its not about size and strength its about whos tougher and no matter how big he was graham was not the toughest person in the room not even close he bent down and down his mouth hovering over mine so that i could feel his breath warm against my lips i think even at the last second he thought about stealing the kiss id never allowed him but he thought better of it he did what he was supposed to do though frankly the kiss would have been less embarrassing in some ways at least he was supposed to lick across my lower lip it was a version of the gesture a submissive wolf uses toward a dominant its based on the foodbegging behavior of wolf pups but saying all that didnt change the fact that his fingers were gentle against my face and his breath was warm against my mouth the tip of his tongue touched my lip and slid across it wet gliding sensual wetter than the first real kiss should be wet as if id taken a drink of wine and spilled just a little across my lower lip just enough so that i had to lick across my lip in an echo of what he had just done to me as if i were drinking down the touch of his mouth he shivered his breath trembling on the air that was nice it was supposed to be you begging the forgiveness of your packs lupa i said but my voice was a little shaky and not nearly firm enough he gave a quick smile the one that ruined the hiptoughguy image and made him look his age graham had yet to see twentyfive i do ask forgiveness but its still the most youve ever let me touch you i shook my head and pushed past him micah and nathaniel followed me nathaniel was carrying the overnight bag that held among other things the pregnancy tests i knew when he came out of the store with them why id put off buying them it made the whole problem more real stupid but it did youve slept in the same bed with me graham i called back over my shoulder as i headed for the big door that led underground sleepings not what i want he said i stopped at the door and just turned and stared at him the other men moved to either side to let me see him better graham looked at me his eyes peeking through the silky fringe of his overly long bangs it always made me think of an animal peering at me through the grass the upper layer hadnt been this long when i met him i do not need your shit tonight graham why are you always mad at me i am not always mad at you graham if youre not mad at me then why dont you like me better i dont dislike you graham i just dont want to fuck you im allowed not to fuck you even though you want to fuck me dont fuck me then just feed the ardeur off me feed it the way you fed off nathaniel for months without intercourse i shook my head i dont want to introduce the passion of the ardeur to someone im not keeping its cruel the ardeur is the greatest orgasmic experience that any of the vampire lines can give to a mortal grahams face was full of such eagerness his hands reaching out to the air as if he could draw the ardeur out of it and hug it to him i just want to know what it feels like the real deal not the little tastes ive had by accident why is that wrong anita why is it wrong to want that shes afraid youll become addicted micah said voice soft graham shook his head ive never been addicted to anything in my life lucky you nathaniel said please anita dont go to strangers to feed the ardeur dont go to strangers when there are people right here who would do almost anything to feed your need i made an exasperated sound almost a scream of frustration and went for the door i opened it and we headed down the stone steps that led down down to the actual home of the master of the city the steps were too wide too something as if theyd been carved for something that didnt walk on two feet the stairs were always awkward which was why i was still in jogging shoes micah took my hand anyway and i let him if it looked to graham like i was needing help down the stairs fuck him or rather dont i needed the comfort of touch tonight nathaniel stayed on my other side but didnt try to take my right hand in his id need that hand for the gun or the blade yeah these vamps were supposed to be jeanclaudes friends but they werent my friends not yet we were at the landing just before the stairs took a turn it was a blind turn but if you hugged the far wall you didnt stay blind for long wait graham said please wait i should go first we all turned and watched him walk the few steps down to us he gave a smile that was almost nervous i am the bodyguard remember i looked him up and down and said are you carrying he sighed no richard says were dangerous enough without guns i shook my head not if everyone else has them graham silver bullets dont let you get close he shrugged those massive shoulders richard is ulfric if you want to change policy take it up with him im just doing what im told i sighed i loved richard really i did but we had some serious differences of opinion graham eased past us but stopped on the step below the landing he looked up but not like he was happy i was hoping that jeanclaude would have joined us by now i gave him a look what do you mean joined us jeanclaude is waiting downstairs with our guests right he shook his head there was an emergency upstairs asher is managing the circus he should be able to take care of any emergencies graham licked his lips i dont know the details because i was left down here to wait for you but meng die did something something that made asher call for jeanclaude to help him meng die was a petite chinese doll or thats what she looked like but she like me didnt really match the packaging shed been the secondincommand in san francisco before jeanclaude called in all the vamps hed made in this country to help bolster his defenses her master had been happy to let her go because shed been nights away from a palace revolt that would have left him dead and her in charge in fact he wouldnt take her back though jeanclaude had offered meng die wanted to be jeanclaudes secondincommand but that was ashers job then all the vamps had come from london after their master went crazy and had to be killed suddenly meng die was just another master vampire in a kiss that was lousy with master vamps she was powerful enough to be third or maybe even second but temperamentally she wasnt suited to be that close to any throne too dangerous too ambitious what the hell did she do now i asked graham shrugged i dont know i thought you were almost her pomme de sang nathaniel said i was he said you dont seem too worried about her he shrugged those big shoulders she keeps promising to make me or clay her pomme de sang but she never makes the decision she was still fucking requiem too until he started turning her down requiem isnt sharing meng dies bed anymore i asked no i frowned did he find a new girlfriend graham licked his lips again sort of i know that look graham thats your ihavemorebadnewsandidontwanttotellit look spill it all of it he sighed again damn it if youre not my girlfriend you shouldnt be able to read me that easily it was my turn to shrug just tell me requiem thinks that the reason youve turned him down as your new pomme de sang is because he was fucking meng die he said youre not a woman who shares your men i didnt know whether to scream or curse or laugh did he tell meng die that i asked i dont know he told me he told clay did you tell meng die i asked he shook his head i am not that stupid she takes bad news a hell of a lot worse than you do is clay that stupid i asked requiem told her micah said voice soft we all looked at him you know that i asked he shook his head but it would be something he would do not to cause trouble but to be honest with her i thought about it then had to agree damn he would i wonder if he told her recently did you turn her down nathaniel asked graham he gave the quick grin again no she may not hold the ardeur but the sex is still amazing ive done vamps before but never belle mortes bloodline if meng die is an example of what they have to offer in bed then my new goal in life is to be one of their pommes de sang i thought you wanted to be anitas pomme nathaniel said graham looked a little startled as if hed said more than hed meant to say if anita would feed the ardeur off me just once i might never look at another woman but until she doeshe let the sentence fade but it summed up why graham was not a strong contender for me he didnt really want me he wanted the ardeur if any of the other female vamps from london had held the ardeur hed have chased them instead of me or as well as me not very flattering to him or to me until i do youre keeping your options open i said he shrugged i gave all my options up for meng die and she kept clay and requiem on her string i shared her with clay in a way ive never shared anyone he looked sad for a moment then it passed i wasnt sure if it passed because his sorrow was that shallow or he had pushed it away anita isnt going to give up all of you guys for me why should i give up everyone else just for a chance to be in her bed i mean just for a chance not even the certainty of it i didnt ask requiem to sacrifice his libido to me you never ask anyone to give up other people for you but if they dont you dont sleep with them graham said and that was a little closer to the truth than i wanted to hear i hadnt asked requiem to give up meng die but the fact that he was fucking her had been a point against him why one because i simply did not like her two graham was right i didnt share my men not with other women the fact that i then expected them to share me with about half a dozen other men well not fair not fair at all the stairs ended in a small room with a door at the other end of it the door was heavy wood and metal like the door to a dungeon and in front of that door stood clay werewolf and bodyguard he came toward us hurrying which wasnt good the look on his face wasnt good either he looked worried graham was all business the mantle of bodyguardness sliding over him so that that was all that was left when he actually concentrated on business instead of trying to get into my pants he was one of the best of the wolves for bodyguard duty whats wrong he asked clay shook his head jeanclaude isnt with you his tone of voice made it half question no graham said whats wrong i asked thinking maybe if we kept asking the question hed answer it nothing he looked at me and smiled an apology nothing except that weve got a room full of guests and no hosts its just me and the four other bodyguards in the room we arent even allowed to offer refreshments without one of the dominants being present are you this worried because you think were being bad hosts micah asked clay seemed to think about it then nodded he did that apologetic smile again yeah i guess i am clay was as tall as graham but his hair was blond curly and careless where graham took time and attention with his appearance clay just didnt seem to care he wasnt sloppy just comfortable he was wearing the same blackonblack outfit but hed put black jogging shoes with his slacks not dress shoes he looked good but a little uncomfortable out of his jeans i sympathized stupid he said but yeah i think the evening is starting off badly i mean jeanclaude gets a message and has to run out the two masters of the city are all right so far but the two women are sniping at each other the muscle or food or whatever they are just stands around looking grim or poutyseductive it has the feel of something that could go south if we dont have someone to help keep it friendly i took that last seriously clay worked security at guilty pleasures and he was good at spotting trouble before it got started it made him invaluable at the club exactly what did meng die do to make asher send for jeanclaude tonight of all nights i asked he sighed im not a hundred percent sure but it had to be bad or asher wouldnt have called him away from the other masters i could have opened the vampire marks between us and found out what jeanclaude was doing but hed warned me against doing that with new vamps in town one we were trying to hide some of my powers under the proverbial basket two jeanclaude wasnt a hundred percent certain that some of the masters of the city might not be able to listen in to such communications his phrase such communications so unless it was a true emergency no mindtomind communication until everyone left town did he need my help no not against meng die she was mean and powerful but not that powerful i also trusted her to be smarter than to start shit bad enough that the only penalty would be death she was like most of the old vamps a survivor at heart micah was looking at me almost like hed followed my line of reasoning out loud he said jeanclaude and asher can handle it you didnt read my mind i said he smiled that smile that made him seem so gentle i read your face great he raised his eyebrows and shrugged as if sorry nathaniel said how can both of you still be wanting to be meng dies pomme shes not dependable graham laughed a loud abrupt sound that almost startled dependable i dont want to be her pomme because shes dependable i want to be her pomme because we are fucking amazing together clay shrugged i love her at least i thought i did you dont sound very sure nathaniel said jeanclaude made us both bunk over with you and anita a couple of times mengdie was upset but not that upset i thought it was because she knew that wed be back that i cared about her enough not to be lured away then requiem turned her down because he thought that was why anita wouldnt take him as her next pomme de sang clays face showed something close to pain she went ballistic jeanclaude rips us out of her bed forces us to sleep with you and shes cool about it losing requiem bothered her more than losing us i watched the look in his pale eyes that had hurt him he really did care for her damn some women especially of belle mortes line seem to take rejection really badly you guys had no choice jeanclaude said bunk over and you had to do it requiem chose to leave her that cuts a certain type of woman or man real deep clay put those puzzled painfilled eyes on me you mean it hurt her pride i nodded trust me most master vamps have more than their share he shook his head i know youre trying to make me feel better anita but what youve just said is that her hurt pride means more to her than whatever she feels for me thanks for trying to make me feel better but i failed miserably i said he actually touched me voluntarily rare for clay lately he squeezed my shoulder very guy yeah you really suck at this whole comfort thing but thanks he had never been very handsy but after he bunked over and felt the ardeur rise in the bed hed touched me only when he absolutely had to i think he was afraid to touch me the hints of the ardeur made graham chase me harder the same kind of hints scared clay one mans heaven another mans hell we should introduce ourselves to our guests micah said and you need to change shoes i sighed so were on our own for this little cocktail party i knelt down careful of my hose on the stone floor and took off the jogging shoes im afraid so clay said great just great i stood up and let nathaniel slip the first high heel on then micah balanced me while nathaniel did the other shoe fourinch heels what had i been thinking i never did like cocktail party talk but that wasnt the problem this time i could fake small talk if i had to the problem was that the two masters in the other room had brought along candidates to be my new pomme de sang it was my own damn fault i hadnt chosen from any of the local talent i had also expressed concern about bringing this many masters of the city into our territory it just didnt sound safe to me so elinore one of our new british vamps had an idea a wonderfully awful idea since masters of the city were coming from all over the united states why didnt we have a sort of contest the masters could bring some candidates for my new pomme de sang id said no in fact id said hell no but jeanclaude had pointed out that i could simply turn them all down that the chances of my finding someone i liked well enough to keep were slim he had a point and elinore was right it was a way to get all the masters to behave themselves while they were visiting us i mean if youre looking at what amounts to your new inlaws you mind your manners i couldnt argue with the reasoning but it meant that i felt like a piece of prize beef or would that be cheesecake why was i such a prize because i was jeanclaudes human servant and he was the first american master to become his own sourdre de sang fountain of blood basically hed hit the power curve where he was his own bloodline it was rare very rare for any master vamp to hit that level of power and he was our first in this country it was a very big deal we hadnt advertised the fact but the vampire high council over in europe knew it and apparently they hadnt kept it entirely secret wed gotten a lot of overtures of friendship in the last few weeks all right wed gotten a lot of people trying to align themselves with us not the same thing as friendship actually but better than the alternatives but when i agreed to all of it i had never dreamt that id be doing the first introductions without jeanclaude on my arm shit micah took my arm in his its going to be fine nathaniel hugged me well help you be charming im just not the cinderella type i said but youre not cinderella anita youre the prince youre prince charming i stared into nathaniels lavender eyes and felt the first cold hand of fear in my stomach me prince charming there had to be some mistake though i guess if you have to choose between being the woman who is trying to catch the princes eye or the prince who doesnt want to be caught prince is better or at least thats what i told myself as clay led us through the door and the drapes that formed the walls of the living room i let micah and nathaniel each take an arm yeah i couldnt get to my weapons fast but what was waiting for me in the next room wasnt a problem that guns and knives could solve it was a problem that only diplomacy witty banter and sly seduction could maneuver us through we were so screwed without jeanclaude and asher the room was all gold and white and silver from the drapes to the couch the love seat and the two chairs framing the empty white brick of the fireplace it looked denuded without the picture of jeanclaude asher and their lost love julianna a picture painted about five hundred years before i was born yeah the wall looked bare but the room didnt the room seemed positively drowning in vamps and shapeshifters i really did not want to play hostess without jeanclaude really really didnt stepping into the room i gave them the smile id learned at work for clients the smile that was bright and shiny and only reached my eyes if i pushed hard i pushed hard but my hands were literally clutching at micah and nathaniel as if they were the last pieces of wood in the ocean i finally realized that i was scared scared of what polite banter cocktail party talk surely not i mean no one here was going to try to kill me usually if no one tried to kill me or i didnt have to kill anyone else it was a good night so why the major case of nerves micah was introducing us while i tried to get a handle on this sudden outbreak of rabid shyness it wasnt like me i didnt like small talk and parties with strangers but i wasnt shy clay and graham took up their posts at our backs there were more of our guards scattered around the room but none of them could help us with the part that was scaring me micah leaned in and whispered anita i did the long blink the one that means im thinking really hard and trying not to show it you have to know what it is to spot it honest welcome to st louis and i hope our hospitality will be better from this moment on there that wasnt horrible point for me one of the vamps came forward smiling he wasnt much taller than me but broad enough through the shoulders that he looked almost misshapen the way some short bodybuilders do in suits we are all masters of the city here ms blake we all know that some business cannot wait for niceties he just stood there waiting smiling pleasant it was my turn to prove that we werent country bumpkins to prove that we did indeed know the niceties i got myself loose from micah and nathaniel i stood on my own two feet and offered him my hand welcome augustine master of the city of chicago jeanclaude had described everyone to me so at least i was pretty sure who i was talking to that was all i was sure about most master vamps tried to be scary or mysterious or sexy this one smiled wide enough to flash fangs and said auggie my friends call me auggie his hair was short blond but still had lots of small stylized curls to it the haircut didnt match the suit and the approach he took my offered hand gently in his as if i were too delicate to touch some muscular men do that usually it bugged me but tonight i was okay with it he turned my hand over and began to raise my wrist to his mouth i did not raise my own arm you end up hitting people in the face when you do that id been practicing with jeanclaude and asher my hand had to sit passive in his as he raised my wrist toward his mouth he was a master of the city and i was just a human servant if jeanclaude had been here it would have been auggie offering up his wrist but i was officially outranked so i got to offer up he bowed over my wrist and raised his eyes to me at the same time his eyes were a gray so dark they were almost black but they were just eyes and i could meet them most masters arent used to humans doing that auggies eyes widened at it and i think my smile slipped from welcoming to just a little bit arrogant that i could meet his eyes with impunity made me feel better more myself his lips curled into a close secretive smile not at all the wide grin hed greeted me with he laid his lips against my wrist where the blood runs shallow below the skin even then it was just lips on skin then he kissed my wrist and a little jolt of power went through my body it tightened things low and intimate in my body tightened them so quick and hard that it caught my breath and made me stumble i felt movement at my back but i shook my head my voice was breathy but i said no im all right its okay i felt rather than saw everyone pull back i had eyes only for the vampire still hovering over my wrist i didnt pull away from him i looked into his eyes until i saw that they were like the sky when it goes black just before it falls down and destroys everything you own but i wasnt just a human servant gaining all my power through my ties to jeanclaude id come to him with partial immunity to vampire gaze and what i did next was my power my magic necromancy i put a little bit of power down my hand into his skin like youd push someone away whod invaded your space i told him metaphysically back off he pulled his hand away dropped that strange gray gaze his breath came out in a sharp sound i apologize if my little push of power caused you discomfort but i am trying to behave myself ms blake forcing me to show more of my power might not be wise he raised his face as he finished gave me a glimpse of a face that was no longer boyishly handsome or cute in an ordinary sort of way now his face was simply beautiful the bone structure more delicate than it had looked a moment ago the eyes were rimmed with a lace of dark lashes if i hadnt spent the last few years staring into jeanclaudes lashes id have said they were the prettiest eyelashes id ever seen on a man only the color of his eyes remained unchanged that extraordinary charcoal gray with its shades of black i stepped back enough to look him up and down his body was the same and not he was still short for a man but the suit fit him better id gone suit shopping with enough men to know expensive when i saw it it had been made for his body and when a short man lifts enough weights to get an upper body that broad it needs to be made to fit but the suit looked good now sleek and stylish rather than fitting oddly hed been using mind games to appear less beautiful and more ordinary all id meant to do was stop him from doing what amounted to metaphysical foreplay what id done instead was strip him of his camouflage i shook my head ive seen vamps waste energy to make themselves scarier but never to appear ordinary yes a womans voice said why would you hide so much of yourself augustine i looked at the woman who went with the voice she sat on the white love seat tucked in very close to the only other vamp in the room who made my skin tighten when i met his eyes the man was darkhaired darkeyed and handsome in an ordinary sort of way after looking into augustines face it wasnt really fair to compare but i knew who he had to be welcome samuel master of the city of cape cod as jeanclaudes human servant i welcome you and yours to st louis he stood and he hadnt had to he could have made me come to him his hair was a dark dark brunette almost black but id spent too many years staring at my own hair to mistake it for true black the careless fall of short curls reminded me of clays hair cut well but not fussed with he was taller than nathaniel but not by much maybe fiveseven tops he looked neat and trim wellbuilt but not obviously muscular in a simple black suit he wore a nice green tshirt underneath it if jeanclaude had dressed him it would have been silk and closer fitting the tshirt like the suit hinted but hid more than it showed a thin gold chain graced the neck of the shirt on the end of the chain was a very old coin set in more gold the coin was one of those ancient pieces they find in shipwrecks sometimes or maybe the shipwreck imagery came because i knew what his animal to call was mermaids no really mermaids samuel was unique among nowliving vamps in his animal to call his wife was one the man and woman standing behind the love seat had to be merpeople too id never actually met any of the sea people before i fought the urge to look away from the vampire in front of me i mean id seen vamps but mermaids that was new i offered samuel my hand he took it more solidly than auggie had like hed shake hands well then he raised my wrist to his mouth like auggie he rolled his eyes up to gaze at me as he did it samuels eyes were hazel pale brown with an edge of grayish green around the pupil the green shirt brought out more of the green so his eyes were almost an olive green but they were definitely hazel not true green but then i had high standards for truegreen eyes samuels eyes were just eyes and when he laid a chaste kiss across my wrist it was just a kiss no extras i rewarded his restraint with a smile ah samuel always the gentleman auggie said something you could learn from said the woman in white who had to be samuels wife thea thea samuel said a slight warning in his tone but it was very slight jeanclaude had warned us all that samuels only weakness was his wife she got her way most of the time so when dealing with the master of cape cod you had to negotiate with both of them no shes right auggie said you were always a better gentleman than i perhaps samuel said but one does not have to say such things out loud there was an edge of heat in his voice the first stirrings of anger she bowed a body that was inches taller than his bowed and hid her face i was betting it was because her face just didnt look sorry enough her dress was somewhere between cream and white and it matched her skin and her hair she was all whites and creams and pearls at first glance you might think albino but then she raised her eyes back up to us both her eyes were black so black that her pupils were lost in the color of her irises her lashes were golden her eyebrows gold and white muscles played under her thin arms as she stood and smoothed her long dress around her body her coloring was odd but not outside human norms her whiteblond hair fell to her waist her only jewelry was a circlet of silver set with three pearls the biggest in the middle and two smaller to either side surrounded by tiny but brilliant diamonds so that the light flashed and winked as she moved her head her pale neck was smooth and unadorned with no gill slits jeanclaude had told me that when they wished the maids of the sea his phrase could look very human may i present my wife leucothea thea he took her by the hand and drew her into a low curtsey did i curtsey back did i tell her to get up what should i do what could meng die have done that was taking jeanclaude this long to sort out she was so on my shit list not knowing what else to do i offered her a hand up she took my hand raising a softly startled face to me her fingers were cool against my skin are you helping me rise like a queen taking pity on a commoner or do you acknowledge that i am your superior i helped her to her feet though she moved like a dancer and hadnt needed the help i dropped her hand and said what i was thinking when in doubt i usually do okay truthfully im not sure who outranks who between the two of us if jeanclaude had been here then you could offer up to him but its me and i dont mean to be insulting but im just not sure who tops who here theas pale face looked surprised but samuel looked pleased auggie laughed an abrupt very humansounding laugh turning me to look at him jeanclaude said you were a breath of fresh air anita but such an honest breeze im not sure were up to it i like it samuel said only because you are hopeless at deceit auggie said samuel gave him a look none of us who have risen to master of the city is without deceit old friend the humor in auggies face softened and faded i realized that of almost all the other master vamps id ever seen his face was the most mobile the most expressive now it went suddenly blank the way all the old ones could do fair enough old friend but you do prefer honesty samuel nodded aye that i do you like honesty i said then you are going to love me there were abrupt laughs from at least two different corners of the room in one of the corners was fredo slumping artfully his black tshirt a little bulky in places from all the knives he hid on his body there were other knives out in plain sight two huge ones on either hip like an oldtime gunslinger his dark face was set in laughing lines his black eyes glittering out from the fall of his dark hair the other laugh had come from almost the opposite corner claudia was nearly six foot six the tallest woman id ever met and a serious weight lifter she made the toothin fredo look frail her black hair was tied back in its usual tight ponytail she wore no makeup and her face was still startling in its beauty claudia cared less about looking like a girl than i did but even with the weight lifting her body was all woman without the extreme height and the muscles she would have been one of those women who couldnt go anywhere without getting hit on or at least leered at she still got the leers but most men were afraid of her and they should have been she would probably be the only other woman carrying a gun tonight at the moment her face was soft with the laughter that was still bubbling in her throat she had a nice laugh deep and throaty i wasnt sure id ever heard her laugh before whats so funny i asked them both sorry anita she said voice still full of laughter fredo nodded yeah sorry but you honest jesus honest doesnt cover it micah had to clear his throat sharply and even nathaniels face was sort of glowing with the effort not to smile at me i fought not to get angry and finally managed it bully for me i can lie if i have to and even to me it sounded pouty but its not your nature fredo said which was a little too perceptive for someone who was supposed to be just muscle hes right claudia said and shed finally managed to control her laughter i apologize for the outburst she is like you samuel thea said an honest heart that would be a good thing he said and the way he said it made me finally look at some of the other people in his party my thought about inlaws was a little too accurate with samuel and thea they were offering up their three sons as possible pommes de sang for me which i found a little creepy but all the vamps had patiently explained to me that most of the really old vamps come from a time when arranged marriages between powers was the norm not the exception the twins were easy to spot because they were identical i knew their names thomas and cristos they had their mothers whiteblond color but the short careless curls of their father they were both taller than their father somewhere around fiveten like mom but their bodies were slender not enough muscle development i searched their curious faces and found them young very young they had to be legal or jeanclaude wouldnt have agreed but they didnt look legal maybe merpeople aged slower than humans the other son i wasnt certain of because there were two darkhaired men standing behind the love seat one of them met my eyes bold as brass the other man wouldnt meet my gaze he actually blushed embarrassed i was betting that was the son maybe he thought it was all as weird as i did they are lovely my sons are they not thea asked and that brought my attention back to her i wasnt sure what to say to that but finally said well yeah i guess i mean i wasnt looking at them for that i felt the blush crawl up my face and cursed myself for it she smiled let us decide which of us is of higher rank so i may introduce you to them formally i thought about it looked at micah and nathaniel they both shook their heads they didnt know either i have a thought thea said and the tone in her voice made it clear mat she wasnt sure id like it her voice was melodious almost like singing im willing to hear it i said we are animal to call and human servant but i am married to a master of the city and you are not would that be a way to decide who is higher tank thea samuel said no i said it is a way to decide this marriage beats just dating im okay with that samuel frowned at me we were warned that you had a temper ms blake i shrugged i do but theas reasoning is as good a way as any to decide which of us offers up a body part you dont find it insulting to acknowledge her as greater than yourself he asked i shook my head no he looked at me looked at me as if he were trying to see all the way through to my spine it wasnt vampire tricks it was just him trying to decide what i was or wasnt once i would have squirmed under such a look but not now now i just stood there and gave him calm eyes back thea made some small movement that drew my attention back to her she was waiting outwardly patient but there was a demand in her time to put up or shut up i offered her my wrist she took my hand in hers and again her hand was cool in mine she wrapped her hand around mine and used it to draw me in toward her body she wasnt going to take the wrist she was going for the neck i didnt fight but i did pull back a little she hesitated giving me those strange black eyes of hers if i outrank you anita then it is my choice where to touch i shook my head no that youre trying for the neck instead of the wrist means only one of three things you dont trust me youre showing how big and bad you are or youre thinking sex which is it thea the second she said she kept trying to pull me in against her body and i started to let her the strength in her one hand let me know that if i really wanted to struggle id have a fight on my hands she was strong like shapeshifter strong she kept her grip on my wrist as she used her other hand to pull me in against her body until the two of us were pressed together not tight but so our bodies brushed from chest to thighs i had to talk staring at her shoulder she was just too tall for me why do you want me to know that youre big and bad my wife is very competitive with other women anita samuel said surely jeanclaude mentioned that as he mentioned your temper to us he said something about it butshe let go of my wrist so she could slide that arm around my back pressing me closer to her her other hand was sliding up my back toward my hair but i hadnt understood what competitive meant i thought it took almost everything i had not to tense up as she entwined her body around me close now so close lover close sex close her breasts were small and tight and she wasnt wearing a bra eeek i felt stupid with my arms limp at my sides and i didnt really want to encourage her but i ended up sort of hugging her just to keep my balance on the damned high heels she leaned her mouth close to my face and whispered i do want you to understand that i am superior to you anita but that is only half my reason my pulse sped up a little at that i started to turn to look at her face but she grabbed a handful of curls and kept my face turned away i was left staring at the man who had blushed he looked at me full face and he suddenly looked like a younger version of samuel how had i not seen it before he mouthed i am sorry i had trouble speaking around my pulse now because i had that bad feeling that something was about to happen something i wasnt going to enjoy whats the other half of your reason i asked voice breathy holding that edge of nervousness that held a touch of fear i want to know what you are anita she whispered and her breath was warmer than it had been her hands were warm now as if she had caught a sudden fever it reminded me of the way some of the shapeshifters felt close to the full moon whats happening i asked but my voice was only a whisper her fingers entwined through my hair until she held my face immobile with her strong hands and i could feel the heat of her fingers through my hair she drew her face back from my neck and stared down at me she held my face tilted up to her as if for a kiss are you truly what they say you are i struggled to swallow so i could whisper what do they say i am succubus she whispered as she lowered her face toward mine i knew in that instant that she was going to kiss me i am seeking another of my kind anita are you what i seek and with the last word she closed her mouth over mine her mouth was warm so warm against mine warm like hot chocolate something you wanted to open your mouth and sip from it wasnt my idea opening my mouth it was hers somehow it was her thought in my head i didnt like that not one little bit the not liking helped me keep my mouth closed tight she drew back enough to whisper do not fight me i heard voices around us arguing help was coming i just had to hold on i just had to hold my shields in place and not let her do what she was trying to do just hold on that was all id held on when help was miles away now it was just inches i could do this shed tried gentle persuasion mind games they hadnt worked she tried force she kissed me so hard that either i opened my mouth to her or she was going to cut my lip on my own teeth if shed been a man i would have just let her kiss me was i really this homophobic if she hadnt whispered through my mind that she wanted me to open my mouth i might have done it but she wanted it too badly part of me was just that stubborn but part of me was afraid of why she wanted it so badly i knew she was a siren a sort of ubermermaid i knew that some of her magic dealt with seduction and sex i knew that she could control the other mermaids i knew all sorts of things from talks with jeanclaude what i didnt know was why she wanted me to open my mouth her kiss bruised my mouth and i tasted blood sweet metallic candy on my tongue the moment i tasted the blood it hurt shed cut the inside of my lip on my own teeth she drew back why fight so hard simply not to kiss me back are you so much a hater of women i tried to shake my head but she still held my face immobile why do you want me to open my mouth what difference does it make to you you are strong anita so strong the walls of your inner tower are high and wide but not impenetrable i was getting angry and i wasnt sure what that would do to my inner tower and its walls i did not want the beast to rise while we were still doing introductions i took a deep breath and let it out slowly but said what my anger wanted me to say i just wasnt angry when i said it either let me go or breach those walls but either way this ends how so ive done all that vampire etiquette requires so either let me go or i call in my guards and they force you to let me go do you need help to break free of me she asked and her voice was singsong again unless im willing to shoot you yes graham came close enough to say quietly say the word anita and we move her he sounded eager or angry i guess i couldnt blame him this whole thing had gone beyond grandstanding to just plain rude samuel came to our side thea this is not the way she turned her head and looked at him then what is the way perhaps you could simply ask a look crossed her face as if that would never have occurred to her then she laughed a high wild sound and for a second i thought i heard the laughter of seagulls so simple my darling samuel so simple she released the grip on my hair so i could move my neck which was a relief she stayed entwined around me but not so forcefully we were still too close for comfort but it was more friendly my deepest apologies anita it has been so long since i met anyone who could withstand my desires that i simply kept trying to force forgive me let me go and i will she gave that laugh again and it wasnt my imagination when she laughed i heard the sound that herring gulls make and the whisper of surf she let me go stepped back the moment she moved back the tension level in the room plummeted all the guards on every side had thought the flags were about to go up me too she bowed my deepest apologies i underestimated you and i am ashamed of my actions i accept your apology she stood and regarded me with those black eyes in that pale white and gold face as if some delicate porcelain doll had the eyes of a movie demon you know that we are offering our sons as your pommes de sang i nodded jeanclaude told me and im honored actually it creeped me out but i understood that it was supposed to be an honor but do you know why that stopped me because the answer was jeanclaude said you wished for a stronger alliance between our two kisses we do samuel joined his wife but there is a reason that my wife was so adamant that we bring all three of our sons to your table and that reason would be what i wanted to just skip this until i had more vampire backup but i didnt think id get the choice micah was suddenly at my side taking my hand i felt better i wasnt alone we could do this we didnt have vamps but we had each other nathaniel came in at my back not quite taking my other hand in case i needed it for weapon grabbing but close enough that he was a line of heat at my back better and better i am a siren thea said i nodded i know do you understand what that means among my kind i know that most mermaids who exhibit siren abilities are killed by the other merpeople before they can reach their full power do you know why because in full power you can control the merpeople magically as a necromancer can control all types of undead thea said i shrugged yeah i have some control over a lot of undead but its not perfect control and it doesnt work on everyone nor does mine work on every merperson though it works on many but do you know what the basis of that control is i shook my head no sex or seduction perhaps i crooked an eyebrow at her what does that mean exactly in this context it means that i hold something similar to the ardeur that you and jeanclaude share it attracts both my kind and mortals to me as the ardeur attracts the dead and apparently lycanthropes and mortals to you i frowned at her yeah a lot of guys want a full taste of the ardeur once they get a small taste i fought not to look for graham when i said it but they arent attracted to me because of it she gave that gullandsurf laugh again you do not know what you are anita the ardeur alone does not make you a succubus or jeanclaude an incubus i have met others with the ardeur but fewer with that next level of power you have it your master has it people are drawn to you because of it the very touch of your skin can be addictive i gave her a look like the touch of your skin is supposed to be addictive yes i fought not to smile but didnt quite succeed i licked the cut shed made in my lip and said no insult meant but i dont crave your touch no you fought me you won what do you want from me i believe that my sons have inherited my powers but there is only one way for a siren to be fully born another siren must bring them into their power i saw where this was going or was afraid i did let me guess the only way to bring them over is to have sex she nodded you cant find another siren to do the job for you i am the last of my kind anita i am the last siren unless you have the power to awaken my sons micah squeezed my hand tighter nathaniel moved in so that our bodies touched from shoulder to hip okay if were being honest im a little disturbed by your pimping out your sons to me what does pimping out mean she asked i sighed great one of those moments when you really dont want to explain the slang nathaniel said it means to sell someone else for sexual purposes she frowned then said i cannot truly argue the definition i wish you to have sex with my sons and it will gain us both a stronger alliance they will gain power from it so if that is selling i cannot argue this pimping out but if you are only a carrier of the ardeur and not a true succubus then you cannot do what thea wishes samuel said i looked at them both and how do we find out if ive got what thea wants i couldnt keep the suspicion out of my voice nathaniel stroked my shoulder like youd settle a nervous horse but i didnt push him away i was getting tense and fighting not to get angry let down your inner walls and let my power taste yours she said it like it was easy a small thing i shook my head i dont know the thought of my pimping out my sons to you makes you uncomfortable does it not yeah it does if your power is not close enough to mine then we will stay for the parties and the ballet but you will not have to look at them as pommes de sang we will take our sons home and you will not have to worry over your discomfort it sounded too easy it sounds simple but before i say yes what are the possible side effects of your power exploring mine she looked puzzled i am not certain i understand the question she means micah said what bad things could happen if she allows this she actually thought about it for almost a minute it should be only a touch of powers like two leviathans moving in the deep sliding their sides against each other then passing away into the dark depths of the sea i felt calmer as if i could feel those dark peaceful depths should be micah said what else could happen it could call your ardeur to the surface and you would be forced to feed i was suddenly tense again the peaceful dark depths gone like smoke in the wind no i said nathaniel whispered in my ear you can feed from me without intercourse anita its a way of getting rid of them micah looked at me only you can decide if the chance of having to feed the ardeur here and now is worth it anita i looked at the sons the twins looked at me smiling somewhere between amused and embarrassed but it was the kind of embarrassment that any teenager would have felt if his mom did something that made him squirm the older one behind the love seat looked more like i felt uncomfortable as hell you must be sampson i said he looked startled then nodded i am what do you think about all this i mean do you want to be brought into your sirenhood he looked down then up do you know that you are the first person to ask me how i feel about this i let the surprise show on my face its no reflection on my parents they love me us but father is over a thousand years old and mother is older still arranged marriages dont seem strange to them and they both would love to have one of us be as powerful as mother it would cement our power base along the entire eastern seaboard of this country i understand all that or i wouldnt be standing here but i said he smiled and it was his fathers smile but i dont know you the thought of being forced to have sex with anyone is just wrong i looked at the twins and you thomas and cristos right they nodded how do you feel about this they looked at each other then one blushed and the other didnt the one who didnt blush said im thomas tom when moms not around to complain he gave her a smile out of his fathers hazel eyes i saw pictures of you before we came i knew you were pretty and now he blushed bit his lip and tried again i would love to have an excuse to have sex with you there thats the truth how old are you i asked he glanced at his parents dont look at them answer the question sampson answered it theyre seventeen seventeen i said jesus thats not legal it is legal in missouri thea said we did check your laws before we brought them here i looked at her and didnt know what my face showed but it felt like nothing pleasant i dont do teenagers hell i didnt do teenagers when i was one then let my wife taste your power anita samuel said it is likely that your power will not do what we need succubus is close to siren but not the same creature if your power does not recognize theas then we will allow sampson to go home with his morals intact we will disappoint thomas that reminded me cristos you never said how you feel about all this the one who had blushed raised his eyes to me the look was enough embarrassment fear even but under that was eagerness the look just screamed virgin i so was not going to be the one who took his virginity so not doing that the fact that his parents were encouraging it just made it creepier his voice was low but deep enough it was not the voice of a child but the look was cris im cris i wanted to say out loud your first time should be with someone you care about your virginity should go to someone you love but i didnt want to embarrass him more than he already was so instead i said fine i looked at thea thea can taste my power i did not add that i hoped she didnt like the power because nothing was going to make me pick any of their sons sons children it made me remember why we had pregnancy tests in our overnight bag would i be bargaining for some sort of arranged shackingup for my own child some day i mean no matter who the father was none of us was exactly human and most of us were scarily powerful shit i wished i hadnt thought of that thea was in front of me her head to one side studying my face you look worried anita very worried as if youve thought of something new to fret over that was a little too perceptive i was really going to have to work harder at hiding my facial expressions tonight i tried for a little truth samuel is only the second master vamp ive ever met with a grown child or children its just weird micah leaned more of himself against the arm he was holding nathaniel cuddled in tighter to my back though the gun kept him from being as comforting as i wanted him to be they knew what id thought of or maybe theyd been thinking the same thing or something close to it thea turned her head to the other side and it didnt remind me of anything aquatic it reminded me of a bird of prey judging the distance to my eye i shivered please god dont let me be pregnant she touched my face with fingers that were still fever warm it is not i who put that frown between the dark beauty of your eyes i drew my head back enough not to be touched very poetic lets get this done thea were wasting moonlight she gave a smile that reminded me of the one that tom had used just before he blushed and bit his lip and admitted wanting to have sex with me the twins looked very much like her except for the eyes very well but your men will have to step away i do not know what the effect would be if they were touching you while i do this it might raise the ardeur for certain or or what i asked or they might bolster your defenses and keep me from testing your power at all she gave a movement of pale shoulders that was almost a shrug but not quite i will treat you as i treat samuel i will tell you the truth i simply am not certain if you were a vampire then i might know but you are more and less you are not simply one thing or the other but both and many i think it must change the rules of power and magic around you i took in a deep breath let it out slow and nodded i moved forward and micah and nathaniel moved back they gave me the room we asked for im not sure any of us were sure it was a good idea but if she found me wanting then there were three very unpalatable pomme de sang candidates off the table yippee thea took me in her arms again and i didnt fight it i even wrapped my arms around her she didnt try to control my head this time she trusted me to let her kiss me i actually went up on tiptoe for her which meant she was closer to six feet than id thought i found myself putting a hand along the edge of her face as if this were a kiss that i wanted sometimes i touched someones face because it was intimate sometimes i touched them because a hand on the face helps you control the kiss more if things get out of hand two guesses which reason it was this time and first guess doesnt count she kissed me and this time i didnt fight her i let my body melt into hers let her feed at my mouth there is a moment in a kiss especially an openmouth kiss where the caress of lips and tongue spills over some line and beyond that line you kiss back i kissed her kissed her as she was meant to be kissed full and complete tasting her i drew back enough to whisper you taste salty she breathed her answer in my mouth as she drew me back into the kiss you taste of blood her breath filled my mouth caressed the back of my throat her breath tasted fresh and clean like the wind off the ocean her lips tasted like she had just that second taken a sip of the ocean i licked her lip and found that there was a whitish film on the fullness of her mouth it wasnt illusion it was real i swallowed the salty taste of her lips staring up at her feeling the surprise on my face howbut i never finished the question because i didnt just swallow the taste of salt i swallowed her power i heard the ocean whispering against the shore i could hear it like music i looked around the room i wanted to ask someone else if they could hear it i meant to look for micah or nathaniel but that wasnt who caught my gaze thomas was staring at me with wide eager eyes his brother had collapsed to the love seat and was covering his ears with his hands rocking back and forth cristos was fighting it whatever it was but thomas wasnt sampson had a death grip on the love seat but his eyes had drowned to black so that he looked blind the other man and woman theyd brought with them turned black eyes to me the woman was hugging herself as if cold or afraid the man had a death grip on his own wrist the typical jock pose turned into something harsh and struggling as if if he let go of his wrist he would do something unfortunate last i found samuels eyes his eyes had bled to vampire fire the glowing brown with flecks of green flame in their depths they all could hear it that whispering seductive sound the ocean was calling and i didnt know how to answer i was still staring into samuels eyes when i felt a hand glide down my shoulder i turned and found thomas standing next to us thea began to pull out of my arms giving me to thomass arms as she moved so that it was as if the embrace never stopped only the arms holding me had changed there was movement around us i saw micahs face his lips moving but i couldnt hear him all i could hear was the sigh and echo of the sea thomas touched my face turned me back to look at him he spoke and his words held the growling echo of surf over rocks you hear my voice though dont you i nodded my face pressed against his hand his hand was large enough to cup the entire side of my face he leaned down and i went up on tiptoe to help him finish the kiss i wasnt thinking that he was seventeen i wasnt thinking we had an audience that included his parents i wasnt thinking that men i loved were watching i saw nothing but his face felt nothing but the strength of his hands on my face his arm trailing down my back his hand gliding down my body the inside of my head was peaceful full of a soft rushing sound like water as it spills along some peaceful shore i wasnt the one who fought free of the mind games it was thomas who spoiled it his hand slid down down and found the gun at the small of my back it made him hesitate made him stumble as if his magic had legs to be tripped by a misplaced stone i pulled back from him saw the uncertainty on his face he was still handsome and the compulsion to touch him was still there whispering through my head but his eyes were wide his face uncertain he looked fresh and new and untried like someone who had never hugged someone and found her wearing a gun the sound of the surf pulled away and i could hear the murmuring in the room people wondering what to do whether they should interfere thats a gun he said in a voice as uncertain as his face i nodded i had gone back to being flatfooted on my heels no more tiptoe no more helping him seduce me with his mothers magic or his own hed actually missed the big knife down my spine because he hadnt come to the midline of my body until low on my back but it was a big weapon to miss baby he was a baby and id have said that if hed been twentyseven instead of seventeen baby not in years but in my world you dont miss a knife as long as a forearm not and live not for long not in my world i gazed up into his face the black was beginning to drain away showing the hazel of his human eyes he was the son of a master vampire and a siren but where he lived was a gentler kinder place than my life i would leave him to that gentleness i drew out of his arms completely go back and sit down thomas he hesitated and looked at his mother she was watching me not him watching me with those black eyes there was a considering look on her face as if she wasnt sure what she thought of the show do as anita says thomas she said at last he went back to the love seat to sit beside his brother it left thea and me staring at each other he hesitated only for a moment she said yet it was enough its not his power i said not yet its yours you loaned him enough power to roll me she made a gesture that was almost a shrug but her hands went out in a wide gesture i think it meant perhaps or you caught me i wasnt sure which and wasnt sure i cared you have greeted thomas but we have two other sons she said micah came up beside me he took my hand in fairness to our other guests i think we need to greet more of auggies people they are only his henchmen and his mistress we have brought you our flesh and blood the fruit of our lives micah nodded still smiling we appreciate that but i cut him off and said enough micah thanks for trying to be all polite and hosty but ive had enough of games for the night he squeezed my hand as if saying be nice i squeezed back but i was done being nice i wouldnt be rude but im going to greet auggie and his people now because they didnt try to roll me until jeanclaude joins us you and your sons are just going to have to wait to be greeted so augustines whore is higher in rank than my sons thea sounded genuinely angry there was a sound of outrage from the other side of the room a womans voice protesting and auggie trying to calm her i glanced to find him talking to a statuesque brunette in a very tiny dress she was mad and i didnt blame her i turned back to samuel you talk to her samuel you explain that your wife damn near abused our hospitality tonight if we have truly abused your hospitality then jeanclaude could revoke our safe conduct he said voice deep but strangely soft i understand that did we frighten you that badly he asked i agreed to thea tasting my power not thomas it wasnt what we negotiated for i was told you were an honorable man bait and switch isnt very honorable could you hear anything we said while thomas touched you micah asked i glanced at him and shook my head i could hear his voice and the sound of the sea that was it i pointed out to samuel that you hadnt bargained for thomas what did he say he said that for a siren to truly taste your power it needed to have a sexual flavor to it and since you were not a lover of women one of the boys would be helpful i shook my head im going to greet auggie and his people now whether i let any of your other children touch me or not is up for a very serious debate i put my gaze on thea i dont like to be forced or played thea if you really want your sons to have a chance at my bed or body or power you need to remember that i saw into your mind when i embraced you she said i saw what you think of my sons you are disinclined toward them without magic to persuade you i do not think they have any chance at your bed your body or your power my pulse was suddenly in my throat i fought to keep a blank face but wasnt sure i succeeded how much had she read while she was playing inside my head did she know about the pregnancy scare thea was watching me very narrowly she saw the fear on me but didnt understand why which meant either shed only read things about her sons in my head or she didnt understand why being pregnant would scare me if the former yea if the latter she was too odd for me to talk to i turned to auggie and his angry girlfriend she was the only woman on his side of the room standing in the spike heels she was over six feet tall but whereas with claudia it was all muscle and menace this woman was thin there was no play of muscle to her arms and legs she was making angry gestures with large hands darkly painted nails a diamond flashing on her right hand her dress was red with silver sequins it fit her like a tiny glittery second skin the dress was so short that when she flounced around the couch taking too long a step she flashed enough flesh that i knew she wasnt wearing anything under the dress oh my auggie coaxed her back to me her face was perfect in a highcheekboned almost stark way she wore enough makeup artfully applied that stark should not have been a word you used for her face her hair was long and teased too high on the top as if shed never quite left the eighties but it was brunette it might even have been her natural color the spaghetti straps of her dress and the thin material should not have been able to support her breasts breasts that large do not stay perky without more help than the dress could give her breasts sat under the dress in a way that real breasts just dont she flounced toward me holding auggies hand the walk was good bouncy but her breasts didnt bounce with her they were big and even shapely but they rode under her dress like they were way more solid than breasts are meant to be it took micah tugging on my hand to let me know id missed something staring at her chest i shook my head and gave auggie eye contact sorry what did you say this is bunny she is my mistress bunny i thought was it her real name i hoped so who would choose to be bunny i nodded hi bunny auggie gave her a little pull and a nod she gave an angry sullen face to me at least im only whoring for one man not a dozen micah actually pulled me away from her i let him do it i was so astounded at the rudeness of it that i was speechless i wasnt even angry yet it was too unexpected too rude auggie ordered her to kneel and when she didnt do it fast enough he forced her apologize now his power filled the room like cold water shivering along my skin why am i a whore when his wife is pimping out her own sons and this one is fucking everything and everyone that will stand still benny he said in a very quiet voice i knew that tone of voice its the careful controlled one you use when youre afraid of what youll do if you yell the only vampire hed brought with him moved around the couch to stand beside him yeah boss take her out of here get on a plane take her back to chicago help her pack make sure she takes only what belongs to her bunnys eyes went wide no auggie no i didnt mean it im sorry he moved away so she couldnt touch him she tried to crawl after him but benny grabbed her arm come on bunny we gotta plane to catch she was human and in fiveinch heels but she put up a fight benny was having trouble getting her to the door without hurting her shed proven to the entire room that she was naked under the tiny dress i said claudia she came to me all serious the bodyguards bodyguard pick someone or two someones to help benny get her out of here claudia nodded almost a bow and said fredo clay help our guest out fredo pushed himself from the wall all boneless ease like some dark wellarmed cat clay just took bunnys other arm and helped benny start carrying her toward the door she used the spike heels effectively probably drawing blood through clays pants he never slowed and neither did benny though his face was bleeding from nail marks fredo got both her ankles and they carried her out auggie gave me a very low bow i dont know what to say anita im sorry that i brought her i knew she was jealous but not crazy jealous jealous i made it a question she like samuels thea is very competitive around other women i frowned at him so she and thea were like trying to outbitch each other he looked at me you really dont understand why she didnt like you from the moment you stepped into the room do you micah drew me in against his body hugging me onearmed i looked back and forth from one to the other of them what no micah said she doesnt dont what i asked you are a natural beauty auggie said artifice gave bunny her face her figure most of her best features were found under a surgeons blade in you walk all natural equipment wearing more clothes and still get more attention from the men in the room than she did when you were with thea and thomas every man in the room was riveted we wanted you wanted to touch you in a way that is rare i felt myself blushing and tried to stop it but as usual lost youre babbling auggie i said watching you and a siren two if you count the boy watching two creatures formed of desire and it was not the pale beauty most eyes watched anita it was the dark i frowned at him i dont need this much egoboo auggie just make your point if you have a point nathaniel came up ill translate what do you mean translate i said turning to him he took my hand and shook his head his face had that iloveyoubutyouamuseme look you outvamped the sirens anita how i believe auggie said because your power is over the dead and the undead i was told your animal to call was only leopard i nodded it is but through jeanclaudes marks i also have ties to the wolves yes but my men are neither they are lion and yet they felt your call i glanced behind him at the two men hed brought along as both bodyguards and food and i was told as pomme de sang candidates though auggie like samuel had a new twist on the whole pomme thing auggie was hoping to convince one of our new female vamps from london to come home with him and play house he wanted another of belles line in his bed maybe that had predisposed bunny to be pissy he had come here to replace her after all auggie was offering to trade one of his werelions for a bedmate of belles line i wondered how the men in question felt did they want to stay in st louis did they want to leave chicago had anyone asked them i was betting not they were both tall and muscular and all they needed was a blinking sign over their heads that said bodyguard they both wore tailored suits that hid the guns i was almost one hundred percent sure were under there somewhere one was brunette the other pale other than that they looked as if an unimaginative baker had used the same cookie cutter for both of them only the icing was different the pale one had short spiky blue hair which had actually been dyed well so that it wasnt a solid blue color but pale blue dark blue all mixed together like real hair is and dyed hair seldom is except that nobody has hair the color of cookie monster and a spring sky on the top of their head his eyes were a pale blue made deeper richer by the hair color he was a little more slender through the shoulders and maybe an inch taller than the other guard the brunettes hair looked like it might curl but hed cut it so short it didnt have the chance his shoulders had a swell that i was familiar with someone lifted weights as more than a casual hobby not a bodybuilder but he worked at it he was tall enough to carry the shoulders cookie monster had a slight smile on his slender face it reached the blue of his eyes as if we just amused the hell out of him brunette watched me like i might do something bad and he would be ready the smile didnt fool me they were both professional muscle they were dangerous and they were totally unacceptable as pomme de sang candidates too dominant too unbending yeah it was a quick judgment but id have bet almost anything i was right my eyes went to the other man who still stood behind the couch id have said human but the power that lurked just below that dark elegant surface made me think maybe not i knew he was octavius auggies human servant id have liked to just greet the two bodyguards and let their power tell me i was right to think they were too dominant for what we wanted but technically since they werent auggies special animal to call octavius outranked them almost as if he read my face octavius said greet them first ms blake let us see what you think of your choices i too think the night is wasting away his voice matched the smooth elegance of the rest of him i nodded and said thank you but i didnt like that octavius had read me that easily i moved around the couch with micah and nathaniel at my back and graham and claudia flanking all of us i dont think any of our guards liked the two werelions any better than i did you guys have names i asked cookie monster grinned at me eyes sparkling why did i think hed grin just like that while he gutted someone haven im haven i nodded acknowledgment then turned to brunette and you would be pierce you guys only have one name apiece like madonna pierce frowned at me haven laughed and it was a good laugh head back fullthroated if he hadnt made the hairs at the back of my neck crawl id have smiled auggie glided up to the two men putting a hand on each of them their eyes tightened not a flinch but noticable what had he done when he touched their backs ohsolightly auggie smiled that happy happy smile that filled his gray eyes with light my lions are like vampires anita they can if they choose have only one name among us pierce and haven do have first names but i think they will keep them until they know if theyre staying what you think i cant run them through a computer and a record check because you dont give me their real names if their criminal record worries you then let me allay your fears they both have one he was still smiling when he said it it was all getting too weird these were our friends and i was already feeling like id been thrown into the deep end of the pool jeanclaude where are you i thought i got a confused glimpse of fighting he and asher were struggling to hold meng die down it reminded me of watching the men carrying bunny out if they want to hurt you and you dont want to hurt them you are at a disadvantage they were inside the building that housed the carnivals freak show upstairs though most of the freaks were rare supernaturals i saw people looking in at them from the outer areas they had an audience i thought ask for help get some guards in there and get her out of sight i felt more than heard him think that asking for help with the other vamps maybe sensing it would make him look weak i thought back taking advantage of your resources is not weakness its good management i felt him reach out to the wolves upstairs i felt them moving toward him soon thered be too many men for her to fight back what theyd do with her once they subdued her that was a different question i had one more awful thought i turned to claudia can you contact the wererat guards upstairs via mind she pulled a small cell phone from one pocket how about phone meng dies animal to call is wolf id like a few wererats to join everyone in the freak show claudia didnt ask she just made the call so nice not to be questioned and what does jeanclaude need that much help with auggie said shes a female of belles line you want her he laughed not if shes this wild no auggie wouldnt need help to subdue one of his vamps pierce said jeanclaude could subdue her or even kill her but shes chosen a place where theres an audience committing murder in front of civilians is a nono i said but once behind the scenes will he kill her haven asked i sighed probably not weakness pierce said auggie patted them both on the back and again there was that tightening around their eyes now now boys some masters would have killed bunny for her disrespect everyone runs his territory a little differently he was still cheerful and charming but there was an edge to it what are you thinking auggie i asked i didnt really expect an answer but i got one that jeanclaude is too sentimental for his own good sometimes i smiled and knew it left my eyes cold you know sentimental is not a word i would have used for him then he has changed dont we all i said auggie nodded the smile melting around the edges taste them anita taste your new toys i shook my head and said can you stop touching them while i do it id hate to confuse your tie to them with their power he gave a small bow and stepped back he even went to sit on the couch where octavius joined him i stepped away from my own people i fought not to look at one particular guard of ours our local lions were ruled by joseph and he was in the corner dressed as a bodyguard he was ready to help if needed but he and i both knew that he was mostly here to check out the new werelions i was betting he liked them even less than i did i looked up at the two men in question do you guys want this trade that surprised them both though haven hid it sooner he smiled im cool with it if it works out his eyes were cooler when he said it as if the smile were beginning to melt down his face if i asked the right question i might even see the real haven behind the smiling hip exterior pierce glanced behind them at auggie i said what id said to the twins dont look at your master look at me and give me an honest answer do you want to be traded to st louis he started to look at the couch again i touched his arm a jolt of power ran through me made me drop his arm it stopped him midmotion turned him back to me with his pulse pushing at the side of his throat what was that i fought the urge to rub my hand along the side of my skirt im not sure power some kind of power youre not sure he sounded as suspicious as he looked i honestly dont know why there was a power jump when we touched i didnt like it either i want to go home he said i dont like being traded away and i really dont like being offered up for sex like some kind of whore he let the anger fill his voice and the anger raised his power like heat across my skin octavius said be careful cat no i said i want honesty ive seen what happens if someone is forced to be in a group that they dont want to be in the local lion pride works well i dont want to queer their deal so you wont taste pierce now will you auggie asked from the couch i shook my head take him back home auggie im surprised you brought him him not wanting to come bunny said pierce was one of the best lovers shed ever had i thought youd enjoy that i couldnt control my face fast enough whats wrong with that auggie asked the idea of bunny just i made a pushaway gesture im fighting off a visual she could be crude but she was very good at her job i looked at auggie and her job would be sex shes your mistress not your whore mistress means more than just sex now that is jeanclaude talking maybe but its still true he shrugged those massive shoulders youve met her anita do you really think i sat around and had stimulating conversations with bunny i laughed i couldnt help it no i guess not then another thought occurred to me why would you date anyone that you couldnt talk to he just stared at me a look on his face that i couldnt read you mean that dont you he smiled almost sadly shook his head and wouldnt meet my gaze oh anita you make me feel jaded and very old do i apologize for that i asked he looked up smiling still no but that you meant that question makes me wonder about my choices for your pomme de sang i looked for good sex dominants because everyone needs more muscle i did not look for good conversation or someone with interests like yours i wasnt looking for a date i was looking for food and fucking you need a woman in your organization auggie being all guys limits you are you saying i need a womans touch yeah and there isnt a woman of belles line that will go with you just to be your whore we promised them that theyd have choices when they came here are you saying i have to court them i nodded yeah i am and jeanclaude agrees to this octavius said i nodded he gave his word that no one would be forced to have sex against their will ah auggie said then he laughed dating i havent dated in decades i wonder if i remember how the master of the city does not have to date octavius said he commands youre in the wrong town for that attitude i said you are so certain of that he said absolutely taste haven auggie said if you dont like him then im going to have to send home for some less dominant takeout i looked up at the tall man in front of me he looked down with that soft laughing face and i just didnt buy it it was like the smile and sparkly eyes was his version of a cop face a way to hide everything he dropped gracefully to his knees which made him not that much shorter than me i added at least another inch to his height he laughed that joyous laugh that seemed so sincere you should see your face so suspicious i just thought that this way you have your choice of wrist or neck with me standing you cant reach my neck it made sense so why didnt i like it no answer other than the one id had since i saw him being close to him reacted with that primitive part of the brain that keeps you alive if you dont argue with it touching him was dangerous in some way but in what way the trouble with the primitive brain is that it doesnt reason or explain it just feels i could just touch him then turn him down hed be on his way back to chicago no harm no foul i reached for his hand and he gave it i wondered if id get that jolt of energy like i had from pierce but his hand was simply warm his hand was very passive in mine but when i pushed back the sleeve of his jacket he had on a frenchcuffed shirt with real cuff links shit you dont like french cuffs i frowned down at him itll take a while to unhook your wrists he gave me that smile again but the blue eyes werent quite as neutrally cheerful i got to glimpse the coldness under that smile for some reason it made me feel better i liked truth most of the time why are you smiling he asked and his voice held just a hint of uncertainty good i shook my head nothing i smoothed my hand up the side of his face turned him so the line of his neck stretched above the collar of his dress shirt i bent over him one hand on his shoulder for balance the other cradling the side of his face the neck was always so much more intimate than the wrist i meant to simply lay my lips against his neck but when i was close enough to smell his skin all my good intentions vanished he smelled so warm so incredibly warm i wanted to put my mouth against that warmth but not to kiss i put my face so close to the warm smooth line of his neck that a hard thought would have made my lips touch his skin but i kept just above his neck and breathed in the scent of him warm a faint hint of some powdery sweet cologne barely there soap and underneath just the scent of his body human and deeper still where my breath blew back hot from his skin the musky hint of cat cleaner less sharp than leopard but definitely cat not wolf not dog i breathed in the scent of lion as it rose from his skin as if my breath called it forth my arms slid down his back across his shoulders folding my body around his hed behaved himself until then hands at his sides but now he reached for me wrapped me in the strength of his arms the force of his fingers kneading at my body through my clothes i heard him whisper oh god i laid the gentlest of kisses against that hot smooth skin a feathers touch of a kiss and it wasnt enough i could smell what i wanted just below the surface i could smell his blood like something sweet and metallic i licked along his neck licked over the warm jumping life of his pulse he shuddered in my arms i heard a voice anita anita dont do this i didnt know who it was and didnt understand what they were talking about i needed to taste his pulse feel it quiver between my teeth until it burst hot and scalding in my mouth a wrist appeared near my face i smelled leopard micah called me back from that quivering edge anita what are you doing i didnt unwind from havens body i raised my face only enough to see micah tasting him and my voice sounded hoarse and not mine let him go anita i shook my head and felt havens fingers hard and firm as if he had claws to sink into my body and i wanted him to do it graham came next putting his wrist between me and that pulsing candy but the musk of wolf was not what i wanted nathaniel was next putting the sweetness of his wrist between me and havens neck he still smelled of vanilla but that wasnt the scent i was after tonight i shook my head no somethings wrong anita you need to stop i shook my head again sending my hair flying over the kneeling mans face he made a sound low in his throat from the sensation of it the sound made me push nathaniel away and lay my mouth over the shivering of havens pulse not a kiss no my mouth was too wide for a kiss my jaw tensed to bite him and two things happened simultaneously someone grabbed a handful of my hair and a wrist i didnt know well was suddenly in my face a voice that had already gone growling deep said if it is lion you want then here i am i followed that scent upward as he pulled my head backward with my hair joseph stood above me his hair golden his eyes already the deep perfect amber of lion the man at my feet wrapped himself tighter around me not kneading me with his fingers now but clinging no haven said no shes mine mine not yours joseph growled he drew his wrist upward and my body followed the line of his skin it wasnt haven i wanted it was lion would anyone do maybe it wasnt a person i chased but a scent haven came up off the floor in a movement too quick to follow he was just suddenly moving and joseph was there and the next moment they were across the room crashing through the drapes into the stone wall beyond the drapes cascaded down around them so that half the living room wall was ripped away revealing the bare stone and the torchlit corridor beyond the guards waded in trying to separate them i was left standing staring not entirely sure what had happened or why joseph had saved me from something something cloth ripped loud and violent haven came up out of the ripped drapes and sailed across the room to find the drapes at the other side they collapsed around him but he never tried to rise he was just a shape under the cascading cloth joseph stepped out of the fall of white and gold cloth half his shirt ripped away his hands were halfclawed and his face was beginning to lose its human shape like his body becoming soft clay his hair was lengthening starting to form the golden halo of his mane auggie stepped to the edge of the spilled cloth around him and his voice echoed through the room like the whisper of a giant intimate soft and thunderous all at once lion i am master here not you joseph growled at him with teeth gone long and dangerous his voice was so low and growling that it was hard to understand i am the rex of the st louis pride i was invited to see the lions you brought and i have found them wanting octavius came up beside auggie laid a hand on his back and the power level rocked off the scale it was like a metaphysical earthquake except nothing moved nothing you could see anyway but it stumbled me on my high heels joseph staggered back a step from it the others turned startled faces toward auggie but they werent as affected as joseph have you ever met a master vampire that could call your animal rex auggie asked joseph was breathing harder than he should have been but he managed to growl no let me show you what youve been missing he didnt gesture or speak but suddenly the air was hard to breathe the air was so heavy with power that we should all be choking on it but it wasnt meant for us joseph collapsed to his knees snarling fighting but he could not stand against it let me see your human eyes rex the growing mane began to shrink the fur that had been climbing over his skin began to be reabsorbed his face was reshaping itself only when he was joseph again fully human again did the air ease a little what do you want vampire joseph said in a human voice that sounded breathy obedience auggie said and there was nothing friendly about that one word the goodnatured man was gone and the master vampire was revealed come to me rex crawl to me joseph fought him you could watch the struggle of it on his face but finally he dropped to all fours stop it auggie i said leave him alone he is my beast not jeanclaudes there is no tie between my host and the lions there is tie between me and the lions i invited joseph here tonight he never looked at me but octavius did he put those perfect chocolate eyes on me and his face held nothing but arrogance which pissed me off anger is bad but sometimes well it has its uses i moved toward them i put myself between them blocking his view of joseph it was like id taken a punch nathaniel was there to grab me and the moment he touched me i felt better he was my animal to call now not just my type of animal but truly my animal to call as richard was to jeanclaude it was sort of like a furry human servant and it gave some of the benefits power extra power joseph and his people are our allies my leopards and i have a treaty with them to harm one is to harm both auggie looked at me then his eyes swimming gray like clouds with lightning caught inside them if jeanclaude had made this treaty i would have to abide by it but you are a human servant anita you do not bind me as your master would just as if you visit us in chicago deals made by octavius alone are not binding on your master so youll hurt joseph because why because he stopped me from doing some metaphysical shit with your lion is that it he is lion and no lion can resist me he is the rex of st louis auggie you have no authority over him i said would you challenge me with octavius at my back would you set yourself against me with your master busy elsewhere i nodded yes i will punish him for his insult to me and mine anita i will do it you can either allow it gracefully or you can force me to control you as i control joseph if you think you can control me auggie knock yourself out it was suddenly harder to breathe again micah came in at my other side he was my nimirraj and it helped me think but it didnt help me fight graham i said he came to my reaching hand and the moment i touched him i could feel the wolves feel the tie through richard to the pack that neckruffling scent of wolf the green peace of woods and fields and i staggered and only nathaniel and grahams hands kept me on my feet pierce the werelion was at auggies side i wanted to call jeanclaude but was afraid to auggie was his friend but what i was feeling pushing against me filling the very air was more powerful than anything id ever felt from jeanclaude if i lost to auggie then i lost but if jeanclaude lost to him then there was a chance he would be defeated as master of the city and right there in that moment i saw the real reason i hadnt wanted these bastards in our city i hadnt trusted us to be strong enough i would not cost us the city i would not be the ruin of us all i would not i was trying to fight him as if i were another master vampire but that wasnt what i was i was a necromancer i was supposed to have control over all the dead we would see i let go of the men who held me up i took a step away from the hands of the living and opened that part of me that i always had to shield that part of me that was like some great closed fist tight tight or who knows what we could do by accident or by design i almost never unleashed my necromancy outside a cemetery but there were no dead bodies for the power to find there were only vampires my power blew out from my body like a chill wind and it found its mark what is this auggie asked octaviuss face didnt look so arrogant over his shoulder pierce moved away from him as if something about my power had made it hard to keep touching him if being human servant or nimirra gains me nothing then there are other titles auggie other powers to be invoked he licked his lips a nice nervous gesture what is this power havent you heard auggie im a necromancer there are no true necromancers octavius said but his voice didnt sound so certain have it your way but you will leave joseph and his people alone while youre in my city or what auggie asked his eyes still full of gray light i have another title among the vampires do you know what it is the executioner they call you the executioner yeah they do are you threatening to kill me he managed to sound amused even with my power breathing around his body i am telling you the rules you do not mess with our people and all the vampires all the shapeshifters and other supernatural to be named later qualify as our people we were attacked octavius said fine youve proved your point you forced him to swallow his beast i say its enough i am a master vampire a ruler of a city you do not dictate to me if youre vampire enough to make me back down then come and get me auggie i stand here alone no animal to call no nimirraj no vampire at my back i stand here with nothing but my own power are you vampire enough to do the same he smiled are you saying to step away from octavius and my lion and meet you in the middle of the room for what a duel you would die a testing of wills then i said you cannot hope to win he said if thats true then you have nothing to lose do you anita claudia said im not sure about this come to me augustine come to me i put everything i had into that command i wanted him to come to me now before jeanclaude got here he pushed away from his human servant and his lion he started walking toward me just like i wanted augustine octavius said do not do this come to me auggie come to me he had taken two more steps before he frowned at me you are bidding me to come you are truly calling me i told you what i was he shook his head i will not come to you afraid cautious he said fine then ill meet you halfway thats fair anita graham said i ignored him i started walking toward the waiting vampire meet me partway auggie he started toward me not gliding but stiffly as if his body wasnt working quite right he finally stopped before he reached me stopped with a look you dont get to see on a master vampires face often nervous he was nervous what happens when we meet in the middle anita if you get past me fine but if you dont then i win that doesnt seem fair you have only to stand your ground but i must walk past you we both stopped about two feet away from each other i coaxed my power whispered to it what i wanted i wanted him to obey me id never tried this so overtly against any vampire a master of the city was probably not the place to start but it was too late now he swayed on his expensive shoes i will not will not what i asked but my voice held the power that was breathing around us my voice knew what i expected him just to keep resisting i should have remembered that there were other options you want me anita you can have me i can do what i wanted to do all along and jeanclaude cant even get mad i hesitated stumbling in my mind the power flickering what he moved faster than i could follow closing the distance taking me in his arms i was suddenly pinned against his body my arms trapped my power pushed at him but his power pushed back i feel it your power and god you are powerful if you were just a necromancer you might even win but you arent just that are you he lowered his face toward me as if he meant to kiss me stop i command you to stop he actually hesitated swallowing hard closing his eyes but when he opened them it was as if his power had taken a catastrophic leap the gaze from his eyes stopped the breath in my throat strong but not strong enough he flexed his power like some invisible muscle and that flexing shot through my body it bowed my spine and only his arms kept me upright we half fell to our knees as if my collapse caught him by surprise he ripped my controls away from the ardeur he did it better and quicker than thea had dreamt of he brought the ardeur with my body wrapped in his he brought the ardeur knowing that once it rose like this he would be my food which of course was what he had meant he could do what hed wanted to all along and jeanclaude couldnt even get mad passion like something touchable solid spilled up through my body and over his lust like some thick heavy paint flowed over us covering us trapping us i froze afraid to breathe afraid to speak afraid most of all to move id gone from finding auggie handsome arrogant and beginning not to like him to wanting to be naked with him even for the ardeur it was an abrupt switch i wanted to ask him what had he done to me but was afraid to move that much and even more afraid to draw his attention to me afraid of what he would do no not true terrified of what i would do i stayed frozen in his arms perfectly still only my pulse moving if i could simply not move i could hold on id won the fight auggie was offering himself up as food that made me the winner vampire rules food loses all i had to do was hold on until jeanclaude came i could do that he was close i could feel him coming down the stairs minutes minutes away from help but fighting the ardeur by not acting only works if the other person involved wants it to work it needs two people trying to fight it auggie didnt want to fight it he wanted to lose his eyes closed and his head fell back almost as if the sex had already started his voice was hoarse as he said i had almost forgotten how it feels to be consumed by passion he lowered his face so he could meet my gaze i try to forget the touch of it anita i almost succeed in convincing myself it wasnt real that nothing ever felt so amazing then she sends me a dream i knew who she was because when any of belles line said her or she of course you knew who she was belle morte it was always belle morte their dark mistress the creator of them all did you hear me anita did you hear me his arms moved so that he was gripping my upper arms our bodies still pressed too close together there was room to try to fight to try for a weapon but it was too late for that if i went for a weapon i wasnt certain i could make my hands grab a gun or a blade my hands ached for the touch of his skin i wasnt trustworthy i wanted to scream in my mind for jeanclaude but with the ardeur this strong i wasnt sure if it could spread that way auggie shook me did you hear me anita i felt movement caught a glimpse of black at the sides if anyone touched us the ardeur would spread to them bad very bad stay back i whispered tell them micah said dont touch either of them it spreads by touch you touch her and ill shoot you graham this from claudia look at me anita auggie said me i swallowed my pulse and moved very slowly to look at him i met the charcoal gray of his gaze and whatever he saw there seemed to satisfy him she sends such dreams anita dreams like this where lust is something touchable holdable caressable and its spilling over your skin drowning you in its need he leaned in toward me as if for a kiss i turned my head down away still careful still slow move too fast and the ardeur was like a predator attracted by quick movements but a small turn of the head that i could do dont turn away let me kiss you let me spill this waiting press of heat over us let us drown together i kept my face turned away my hands in fists because all i could think of was what his body would feel like under my hands i wanted to trace his shoulders his chest see the muscled promise of him nude before me it was like months or years of dating and wanting all packed into moments requiem one of our imports from britain could cause instant body reaction hours of really good foreplay in seconds of power could auggie hit the emotional markers as fast as requiem could hit the physical ones sweet mary mother of god help me the moment the thought left me i was calmer could think more clearly for years i hadnt prayed during times like this too embarrassed but id finally realized if my faith was real then it didnt desert me just because i was outside societal norms no he said no i will not come this close and be denied he drew me in against his body and i fought to stay stiff and unyielding when all i wanted to do in the whole wide world was touch him he rested his cheek against my hair i feel your masters nearness anita you wait for rescue but remember unless you actually feed from me then you have not won this fight i felt the press of his lips against my temple soft and hot do you really believe jeanclaude will win against me feed and you win and so does he he was implying what id already thought of that if jeanclaude hit the door before id won that we would lose badly id felt the power in auggie and i knew the power in jeanclaude if it was a straightup battle we would lose i couldnt let that happen micahs voice came from behind me he didnt touch me but he said there are other hungers anita other drives he spoke carefully as if he wasnt sure how well i could hear him micah was right the ardeur had a habit of swallowing the world and my logic with it there were other hungers and they were inside me just like the ardeur once id thought to raise other hungers i had to open the marks between richard or micah or nathaniel but i knew better now the beast wasnt something i got from them it was something inside me the fact that it had no way out no way to make my body match its hunger didnt make it less real i closed my eyes and reached down inside myself like a metaphysical hand reaching into a sack searching for what i needed auggie inadvertently helped me he jerked me off my knees with a crushing grip on my arms it hurt but the pain didnt blow my concentration no the beast liked anger anger and pain meant we had to fight and we were good at fighting always before the beast had been a process but now it was like a switch in my head one moment me the next something that wasnt thinking about sex or even food escape escape escape i screamed into his face wordless ragefilled he jerked me close to his face he grabbed my hair and tried for that kiss but it was too late for kisses too late for so much i bit him sank my teeth into his pouting lower lip the grip on my hair became painful and he tried to control my face my head my mouth with that bruising grip he couldnt pull me off before i bit through his lip and he seemed to know that because his other hand went to my jaw the way youd grip an animal at the hinge of the jaw pressing inward if you have the strength you can force an animal not to bite down completely if you have the strength you can pry him off he had the strength to keep me from biting his lip off but that was all unless he was willing to crush my jaw i kept trying to bite him and he kept me from doing it if thered been enough person left in me id have gone for my gun or the knife but id given up thoughts of knives and guns when i embraced my beast all i could think of was teeth and claws i raked my nails down his hands bloodied him in ribbons to try to get free he was going to have to cripple me or let me go but he had one other option and he used it he threw another burst of power into me he raised the ardeur again drowned my beast in desire and things that are only partly about mating if hed been like some of belles line and only affected me physically the beast wouldnt have left but his flavor of belle mortes power was more human it was not just lust but love he had the ability to make you love him evil did not begin to cover what he did to me because in that moment i loved him loved him completely and utterly part of me that was still sane prayed dont let this be permanent i went up on my knees stretching toward that full mouth that a moment before id been trying to bite off i gave him the kiss hed wanted the fresh blood didnt make it horrible he was a vampire and roses roses on the air like some cloying perfume i was drowning in the scent of it so that as i kissed him the blood tasted of roses auggie jerked back from me roses oh god you taste of roses he pulled back enough to see my face and the fear showed on his face your eyes anita your eyes id seen belle mortes eyes in my face before her pale brown eyes like dark honey filled with fire i stared up at auggie with her eyes and she saw him too while her dark light filled my eyes she saw what i saw she whispered through my mind did you truly believe that jeanclaude being a sourdre de sang would keep you safe from me anita yeah actually i had she knew and thought it was funny as hell what do you want i asked fear like fine champagne was tingling through my body the ardeur the beast all of it was washed away under that rush of fear she gazed up at auggie kneeling above us and i knew what she wanted i felt regret in her regret that auggie had gone from her bed and her body but you exiled him i said stay out of my thoughts anita she was sitting on the edge of her huge fourposter bed a bed id seen once before in jeanclaudes memories she was curled there a white gown centuries out of date covering the lushness of her body so that she looked petite like a dainty pouting child as she leaned against the carved wood her hair was a wealth of dark waves longer than my own for the first time i realized that we looked at least superficially alike petite brunettes with icepale skin and brown eyes i was the greatest beauty in all of europe how dare you compare yourself to me her power lashed through me like the sharp blow of a whip forgive me i said because id meant no disrespect i hadnt meant i was as beautiful as she only that we shared some traits the thought mollified her but it also freed her to concentrate on why shed entered me in the first place not good augustine she said her voice spilling in a lower alto purr than my normal voice it wasnt her voice exactly because she had to use my throat but it wasnt my voice either it was close enough to hers to widen auggies eyes and make him go paler than death itself i dont know if id ever seen a vampire go pale before how is this possible he whispered you called me she said with my lips your power and your blood called me he swallowed rolling his lips when he did it so that the blood seeped faster from the cut the bite was healing as we watched but it was still bleeding i did not mean you caused her to love you augustine as you tried to force me to do but no one forces belle morte no one forgive me i did not know what my powers could do he whispered it hands still on my arms but gentle now his hold was so loose that i could have broken away easily but it was too late for that to matter we had bigger problems than the ardeur but i can enjoy you again here and now and it will not be i who falls in love but her it will cause her pain and jeanclaude pain it will even cause you pain she laughed sitting on her bed hundreds and hundreds of miles away for as requiem can raise the bodys lust in his victim he also raises it in himself so once you force a woman to love you you love her back it is the nature of our bloodline that our powers are twoedged again i felt regret in her i knew in that moment that once auggie had used his power to its full extent the effect wasnt temporary no anita she said inside my head talking to me from the firelit edge of her bed it is quite permanent i assure you then you love she lashed out again with that sharp power it stopped what id been about to say and let her speak all love belle morte all adore me it is my nature to be loved but id been too close to her mind too often not to understand her better than that lust i said out loud all lust after belle morte lust love what difference the word it means the same but we were too deeply wedded together she knew my thought on that that lust and love arent the same thing at all and that thought was so loud that i felt her stumble in her mind felt her doubt for half a moment i felt doubt there and it wasnt i who put that seed of doubt in her mind it was already there had been there since jeanclaude and asher left her side voluntarily centuries ago they returned to me anita dont forget that they could not live without belle morte she was on her knees on the bed now face beautiful in her anger but i knew better than most what lay behind anger fear enough of this she shouted and that shout echoed through my mind my body and hit auggie like a blow he staggered fighting to stay on his knees to hold me but her power was there her version of the ardeur the original all that had come from belle morte were but pieces of her own power we were reflections of her the real thing roared over me tore a scream from my mouth and auggie echoed me her power tried to spill out from us tried to fill the room and touch everything near us auggie threw up a wall around it he used his will his power as a master of the city to hold it back but it wouldnt last for long i tried to call necromancy id used it to chase her out before but i couldnt shut down the ardeur until that was cleared i was useless he found his words before i did everyone out out all of you we cant hold it like this for long when we lose control it will fill this room it spreads by touch micah said auggie shook his head this isnt jeanclaudes ardeur this is belles proximity is enough he shuddered shoulders hunching as if some great weight were beginning to crush him samuel get your family out you dont know what this could make you do a voice from behind us with more french accent than i usually heard in it said augustine what have you done to ma petite the power she pressesi looked at him and the words stopped belle morte he said it flat as if hed just swallowed all the emotion he had he was dressed in his signature colors black and white a black velvet jacket barely touched the top of his waist the white lace of his shirt spilled out between that blackness held at the neck by the cameo that had been one of my first presents to him the pants were leather and looked poured on the kneehigh black boots were some of the plainest he owned of course with his body gliding toward us there was nothing plain about him we both knew the potential of his body too intimately to ever believe such simple camouflage because it was a we and because it was a we she knew why jeanclaude had his black curls pulled back in a ponytail she knew why the clothes were elegant but some of his least expensive why he wore almost no jewelry he had planned to appear as the visiting masters had last seen him he was going to hide what he truly was let them wonder about his power it was a gamble that i had disagreed with i thought it was like baiting them look how powerless i am try me jeanclaude said that he had never gotten in trouble when dealing with other masters by hiding some of his abilities it was a strategy that had saved his life in the past she used me to say i see you jeanclaude all these simple games do not hide you from belle morte but you were right to come humble before me as i like my men i stared at him with belle mortes eyes while she laughed and laughed and laughed on her big empty bed i thought empty since when did belle sleep alone that thought made her stumble in her mind again a moment of hesitation but jeanclaude took it he used it to put himself at my back to fold all the velvet and leather of his body around me so that he and auggie faced each other across me belle roared back through me but in some ways her moment had passed jeanclaude was sourdre de sang and i was his human servant touching she could not turn me against him but she left us with a parting gift an evil whisper in my mind you are sourdre de sang you can chase me out but you cannot cure what augustine has begun when i leave her mind the ardeur will still be there it will spread to the three of you and you will do things together that you have not done in centuries she was in my head so i couldnt hide that this was the first id heard of auggie and jeanclaude being more than friends she laughed in her firelit bedroom all those miles away she spoke through me that alto purr trying to come out of my mouth oh jeanclaude you did not tell her that you and augustine were lovers jeanclaude was very still against my body as if he were holding his breath i realized he was waiting for me to react to what shed said he was waiting for me to be angry and make the disaster that was about to happen even worse but i surprised us all i wasnt shocked i dont know why but i wasnt id known he hadnt come to me a virgin i even knew that hed had other male lovers besides asher of course knowing something in the abstract wasnt the same as having the fact kneeling in front of you holding you in his arms i looked up at auggie and expected to be upset but maybe auggies powers had done something to me or maybe i was picking up jeanclaudes emotion or even belles whatever the reason i gazed up at the man in front of me and saw the line of his face from temple to jaw like the stroke of some fine painting the charcoalgray eyes had lost their fire fear and willpower had shut down some of his vampiric powers but even empty of anything but him the eyes were utterly compelling it wasnt just the lace of black lashes and the drowning color that for the first time convinced me that gray could be as beautiful as blue but the look in those eyes he stared down at me like a drowning man something of pain and loss so raw that it tightened my throat my reaction was sympathy belles was not she was glad so terribly glad that after all these centuries the sight of her eyes could still fill him with such pain she wanted him to hurt wanted him to suffer wanted him to feel cast out driven from paradise by the hand of a vengeful god or i guess in this case goddess augustines power meant that i watched his pain as one freshly fallen in love in that first blinding overwhelming rush where youll do or say almost anything to make each other happy i wanted to make it all better to kiss it and make it all go away no belle said no they lied to you you should feel betrayed heartbroken sorry to disappoint you i said but she knew i didnt mean it so calm anita see through my eyes and your lovely calm will not survive i knew i still knelt held between jeanclaude and augustine but i was trapped in belles memories so that we sat on a throne in a huge dark torchlit room augustine was tied to a metal framework the naked line of his body exposed to all he had come begging belle to take him back she had refused but offered one more taste of the ardeur these werent thoughts i was in her head so deeply that i shared her memories she meant to humiliate him he had made her love him and that she could not forgive jeanclaude and asher appeared before the throne they were dressed in long cloaks that hid all but their faces ashers face had the flawless beauty that had once been his so this memory was from a time before he and jeanclaude left belle to save julianna the woman they both loved from belles jealousy jeanclaude and asher were still her perfect pair her matched beauties that did all we asked i knew they were naked under the cloaks i knew what she meant them to do augustines voice next to my ear startled me but did not break belles memory it was like a voice from on high you are her master jeanclaude do not let belle show this to anita it was as if his voice helped call me back because the person talking was not the person tied there the jeanclaude he spoke to was not the servant who stood before this throne this had happened long long ago it wasnt real anymore it happened anita just as i will show it to you ma petite jeanclaude said can you hear me i blinked up at them saw their faces looming over me but belles power roared through my head no anita you will see the reality of it i was back in that torchlit room i could feel their hands on me but all i could see was what belle showed me touch her bare skin auggie said asher and jeanclaude began to glide around the bound man it was almost a dance the swaying of cloaks the grace of their movements hands glided over my bare arms the moment his bare skin touched me the memory began to grow dark it was as if the lights were dimming hiding what was happening no belle shouted and she pulled me back into that dark hall all those centuries ago the cloaks were gone and their bodies were pale and perfect i heard augustine protest you promised me the ardeur i keep all my promises augustine jeanclaude glowed like some dark star laying only his hand on the naked back of the other man augustine said ah now i understand he lifted his face at an awkward angle to look back along his body at jeanclaude jeanclaude knelt in front of him so he didnt have to strain he cupped augustines chin in his hand and spoke so low that belle could have not heard it i have given you but a taste if you find my touch repulsive then i can stop he put his face next to augustines mouth as if he were kissing the other mans neck he gave augustine a chance to breathe his answer you have such fine control over the ardeur so soon oui if this is but a taste and all she will allow me then i want it jeanclaude pulled back enough to see the other mans face he cupped augustines face in his hands i realized that i was seeing jeanclaudes face through augustines eyes i watched augustine see the uncertainty in the other mans eyes would you risk her anger to save me i do not enjoy force asher knelt beside jeanclaude and there was a look id never seen on his face arrogance fierceness something predatory and something else something dangerous and unpleasant ashers voice fell into the memory jeanclaude do not let anita see me like this until that moment i hadnt known asher was somewhere in the room waiting for us to win or lose this battle and he was seeing what belle was forcing me to see how was she doing this you are all blood of my blood anita i can do many things to that which is mine hands on me cloth tearing my body jerking with the force of it the coolness of air on my back jeanclaudes chest and stomach pressed against my back the lace of his white shirt only a frame for our flesh but the moment that much of his skin touched mine the memory turned black and belle was back on the edge of her big bed in the flickering light of candles her anger filled her eyes with dark honey flame she had never known that jeanclaude gave auggie a choice all these long years ago jeanclaudes bare arms wrapped around my nearly naked upper body he wrapped his arms around me cradled me as close to his body as the gun and knife at my back would allow augustines hands were still in mine as if he couldnt or wouldnt let me go but it was jeanclaudes body that chased her back that shut down the memory your body can stop me but i leave you two parting gifts jeanclaude and augustine the first is the ardeur that will claim the three of you and if i push hard enough will spread through the room to all that are left i feel asher andshe closed her eyes licked her lips mmm requiem is there as well they will try to hold it back when it happens perhaps they will succeed perhaps not then she looked directly at us and it was as if she could see us truly see us such concentration in those eyes my second is a question to you and a gift for anita have you realized one of her talents jeanclaude that she can borrow the abilities that are used against her my ability to make living memories i give to her now just this once i want her to have it to use and i will not fight her magics ability to take it i will let her take this power to her mind and i leave her with this question do you really believe that augustine and jeanclaude only had sex this one time or were there more cloth tore and more of jeanclaude pressed against me i close this door to you belle for she is mine not yours im going im going enjoy my gifts but i was still tied close enough to her mind to know that she had no choice she pretended she did but jeanclaude had chased her out the last thing i felt from her was regret regret for the men she left me with that i had them and she did not i came up gasping as if id been underwater i was down to nothing but bra and panties the skirt suit ripped away my gun with its holster had vanished with the skirt jeanclaudes clothes were mostly gone as well is there anything your bloodline does that doesnt involve getting naked he laughed that wonderful touchable laugh and i wasnt the only one who reacted to it auggie shivered as he gripped my hands he was still in his expensive suit even his tie tight in place hed behaved himself admirably i looked around the room and found it empty except for asher on the side near the outer door and requiem on the side near the hallway that led farther into the underground asher with his golden hair that hid the scars the church had given him when they tried to burn the devil out of him with holy water requiem tall and pale with hair almost as dark as mine and jeanclaudes his face was graced by a mustache and a small trimmed beard though tonight he looked like something big had hit him on the side of the face they both held their arms up and out from their bodies i could feel power radiating from them i realized theyd thrown up the vampiric equivalent of a power circle to try to hold in the ardeur and the memories to stop it from spreading i relaxed in jeanclaudes arms squeezed augustines hands there was a whisper in my mind were there other times was it my thought or hers i didnt know and it didnt matter because the question came and the thought was enough i was thrown into the middle of a memory that had me clawing for air auggie on top pressing jeanclaudes body into a bed non ma petite non his body pressed against me all that lovely nakedness but it wasnt enough this wasnt belles power imposed on me shed figured out what id only discovered recently myself that i could borrow powers from vamps if they used those powers on me first some powers were more permanent than others some didnt take at all but this one was taking this one was taking and i couldnt stop it i screamed and auggies arms were bare under my hands but it didnt help it didnt help then have all the memory anita auggie said see it all we were in a room small but elegant auggie sat in a chair jeanclaude was down on one knee before him hat in hand head bowed this auggies yellow hair was down to his shoulders he wore blue and silver gray with too much lace for my taste so the rumors are true you have left her voluntarily jeanclaude nodded and looked up i have auggie laughed you leave heaven voluntarily when i cry in hell for one last glimpse of it he shook his head sighed the humor vanishing from his face but if you are strong enough to leave heaven i will get you to the coast i know a ship and a captain that i trust what is the destination of the ship the english colonies the united states of america they are called now but honestly jeanclaude does it matter where it goes as long as you are off the continent and far from her jeanclaude bowed his head again as if whatever was in his eyes he didnt wish to share i cannot pay you augustine i have left with nothing it is a gift in honor of your bravery at leaving paradise not once but twice twice when i would give everything i have to go back jeanclaude raised his face beautiful and empty his face when he was hiding what he was thinking is it belle you miss or the ardeur both i cannot give you belle but the ardeur is mine to share such eagerness on augustines face for an instant a need so raw it filled his eyes with fire like lightnings glow behind gray clouds then his face stilled all that hunger hiding away but we had seen it for in that instant i was no longer seeing the room like some floating phantom i was inside jeanclaudes head as i had been inside him and belle in the earlier memory augustines voice was as empty as his face when he said it is a gift jeanclaude i would be your friend friends do not count the costs of favors we were surprised and had been too long with belle morte to trust it i would have bargained my body to gain what you offer so freely augustine and that is why i offer it freely yes i long to be with her again i will love her until the end of the world but i did not always like her or what she forced us to do his face darkened with memories but he waved them away and smiled i would have stayed with her forever doing her bidding her willing slave even though i knew her to be evil i was too he seemed to search for a word immersed in her to ever wish to save myself or save all those she wished me to enslave for her if she had not cast me out i would never have been strong enough to go you refused direct orders from her some at her court still speak of it he nodded even someone as weak as i am has things he will not do such sorrow on his face such loss we laid our cheek against his hand where it lay on the chair arm we rolled our eyes upward so we could watch his face his hand was very still under our cheek as if hed stopped breathing let me share the one gift i have with my only friend he fought to keep the eagerness off his face but only half succeeded you do not have to do this jeanclaude i meant what i said it is my gift to you there was a tension in his hand where it lay as if his body fought to be still but his hand betrayed him i know your preference is for women as is yours auggie said yes but belle does not share her personal men with other women auggie smiled and the smile was friendly but nothing more it didnt match the growing tension in the hand that lay under our cheek his voice was mild as he said unless it is a woman she wished for us to seduce we smiled too for money or land or politics oui we shared a smile made up of centuries in her bed pawns in her great plans i am the only one of her line to have inherited the full power of the ardeur augustine and there are none of our blood in this new america so my last opportunity to taste the ardeur and yours to be with another master of belle mortes line is tonight we nodded our face rubbing along his hand he took his hand gently out from under us you are frightened he said and his face was soft with wonder i am then why leave her because i could not stay not and be hated by them both both we could not hide the tears except by turning our faces away augustine came down on the floor with us he held us while we cried it is not belle that has broken your heart it is asher we wept for the first time in months wept into his arms and he kissed our tears away and we sought comfort in the only arms that we trusted our only friend the earlier memory returned of them in the sheets but it wasnt shocking this time i was ready for it knew what to expect and i knew that this jeanclaude had been the one who spent over twenty years as a happy couple with asher and julianna this jeanclaude had lost julianna and asher julianna burned as a witch and asher consumed by hatred at jeanclaude for not getting there in time to save her this jeanclaude still blamed himself jeanclaude had taken the wounded asher back to belle mortes court to save his life and the bargain for that salvation was that jeanclaude was her whipping boy for a hundred years the jeanclaude in augustines bed had lost everything and everyone hed ever loved he took the only comfort he could find and i couldnt begrudge him that the memory faded round the edges because it wasnt the sex that was important to me or jeanclaude or even augustine it was the emotion of it i came back gasping pulse in my throat if thats a memory then why does it almost hurt to come out of it i do not know ma petite but we have not much time i could not stop the memory but i was able to direct it i wanted you to understand what happened between us because i cannot stop what is about to happen we have fought her to give me time to soften the blow we i looked up at augustine and his eyes held sorrow the way jeanclaudes could hold lust well hold it as long as we can jeanclaude but hurry whatever you are going to do hurry ashers voice but it held sorrow to match auggies eyes i looked at asher and found his face traced with the faintly reddish lines of vampire tears i realized then that everyone in the room had shared the memory i am sorry anita auggie said and he looked across me at jeanclaude sorry to you both sorry about what exactly i asked this he said softly and it was as if theyd both been holding their breaths and suddenly they let go they dropped their shields their wills broke together and the ardeur was suddenly there smothering us all i thought i heard laughter dim and echoing belles laughter somewhere deep inside my head the ardeur came and the clothes went the custommade leather knife sheath ripped away with all the rest we fell to the carpet naked all hands and mouths the heavy metal and glass coffee table got shoved to one side as if it weighed nothing i pressed auggies muscled body onto the carpet lay on top of him naked feeling that he was already hard and ready but i wanted to start at the other end we kissed and his lips were as full and ripe as theyd looked he kissed delicately though i knew the ardeur rode him and what he wanted to do was anything but delicate i licked and kissed along his neck his upper chest i came to his nipples pale and hard in the muscled swell of his chest id never been with anyone who was such a serious weight lifter it was as if his skin fit tighter over all those muscles so that it was harder to get a grip with my teeth but worth the effort sucking on his nipple raised his upper body off the floor tore a yell from him his eyes were wide surprised his hands reaching for something to hold on to someone grabbed one of those reaching hands and i knew who it was before auggie drew him into my line of sight auggie drew jeanclaude in to him drew him down as he lay back against the floor and i worked lower on his body i licked and bit along his stomach as he drew jeanclaude down for a kiss something i did raised auggie up off the ground as their mouths touched so that i had a good view of it i had never seen two men kiss not like that not with lips and tongue in the months that asher had been in our bed they had moved toward each other a time or two but stopped i had never asked whose sensibilities they were saving mine or theirs now watching jeanclaude cradling auggie in his arms and kissing him so thoroughly it tightened my body so hard and fast that it was like a miniorgasm id been told by a very smart friend that to keep saying that i didnt like to be in bed with two men at once was a little silly a case of the lady protesting too much my body reacted for me the sight of them kissing just flat did it for me ive been told that its how a lot of men feel about seeing two women kiss why should i be any different i worked my way down auggies body eyes rolled upward so i could watch them i came to the long hard curve of auggies body not straight but truly curved so that the grace of that hard flesh curled in against his own body he was hard enough that the head was naked above the silky foreskin i rolled my mouth over that head then shoved as much of him into my mouth as i could as fast and hard as i could it made me come up choking but it also tore him away from jeanclaudes mouth made auggie stare down at me with wild eyes i went down on him again slower lingering over the feel of him in my mouth so ripe so thick and how the hard line of that curve felt going down my throat i watched them both watch me as i did it auggies eyes wild with sensation jeanclaudes face full of pleasure yes but also pride his own vampire marks were open enough for me to know that he was thinking how long and how hard he had worked to get to this point he started to close the marks as much as the ardeur would let him but i rose up from auggies body and said dont dont close down lets do this do it all he started this fight not us lets finish it do you know what you are asking ma petite i nodded then shook my head my hand still wrapped around the base of auggies body i dont know but i wont blame you later please auggie said his voice full of such pleading please dont stop god dont stop jeanclaude and i looked at each other we had a moment where he weighed me with his eyes then he gave a small nod and said as you like ma petite for you are correct he overstepped the bounds of hospitality he looked down at auggie bad augustine to force the ardeur on ma petite auggie nodded his hand gripping jeanclaudes arm its been so long jeanclaude so long and there is no going back to her we must feed on you augustine in such a way that no other visiting master will dare this he nodded though i wasnt certain he really understood what jeanclaude had meant jeanclaude was holding the ardeur back just enough enough so we could think a little when he let it go it would sweep us away and there would be no secondchance decisions he has to be our message to the other visitors jeanclaude or we wont survive this little gathering these are your friends and they nearly rolled us i looked at him and i felt the part of me that allowed me to kill to do what was necessary this was in its odd way a business decision a political decision a survival decision i knew we could roll auggie he was more powerful than jeanclaude but i could feel it feel that we could feed on him in such a way that it wouldnt matter not kill him but take him make him ours in a way that i couldnt even explain in words jeanclaude spoke as if hed read my mind which he probably had i feel it also ma petite but no buts i said we can take him i can feel it perhaps belle morte is too much in your mind still it was ashers voice strangled with effort it drew our eyes to him his hands trembled in the air as if he were holding some great weight hurry jeanclaude hurry we cannot hold the circle much longer he began this fight requiem said let us finish it his hands werent shaking but there was a thread of strain in his voice jeanclaude looked down at auggie understand this augustine we have never fed like this i do not entirely know what will happen are you content with such a gamble for it is you who will suffer if it goes badly i slid my mouth over him playing my tongue along the foreskin he shivered and simply said yes ma petite stop that or he will not be able to think i went back on my knees and stopped touching him i put my hands in my lap and behaved i guess it was cheating augustine do you agree to this he nodded hands reaching for jeanclaude yes yes god yes the two of you both yes yes his grip on jeanclaudes arm looked almost painful jeanclaude stroked his hair soothing him then we will do as you ask he looked at me and it was as if a door opened in my mind some inner guard that he must have used almost constantly to keep the marks from being in full force was gone it staggered me for a moment made me reach out to auggies thigh to steady myself the moment i touched him the ardeur roared back but this time i could feel jeanclaude at the other end of his body i could feel the two different ardeurs like different flavors of fire and auggie was our only wood wed burn him up and he wanted us to do it i heard jeanclaude in my mind whispering i am letting go of my control ma petite are you ready i nodded he let go and i fell screaming into the abyss an abyss of skin and hands and mouths and bodies my own body was one huge throbbing need and i didnt particularly care how that need got met i ended up on the floor with augustine on top of me all that curved hardness going in and out of my body so that i screamed for him screamed my need my pleasure and my eagerness he began propped on his arms so i could watch his flesh slide into mine but then jeanclaude joined us and the angle had to change we had never put anyone in the middle of us when we both fed the ardeur all these months with asher micah nathaniel richard and jason and id always been the one in the middle jeanclaude and i had fed from each other he had fed from me while i fed at the man or men touching me but never in all those nights had jeanclaude been touched by someone other than me when we were all naked together with the marks roaring open between us i knew how much that had cost jeanclaude how horribly careful he had had to be in the middle of the one moment when you should be able to lose all control so careful so afraid of scaring me disgusting me making me turn away so afraid of what the other men might say with a badly placed hand or caress so careful so terribly careful and now suddenly he didnt have to be careful i felt the horrible tension in the center of his being relax like a longheld breath released he explored auggie first with fingers and used the wetness of my body to lubricate other places that didnt normally lubricate themselves the marks were wide open so i got flashes of memory of other men and other times random images as they occurred to him but even here he chased them away still afraid of what id think but auggies body was already inside mine and i felt his eagerness at every probe every touch everything that jeanclaude did urged him on to more with me so that all i could think was how would it feel to have auggie thrusting inside me while jeanclaude rode him jeanclaude entered him slowly and auggies body stilled above mine as he concentrated on the sensation of it it had been a long time for auggie as hed said before he preferred girls which meant that even here with both of us eager jeanclaude had to be careful so careful nothing spoils great sex like unintentional pain but finally he had everything in he was getting in and auggies body relaxed above me relaxed into the rhythm that jeanclaude found on top of us both they both found a rhythm auggies body pushing in and out of mine slowly ramming home at the end so that i made small sounds at the height of every stroke the two of them found a rhythm together so that the height of one stroke was the height of the other so that auggie and i cried out together and jeanclaude rode us both i tried to move with them but the combined weight pinned me to the floor so that the best i could do was squeezing auggie as he came and went inside me my legs were wrapped around them both as much as i could so that jeanclaudes body brushed against my foot as he moved i felt that heavy delicious weight begin to grow between my legs i knew that orgasm was coming and that this one couldnt afford to be a surprise but i didnt have to tell jeanclaude he knew he stared down at me over augustines shoulder his eyes all drowning blue fire as if a midnight sky could burn his hair had come loose strands of it sticking to the sweat on his face i knew that my eyes were dark brown flame as if i were a vampire it had happened before we stared at each other over augustines shoulder and i felt that weight growing growing growing augustine whispered your breathings changed i came screaming and it was as if that had been the moment both men had been waiting for as if they had fought long and hard not to go and suddenly they could augustine shoved himself twice three times as fast and hard as he could inside me he brought me again screaming and writhing on the floor and only then did he go inside me his body spasming above me his body trying to dig deeper inside me so that i cried out jeanclaudes head went back eyes closed his body bowed above us both and we fed we didnt just feed off augustine we fed off all his people in our territory i felt haven the werelion spasm against the floor where he still lay in the fallen curtains i felt benny behind the wheel of a car lose control and have to screech to the side of the highway pierce fell against a wall and slid to the floor his body spasming octavius collapsed on the stairs choking clawing at the stone breaking his nails to bloody bits to try to keep it from happening but nothing could save them any of them if wed been in chicago we could have fed off every beast and vamp that owed allegiance to auggie and he would have let us for this pleasure he would have sold what was left of his soul and the souls of everyone who worked for him we drank them down all of them we fed and fed and fed and while we fed augustines body kept spasming and every thrust of pleasure brought me again which brought jeanclaude we fed and orgasmed until augustine went still between us collapsed body twitching jeanclaude looked down at me over auggies sweating body a fierce smile on his face he stared down at me with his eyes gone to blue fire so bright that the skin of his face glowed with it he glowed with the power we had drunk so much power so very much power i felt like a distant echo that richard was leaning against a wall somewhere staggered by the power wed taken and shared a thought was enough micah and nathaniel were sitting just outside one against the wall the other sitting on the floor nathaniel laughed with the power rush of it all wed shared the power with all our people all of them good bad indifferent everyone with a connection to us was power drunk and glowing tonight if there had been a metaphysical satellite up there in the sky our territory would have glowed from orbit it took about an hour to get everyone separated to places where they could clean up claudia had sent for reinforcements so that the wrecked living room was nearly a solid wall of blackshirted guards werewolves wererats and werehyenas the people we had treaties with for guard work all stood around while octavius had hysterics if hed had more guards with him and wed had less it could have gotten violent but when youre outnumbered outmuscled and your master is saying let it go well octavius had to eat it he didnt like it neither did pierce but haven of the cookiemonsterblue hair was voting with auggie they both liked us just fine jeanclaude and i lay back in his huge bathtub my clothes were ruined but i had my knife and gun on the edge of the tub nothing else had been salvageable wed scrubbed and cleaned and now were just soaking in the hot water auggie had probably already finished in the showers down the hall but requiem and asher were in charge of seeing that our guests didnt do anything unfortunate they were both master vampires over four hundred years old they could handle it wed handled everything i wanted to handle for one night jeanclaude lay back against the edge of the tub and i lay in his arms the back of my body cradled against the front of his he trailed his hand down my arm and hugged me tighter against him his body was quiet pressed against my body i think wed both had all we could handle for one night his voice came lazy with that edge that sleep can give it what are you thinking about ma petite if you hadnt shut the marks down so tight you might not have to ask i snuggled my head into the hollow of his shoulder and chest you shut them down as soon as we were finished with auggie why his body tensed against me even his arms where they were wrapped around me not so comforting anymore perhaps i was afraid of what you would find in my thoughts his voice wasnt sleepy now but had that bland emptiness that he used to hide behind what would i have found i asked but i wasnt cuddling now tension is contagious if i had wanted you to know the answer to that question i would not have shut the marks down i started to protest but another thought stopped me with the marks that wide open it had only been chance that i hadnt thought of the baby question chance and the fact that the ardeur tended to wipe out anything that wasnt pertinent to the moment now the fear came crawling back tightening my stomach tensing my muscles please god dont let me be pregnant what is wrong ma petite he asked i let out a breath that shook around the edges and said you know jeanclaude normally id push for honesty but i think ive had all the revelations i can handle for one night its okay whatever you thought its okay it is okay without your ever knowing what the thought was he asked i settled back into his arms willing the hot water and the touch of his body to take away that awful tension yes i said yes he moved me to the side holding me in the water so he could see my face yes just like that his face showed his skepticism i stared up into him his hair was wet and slicked back from his face so that nothing took away from it those eyes a blue as dark as blue could be and hold no touch of black his lashes thick and black it had taken me months in his bed to see his upper lashes by candlelight and realize that he had a double row of upper lashes him and elizabeth taylor you only saw it if the light was just right and his head turned just right until then they were just this unbelievable lace around his eyes i traced the lines and curves of his face down to the grace of his lips i let him see in my eyes what i saw what i felt gazing at him he leaned in and laid a kiss upon my lips then he cuddled me back against him as wed been before the questions started no more personal questions tonight but there were other questions i wanted answered why did requiem look like someone had pounded his face into a wall because someone had that made me turn enough to look at him who meng die he said voice soft face solemn was that the emergency oui thank you for sending the extra guards ma petite it was wise of you i shrugged and turned so that i was sitting across his legs my hands against his chest his arms around me still but i could see his face now how did it get so out of hand i was called in rather late ma petite in truth i do not know exactly how requiem and meng die allowed their spat to get so terribly out of hand and so terribly public asher as manager of the circus came down to stop it or take it to a backstage area that should have been the end of it his face was closing down hiding what he thought of the fight and the aftermath why wasnt that the end of it because meng die decided to fight them both i sat up in his lap why fight asher shes never been his lover but he is your lover i frowned at him so what i believe that if a master vampire had appeared who wasnt in your bed had never been in your bed the fight might have calmed instead of escalating im totally lost here jeanclaude he looked directly at me but his face was empty enough that it gave me nothing you have not asked the right question yet ma petite what is the right question what the fight was about i frowned harder and said okay i give what was the fight about you now i was really lost what they were arguing about you what about me meng die thinks you have stolen requiem from her i pushed back enough in the water so i was kneeling and not cuddled the water was deep enough that it came to my shoulders requiem isnt my lover ive worked really hard to make sure he isnt my lover but you have fed the ardeur from him in an emergency yes it was to feed or i was about to suck damians life away i had to feed but we didnt have intercourse we didnt even take our clothes off i thought about it and added not all of our clothes i mean requiem was fully clothed i started blushing and couldnt prevent it i had to stop explaining before it sounded worse and worse he has offered to feed you more completely i know why have you refused him i looked at jeanclaude trying to see behind that perfect mask of a face i think i was under the impression that im having sex with enough men his lips twitched he was fighting not to smile this isnt funny he let himself smile ma petite there have been women over the centuries who traded lands titles their honor everything for one more night in requiems bed his master in london used him much as belle morte used asher and me though because requiem only did women he wasnt as flexible as we i let that last part go i still wasnt completely sure how i felt about jeanclaude doing auggie at the time i hadnt minded in fact id liked it id liked us both doing him at the same time wed fucked him in every way possible physically and metaphysically and it had felt afuckingmazing that last part was probably going to bug me the most but one disaster at a time are you saying youre surprised i turned him down no it is typical of you to turn a man down at first at first i said and sounded a little outraged he laughed and it was that touchable sound as if it were the sound of pure sex and it went through my head and all the way down my body stop that i said he smiled face lit with suppressed laughter but he stopped to my knowledge the only man you have never said no to is your nimirraj micah but the ardeur was newly woken and so i do not think we can count that one completely it was your exception not your rule fine but im still lost i have avoided requiem graham made some remark that requiem was refusing meng dies bed and somehow that was my fault apparently requiem told meng die that he would not be her lover any longer because you do not share your men with other women he seemed to believe that his being in her bed was what kept you from accepting his offer to be your new pomme de sang i shook my head he shouldnt have assumed that he nodded because that isnt why you refused him is it i shook my head hard enough to move the water around my body no and if requiem had asked me why i was saying no i would have told him it wasnt because he was screwing meng die then why what does it matter because he has left his lovers bed in the hope that you will take him to your bed he is third in rank among my vampires and second or perhaps third in power meng die is powerful enough to be my secondincommand but her temperament is not suited to it as she demonstrated today you have set two of my most powerful vampires at each others throats ma petite i need to know why i did not start that fight i said no but you were the cause of it and if you are to convince requiem that you will not take him as your pomme de sang then you must give him a reason that does not include his being meng dies lover his reasoning was sound ma petite you have refused all the pomme de sang candidates who have a female lover graham clay and requiem are all meng dies lovers i said he gave that wonderful gallic shrug that meant everything and nothing so is it that you will not take meng dies seconds i shook my head no thats not it you know why not graham he might do for a meal but hed be a disaster as a permanent member of the household agreed he said clay is in love with meng die shes just about broken his heart but he wants her and i say more power to him and requiem i leaned back against the side of the tub out of reach the bath had stopped being comforting did we have to do this tonight meng die threw both requiem and asher around like dolls in front of humans we will be lucky if your police do not come calling and asking questions she tried to kill requiem ma petite not wound him she did not care that there was an audience but requiem and asher did not want to kill her in front of an audience i had the same problem when i arrived on the scene he was angry now the first thread of it filling his eyes with light she is even now locked in a crosswrapped coffin but it is a temporary measure i must let her out tomorrow night or kill her she will see one night as a fit punishment but beyond that it will be an insult and she is too powerful to eat such an insult he fixed those brilliant eyes on me so i ask again what will you tell requiem when he tells you that he is free of meng die what excuse will you give im dating three men living with two more and having occasional sex with two others thats seven men im like a pornographic snow white i think seven is plenty but it is not ma petite emotionally it may be too many but metaphysically and for the sake of our power base seven is not enough you must add a lover who is not metaphysically connected to you and you must pick a new pomme de sang now that nathaniel is your animal to call i thought this was optional youre making it sound like its almost an emergency and wait did you say add a lover and a pomme de sang i thought i was adding just one if i added anybody i tasted your power tonight ma petite it needs to be fed and fed well you are like one of those dieting women that thinks she can survive on lettuce leaves and water it may feel like food but your body dies anyway im not dying i said no but your power is seeking a new pomme de sang dont you understand what is happening ma petite the ardeur is seeking for you okay im confused now it is not like augustine to lose control he is over two thousand years old ma petite one of the first vampires belle made you do not thrive for so long if you make such mistakes as he did this night belle messed with him and with me he shook his head he raised your ardeur first before she appeared did he not yeah he said now he could do what hed wanted to do all along and no one could be mad at him jeanclaude laughed and it was just humor this time he could control his laugh if he worked at it he doesnt know you very well yet but when i said augustine is my friend i meant it he would not have overstepped his bounds as my guest not without something being wrong and whats wrong the ardeur needs more food ma petite and like any predator it is seeking prey its just a metaphysical ability jeanclaude not its own entity he gave me a look and it was eloquent you know exactly what the ardeur is ma petite you know that it has a mind of its own similar to the beasts you carry but i believe that the ardeur can do something your beasts cannot it is i believe putting out the welcome mat welcome mat he sighed and slid down in the water until his chin touched it you may not like meng die but she is proficient in bed i find it inexplicable that requiem would leave her body on only the chance that he might be your lover as i find it inexplicable that augustine would purposefully insult me by raising the ardeur in you he in effect attacked you and through you me he told me to feed from him because then id win the fight and once you got into the room he said youd lose jeanclaude sat up so abruptly that he sloshed water in my face i brushed my eyes clear while he said he said that i blinked at him still trying to keep water out of my eyes yes then it is as i have feared the ardeur is seeking what it needs are you saying that the ardeur is putting out what pheromones i do not know this word pheromones its a chemical or hormone that some animals give out the scent attracts mates i think it was first discovered in moths yes pheromones then yes im not agreeing with you but say it is true why does it only seem to work on certain people i mean it doesnt work on clay and i think graham just wants to fuck why requiem and auggie what do they have in common he asked theyre both vamps of belles bloodline and theyre both masters but thanks to all our imports from london there are a couple more vampires in town who qualify they arent buzzing around me but they do not approach the power level of augustine and requiem are you saying the ardeur is shopping for powerful food i offer it as an idea i thought about it but finally looked at him if this is whats happening and im not saying it is then is it only vamps from belles line or any master vampire of a certain power level i do not know then we need to know before tomorrows big party i said if there is even the faintest chance that the ardeur is going to do some funky shit with every master vampire above a certain power level then no way can i go to the party tomorrow were going to be neckdeep in masters of the city it would be bad if they all decided they wanted to be my sweetie he nodded there is one other thing they both have in common ma petite and that would be they have both been with vampires who held the ardeur you said vampires plural you dont mean just belle do you requiem had a lover who meant as much to him as julianna did to asher and me her name was ligeia he told me that belle killed her out of jealousy oui ligeia was the only woman of her line to acquire the ardeur it wasnt the full ardeur that belle you and i carry but there is more requiem refused belles bed for her and she killed her for that you have been inside belle mortes head ma petite how can you sound surprised he had a point it still seems pretty petty for a vampire whos over two thousand years old i said he nodded oui but many of the old ones can be extremely petty he held his hand out to me i stared at that hand for a heartbeat then i took it i let him draw me through the water and in against his body let him press me to the front of his body wrap his arms around me youre afraid i said my cheek pressed to the firmness of his chest oui i am afraid why there are others here who have tasted the ardeur and are masters we need to test our theory ma petite but i fear we run the risk of having you tied permanently to someone or they to you auggie isnt tied to me he did not want to leave our side ma petite if he does not recover then he will be as belle made her victims hungering for us forever willing to do anything to be back between us you sound sad he was my friend i did not mean to enslave him as belle would i saw her victims give up everything betray every vow every trust for the sake of her body he held me tight against him it is not a power i ever wished to possess you hold the ardeur oui but this is a level of the ardeur that only she possesses we all believed that only belle morte could wield it at such a level you dont want it i want to be so powerful that no one dares challenge me or our people but i am afraid of this and what it will mean his heart was beating too fast against my ear had it been beating all along or had it just started mean how there are those in europe who already fear my growing power knowledge that i wielded the ardeur at the same level as belle morte might tip the scales in the councils voting they might vote to kill us all rather than risk me making a power base in america as strong as belle once possessed in europe or the other american masters might collude to kill us for fear that we would become like the tyrants of the european council how likely is all this i asked possible how possible i asked suddenly realizing that an accidental pregnancy might not be the worst disaster we could have we must understand these new powers and quickly ma petite we must experiment with a master we trust before i allow you to go to the party tomorrow we must know what we are dealing with if we can raised voices on the other side of the door claudia yelling you cant just go in there richards voice angry watch me jeanclaude sighed and i settled lower in the water i did not want to fight with richard tonight but from the feel of him through the door we werent going to have a choice jeanclaude called let him in claudia the door opened but claudia came first as if she didnt trust richard in there with us his power rode through the door like the heat edge of a forest fire something that should have choked and killed anything in its path wed raised his power level along with ours and we were about to find out how sorry that was going to make us claudia stood between him and the tub and because she was about five inches taller she blocked our view of him of some of him she was the more serious bodybuilder but he had broader shoulders his shoulders and what i could glimpse of his lower body let me know he was wearing blue jeans and a red shirt there was a herd of black in the door where the other guards waited to figure out what to do some of them were werewolves and he was their ulfric you dont stand in the way of your king not and survive his power swirled through the room like invisible fire as if the water should have boiled with it then i realized it wasnt just richards power claudia had been my bodyguard off and on for months maybe a year but until this moment i hadnt really understood how much power was in that tall muscular body it was her power too burning down the room she wasnt just physical muscle the air was hard to breathe as if it were too hot to pass over my lips like coffee that you want to blow on before you drink it i dont know what richard had done outside but it had made claudia drop all her pretenses and show her power like a preview or a warning her voice echoed in the room no farther until you prove youve got your shit under control her legs bent her body going into that partial crouch legs moving in the space she had between the raised tub and him it was a fighting stance jesus move richard shouted it in a voice gone bass with growling not good jeanclaude and i exchanged looks he gave a small shrug i tried richard i had to raise my voice and say his name three times before he answered tell her to move anita he growled what will you do if she moves i asked i felt some of that burning power hesitate grow weaker his voice was still growly but less sure of itself i dont know he said it as if he hadnt thought beyond getting to us that wasnt like richard to have no idea what he planned to do are you going to try to hurt us i asked sitting up in the water enough to peer around claudias body i caught a glimpse of his face his hair was a foamy mass of waves all brown and gold in sunlight there would be more gold to his brown and strands of coppery red his hair was brown but as if it could never quite decide if it might be blond or auburn instead it had finally grown back to brush the tops of his broad shoulders the bright crimson tshirt strained around his upper arms because he was holding his hands in tight tight fists it looked as if the seams of the shirt werent going to hold the muscles strain his summer tan was dark against the red of the shirt he looked at me then the full force of his eyes and the shock of it thrilled down my spine his eyes were wolf eyes amber gold and no longer human it was the beginning of the change no wonder claudia was on alert the dimple in his chin usually softened the sharp perfection of his cheekbones and the utterly masculine beauty of his face he more than almost any other man in my life was handsome not pretty nothing would ever make you mistake richard for a girl not even from the back not even with the hair the body was too masculine to be anything else tonight the dimple didnt soften anything because the anger in his face was too raw had the anger fed his power or the other way around who knew who cared dangerous either way control yourself ulfric claudia said he turned those goldenamber eyes to her if i dont what then for the first time since id known him i realized he was spoiling for a fight it wasnt like him it was like me jeanclaude and i both started to climb out of the tub at the same moment he went for one of the huge fluffy white towels wrapping it around his waist as he cleared the water shapeshifters arent usually bothered by nudity but tonight he might be at least by jeanclaude richard was a touch homophobic what hed felt us do tonight wouldnt help that i left the knife and the gun on the edge of the tub i wouldnt kill him and he knew it one there was a chance that if one of us died the vampire marks would kill us all two most of the time i loved him too much to want him dead right at that moment was not one of those times that moment was one of those times when i wished he had fewer hangups and had had more therapy he was in therapy but not enough therapy for what hed felt jeanclaude and me do tonight he was the last third of our triumvirate of all the ones wed shared power with richard would have gotten more sensations more real physical feedback of what we were doing he was the one who would hate it the most and he got the most complete ride unfair but true jeanclaude stayed near the back wall with its mirror it was the largest place to stand he handed me a towel but i caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror i stood there framed by the black marble nude water dripping down my body glistening in the light my hair plastered to my face leaving my eyes huge and dark in the paleness of my face i could almost never resist any of my men fresh from the tub or shower there was something about water streaming down naked skin that was just yummy here was hoping that richard felt the same way i wont ask you again move she is doing her job mon ami shut up he screamed shut up i dont want to hear you right now oh boy i moved around the narrow edge between tub and wall on the closest side to the door i stopped on the raised platform so i was totally framed by the cool black marble with its white and silver streaks my pulse was in my throat because even a few inches closer made their power hotter like moving closer to that open flame when your skin is crying out hot hot dont touch richard i whispered it but he heard me he looked at me with that ragefilled face and the moment he saw me his eyes filled with such pain as if the sight of me like that was a knife blow straight through his heart i was sorry for the pain but happy about the reaction almost any emotion is better for a shapeshifter than anger anger feeds their beasts quicker we needed to slow things down how could you do that how could you do that with him i thought he meant auggie until he pointed a finger at jeanclaude im not sure what you mean by that richard dont play me anita and this was a yell he covered his face with his hands and staggered back a step he screamed wordless and so full of pain he dropped to his knees and screamed again his power filled the room as if wed all been plunged into boiling water it felt as if my skin were being cooked id felt richards power before but nothing like this how much power had he gained from our feed on auggie claudia stayed in a fighting stance and i didnt blame her graham was just inside the door rubbing his bare arms looking conflicted he owed richard his allegiance but he was paid to keep us safe he also knew that richard would never forgive any of the wolves that allowed him to hurt me jeanclaude i wasnt so sure about but me hed regret it later and his regret had a way of raining all over everybody lisandro was in the room too near the sinks there was no conflict on his dark face he was tall dark and handsome with the longest hair of any of the male wererats if claudia said jump hed do it clay was in the doorway as tormented as graham we needed fewer wolves in here and more wererats or werehyenas anything but people who would hesitate richard lowered his hands and his eyes were pure chocolate brown hed swallowed some of that awful burning power you helped him rape the master of chicago he wasnt yelling now and i almost wished he had it would have been easier to hear than the anguish in his voice but what he said made no sense to me it wasnt rape richard you know that you felt some of what auggie was feeling hell richard auggie started the ball rolling he raised my ardeur on purpose picked a fight with me richard looked at me and i watched him want to believe me but be afraid to do you really think id rape someone he shook his head no but he would he pointed toward jeanclaude who was standing very still behind me his voice came neutral as empty as he could make it i have done many things over the centuries richard but rape has never been to my taste i remembered jeanclaudes memories with auggie belle had wanted him to rape auggie and jeanclaude had changed it to something gentler or as gentle as he could make it with belle watching i opened my mouth to say something but knew somehow that telling about the other two times that jeanclaude and auggie had had sex wouldnt help us see anita you cant defend him either i do defend him jeanclaude has a lot of faults rape isnt one of them that wasnt what you started to say a second ago he was still kneeling on the floor but he was calming swallowing that choking power he was showing the control that had helped make him ulfric of the thronnos rokke clan claudia moved to one side so she could see him as she glanced at me i gave her a small nod but added i think clay and graham have something else they need to be doing she nodded and ordered them out and replaced them with two guards who wouldnt feel conflicted shed understood what id meant if richard understood what id done he didnt show it not even by a flicker of his eyes im trying to decide what i can say that wont piss you off richard thats all he took in a breath so deep it made his shoulders shake fair enough his voice sounded like his own now not all growling deep did the other master really pick a fight with you i nodded wed leave the whole theory as to why he might have picked it until we were alone you felt his power richard if it had come down to a fight a true fight vampire on vampire would we have won he looked down at his hands where they lay still and open on his thighs i dont think so he raised the ardeur if i feed off him then he loses richard nodded food cant be dominant i know he looked past me to jeanclaude why would he raise the ardeur why would he pick the one way that he could lose i do not believe he wished to win jeanclaude said that makes no sense richard said he is already master of one territory it is against our laws to rule a second that does not touch your own there are lands in between our territories so defeating me would win him nothing but losing to the ardeur would give him anita a woman of belle mortes line who holds the ardeur oui i thought you said he was your friend richard said i believe he is jeanclaude sighed and said we need privacy for this discussion claudia if you would leave us she looked at me not at the men i liked claudia its okay she sighed well be right outside the door but if the power level rises again we are back in here no arguments i said ill control myself richard said sure she said and went for the door lisandro stared back at us as the door closed and it wasnt a bodyguard look it was a mans look at a naked woman that hed never seen naked before until that moment i hadnt even thought about any of the other men in the room richard had been all i thought of the rest of them might as well have been eunuchs as far as id been concerned but with that one look lisandro broke two rules first shapeshifters didnt notice nudity they did it too much it would be like your cat thinking about not wearing pants second it was against the bodyguard code to let clients see that you thought about them in any way other than as a target to keep safe you did not let a female client see that you lusted after her even if she paraded naked that was her problem not yours you do not fuck those you guard because you cant guard them while youre fucking i guess there are exceptions to the above rules but lisandro hadnt earned those exceptions i gave him a look that let him know id seen his look he just smiled not a smidge of regret great just great the door closed behind the guard and we were alone none of us moved as if now that it was just us we werent certain what to do richard spoke into the sudden heavy silence i need you to put on a towel at least anita please he added the please like it hurt him to ask politely i guess he was still angry but he had swallowed all that rage the way hed learned to swallow his beast part of me was beginning to wonder if there would come a day when he couldnt swallow all the rage and what would happen when that day came once id thought richard would never hurt me now i knew better he wouldnt hurt me on purpose but purpose wasnt always what drove him jeanclaude handed me a towel his face was empty as he did it nothing to help me or give me a hint but nothing on his face for richard to take offense at either i guess we were both being as careful of him as we could it was a big towel i ended up covered from armpits to nearly my ankles i tucked the end of the towel securely under and over and voilà i was dressed thank you richard said youre welcome i said and sat down on the edge of the marble smoothing the towel under me marble can be very cold to sit on bare jeanclaude handed me another slightly smaller towel i took it and watched as he began to wrap an identical towel around his wet hair he was right if i didnt dry my hair well it would be a mess tomorrow how can the two of you do that he asked i looked at him from underneath the towel while i wrapped it around my head what are we doing now taking care of your hair like nothings wrong i got the towel fixed in place and turned to meet jeanclaudes look he took the hint if we let our hair dry badly it will not change what has happened richard the practicalities of life do not cease needing to be done just because other things are going wrong richard moved so he was sitting on the floor rather than kneeling he hugged his knees to him and it was something that nathaniel might have done not my dominant richard whatever he had experienced with us tonight it had shaken him jeanclaude came to sit beside me on the edge of the marble tub he was careful not to touch me only the faintest edge of our hips touching through the towels i wanted him to wrap his arms around me but he was probably right richard didnt always like to see us cuddle you wanted privacy for this talk so talk he said one of the side effects of the vampire marks was that we seemed to be sharing bits of our personalities he seemed to have inherited some of my impatience and lack of anger management a bad combination for a werewolf but we didnt get to pick and choose what we got ma petite if you will tell him and me what happened before i arrived i told the shortest complete version i could of all that had happened before jeanclaude showed up somewhere during the talk i leaned in against jeanclaudes body it just seemed wrong to be this close and not touch he put his arm along my shoulder richard didnt seem to notice i thought this samuel and augustine were your friends he said they are then richard said what id thought earlier if these are your friends jeanclaude what are the other masters going to be like id thought of that too i said i mean if these are your friends your enemies are going to kill us one of the reasons for tonights little meeting was to see how ma petite reacted to other masters of the city badly richard said not necessarily jeanclaude said he leaned forward curving me more into his arm to keep from knocking me off the edge jeanclaude started to tell his part in tonights little drama but richard stopped him i felt most of what happened after you touched anita i dont need a reminder as you like jeanclaude said but the point is we may have rolled augustine as thoroughly as belle morte could have done i wouldnt brag about that richard said hed moved to lean his shoulder against the marble around the tub so that he was close enough to have reached out and touched us but he didnt try to close the distance and because he didnt we didnt if augustine is truly ours in the way that belle made allies than none of the other masters will try us they will fear us richard fear even the touch of our hands richard frowned at us i wanted to touch the thick waves of his hair but kept my hand around jeanclaudes waist and the other hand in my lap but you told us before we agreed to this gathering of masters that everyone would behave especially if they thought one of their people would be anitas new pomme de sang now the first two masters who touch her are breaking all the rules i believe there is a reason for that he gave us a skeptical look that was like a mirror of my own what reason jeanclaude told him about his theory that the ardeur was hunting powerful prey but that means that any master of the city who comes into contact with her will be what compelled to try to mindroll her not just masters of the city he said and he told about meng die and requiem it may have been only that these two are of our bloodline and both had tasted the ardeur more than once so has asher and hes not crazed asher was drawn to ma petite from the moment he came to us he saw her as a way of duplicating what you and he and julianna had richard said he had moved almost as close as he could without actually touching us i wondered if he was even aware of it that and the only way back into my bed was through anita but what if it was more than that richard i had to add now requiem isnt the only one of the new london vamps that had tasted the ardeur and theyre all of belles line they dont seem particularly drawn to me perhaps they must get at least a small taste of the ardeur from you before it is triggered or maybe youre wrong richard said maybe you just dont have any friends how long has it been since you saw these guys jeanclaude gave that graceful shrug almost a century for augustine and not since i entered this country for samuel i looked at him jeanclaude just because someone was your friend a century ago doesnt mean he hasnt changed he nodded as if id made a point perhaps but i felt something when we were with augustine it was such power i believe that the ardeur is reaching some new power evolving into something new or at the very least new to us what if auggie isnt rolled completely i asked then what we did tonight will not be as large a deterrent tell richard the other part that if we really did roll another master of the city youre wondering if the council in europe will use this as an excuse to kill us or maybe our american neighbors will decide to kill us before we try to take them all over richard looked at us with that flat idontbelieveit look well this is a loselose situation why did you bring them all here jeanclaude because their presence makes an important event of my evening of dance it is unfair that just because an artist becomes a vampire he is no longer allowed on the stage i want my kind to be able to pursue passions that have nothing to do with blood and power i hope as you for your wolves that we can be more than just monsters id been thinking about what he said about the taste of the ardeur too much to be sidetracked into talking about ballet you know i fed the ardeur off byron too hes not besotted with me but he is not a master vampire ma petite nor will he ever be a master he accepts that if anita has this effect only on your bloodline were safe for tomorrow because there are no other masters of the city from that line but there are master vampires of belles line scattered throughout this country some will be there tomorrow some are part of the ballet troupe itself so i stay home i said cinderella must come to the ball ma petite nathaniel says im not cinderella im prince charming he smiled and gave me a little hug of course ma petite whatever you say yeah he was humoring me but i let him but the point remains you must go to the party tomorrow night richards knee touched my leg his hands still clasped around his legs his hands were mottled with the tightness of his own hold she cant go not if shes going to get jumped by all of them his hand started to reach for my leg then he stopped himself and went back to holding his own hand he was fighting so hard not to touch me to touch us the vampire marks at least for belles line made you want to touch each other it didnt have to be about sex just about feeling more complete when you touched i know richard felt almost compelled to touch me but id never had the courage to ask if he felt the same way around jeanclaude if he did it might explain some of why he was so enraged about augustine we have in our camp other masters of similar power to requiem who have tasted the ardeur one is even of belles line i shook my head if youre talking about london forget it he seriously creeps me richard was shaking his head too no frankly jeanclaude i dont know why you agreed to take him i mean his own kiss nicknamed him the dark knight i think that says something he sighed and leaned his back against the wall you know that belle morte tried to demand all her bloodline back when their master was executed how could i refuse to save them from her yeah but id think belles court would be right up londons alley a nice dark alley he did not wish to go back to her he spoke to me over the phone he begged me not to let him go back to her court you see ma petite richard london was traded to belle for several years then she exiled him she tried to recall him but he got his new master to intercede why richard asked auggie would give anything to go back i felt how much he misses her richard shuddered its like some sort of addiction oui mon ami exactement that is precisely why london does not wish to go back he is like an alcoholic that has become a teetotaler he knows he has another drunken binge in him but he does not know whether he has the strength to stop again how could i leave him to her thats awfully sentimental for you isnt it richard said jeanclaude gave him an unfriendly look i try for kindness when i can richard richard sighed and leaned his forehead on his knees god this is a mess you said we had other master vamps who had tasted the ardeur but who werent of belles line who are they our list of nonbelle masters was pretty damn slim wicked and truth he said it was richard who raised his face and said no absolutely no then he seemed to think about it not wicked truth would be acceptable jeanclaude asked richards shoulders hunched and i thought he might break his own hands holding on so tight youre asking me to share her with another man how can you ask me to help pick who its going to be how many women have you lain with in the last month richard richards power flared like a burst of fire through an innocentlooking wall we were suddenly bathed in the biting heat of his power you all right in there claudia called through the door i looked at richard he gave the tiniest nod were fine i said you sure she asked yes silence from the other side of the door richard said thank you then got back to the fight i didnt have to see his face to know he was angry we all agreed that id keep dating anita will be my lupa and my bolverk but she doesnt want to marry or have kids or any of that i do we all agreed to this dont throw it up in my face now youre going to hurt yourself richard i said softly staring at his hands and all the notsopretty colors they were turning he let go of his hands with a breath that held pain in it he finally let himself wrap his hand around my calf his power ran over my skin like a thousand tiny insects biting ow i said he leaned his face on my towelcovered knee and said sorry im sorry the energy calmed still warm raising sweat along my spine but it stopped hurting he spoke with his face still on my knee your feeding on auggie raised my power level oh god it did the power rush felt so good so incredibly good even after i knew what youd done to get it it still felt wonderful his shoulders started to shake and i realized he was crying i touched his hair letting my fingers comb through those thick waves richard oh richard he wrapped his arms around my legs holding on putting his face in my lap letting me touch him jeanclaude laid a tentative hand on his back and when richard didnt say no he stroked his back that useless stroking that youll do for good friends and loved ones those endless useless circles where you try to say with your hands that it will be all right i stroked his hair and brushed the tears from his face we comforted him as his friends his very good friends whatever else we were to each other we were at least that we ended up on the floor with richard cradled in my lap while i sat against jeanclaudes bare upper body as if he were a warm silken chair richards shirt was gone so the warm muscled smoothness of his chest and shoulders lay across the pooled towel in my lap my upper body was as bare as his the towel just couldnt hold on during that much cuddling richard lay on his back eyes peaceful his hair like a brown and gold halo around his face my hands stroked his bare chest not for sex but for comfort all the lycanthropes were like that touch was good touch was even necessary to stay sane it was as if they had the normal human skin hunger except more orders of magnitude more his arm was raised along the line of my body his hand playing with my hair which had begun to dry in tight frizzy curls jeanclaudes hand played along richards raised arm stroking up and down the muscled length of it there were no words just the comfort of the touching jeanclaudes other hand was stroking my shoulder and arm almost mirroring what he was doing to richard i think wed all been surprised that richard let jeanclaude touch so much as a fingertip to him after the way hed entered the room id seen plenty of lycanthropes pet each other regardless of sexual orientation a cuddle was a cuddle to most of them but richard had issues with jeanclaude that he didnt have with the people id seen him be so casual with richards eyes shifted and i knew he was looking past me to the other man your hair is almost as curly as anitas the comment made me turn so i could see his face more clearly too richard was right jeanclaudes hair was a mass of black curls not the relaxed almost wavy curls that he always had but something closer to mine but his hair drying naturally was about where mine was with hair care products not the black foam mine had turned into have i never seen your natural hair texture i asked staring at all those curls he smiled and if it had been almost anyone else id have said he was embarrassed but it just didnt quite fly for jeanclaude i suppose not richard moved his hand from my hair to jeanclaudes he rubbed the curls between his fingers then went back to mine comparing your hair is still softer textured than anitas or mine for that matter he knelt and took a handful of both of our hair as if he were testing how much it weighed normally your hair just looks silkier but now you have to touch it to feel how much difference in texture there is between you and anita jeanclaude had gone very still against my body i think he stopped breathing and the heartbeat that had been chugging along like any humans heart slowed i knew hed gone still because richard was touching him voluntarily and he didnt want to spook him but i also think that in that moment he didnt know what to do a man who had been a great lover for over four hundred years did not know what to do because someone was playing with his hair he didnt want to be too bold and raise that anger again or frighten him with a homophobic possibility if richard had been a woman hed have taken it as foreplay if richard hadnt been a shapeshifter he might still have taken it as an invitation of sorts but shapeshifters were tactile junkies touching didnt mean sex to them any more than it did when a dog started licking the sweat off your skin you tasted good and they liked you nothing sexual but it is personal if they didnt like you they wouldnt touch you he sat pressed against my body and i knew by his very stillness how much it meant to him that richard was touching him the stillness also told me he had no idea what to do about it what does it say when a vampire who has been a great lover and seducer for centuries chooses as his metaphysical sweeties maybe the only two people in his territory who are going to puzzle him there was a knock at the door those of us with a heartbeat jumped richards hands fell away from both of us as he turned to face the door still on his knees movement came back to jeanclaudes body the way a human would take a breath yes he said and his voice held just a touch of impatience claudias voice came its the master of cape cod and his oldest son jeanclaude and i exchanged glances richard just frowned why is he back richard asked we can but ask jeanclaude said his voice back to almost its normal silky emptiness the voice he used when he was hiding things but trying not to seem like it samuel would know what a totally empty voice meant hiding or fear weakness so jeanclaude compromised with his voice hiding from richard and maybe from me and not seeming to hide from samuel we were so not going to make it through this weekend without another disaster the combination of metaphysics and politics was just too hard well be right out i yelled at the door we all got up off the floor richard reached for his shirt and slipped it over his head jeanclaude and i had robes hanging on the back of the door jeanclaudes was one id seen and enjoyed before heavy black brocade with black fur at the collar and lapel so that it framed a triangle of his pale chest there was more fur at the wide cuffs and id felt that fur rub down my body before just seeing him in the robe made me shiver he gave me a smile that said hed noticed richard either didnt understand or ignored it my robe was black silk no embroidery no fur just plain unrelieved black we had to walk in front of the mirror to get to the door and richard stopped us with a hand on either of our shoulders he turned us toward our reflections so that he stood between us we were all black cloth and white skin sharp contrasts then there he stood in his bright red shirt blue jeans his hair all brown and gold his tan darker in contrast with how pale we were which of these things does not belong he asked in a low voice there was that shadow in his eyes again i slid my arm around his waist hugged him but even to me it looked like something carved of bone and darkness clinging to all that life jeanclaude anita you coming claudia asked voice a little hesitant which you didnt hear much from her were coming i called if i could set you free mon ami i would richard hugged me so tight it almost hurt then he relaxed against me and looked at jeanclaude if you had that kind of magic wand id let you use it but you dont he turned keeping one arm around my shoulders and reaching the other until he touched jeanclaudes shoulder he did that guy grip on the shoulder that some macho guys do instead of hugging another guy some nights i hate you jeanclaude but if id been with anita tonight touching her augustine wouldnt have been able to roll her if id been where i should have been none of the crap that i hated tonight would have happened i know that i felt it while it was happening i was miles away and i felt the fight but i didnt reach out and help it was vampire politics and thats not my problem he shook his head hard enough to send his hair flying around his face no more lying to myself i am your animal to call and i hate it and sometimes i hate you and sometimes i hate anita and most of the time i hate myself no more lies and no more crippling us jeanclaudes face was as careful as id ever seen it and what do these sowise statements mean mon ami it means when you meet with samuel ill be at your side where i should have been earlier tonight he hugged me tight with one arm and squeezed jeanclaudes shoulder again i wasnt even willing to offer up energy to help anita she had micah and nathaniel with her i thought she didnt need another animal to call but she did you did if you and anita hadnt pulled a metaphysical miracle out of thin air the master of chicago would have defeated you maybe he couldnt take your territory but if one master defeats you then its like blood in the water the sharks come and feed if wed proved weak then not tonight but some night soon someone would come and kill us all i agree with everything youre saying i said slowly but it doesnt sound like you no i guess it doesnt he looked at jeanclaude and i felt that first warm trickle of his energy are you playing puppet with me again i swear to you that i am not not knowingly but these are all things i have longed to hear you say with you at our side richard i fear no one who has come to our territory with one third of our triumvirate absent or unwilling tonight has made me doubt my decision to invite others to our lands he dropped his hand from jeanclaudes shoulder then lets go have this meeting i cant promise that i wont freak again i cant promise to like any of this but i promise to try harder not to run away he started walking toward the door still holding me i looked back at jeanclaude and the look must have shown what i was thinking because he shrugged as if he didnt know what the hell had happened to richard either it wasnt that we werent happy with a more reasonable response from him but it just didnt seem real it didnt feel like the quiet rush after the storm has passed no this felt more like that false calm you sometimes get where the world is hushed and waiting it feels quiet but the air is charged and waiting waiting for the storm to come thats what richards new attitude felt like like it was brittle and waiting to break i applauded the effort and the sentiment but the pit of my stomach was afraid of what would happen when the new attitude met the old issues someone had cleaned up the living room the torn drapes were gone and the remaining ones had been moved to make long swags of cloth against the stone walls it didnt make cloth walls now but it was pretty and helped give the illusion that the carpeted area was its own space and not part of the larger rock room the electric lights seemed odd now that you could see the torches in the hallway we walked up hand in hand me in the middle of the men richards hand was ohsoslightly damp he was nervous but it didnt show on his face i wished i could have asked what exactly was making him nervous but even if there hadnt been company i wouldnt have asked he was being brave and cooperative and i wasnt going to poke at it honest asher rose from the chair where hed sat and entertained our guests there were half a dozen blackgarbed guards scattered throughout the room claudia and her crew followed behind us like an honor guard i think shed decided no more taking chances tonight we had enough manpower to fill a room so she was going to do it none of us were going to argue asher glided toward us and it was almost as if his feet didnt touch the ground as if he were floating he was always graceful but not like that he was one of the best at levitating that id ever seen so that he could do what the legends say asher could fly tonight it was as if he could barely force himself to walk when he knew he had wings and longed to use them he was like some earthbound angel waiting to fling himself skyward his clothes helped the angelic illusion he was all in white with gold and copper thread worked through the frock coat and along a pair of silk pants that ended at his knees where white hose took up and ended in white high heels with golden buckles the shoes reminded me that the original high heel was meant for men his hair was the color of the gold thread in his clothes as if the seamstress had used his own hair to decorate the cloth he used that hair like a shield to hide the scars on the right side of his face hed been so worried about what the other masters many of whom knew him before the scarring would think of him that he had requested we take down all the paintings that showed him before the side of the face that showed beside that fall of truly golden hair was the face of some medieval angel if you liked your angels sensuous and a little fallen that full kissable mouth smiled at us all his eyes managed to be both pale blue and a vibrant color as if a winter sky could burn with pale clear blue only one eye showed clear the other one seemed to wink and burn when glimpsed through the hair as if light were glancing off glass he offered his hand first to jeanclaude and said what jeanclaude usually didnt like to hear master our friend from cape cod begs a word his words were utterly polite but his face glowed with some suppressed excitement something had filled our usually solemn asher with delight but what jeanclaude arched an eyebrow as if he wanted to ask what was up too ashers voice floated through my mind the new power level is amazing i felt richard jerk as if hed been hit i looked at him and saw from his wide eyes that hed probably heard it too the next mind whisper held a trace of laughter to it my apologies i only meant jeanclaude to hear but i confess to having some trouble controlling all the new abilities jeanclaude squeezed my hand and it was his voice that came next calm we must all be calm for our guests richard let his breath out slow and gave a small nod his abilities didnt lie with the dead so he wasnt used to vamps other than jeanclaude talking mindtomind with him even i wasnt used to them doing it by accident how much power had he gained from this one feeding and how much had others of our vampires gained there were one or two i wasnt sure i wanted more powerful than they already were meng die for one samuel and sampson stood in front of the love seat asher led us to the couch across from them the white carpet seemed emptier than normal oh the coffee table was missing had we broken it after the ardeur rose i couldnt remember i had my best professional smile plastered on my face the one thats bright and cheery as a lightbulb and about as warm but it was the best i could do id had about all the outoftown visitors i could deal with for one night samuel sampson you have not met our richard samuel bowed toward us ulfric it is good to meet you at last sampson bowed a little lower than his father and let him do the talking they both looked way too solemn for my tastes as if something else had gone wrong samuel what brings you back to us tonight jeanclaude asked if he was tired of visitors it didnt show in his voice he sounded pleasant welcoming the perfect host first the apology i owe you on behalf of my wife i worry that something about her nature affected your servant and may have helped cause what happened tonight i blinked at him felt my smile slip a notch was this all someone elses fault was i going to have someone else to blame goody jeanclaude sat down on the white couch not so much pulling me down with him as leading as you do in a dance he sat and i followed his lead and richard followed mine jeanclaude kept my hand in his but richard let go and put his arm along the back of the couch he was touching mostly me but his hand moved along jeanclaudes back and ended lost in the thick curls of his hair where is your lovely wife and your other sons jeanclaude asked asher sat in the overstuffed chair closest to us he matched the chair and pillows perfectly all white and gold he still looked entirely too pleased with himself like the proverbial cat with cream samuel sat down on the love seat and sampson followed his fathers lead they are at a hotel along with our two guards i did not feel it wise to bring thea and anita together again tonight what did she think of the show i asked jeanclaudes hand tightened on my hand where he held it in his lap the squeeze was enough be nice he was saying id be nice my version of it richard had gone very quiet beside me his arm tensed against my back but it wasnt a warning to be careful because his body temperature went up as if he was thinking what i was thinking was there someone else to get angry with someone besides ourselves richard and i both preferred to be angry at other people thea was much impressed he said and his voice was mild empty his tone told nothing if she was so impressed i said then why isnt she here sampson smiled and had to turn away to hide it whats so funny i asked his father gave him an unfriendly look sampson fought to control his face but finally burst out laughing samuel gave him his best ancient vampire disdain im sorry father sampson said in a voice still choked with laughter but you must admit it is funny impressed does not begin to cover mothers reaction to what anita and jeanclaude did tonight his father gave him a stony face until the laughter faded round the edges then samuel said in a voice that held an edge of injured dignity my son has been indiscreet but he is accurate you ask why thea and my other sons are not here simply put i did not trust her near the two of you she liked the show i said samuel shook his head gave his son another disapproving look more than liked anita she is all ablaze with speculative plans would it be possible for her and i to do what the two of you did i find that unlikely for though thea carries something similar to the ardeur i do not i believe what you did to augustine required similar gifts between the two of you jeanclaude gave a small nod face still empty i believe so she is now convinced that anita could bring our sons into the full strength of their sirens powers something crossed his face too faint to read but with such an empty face it was strangely noticeable i do not share her certainty what i felt from you tonight anita is a different element of passion it is like the difference between fire and water they will both consume you but in very different manners i looked at sampsons face still softly amused what did your mother actually say i asked he glanced at his father before he answered samuel sighed then nodded sampson grinned at me and said i dont think you really want to know what she said but what she meant was that if she had her way tom and cris would both be here shed be here too shed be offering us all to you any way you wanted us his face sobered around the edges she can get carried away sometimes our mother she means well but she doesnt think entirely like a human being do you understand i hang around with vampires so yeah he shook his head his hands clasped on his knees no anita vampires start out human as do shapeshifters and necromancers he said that with a smile but mother was never human she thinks likehe seemed unsure what to say samuel finished for him thea is other and she reasons in ways that do not always make much sense to those of us who began life as human beings he didnt sound entirely happy about it but he stated it as truth that must make life interesting richard said samuel gave him cool eyes but sampson nodded smiling you have no idea what did you think of the show samuel jeanclaude asked the other vampire thought about it face careful and his voice was just as careful when he answered i thought it was one of the most powerful things i have ever seen i think it is the kind of power that made me flee the great courts and it is exactly the sort of power that made me avoid belle mortes court it is the kind of display that made me flee europe for fear of becoming nothing but a vassal of some great vampiric lord do you fear us now jeanclaude asked samuel nodded i do i would not harm you deliberately jeanclaude said no but your power is growing and growing power is a wild and capricious thing i do not want my people or my sons near you while your power finds its way i think you will be incredibly dangerous by accident for years to come yet you come before me with your son why why not leave my lands if we are so dangerous because thea is right in one way if she and i could by some chance duplicate what the two of you did it would be he licked his lips worth the risk i also agree that there is a chance that your anita could bring my sons into their powers if they have them do you believe your sons are so human jeanclaude asked sampson is well over seventy in human years so no not so very human i looked at sampson he looked somewhere in his early twenties maybe thirty at most by no stretch of the imagination did he look seventy my i said youre holding up well he grinned at me and i liked the grin he seemed to find the whole power game a little embarrassing a little funny clean living he said still grinning richard moved beside me a small uncomfortable movement i glanced at him and his face was beginning to darken one of richards biggest problems with our new lifestyle was jealousy of all the men trying to be in my life he was the only one who found jealousy a real problem until i saw that look on his face id been able to ignore that they were still talking about sampson and me being lovers id gotten better at pushing away the uncomfortable bits until i had to deal with them richard was still working on that thomas and cristos seem to be aging at a more normal rate they are only seventeen jeanclaude said too young to be certain surely samuel shrugged a normal shrug not that graceful gallic movement but for this i think they are too young too human whatever thea may wish hes afraid youd break them sampson said i couldnt help smiling richards frown got deeper and your dad isnt worried about you i asked he is my oldest samuel said as if that meant more to him than it did to me if you break me he has two sons left sampson said smiling to take the bite out of it samuel touched his sons arm i hold all my children precious you know that he smiled at his father patted his hand where it lay on his arm i know that father but for this kind of power youd risk one of us and im the most likely to survive without becoming her slave my slave i made it a question i dont do slaves sampson looked at me as if he were studying me a shadow of his fathers penetrating stare if augustine is not your slave it will only be because he is powerful enough to recover not for lack of trying on your part and i am not nearly as powerful as a master of the city i opened my mouth closed it not sure what to say i finally said i dont want anyone to be my slave then what did you want he kept his suddenly serious eyes on me i just blinked at him trying to think what had i wanted what had i intended to do to auggie win i said what sampson asked win i wanted to win auggie and your father are supposed to be jeanclaudes friends but your mother had almost rolled me shed tried to raise the ardeur and make me fuck your brother your little brother then auggie raised the ardeur and used his bloodlines special ability on me if this is what jeanclaudes friends do to us then what are the other masters of the city going to do i shook my head leaning forward on the couch still holding jeanclaudes hand but having to put my hand on richards thigh to keep touching him too we had to win this fight had to you had to win in such a way that the rest of us would not try your strength samuel said i nodded yes he looked past us to the hallway beyond so searching a look that it made richard and me look behind us neither jeanclaude nor the silent asher bothered as if they knew there was no one there i believe you have succeeded anita if augustine follows you and jeanclaude about like a lovesick puppy then the rest will fear you some may even take back their offers of pomme de sang for fear of having you feed off them the way you fed off augustines people we fed from augustines people because he is their master jeanclaude said no others offer themselves to ma petites bed perhaps samuel said but i think if they did know what has happened with augustine they might be tempted there is something about her that draws one even i feel it and i am not of belles line how strongly drawn jeanclaude asked in that careful voice the two vampires looked at each other there was suddenly something between them not magic but almost as if willpower could be something touchable that is an odd question samuel said is it jeanclaude asked and his voice held a lilt at the end that sounded strangely chiding samuel settled back against the love seat as if he was going to be there for a while somehow they both knew they were negotiating it was surprisingly bad manners for augustine to have started a fight with your human servant yes jeanclaude said it seemed out of character for him dont you think samuel nodded i do richards free hand found mine where it rested on his leg he began to run his thumb over my knuckles as if hed picked up the tension too something was up but what what was jeanclaude up to i wasnt used to being shut out by both of the men especially when we were touching but whatever was happening tonight jeanclaude was holding us tight shut against each other he usually only did that when he was afraid of what would happen if the marks opened after our little showdown with auggie i wasnt going to argue but it made me headblind around them and i wasnt used to that i hadnt realized that id started counting on getting hints from both their minds i need advice samuel advice from another master of the city what could i possibly advise you on you are a sourdre de sang i am but an ordinary master of the city i crave your wisdom not your power the two of them stared at each other and neither face showed a damn thing note to self never play poker with master vamps i am always glad to share my wisdom with my friends i need your trust as well samuel friends must always trust each other i had a moment to wonder if friends meant for them what it had meant for augustine and jeanclaude not the time to ask i trusted you tonight samuel but thea tried to force herself and your thomas on my human servant that is not the way a trusted friend behaves i can only give you my deepest apologies jeanclaude thea is sometimes overly enthusiastic in her pursuit of our sons powers sampson and i both laughed at the same time the vampires looked at us sorry i said but i think youre understating it mother overly enthusiastic in pursuit of her childrens destiny sampson laughed again shaking his head samuel frowned at him then he sighed and turned back to jeanclaude once i helped you not for money but because augustine was my friend and he asked a favor your ship was my escape to the new world jeanclaude said i remembered auggie in jeanclaudes memory saying something about a ship and a captain he trusted had that been samuel i propose that we put aside mistrust and speak plainly i propose that we act as true friends and not adversaries all master vampires are adversaries jeanclaude said samuel smiled you speak what you have been told not what you believe he looked at asher he is master enough to have his own territory but he stays with you out of love you do not fear each other no but you and i have never been close in the way of lovers samuel waved his hand in the air as if jeanclaude had missed his point i do not covet your lands do you covet mine jeanclaude smiled no i do not covet your lady do you covet mine jeanclaude shook his head no we have different animals to call so that cannot even be shared we are no threat to each other jeanclaude our powers are too different let us help each other and leave off this game playing let us come in honesty and friendship jeanclaude gave one brief nod agreed then he gave a wide smile you first samuel laughed sudden and wide enough to flash fangs it was an echo of sampsons laughter as if when human hed been even more like his son the thought made me wonder if i was pregnant who would the baby be like would it be a little carbon copy of someone would there be a little jeanclaude running around the thought of a baby was terrifying but the thought of a little living version of jeanclaude wasnt horrible i shook my head hard enough that they all looked at me what is wrong ma petite sorry thinking too hard maybe ive never seen master vamps talk about honesty and friendship takes some getting used to samuel smiled at me i suppose for the executioner it would be a very alien concept i shook my head no as jeanclaudes human servant that is where it gets weird as the executioner i just kill people i dont talk to them he looked at me with those browngreen eyes a long considering look he turned the look back to jeanclaude i think we can help each other jeanclaude i will begin he gave a long sigh when sampson said that thea does not think like a human he is quite right she is the last of the sirens and it preys upon her mind she sees the promise of power in our boys and she is determined that it be brought out samuel hesitated and even through centuries of control he seemed uncomfortable thea comes from a time and a people where close family relationships were not a hindrance to sex or even marriage her people were worshipped as gods and goddesses are you familiar with the greek mythos anyone who is classically educated is familiar with the myths jeanclaude said youre making this a long story father samuel looked at him i admit that now that the time has come to be honest i am having second thoughts sampson touched his fathers hand let me then he shook his head no i am master and father and i will do it he looked back at jeanclaude thea tried to bring sampson into his powers as a siren jeanclaude and i just blinked at him richard was lost because we hadnt given him the whole story about how sirens come into their power or had we i couldnt remember anymore i was the one who said do you mean that your wife tried to seduce your son he nodded sampson came to me and i told her in no uncertain terms that if she ever tried to do it again i would kill her when the twins began to exhibit faint signs of power i gave her the talk again would you truly slay her jeanclaude asked the polite mask dropped and samuels eyes blazed for a second before he lowered his eyes and hid the anger i love my wife but i love my sons and they are children and cannot protect themselves against her in my mothers defense sampson said when i said no she took no for an answer she didnt have to im her son but im not a siren yet if shed pushed her powers then i wouldnt have had a choice she stopped when she realized i was horrified she didnt understand why it bothered me but she accepted it richard and i exchanged glances and for the first time i think we were both thinking gee it could be worse that there was a vampire out there sexually more disturbing than jeanclaude and belle morte eeek i fear samuel said that theas restraint will not be perfect the twins are seventeen old enough to marry old enough for much i fear that she will be tempted to push with them and they are not as strong of will as sampson it might take less to cloud their minds and lusts and would you do as you threatened jeanclaude asked even if the sex were to make them full sirens his face and voice were back to being very neutral they would come into their powers but i am not certain that their sanity would survive it can you imagine someone with theas powers or even more powerful because of my bloodline but mad completely broken in the mind i do not wish to be forced to either imprison or kill my own child jeanclaude and that is what we might have to do he shook his head and the worry on his face was like scars so deep as if he had carried this burden for a very long time it would be a terrible choice jeanclaude said samuel gathered himself and his face was back to being neutral hailfellowwellmet boynextdoorhandsome but if we can find a way to bring them into their powers without thea being involved then the choices are not horrible the choices are wonderous powerful and i would be in your debt it is by no means certain that sex with ma petite will do for your sons what you wish i opened my mouth to protest that i hadnt agreed to sex with any of them but he squeezed my hand as if wait perhaps not but i believe that i could convince thea that if anita could not make them full sirens none could not even thea herself if anita tries and fails then i believe that thea would accept that they are not sirens jeanclaude looked at me then if you have questions ma petite richard now is the time for them richard said did you say seventeen samuel nodded richard looked at me and the look was eloquent ive already turned them down as too young richard you dont need the look thanks i took my hand out of his because i hadnt deserved the look he gave me but youll fuck sampson i stood up letting go of both of them and stared down at him apologize to me richard apologize to me now embarrassment was on his face but so was anger i shouldnt have said it and im sorry i said it but dont expect me to be happy that youre adding another man to your list of lovers im not going to be happy about it anita im just not do i ask how many women youve slept with this week no but you dont have to meet them either i couldnt argue that fine youre right it would probably bug me to meet your dates i threw my hands up in the air damn it richard do you have an opinion on this that isnt based on jealousy he looked down then got up from the couch and paced away to the edge of the carpet all i can see when i look at sampson is that hes not bad looking and hes about my height and i dont want you fucking him but then i dont want you fucking anyone but me so he spread his hands wide and shrugged have i raised a sore point samuel asked an ongoing disagreement jeanclaude said if this is a problem sampson said then forget it we were under the impression that everyone was okay with anita adding to her list of men richard crossed his arms across his chest and said and if we dont do this because im not happy about it and your motherhe closed his eyes his face struggling with so many emotions god help me but you and your brothers are actually in a more perverted sexual mess than we are if i say no and the worst happenshe paced the edge of the white carpet as if the walls were still there i dont want to watch but it has to be anitas call i wont say no neither of us is monogamous so why should i bitch he stood there arms crossed shoulders hunched as if something hurt anita samuel said i looked at him still standing i sighed id rather not add to my list of men either truthfully but as jeanclaude has explained to me i need a new pomme de sang sooner rather than later im not promising but ill agree to try i couldnt look at anyone when i said it because it felt squeechy to agree to try to take another lover in front of three men i was already sleeping with good samuel said and there was such relief in that one word that i looked at him he was smiling his eyes sparkling with happiness and tears unshed tears glittered in his eyes in that moment i realized that he had accepted that his wife would seduce one of their sons and he would kill her and the son would be mad and he would have to kill him and too oedipal for words samuel had accepted that someday the worst would happen and suddenly he was saved he looked like a man who had thought the executioner was coming and the governor called instead i still wasnt sure how i felt about adding to my men but it was nice for a change to be someones salvation instead of their doom yeah being the savior instead of the executioner that sounded pretty damn good samuel smiled at jeanclaude and it was like a lot about samuel a very human smile i realized that he like auggie could be more normal than most vamps id ever seen was it a vamp trick like auggies had been maybe was it any of my business to mess with it and reveal his secret nope no more grand revelations tonight not that were my fault anyway i wasnt messing with anyone or anything tonight if i could help it my goal was simply to get through the rest of this interview without anything bad happening why was i so worried id sat back down beside jeanclaude but richard hadnt richard was still standing arms folded shoulders rounded as if with pain i knew the look on his face it was the look that usually meant we were going to have a really bad fight i didnt want to fight tonight not with anyone but especially not with richard jeanclaude touched my hand it made me jump and turn startled to him what is wrong ma petite i gave him a look and rolled my eyes back to our other third ah he said i gripped jeanclaudes hand tight and tried to head this fight off richard i made his name a question he turned those smoldering brown eyes to me what that one word was so angry that even he flinched im sorry what is it anita you dont have to pick a fight with me to leave there that was as honest and as calm as i could make it he frowned at me what does that mean it means that ever since we started talking to samuel about his sons and their problem your tension level has done nothing but rise and if we were talking about me having sex with three new women two of them seventeen years old wouldnt you be angry i thought about it then nodded yes then dont expect me to be happy about it what am i supposed to do richard apologize i wouldnt even be sure what i was apologizing about anyway ive told you that my answer was no on the seventeenyearold i think jeanclaude sampson and i will leave you all for the night samuel stood you seem to have much to discuss sampson stood alongside his father he was about two inches taller than samuel as if hed gained height from his mothers genetics i wondered what else he might have gained i really didnt know much about mermaids or sirens i probably needed to remedy that before i got too up close and personal with any of them not yet my friend please jeanclaude said he looked at richard giving a peaceful face to the unhappy one we need some riddles answered before we dare take ma petite among our brethren tomorrow night samuel nodded and sat back down youre wondering if you take her among nearly a dozen masters of the city whether the night will be even more interesting than this one jeanclaude nodded exactement are these questions that only a vampire can answer sampson asked it is from a master like your father that i need advice jeanclaude said then i could go back to the hotel and check on mother and the twins i think they have enough watchdogs sampson his father said sampson gave his father a look like he was trying to say something with his eyes and his father wasnt getting it youre leaving because you think it will make me less upset richard said sampson looked at him with that open honest face and nodded thatsrichards face struggled with his emotions because a friendly gesture honestly given always touched him thats really good of you you obviously dont like sharing anita and now here i am asking you to share her again we need her to help us i dont want to lose my mother and one or both of my little brothers sampson shook his head eyes staring off into space but not seeing anything in this room the look in his eyes was haunted as if he like his father had given up on avoiding the tragedy as if hed been picturing it all in his head for months trying to make peace with it and failing he looked up at richard i wont give up this chance to save my family but i am sorry that its causing you pain he came out into the middle of the room facing richard if my going will make you feel better i can do that richard hung his head his newly long hair hiding most of his face when he raised it again he looked like a man coming out of deep water shaking his hair back from his face insult to injury damn it did i say something wrong sampson asked no nothing wrong richard said he sighed and his arms started to unfold stiffly as if it hurt him to let go of the anger no i just didnt want to like you sampson looked puzzled i dont understand if i can hate you i can get angry and storm out if youd acted like some kind of lustful asshole i could have just gone wrapped my injured righteousness around me and gotten the hell out of here i stood up and faced him jeanclaude kept my hand lightly in his ive already told you richard i said you dont have to pick a fight to leave yes he said i do because i know that i cripple us as a power by simply not being here when you need me if id been here auggie wouldnt have rolled you i have no one but myself to blame that you and jeanclaude fucked auggie his voice held the edge of warmth and the first bite of his power flickered through the room i took a few steps leaving jeanclaudes hand behind why are you responsible for everything i asked i deal with more undead than you do i should have been able to protect myself and maybe i should have seen it coming but im not beating myself up about it it happened and now we deal with it is it really that easy for you anita it happened now we deal with it we move on i thought about it then nodded yes it is because it has to be my life wouldnt work if i wallowed in every disaster every moral quandary i cant afford the luxury of selfdoubt not to that degree luxury richard said this isnt luxury anita its morality its your conscience thats not a luxury item thats what separates us from the animals here we go again i thought out loud i said i have a conscience richard and my own set of morals do i ever worry that im a bad guy yeah sometimes i do do i wonder if ive traded away pieces of my soul just to survive yeah i shrugged its the price of doing business in the real world richard this isnt the real world anita this isnt the normal workaday world no but its our world i was facing him now almost close enough to touch he was controlling himself because his power was only a warm pressure in the air he waved his hands around the room this is not where i want to be anita i dont want to live where my choices are sharing you with other men or having people die i dont want those choices i sighed and let him see that i was tired and sad and sorry there was a time when i would have agreed with you but i like parts of my life a lot richard i hate the ardeur but i dont hate everything its brought into my life id have liked to try that whole picketfence thing but i think even without the ardeur and the vampire marks that it wouldnt have been my gig i think it would have been he said richard i dont think you see me i dont think you see who i am how can you say that to me if i dont shield i share your dreams and your nightmares but youre still trying to shove me in a box that i dont think fit me even when we met just like youre trying to shove yourself into a box that doesnt fit you either he was shaking his head thats not true thats not true which part i asked i think we could have made it our version of the white picket fence without him and he pointed at jeanclaude jeanclaude was giving his most peaceful empty face as if he were afraid to do or say anything dont try to blame all our problems on jeanclaude why not its true if he had left us alone not marked us youd be dead i said he frowned at me what without the extra power of the marks with jeanclaude youd never have had the power to kill marcus and keep the pack thats not true i just stared at him yeah richard i was there it is true youd be dead and id still be living alone sleeping with my stuffed toys and guns youd be dead and id be dead inside dying of loneliness not just because you would be gone but because my life was empty before i was like a lot of people who do police work i was my job i had nothing else my life was full of death and horror and trying to stay ahead of the next horror but i was losing the battle richard losing myself long before jeanclaude marked me i asked you to give up the police work i told you it was eating you up i shook my head youre not listening to me richard or youre not hearing me maybe i dont want to hear you or maybe im right and youre not listening we stood barely two feet apart but it might as well have been a thousand miles some distances are made out of things bigger and harder to travel across than mere miles we stood and stared at each other across a chasm of misunderstanding and pain and love i tried one last time say youre right say if jeanclaude had left us alone you could have your perfect picture i still wouldnt have given up the police work you just said it was destroying you i nodded just because somethings hard doesnt mean you give up on it somehow i thought i was talking about more than just police work you said i was right i said say youre right lets just pretend that without jeanclaude here we would have found a way but we are bound to him richard we are a triumvirate of power what we would change if life were totally different doesnt really matter how can you say that what matters richard is that we deal with the reality of our now this minute there are things we cant undo and we all have to work together to make the best of whats true in our lives his face was cold with his anger i hated his face like this because it was both frightening and more beautiful as if the anger cleaned away something that distracted the eye from realizing just how amazingly handsome he was and what is true in our lives his power began to flow through the room hot water hotter than youd want in the bath the guards around the room shifted uneasily i am jeanclaudes human servant you are his animal to call we are a triumvirate of power we cant change that jeanclaude and i both carry the ardeur we both need to feed the hunger and thats not going to change i thought you were hoping to be able to feed from a distance at the clubs the way jeanclaude did under nikolaos it crippled his power which is what the exmaster of the city wanted to do im not going to cripple us magically because im squeamish no more hiding richard the ardeur is here to stay and i need to feed it he shook his head no no what he let down his shields i dont know if it was on purpose or his emotions got the better of him whatever the cause i suddenly heard his thoughts like clear bells in my head he thought that once i got the ardeur under control id dump micah and nathaniel and live with him be with him he still hoped seriously that some day wed be a nice little monogamous pair it took only seconds for me to get all of it but his shields coming down had brought mine down too and he felt my shock my disbelief that he still thought seriously that that would ever happen i felt the next thought forming and tried to stop it tried to keep it halfformed or to shut him out but the emotions were too raw and i wasnt fast enough the thought was even if i am pregnant it would never work richards face showed the shock now he gaped at me and whispered pregnant i said the only thing that came to mind fuck i slammed every shield i had in place shut tight metal closed i thought metal smooth and thick and impenetrable i stared at the floor afraid to meet anyones eyes afraid of what id see in their faces or what i wouldnt anita richard said and his hand reached for me i stepped out of reach i was shaking my head i didnt know what i wanted out of this moment didnt know what reaction would please me and which one would piss me off id hoped to keep it secret until i knew for sure i did not want to open this can of emotional worms until it was a done deal it was samuel who broke the silence congratulations to both of you a baby joyous news indeed i turned slowly to look at him because of anyone in the room i cared least what he thought about the news him i could look at him i could be angry with sampson was already touching his fathers shoulder father i think we should leave now samuel was looking from his son to me to jeanclaude to most of the people around the room he looked utterly confused but this is wonderful news and youre all acting as if someone has died father sampson said soft and warningly he was looking at my face and whatever he saw there made him grab his fathers elbow and try to get him on his feet he stared at his sons hand until sampson let it drop away samuel then met my gaze his eyes didnt look friendly now they looked older full of some deep knowledge and sad around the edges and angry why such anger anita i started to count to twenty knew it wouldnt be enough and just said it in a voice that was choking with anger confusion dont tell me how to feel samuel you dont have that right he stood up and pushed his sons hands away from him think how powerful a child you and jeanclaude could have theres no guarantee its his i said the odds are that if you are pregnant it wont be any of the vampires richard said his voice was low and careful but there was something underneath all that that i hadnt wanted to hear eagerness i turned to him and i dont know what i would have said or even done because jeanclaude was just suddenly there between us do not do anything rash ma petite rash dont do anything rash i pulled away from him hes not unhappy about this and youre locked down so tight i dont know what youre feeling i feel that anything i say or do in this moment will upset you it was the most diplomatic way id ever been told that i was a pain in the ass i fought the urge to scream at him i managed a voice that was strangled low and tense with the effort not to yell say something i said are you with child he asked in that neutral pleasant voice of his i dont know but i missed october richard came closer and he tried for neutral failed but he tried have you ever missed a whole month before i shook my head no emotions fought on his face and finally he had to turn away as if whatever expression he had he was sure i wouldnt want to see it dont you dare be happy about this damn it he turned back face mostly under control but his eyes held that look that soft iloveyou look that once was meant just for me but which lately i hadnt seen much of id seen lust but not this would you prefer me to be angry or sad he asked no yes i dont know there that was the truth i dont know im sorry he said and he looked it around the edges sorry if im making this harder but how could i be completely unhappy if we made a child together he would pick the very worst way to say it the way most guaranteed to panic me its not a child yet its a bunch of cells smaller than my thumb his eyes got more careful what are you saying anita i hugged myself tight and wouldnt meet anyones eyes i dont know what im saying but i was beginning to have more sympathy with ronnies idea about just going away and making the choice without any of the men would you really be able to kill our baby he asked and i didnt have to see his face to know he looked hurt i could hear it in his voice mon ami you put the cart before the horse let her find out if she is pregnant before we make plans jeanclaude tried to move between us again tried to block my view of richard as if that would help richard moved around him so he could still see me anita could you really kill our baby i wanted to scream yes just to see the pain on his face but on this i couldnt lie i already knew the answer i just didnt like it no i yelled it and the sound echoed against the stones without the hanging drapes to soften it richards face softened and he started to walk toward me around jeanclaude the look on his face was almost beatific as if all his dreams had come true i felt as if i were suffocating in a nightmare and he looked like that i had to wipe that look off his face i had to what if its not yours i asked and my voice was ugly i wanted it to hurt he hesitated then got a look that was almost smug the odds are in my favor anita he looked entirely too pleased with himself why just because jeanclaude and asher and hell damian are several hundred years old that doesnt mean its not theirs look at samuel he has three sons two separate pregnancies richard started to frown he wasnt walking closer now good jeanclaude sighed and stepped back as if hed given up trying to stop the fight and what about micah and nathaniel i asked theyre not vampires and ive had more sex with them in the last two months than with you i was happy when he flinched ugly but true micahs fixed he said and his face darkened that leaves nathaniel there was such anger in those three words that i wished id left it alone as if on cue micah and nathaniel came out of the far hallway they looked at all of us and micah said is this about what i think its about you knew about the baby richard asked are we sure nathaniel asked no i said you both knew richard said and his power started up again i was suddenly standing too close to the metaphorical fire yes we knew micah said you told them before you told us richard said and he gestured at jeanclaude they live with me richard its harder to keep a secret from them i didnt want any of you to know until i did a test i didnt want to deal with all this crap if i didnt have to let us calm down until we know for certain jeanclaude said doesnt it bother you that she told them before us richard said no mon ami it does not richard glared at micah and nathaniel but his gaze finally settled on nathaniel not good you know that if she is pregnant its probably you or me richard said the words were neutral the tone wasnt the tone was a warning as clear as the heat rolling off his body nathaniel had one of the most careful looks id ever seen on his face he looked blank pleasant but not sorry not submissive always before when dealing with richard nathaniel had given off subservient vibes now suddenly there was nothing subservient about him he might still bottom to me but his days of doing it for richard were over it was there in the set of his shoulders the eye contact he gave the bigger man he wasnt being aggressive but he wasnt giving off those subtle submissive signals either his attitude said clearly he wasnt backing down on one hand i was happy to see it on the other hand it scared me id seen richard fight and id seen nathaniel fight i knew who would win of course if richard started the fight he would win the slugfest but hed lose the girl i hoped he understood that i dont know what would have happened something bad almost certainly but help came you guys are all being assholes it was claudia everyone turned to look at her how dare you make this about some macho ego shit cant you see shes scared she gestured in my direction ulfric if you think a baby will make her give up the police work and the execution work or the zombie raising youre wrong do you see a baby fitting into anitas life are you going to quit work and stay home and play nanny because anita sure isnt we all looked at richard he was scowling at her well she said are you are you willing to completely disrupt your life if its yours he scowled harder i dont know he said finally i will nathaniels voice turning us all back to him im already the wife why not the mother have you ever taken care of a baby claudia asked he shrugged no i had four younger brothers trust me its harder than it looks i will micah said whatever anita wants or needs stop being perfect richard said you work days richard nathaniel said and you work a regular weekday i can make more parttime at guilty pleasures than any teachers salary ive ever heard of so youd be a good provider richard said and his voice was full of scorn nathaniel smiled and shook his head anita provides for herself just fine she doesnt need my money what i meant was that dropping my work hours down wont affect my job that much it would ruin yours richard didnt want to be mollified he wanted to be angry so he turned to micah and what about you you work as many hours as anita does i would need more help running the hotline and the coalition we would have nearly a year to train someone to help me or even replace me if thats what was needed it cant be your baby richard said genetically no what does that mean genetically it means that just because its not blood of my blood doesnt mean its not mine ours yours and anitas and the words singed along my skin so much power so much anger it actually hurt no micah said anitas and nathaniels and jeanclaudes and ashers and damians and yours and mine leaving a little bit of sperm behind doesnt make you a father its what you do afterward richard you cant bring up a baby with seven fathers call it what you like micah said but the only two men in this room able to totally disrupt their lives if there is a baby are nathaniel and me he looked at jeanclaude or am i wrong jeanclaude smiled at him no mon chat you are not i do not believe that a baby could spend all its time in the underground of the circus of the damned and be he seemed to search for a word wellbalanced visits oui many visits but the world i have built here is not again he searched for a word conducive to the upbringing of small children im a small child came a small sweet voice from behind us apparently wed all been so caught up that we hadnt heard the approach of the tiny girl of course valentina was a vampire and the undead are quiet bastards her dark hair curled just below her ears shed cut it recently to look more modern her face was round and soft not long past being a baby she was five and would always be five at least physically she was wearing a red dress with white tights and little white patent leather shoes when she came to us shed worn nothing designed after she still wouldnt wear pants or shorts because it wasnt ladylike but she had arrived in the twentieth century at least in fashion she blinked large dark eyes at us her face perfectly innocent at belles court she had tortured people for information for punishment and because she enjoyed it jeanclaude told me that all the child vampires go mad eventually it was why it was against their laws to bring anyone over before puberty valentina had been made by a pedophile who happened to be a vampire he had been given an isolated territory and there he had made his own special playmates for almost fifty years before someone discovered what he was doing valentina had been one of the lucky ones hed brought her over but hadnt made her one of his brides yet most of his brides and grooms had to be destroyed too mad too savage for anything else that one of her vampires had done such things was one of her few things that belle morte seemed to feel guilty about yes jeanclaude said of course you are you are our petite fleur he moved forward as if he would herd her out of earshot of the grownup talk she may have looked five but she was over three hundred years old the body was a childs the mind was not but unless we were careful most of us had a tendency to treat her like she looked not like she thought she turned that tiny face to mine with those solemn eyes are you going to have a baby maybe i said she smiled flashing fangs as delicate as needles i would have someone to play with jeanclaude started to take her hand then hesitated in midgesture he had suffered at valentinas hands more than once he never truly forgot she was a monster he said where is bartolome hes supposed to be watching you today isnt he i dont know where he is she said gazing up at jeanclaude he laid the barest touch on her shoulder she looked past him to me the look in those eyes had nothing to do with childhood shes over three hundred years old jeanclaude dont shush her away like shes really five he looked at me valentina prefers to be treated as a child it is her choice he gazed down at her dont you ma dulce he lied with his voice but he did not touch her as if she were a child she nodded but those eyes gazed at me those eyes that held centuries of power trapped in a body too delicate to do most of the things in her mind there were nights when i felt sorry for her then there were moments like now when i wasnt certain that shed have been sane even if shed come over as an adult there was simply something in her that wasnt quite right it was sort of a chickenegg question on valentinas sanity shed never hurt me never done anything to purposefully frighten me but she was on my short list of people that i wouldnt have trusted if id been helpless and alone with her it had taken me months to realize that the reason she creeped me out was only partly the whole trappedinachildsbody thing months to admit to myself that i was more afraid of valentina than any other vamp who called jeanclaude master i think having a baby around would be fun she said fun how i asked not sure i wanted to hear the answer i wouldnt be the smallest anymore she said it should have been an innocent statement so why did i suddenly have the urge to tell her that if she tried to change my baby over into a vampire littler than herself i would fucking kill her paranoid or just cautious so hard to tell the difference sometimes richard moved closer to me and i let him i wasnt the only one who felt something was terribly wrong with her he put his arm across my shoulders and i let him do that too staring into valentinas eyes i would have let almost anyone comfort me no i said slowly no not too much time at the circus micah moved closer to us not touching me because richard never seemed to like that hed tolerate jeanclaude touching me with him but almost no one else but i wasnt the only one weirded out by the little girl jeanclaude looked back at us still touching her shoulder i must find bartolome and chastise him for not watching her better valentina pulled away from jeanclaude and he let her go she started walking farther into the room richard drew me in tighter against his body micah moved so that he was standing almost in front of me blocking her from coming closer to me normally i might have told him it wasnt necessary but i didnt like how interested shed been in the whole idea of the baby valentina walked around us the tension in my shoulders eased richards breath eased out in something like a sigh micah didnt relax he stayed tense just in front of us as if he didnt trust she wouldnt circle back she walked toward samuel and sampson what are you doing little one jeanclaude said she gave a perfect and very low curtsey holding her little dress out with her hands ankles crossing as she went down greetings samuel master of cape cod greetings valentina he said she offered him her hand he took the tiny hand in his and laid the barest touch of his mouth upon her wrist it was all protocol perfectly acceptable but the gesture showed better than any words that he wasnt comfy with her either she turned to sampson she gazed up at him her head tilted back very childlike but i would have bet anything i had that the searching look on her face wouldnt be childlike id had her stare at me before and knew that the face didnt match the intensity and personality in the eyes is this your son yes his name is sampson she held her tiny hand out to him too he took it but seemed unsure what to do with it i am not a vampire he said nor anyones servant or animal to call but you are his son his heir i am just one more vampire i am not even a true master she was saying that he outranked her sampson glanced at his father who must have given him some look because he raised the tiny hand to his mouth he like his father did the minimum touch he could get away with he like his father kept eye contact with her while he did it it reminded me of how you bow on the mat in judo you keep your eyes up as you do it never looking away from your opponent just in case but there was a difference between the two men one was a very master vampire the other was not he was part human and part mermaid and maybe someday he would be more but tonight he wasnt pick me up she said in that high littlegirl voice he picked her up and sat her in his lap she cuddled against him he was blinking out at the room frowning his face looked almost like he was in pain shit i said softly she had rolled him rolled him with her eyes jeanclaude said valentina he is our guest samuel raised a hand up i run my kiss in the old way he is my son my eldest if he cannot win free of a vampire who is not even a masterhe left the sentence unfinished you make him earn his place constantly jeanclaude said samuel nodded id never even heard of the rule he was talking about i said so i dont even know this rule it is a version of survival of the fittest ma petite if sampson is not strong enough to break free or avoid valentinas trickery then he is a little less worthy in his masters eyes it is a way that some masters of the city separate the weak from the strong those who fail these tests often are demoted traded to other lands or killed his voice was matteroffact but i knew him well enough to taste the faint disapproval very few american masters run their lands with this rule i am older than most of the american masters samuel said i looked at jeanclaude and he met my look but shes our vampire and we dont live by this rule richard hugged me onearmed as if he were afraid of what id do or say if his father decrees that sampson must break free of her gaze by himself then it is so but we will make it very clear to all our vampires that this gaze is illegal in our country it is seen as coercion he stared at valentina as he said it she pouted her lower lip out at him and snuggled in tighter to sampson he put his arms around her as if in response to the cuddling or maybe shed used mind tricks if shed rolled him enough not to need words to boss him around we were in deeper trouble than id thought because once vampires roll you that much they own you they can reclaim their victims at any time they can stand under their windows and call them out into the night hell some of them can call their victims across town like sleepwalkers if valentina had rolled him that badly hed give her blood anytime she asked hed have no choice i dont know what i would have done but suddenly there was new energy in the room the air smelled fresher faintly of salt and sea sampsons eyes cleared that confused bemused look fading his eyes changed from the hazel of his fathers to the flat black of his mothers he stared down at the vampire in his lap and his face had a look that id seen before it was a look that said his seemingly youthful face held wisdom decades beyond the outside packaging he gazed down at valentina with a face that showed he had lived every day of seventy years that he was no more his twentysomething niceguynextdoor package than valentina was a child he tried to lift her out of his lap but she clung to him playing the child for all she was worth dont you like me sampson he shook his head no he said i do not like you she pouted at him even managing to feign tears as if hed hurt her feelings maybe he had valentina was hard to figure he drew her away from his body and set her firmly on the ground you will not be able to trick me again for i felt your mind you are not a child valentina you do not think as a child he shivered rubbing his hands up and down his arms as if to cleanse them from the feel of holding her i saw what you wanted to do to me what you tried to persuade me i wanted to do he shivered again your mind has begun to want things beyond your bodys years pain is your substitute for sex she put her hands on her hips and stomped her little foot i dont know what you are talking about perhaps it is you that desires such things then she turned to jeanclaude master can you not find one among all the visitors who would let me hurt him i miss it she said it as if there were no contradiction in telling sampson he was the pervert and then asking to do what hed accused her of wanting to do jeanclaude sighed asher if you would take her back to bartolome asher pushed himself up from the chair where hed gone nearly motionless during all the hoopla but nathaniel said ill take her we all looked at him he smiled you need to talk vampire business with samuel asher will be more useful for that than i will he walked toward us to say good night and micah moved out of the way so he could lean in toward me richards arm was still holding me close to his body he tensed and moved as if hed take me out of nathaniels reach nathaniel touched his arm and richard froze his power lashed out like lightning scoring along my skin ouch richard that fucking hurt nathaniel shivered that really did hurt but his voice didnt sound like a complaint back up richard said his voice holding an edge of growl he was controlling his power enough so it didnt actively hurt me but it was like cuddling next to a stove that you just knew was going to get too hot to touch soon nathaniel smiled and pushed in against us both pressing his chest against richards arm richard moved away but he tried to take me with him and frankly i just didnt want to be in the middle of it so i stopped moving but nathaniel was so close i couldnt step forward either richard had choices pick me up or hurt me to move me or let me go or move away without me or stay where he was with nathaniel touching him richard tried to move back while i tried not to move and nathaniel just watched us from an inch away richard wasnt willing to move without me or leave me alone with nathaniel the symbolism was too raw for words nathaniel spoke low and soft his lavender eyes raised to the taller mans face his chest almost pinning richards arm between us youre like a dog marking your territory maybe you should piss on her so well all know shes yours i froze between them because this was going to be bad richard growled low and deep the sound of it vibrating over my skin and into nathaniels body we both shivered but i dont think it was for the same reasons stop it both of you i said shes not a bone that only one of us can have nathaniel said richard growled again and this time richards power rippled along my skin like little slaps of electricity nathaniel and i spoke at the same time i said that hurts nathaniel said yummy you are such a freak richard said almost a yell maybe but this freak is willing to do for the woman he loves and his baby what you wont do richard jerked away so suddenly it made me stumble nathaniel caught me but richard backed up nathaniel backed him down not with power but with truth nathaniel held me and i let him because if id pulled away now the whole show would have been wasted id hung around the lycanthropes long enough to understand what was happening nathaniel my submissive nathaniel was stepping up to bat he was showing the most dominant person in my bed that he was a force to be reckoned with why tonight why did nathaniel have to draw his line in the sand tonight the baby of course the baby something about the whole baby question had made nathaniel feel like he had to be more dominant or maybe he like me was just tired of watching richard say he was the dominant sweetie in my life but acting like he was my fuck buddy nothing wrong with a fuck buddy but you cant be the love of someones life and a fuck buddy they are mutually exclusive nathaniel held me and i wrapped my arms around him hiding my face against his chest because i wasnt sure what expression was on my face nathaniel had stood up to richard and won what else was going to change just because of the possibility of a baby ill take valentina you guys stay and talk business youre part of the business micah said from behind us but you can fill me in later and im not really going to have an opinion on the vampire stuff he grinned im also the least likely to object to anyone anita is willing to take as a pomme or a lover he kissed me on the forehead and whispered besides valentina doesnt bother me i looked up at him and that bothers me a little that youre not creeped the grin softened to a smile i know he kissed me on the mouth soft gentle he pulled away and i let him go still not sure what had changed in him valentina came to him and he took her hand he began to lead her toward the far hallway she looked back and stuck her tongue out at us claudia sent lisandro to accompany them aloud she said make sure bartolome isnt doing anything he shouldnt but i was pretty sure after valentinas show with sampson she just didnt trust any of the nonvamps alone with her me either how can you love him richard asked i turned to look at him he stood shoulders hunched rubbing his hands up and down his arms as if he were cold but i knew he wasnt cold or at least not the kind of cold that blankets and skin warmth could fix it was a coldness of the heart or the soul or the mind that cold that eats a hole through the middle of who you are and leaves something dark and awful behind i looked at him and wondered how to answer his question how to answer without making the pain in his body worse i sighed and finally realized that the only thing i could give him was the truth whatever we were to each other whatever else we might someday be to each other truth at least truth was between us i asked you a question he said and his power warmed the room like opening an oven to peek inside the heat dissipated almost as soon as id felt it he was trying to control himself why do i love nathaniel i asked thats what i asked he said in that angry voice because he never makes me feel like a freak because he is a freak richard snarled anyone looks sane beside him i felt my face shutting down felt that flatness that i used when i was really pissed and trying to control it perhaps this is not the time for this conversation jeanclaude said in a careful voice we both ignored him first i said in a very tight careful voice nathaniel is not a freak second hes willing to disrupt his entire life if he got me pregnant and youre not so id be careful before you throw stones at his character if youre pregnant ill marry you the room was suddenly full of one of those silences so thick you should have been able to walk across it i stared at him for a second or two then said jesus mary and joseph richard is that all you think it takes to fix this marry me so the baby wont be a bastard and its all better i dont see anyone else offering marriage he said its because they know ill say no every other man in my life understands that this isnt about marriage its about the fact that we may have created a little person and we need to do whatever is best for that person how will marrying anyone make this work better he looked at me and there was such pain in his face such struggle as if id said something incomprehensible if you get a woman pregnant you marry her anita its called taking responsibility for your actions and if its not your baby could you really raise someone elses baby could you really stay married to me and play daddy as you watched the baby grow to look like someone else he covered his face with his hands and he screamed no he showed me a face ravaged by rage the room was suddenly hot again as if his power were raising the actual temperature no id go crazy is that what you wanted to hear is it no i said but you needed to hear it he frowned at me what i appreciate the offer richard really i do but if i was going to marry anyone it would have to be someone who would be okay no matter who turned out to be the father so youll marry nathaniel or micah the heat bit along my skin i am not going to marry anyone dont you get that you just said i cut him off no that isnt what i said or what i meant its what you heard youre pregnant anita maybe im pregnant i said dont you want a father for your baby i stared at him wondering what could i say that hed actually hear and understand jeanclaude stepped close to us not between us but as if the three of us were a shallow triangle i believe what ma petite is saying richard is that marriage is not part of her plans and that having a baby will not change that his voice was his pleasantly neutral one the one that he used when he was trying to persuade or calm and not make things worse and if its my baby then im just supposed to be okay with nathaniel and micah raising it i hung my head what could i say to that ulfric claudia said yelling that one word the way a drill sergeant yells at a bad recruit he looked at her what his power bit along my skin again first control your power its biting along everyones skin youre the wolf king you need to set a better example what i set for my people is my business rat she continued as if he hadnt spoken second youre making anita feel worse than she already does he made a wordless sound almost a yell his power went back to just being heat but not painful his voice came careful each word thick with suppressed rage he was swallowing it but it was still there i dont want to make anita feel worse but if shes pregnant then she has to know that she cant keep living the life shes living you still want to trap her claudia said trap her and put her in some kind of s cage marriage is not a trap he said you make it sound like i want her barefoot and pregnant dont you she asked and her anger was softer now as if she finally understood he wasnt being a jerk he just didnt understand himself no he said and he meant it he turned back to me you said it yourself anita whatevers best for this little person do you really think being a federal marshal and dealing with all kinds of violent crime and monsters is the kind of life that a baby needs jesus richard i said youre still trying to take away my life to take away what makes me who i am you love me but not who i am you love who you want me to be isnt that what you want from me he said dont you want me to change who i am too i started to say no then stopped myself i thought about it was i asking him to change as much as he was asking me i want you to embrace the life you already have and be happy in it richard you want me to totally change my life and try to fit in some whitepicketfence picture that doesnt match your life or mine i am so sick of you accusing me of wanting to put you behind a white picket fence i may be pregnant and suddenly you want me to marry you and give up being a federal agent we arent even sure there is a baby and youre already trying to impose your idea of what our life should be on me could you really keep working on serial killer cases and killing monsters after you have a baby i stared at him what do you think having a baby will do to me richard do you think just because i have a baby ill become this other person this softer gentler person is that what you think may i add something to this discussion samuel asked richard and i said no jeanclaude said yes samuel ignored us and did what jeanclaude said if my wife is any example of having children in these rather extraordinary circumstances then softer is not what will happen thea was gentle with the children there was indeed a new softness that i had never seen but with everyone elsehe shook his head i had never seen her so ruthless as after sampson was born she was more determined than ever to make our base of power strong and secure any threat to us was destroyed immediately even with the help of servants she insisted on caring for him herself and with the feedings well he shrugged with hands up having to wake every two hours to breastfeed meant very little sleep lack of sleep makes anyones temper worse and makes the most expedient solution look good i was thinking breastfeeding oh no so not my gig richard said youre saying that to make me feel what worse better ask someone you trust then samuel said ask a woman how exhausting and overwhelming a new baby can be i have three children two of them twins i did what many fathers do when they have children later in life i did more of the baby care with the twins than i did with sampson my power base was more secure and there was less business to occupy me i think i had been too exposed to modern america i had this odd idea that i should be very involved with the twins it gave me a new respect for what thea went through with sampson when i was more occupied with business a child is a great blessing he patted his sons leg when he said it but like other great blessings they require a great deal of time attention and energy i shook my head waving my hands in the air as if to erase all of this i cant deal with this now weve got to change topic at least until i take the test and find out for sure if the tests positive then we can talk but until we know for sure this topic is closed you cant just change the topic richard said yes jeanclaude said she can what if i dont want to change the topic again i got the impression that richard was spoiling for a fight micah finally said something anita is only asking to change the topic until we know for sure richard that makes sense you stay out of this richard yelled it at him dont yell at micah i yelled at him ill yell at whoever i want to yell at he yelled claudia yelled us both to silence a huge deep sound that made us all look at her are your hurt feelings the only thing that matters here ulfric she shook her head nathaniels right youd piss on her if you could if that would make her yours and yours alone he growled and took a step toward her no jeanclaude said no richard are you picking a fight with him micah asked he sounded puzzled he was right it wasnt like claudia to start the fight shed finish the fight but not start it she actually looked at the floor i think she was counting to ten i dont want to start a fight with anyone but im tired of the attitude what attitude i asked she pointed at richard his attitude she wasnt the only one but out loud i said i dont think your starting a fight with richard will make me feel better im sorry for that then she gave richard a completely hostile look but hes like so many men he thinks that if he could just get you pregnant just get you married youd be the perfect little woman i do not think that richard said you dont she said no he said then whats with the proposal youre supposed to propose if youve got someone pregnant she gave a nod and whats with anita not being a federal marshal or a vampire executioner the life shes living right now just doesnt seem like the kind of life that would be good for a baby no i said it doesnt he turned and looked at me you agree with me yes of course i agree that my life wont work with a baby but this is the only life i have richard this is who i am i cant remake myself just because there may be a baby yes he said you can if you want to badly enough you can change are you going to give up being a teacher he looked away and shook his head i love being a teacher and i love being a federal marshal you hate it too yeah sometimes i hate it and maybe ill burn out on all the violent cases maybe ill reach a point where i cant do it anymore but i do enjoy the police work and im good at it you enjoy seeing mutilated corpses i shook my head get out what ma petite please jeanclaude said and came to hold me i didnt pull away but i stayed stiff and unyielding in his arms i was so angry i couldnt even think all i knew for certain was that i needed richard to be somewhere else because if he stayed here saying stupid shit i was going to say something unforgivable or he was we were close to the kind of fight that there is no fix for samuels pleasant and ohsoreasonable voice came perhaps we should discuss the topics that will allow all of you to survive this weekend and keep sovereignty of your own territory in your own hands that got everyones attention even richards what are you talking about he said if anitas powers are as disruptive to other masters of the city as they have been to augustine then what will you do what will the other masters do when they see augustine follow her and jeanclaude around like a lovesick dog she ordered augustine around she exhibited necromancy that controlled a master of the city that is legend among us ulfric but not present reality i saw augustine strain against her compulsion i do not know even now whether he used his full powers on anita because he wished for sex with a woman of the ardeur once more or to keep her from bespelling him completely better to be tied to her by love and lust than by blind obedience in truth i am not certain that augustine himself knows why he did it or what might have happened if he had chosen another defense samuel sighed you cannot take her to the ballet tomorrow without knowing if her attraction is universal or whether it is mainly belles line that is susceptible to it were you drawn to her jeanclaude asked i feel some attraction yes but not to the degree that augustine did i am not fighting to keep from touching her or doing what she says i sense her power and when she was using her necromancy it was most impressive but no i did not feel compelled then is it just belles line jeanclaude asked or perhaps only vampires that have experienced belles ardeur are strongly drawn i was finally relaxing into jeanclaudes arms that would explain it he didnt sound like he believed it was that simple but jeanclaude you must understand that i feel her power i am over a thousand years old and a master of the city i have as my animal to call a siren i am not a small power yet she does have a certain he seemed to search for a word attraction even to me i am not burdened by it but it is there you said you wished my advice i do i advise that you find a way to test her powers before she meets the larger party how i know that maximillian of vegas has one of belles line as his pomme de sang candidate he would be thrilled if you asked to see one of his candidates early he will see it as a point of favor we would have to see at least one candidate from each of the masters then in private but if it goes wrong i said arent we running the risk that whoever we experiment on may be metaphysically bound to me forever samuel nodded yes he looked at me like whats wrong with that it wouldnt be fair i cant experiment on them run the risk of binding them to me if they dont know what the risks are but they have come hoping to be your new pomme de sang samuel said they have come hoping to bind themselves to you jason has been jeanclaudes pomme de sang for years but if he decided to go back to college or change jobs or fell in love and didnt want to keep being a pomme de sang he could do that wed miss him and i think hed miss jeanclaude but he has choices he isnt trapped into being jeanclaudes pomme forever i moved away from jeanclaude and faced samuel what youre suggesting takes away their options its like making them a slave without asking first if thats what they want samuel smiled at me freedom and fairness are very important to you arent they i nodded and frowned theyre important to everybody he laughed oh no anita you would be amazed at the number of people who try to give away their freedom at every opportunity they much prefer that someone else make their decisions as for fairness you said it earlier life isnt fair no life isnt fair but i try to be he nodded and stood clapping his hands together she is a rare find jeanclaude thank you he said as if the compliment were all for him and none for me to make these experiments with their knowledge anita samuel said needs jeanclaude to admit to the other masters that you all of you have no idea what the extent of your powers are you would have to admit weakness and confusion when what you must have this weekend is strength surety and unassailable power no ones power is unassailable i said he gave a small bow touché but my point is still valid to expose that much of your uncertainty to some of the masters would be nearly suicidal he came to stand in front of me think upon this anita if you are with child then it is no longer just your life you risk is your sense of fair play worth the risk of letting the other masters of the city see your weaknesses for what will they think if you admit to this being a new power might they think that they should destroy you before you enslave us all jeanclaude moved to my side micah came to my other side i just stared at samuel i mean you no harm anita but i am not as insecure as some the insecure ones will be your danger if we cant tell the truth what do you propose i asked you couldnt simply lie he asked im not very good at it i said he smiled and looked at jeanclaude how have you managed with her and the ulfric they are both most unwieldy you have no idea jeanclaude said samuel laughed again then his face stilled as if the laughter had been a trick of the eye tell the masters that you wish to see how powerful their candidates are and whether they can withstand your full powers tell them that if their candidates are too weak they may be enslaved as any servant for jeanclaude is so powerful that that has happened with some lesser vampires of the church of eternal life that actually did happen with some of the church members i said he smiled again but it never reached his eyes so i had heard i glanced at jeanclaude did you tell him no you have spies in your lands anita you are too great a power not to have spies from all the masters that agreed to come here none of us would have come to your lands without some intelligence of our own finding none of us trust any of us that much great i said but it sets up the situation perfectly anita you can tell the truth that you wish to see if the candidates are strong enough to withstand your powers for a true pomme de sang as you so accurately stated is not so closely bound to you metaphysically to eat only from those who are already bound to you is like eating your own arm it may fill your stomach but it takes more energy from you then it gives to you it took us a little while to figure that out i said he gave another small bow your new pomme de sang must be independent and strong enough to play his part it is a reasonable request it is a good plan jeanclaude said and what if they all fall under my whatever spell what if im too much necromancer for any of them then the ball is canceled samuel said you cannot play cinderella if all the princes will want you im not cinderella i said im the prince he smiled but again it didnt reach his eyes very well prince charming but the point remains the same you cannot play prince charming if all the princesses want you because as good as you may be no one is that good he looked at jeanclaude then not even jeanclaude that look and that comment made me wonder if they really were friends the way that jeanclaude and augustine had been they said that they werent but the look meant something we will do as you suggest samuel i know that i can rely on your discretion not to share any of this you have my word he said then he looked back at me i would never endanger you i want you to try to bring sampson into his power anita i would not insist it be done first but i would prefer sooner to later i know it wont be tonight i said he smiled and this time it filled his eyes with soft humor no not tonight i think your plate is quite full enough without adding sampson to it he bowed to jeanclaude sampson followed suit they turned on their heels and left claudias voice broke the silence do you want me to go out and get a pregnancy test we have two of them in the overnight case micah said my throat was suddenly so tight i couldnt breathe nathaniel and lisandro came through the far hallway what did i miss i looked at him and the look on my face must have been a bad one because he came to me and wrapped his arms around me and i let him shes missed a month you dont have to wait until morning to take the test claudia said i wanted to tell her to stop stop talking stop helping but she was right i wasnt just two weeks late like id told ronnie my period could move around by up to two weeks later or earlier depending on my hormone cycle i guess if i used the count that most women did i was nearly four weeks late not two two weeks into the month of november but four weeks past when i should have bled four weeks yeah the test should work a pregnancy test is just this flat piece of plastic with little windows in it so small it fit in my hand with room left over and my hands arent that big such a small thing to have so many people so upset but then if i was pregnant the baby would be smaller than the pregnancy test tiny bits of plastic and even tinier bits of cells and my whole life rested on them okay i wouldnt die if it was a yes but it sort of felt like i would first theres no dignity to it you have to pee on the little stick or pee in a cup then put the stick in it then you put the cap on and wait for lines to appear one line not pregnant two lines pregnant it seemed simple enough i prayed not to be pregnant i prayed and i bargained id be more careful id use condoms and not trust just to the pill id well you get the idea im sure i wasnt the first single woman to sit in a bathroom wishing hoping praying bargaining with god that if this mess passes me by ill be better shit i didnt want to sit in the bathroom for the entire three minutes but i didnt want to go outside and face the men either i compromised i paced inside the bathroom it was ten steps from the door to the edge of the tubs raised marble ten steps back and forth marble is cold on bare feet but i usually didnt spend this much time walking on it i was either coming in and out or sitting in hot water in the tub i concentrated on anything everything but that little piece of plastic where it sat on the side of the sink i tried not to look at it if you peek early it may not be conclusive i was carrying a mans watch in my hands micahs watch hed taken it off his wrist and handed it to me because mine was still sitting on the nightstand beside our bed i tried putting the watch in the pocket of the robe but that made me nervous as though if i couldnt see the watch id screw the time up i tried sitting on the edge of the tub staring at the second hand but that made the time go even slower now that i was only minutes away from knowing i wanted to know no more guesswork i needed to know one way or the other i needed to know what i didnt know was that micah had set an alarm on the watch it beeped at me and scared me i gave that little eep scream that only girls seem to do claudia knocked on the door anita you all right sorry alarm startled me sorry i was already in the middle of the room opposite the sink all i had to do was turn around i had a death grip on the watch my heart was beating so hard i was sure that everyone outside the door could hear it i didnt want to look i wanted to know and i didnt want to know i wanted to have someone else look micah would do it or nathaniel god i was being so cowardly and stupid as if simply not looking would make it not true but i had to look i had to i took those last few steps to the sink and looked down two lines two fucking lines the world swam and i had to grab on to the sink edge to keep from sliding to one side all i could hear was my own blood roaring in my ears i was not going to faint damn it i was not going to faint i lowered myself to my knees still clinging to the cabinet edges i put my face against my arm and waited for the dizziness to pass fuck when i thought i could do it without feeling worse i raised my head up the room didnt swim good but i wasnt at all sure i trusted myself to walk to the door i hated it but apparently my body had decided that it just wasnt working yet i could either sit on the floor until i felt less weaklegged or i could yell for help i knew the men were almost as tense about it as i was so waiting seemed cruel or maybe it wasnt cruel they had a few minutes more of believing the worst hadnt happened i hated to treat the miracle of life like a disaster but thats how it felt i finally called in a voice that almost sounded like mine claudia she tapped the door and said do you want me in there yes i said she came through and one look at me on the floor made her close the door behind her she walked to me looked down at the test and said with real feeling well shit yeah i said who do you want to tell first i shook my head and leaned back against the cabinets no one she gave me a look i cant call them in one at a time richard will get pissed or someone else will i have to go out to them she gazed around the room theyd all fit in here barely i tucked my knees up tight and held on jesus claudia jesus she knelt beside me her face was so sympathetic that i had to look away my eyes were starting to burn my throat to tighten help me do this before i start to cry what can i do to help she asked help me stand she took my offered hand and raised me effortlessly to my feet she kept a hand on my elbow to steady me as if she knew i needed it i didnt argue we made it to the door that way then i took my arm back and opened the door i thought i had my face under control but i must have been wrong because they all reacted to it only jeanclaude and asher showed nothing but their lack of reaction was reaction enough micah and richard reached me first at almost the same time they looked at each other and micah bowed out let the other man touch me first it was good of him but id have preferred to hug him since i was almost certain richard would say something to make me feel worse he halfhugged me so he could hold me and still see my face its a yes i nodded because i didnt trust my voice my throat was so tight it hurt as if i were choking he hugged me and picked me up and spun me around when i could move my face back enough to see his he was beaming at me beaming at me he was happy happy about it dont you dare be happy about this i said his smile began to fade around the edges jeanclaude said would you prefer he was unhappy about it richard put me down while i looked at the other man i glanced back up at richard who didnt look happy now at all what would i have done if he had been angry or sad about me being pregnant i hung my head resting the top of my head against richards chest im sorry richard im sorry im glad someone is happy about it he touched my face raised it so i had to look at him i cant be unhappy about this anita i cant if we made a babyhe shrugged and his eyes were full of happiness worry so many emotions what do you want us to say ma petite if we are not to be happy then what do you wish i pulled away from richard i just couldnt be happy and his being happy bugged me i dont know just be what you feel i guess micah touched my arm im sorry youre unhappy about it i smiled at him and the fact that i could smile at anything was probably a good sign how do you feel about it he smiled i love you how could i not love a little piece of you running around i shook my head dont you feel cheated i mean it cant be yours he shrugged i knew i gave up children of my own when i had the vasectomy why did you have yourself fixed richard asked youre not thirty yet why would you do that to yourself micah wrapped his arms around me held me close my old alpha chimera liked pregnant shapeshifters if one of the women came up pregnant by someone else someone she cared for chimera would take her until she lost the baby he got off on taking her from her lover from fucking her while she was pregnant with someone elses child and from her losing it i held him tight held him and listened to his heartbeat speed his voice never showed how awful it had been but his pulse did i had heard the story before but richard had not his face showed revulsion and something else anger i think id never heard a story about chimera that made me unhappy that id killed him no that was one death i had absolutely no regrets about nathaniel came up behind me and wrapped himself against my back holding me between the two of them it felt so safe even now even with micahs story still horrible and fresh even with the news about the baby i still felt safe that had to be a good sign didnt it jeanclaude came to our side we all raised our heads from the various shoulders we were on and looked at him he touched my face ever so gently and smiled whatever happens ma petite we will not desert you asher walked around to the other side so i stood in a box of the four of them im not really included am i richard said and his voice held more sadness than anger micah said you could be if you wanted to be richard no one excludes you but you he held his hand out toward richard richard stared at that hand then looked at all the men i cant anita i cant be part of this a part of what mon ami jeanclaude asked all of you together richard said micah let his hand fall were not asking you to have sex with everyone richard were just comforting anita and ourselves youre a shapeshifter you understand the need for touch when youre worried or scared richard shook his head its always about sex with him he pointed at jeanclaude dont let him fool you micah hes enjoying touching you it seemed hed decided that of the other men micah was the one most likely to understand his unease micah slid his arm around jeanclaudes waist pulled him in a little tighter against him and me it forced jeanclaude to put more of his arm across micahs shoulders put the line of their bodies against each other from hip to chest micah kept his gaze on richard while he got cozy if he were another shapeshifter theyd enjoy the touch too weve all had a shock were all feeling insecure richard were all wondering how much our lives must change to accommodate a baby were scared arent you youre nimirraj are you saying you cant smell when someones afraid there was derision in his voice i thought youd get angry if i told you that you smelled of fear richards hands made fists his face darkening with anger he fought for control of himself visibly it was almost painful to watch him fight his anger and since his power never once warmed the room he was controlling so much more than just his anger he started walking toward us jerkily as if his feet didnt want to move he moved like some reluctant robot until he came to the edge of the knot of men then he stopped he just stood there beside us as if he didnt know what to do next jeanclaude moved making a hole between himself and nathaniel it was an invitation to join the circle richard just stood there eyes on the ground hands limp at his sides it was nathaniel who moved even farther out letting go of me and only keeping ashers hand nathaniel moved so that the circle became almost half a circle jeanclaude took his cue from nathaniel and moved farther away from me his arm still around micah i stood alone with the men like a backdrop richard stood there unmoved as if he hadnt noticed i took a step forward and touched fingertips to the fringe of his hair where it hid the edge of his face he flinched and raised his eyes to me the pain in those brown eyes made my throat tight maybe i was just having an emotional night or maybe if you love someone you can never see that much pain in his eyes without wanting to fix it i had to go up on tiptoe to touch his face one hand resting against his arm to steady myself i rested my hand against the side of his face just at the swell of his cheekbone feeling the strength of that curve under my hand his face was like him strong and outwardly perfect inside that nearly perfect male package there was a storm raging it showed in his eyes all that pain that anger his arm flexed under my hand the smooth swell of muscle molding itself against the curve of my hand i wasnt sure if hed done it to remind me how strong he was or if it was the only sign that he was still flinching from the look in his eyes i was betting on flinching he began to lean in toward me as i stretched upward to meet him our lips met but it was more a touch than a kiss his lips moved against mine the gentlest of kisses i kissed him back a soft caress of lips then his mouth pressed against mine and there was nothing gentle about it he broke from the kiss with a sound that was half sob and half sigh he fell to his knees dragging me with him clinging to me as if i were the last solid thing in the universe i held him stroked his hair murmured his name richard richard over and over he cried like his heart was breaking jeanclaude knelt beside us he put his hand on the back of richards head when he didnt react to the touch jeanclaude put his arms around both of us he laid his face against the side of richards head and said something in french that i didnt catch whatever he said it was low and comforting nathaniel knelt on the other side opposite jeanclaude he touched my shoulder but hesitated about touching richard it was clay who came and knelt at richards back he gave me worried eyes and pressed himself along richards back his arms holding him tight he said smell the pack and know that you are safe it sounded like an old saying with clays body to protect richard nathaniel hugged me and clay but we all hugged richard clay had understood how much richard needed the touch but hed also understood that he might not let leopards and vampires get that close but another wolf of his own pack that was safe that one moment of understanding pushed clay from bodyguard to friend in my book micah came in at my back hugging us close asher finally knelt more by nathaniel and me than richard but his hand touched richards hair we all gave what we could the crying began to ease then stop i felt the tension in his arms his body ease his breath went out in a long heavy sigh i felt him settle into the warmth and the touch i felt all that care and worry drift away in the press of bodies and caring then he drew in a deep full breath and rose up higher on his knees it was like a man rising from deep water except that this water was hands and bodies he rose to his knees then started struggling to his feet we all moved back to let him stand he smiled down at me at all of us thank you all of you i needed it i didnt know how muchhe started to move out of the kneeling circle of us jeanclaude and clay moved back so he could walk out he stopped at the foot of the bed and took a breath so deep his body shuddered with it jeanclaude stood and helped me to my feet i didnt protest the help i felt shaky richard wasnt the only one who needed to be held tonight everyone got to their feet in ones and twos we waited for richard to say something or for one of us to think of something worth saying he turned back and gave us a smile it was his old smile his boy scout smile i used to call it he looked more relaxed than id seen him in a while ill bunk in jasons room tonight you dont have to leave i said the smile slipped a little letting some sadness through i cant sleep here anita not with all of them i dont think everyone is staying i said he shrugged i dont want to share you anita especially tonight but i saw your face when nathaniel and micah held you you never look that peaceful with me anymore i opened my mouth to say something comforting but he held up a hand and stopped me dont deny it anita im not angry justhe shook his head i dont know what to do but i know i cant share you tonight it will be dawn soon and you wont want jeanclaude with us hes the only one i could stand to share you with tonight he shrugged again but youll want something warmer his face struggled to look cheerful and almost succeeded its better if i just go ill say or do something to upset anita tonight i know i will his frown turned into something bitter for a second i appreciate the comfort i needed it but part of me still wishes you were all gone with that he turned on his heel and went for the door clay i said go with him clay didnt argue and when he followed him out richard didnt protest i took it as a good sign i hoped so anyway jeanclaude hugged me in against his body i am sorry ma petite asher came and kissed me on the cheek i am not sorry he is gone be nice i said he cuddled in against me his arm going around jeanclaudes shoulders we all behaved ourselves admirably and your ulfric still leaves in a huff nathaniel came to stand in front of me he pushed a lock of my hair back from my face honestly anita im not sorry hes staying somewhere else for the night i want to hold you tonight and richard wouldnt let me in the bed they were both right so why did i feel like i should defend richards honor enough of this jeanclaude said ma petite is tired we will leave her with micah and nathaniel he kissed my upturned face gently his face showing nothing there were nights when he asked not to be sent away but tonight he didnt even try for it he let me go and started for the door asher at his side it seems wrong to keep kicking you out of your own bed micah said jeanclaude turned back and said ma petite is not comfortable when i die at dawn we will respect her sensibilities in this tonight she has had enough shocks for one night asher slipped his arm through jeanclaudes well be in my room id seen them arm in arm a hundred times id sent them off to bunk in ashers room dozens of times but for the first time i wondered what they would do once they got there would they have sex would they do with each other what jeanclaude and i did with auggie did the thought bother me i wasnt sure micah looked at me damian doesnt die at dawn if hes with you shouldnt we find out if the same applies to jeanclaude dont push me micah i felt almost frantic with the need for some kind of normality tonight my voice didnt sound frantic it sounded angry he can sleep on the other side of me so if he dies at dawn you wont be touching him i shook my head why is this so important to you why tonight i do think we need to find out if jeanclaude has gained some of the same powers damian has but truthfully belle morte had a harder time controlling you once he touched you id like to keep him close to you tonight just in case i blinked at him then sighed practical as always i said eminently practical asher said he let go of jeanclaudes arm i will go to my lonely bed asher i said please i cant deal with any more hurt feelings tonight he smiled at me and came back to me he hugged me gently and gave me an almost brotherly kiss on the forehead i will not cause either of you more distress tonight but i would like a chance to test this theory of vampires in the day if it works for our jeanclaude then perhaps it might work for me it only works for damian if nathaniel is in the room i think without richard it wont work for jeanclaude either asher stepped back gave that gallic shrug and went for the door he waved at us lightly but i had too many centuries worth of memories of his body language thanks to jeanclaudes memories asher was bothered i guess i couldnt blame him he was the only one kicked out of the room but i didnt call him back i didnt really want to have one corpse in the bed let alone two i turned back to the corpse in question he stood there in his elegant robe a triangle of his chest showed so pale surrounded by the black of the fur lapel his hair was a foam of curls softer than mine tiredness came over me in a wave no it wasnt being pregnant it was just everything i had had all i could handle for one night micah hugged me from behind nathaniel came to stare down at me he lifted my chin and looked into my eyes he gave me the gentlest of smiles then said youre beat i nodded his fingers still under my chin he kissed me on the mouth still gentle no demand to it he took my hand and started leading me toward the bed micah let his arm fall away but kept my other hand so that nathaniel led us both to the bed the bed was draped in red tonight crimson from the curtains that graced the four posts to the mounds of pillows the sheets underneath the bedspread either would match the rest perfectly or would be some highcontrast color once upon a time jeanclaudes decoration had been exclusively black and white id complained i still remembered the first night id seen the bed draped in red id stopped complaining about the monochrome color scheme after that afraid of what he might do next nathaniel had to let go of my hand to wiggle the coverlet out from under the mound of pillows the sheets were black like a splash of darkness in all that red some of the smaller pillows would get piled in the rooms two chairs beside the false fireplace thanks to modern technology it could actually make flames but in all the time id been with jeanclaude id never seen anything in the fireplace but an antique fan framed behind glass nathaniel and micah went back and forth like busy ants until the seats were piled high with pillows and there were still plenty left on the bed jeanclaude had come to stand on the other side of the bed from me we stood there staring across the expanse of red and black silk when i say expanse i mean it the bed was larger than a kingsize orgysize is what id started calling it but i hadnt actually shared that with jeanclaude i didnt mean to imply anything about what he was doing when i wasnt here the bed was just the biggest one id ever seen then i realized that wasnt entirely true belles bed was this size i really wished i hadnt thought of that suddenly i was cold what is wrong ma petite he asked i shook my head i didnt want to share the observation as if talking about it would make it more true micah and nathaniel came back to the bed micah stopped and looked from one to the other of us nathaniel started unbuttoning his shirt i think you might want to wait on that micah said still looking from one to the other of us nathaniel kept unbuttoning theyll work it out he slipped the shirt off and went for the large armoire it was dark rich wood that matched the bed nathaniel opened it and started hanging up his shirt the armoire was empty except for our extra clothes nathaniels micahs mine jeanclaude had a room the size of a small warehouse that was full of clothes hed started hanging an outfit at a time in the armoire but he still kept his room as clean and empty as he could hed gotten in the habit when he used to entertain strangers on a regular basis you dont keep things you value in a room where youre going to have onenight stands jeanclaude didnt do onenight feedings and fucks now but old habits die hard vampires id found once they have a habit really dont like giving it up old dogs new tricks that sort of thing nathaniel came back to the bed wearing absolutely nothing i had one of those moments of discomfort id seen him nude more times than i could count id seen him nude in front of micah and jeanclaude more times than i could count so why was i blushing nathaniel climbed into the bed pulling the sheet up just enough to keep me from yelling at him left to his own devices i think nathaniel would have been nude all the time he lay back against the red and black pillows his hair was still in its braid so that his face was framed by all that black and red silk his face had started to fill out bone structure that had only been a promise six months ago was somehow more real more masculine he was moving from the pretty handsomeness that some young men get to the more handsome handsomeness that most of them grow into hed also grown nearly an inch taller in the six months wed been together at twenty he was growing into what some people hit at seventeen or earlier genetics is a wonderful and confusing thing he smiled at me and the smile was all male that pleased smile that said he knew i was looking at him and how much he liked the effect he had on me hed been in my bed for half a year naked in it for about a month and i was still staring at him as if it were the first time it made me blush and look away come to bed anita he said you know you want to the anger was instantaneous i wasnt blushing when i raised my eyes back to him i dont like being taken for granted nathaniel he sighed and sat up putting his muscular arms around his knees dont let the whole baby thing push you back youve made a lot of progress in your comfort zones dont lose ground now and what exactly is that supposed to mean i asked hands on hips glad to be angry anger was so much better than sad or scared or embarrassed his lavender eyes went all serious not scared or worried but grownup serious are you really going to make us do this do what i demanded he sighed and said why is my being nude bothering you i opened my mouth closed it and finally said quietly i dont know that was the truth stupid but the truth micah came to me touched me tentatively i went to him wrapped my arms around him he hugged me close and i turned my face in against his neck so i could smell the warmth of him just the smell of his skin made something hard and cold inside me loosen i breathed in the scent of him and underneath the smell of clean skin and aftershave micah had that nosewrinkling smell an almost sharp smell of leopard the smell of home he spoke against my skin lets go to bed anita i nodded still pressed against him i felt his mouth move in a smile against my skin i knew exactly the feel of it which meant i must make him smile with his mouth pressed to me a lot i guess i did he drew away and started unfastening his collar he had a tie bar to remove i stood there and watched him begin to reveal his tanned upper body but instead of enjoying the show i felt the anxiety creep back i touched micahs arm stopped him in the middle of undoing one of his cufflinks stop for a minute he turned puzzled eyes to me youre nervous again nathaniel said why i shook my head then looked across the bed jeanclaude was still across the bed but he was leaning on one of the big wooden posts his arms entwined around it as he watched us his face was neutral but id been further into his head tonight than ever in one special area shit i said what micah and nathaniel asked together i know whats wrong they both looked at me but it was jeanclaude that i looked at its you i said i have seen your men nude before he said in that pleasant neutral voice weve been in bed all naked and sweaty anita nathaniel said yes but youve never had sex with him i had sex with him jeanclaude has fed off me anita micah said has had more of my blood than yours i looked at micah are you saying having him take blood is the same thing as having sex with him he shrugged and i watched his face shut down to the look he wore when he wasnt certain what look i wanted ive had sex that didnt feel as good as jeanclaudes feedings then you were doing the sex wrong i said he smiled i was young i got better yes you did i said and smiled back he kissed me then moved back and gave me a searching look he moved past me to put the first cufflink on the bedside table he started on the other sleeve his back to me i glanced up and found that i wasnt the only one watching him jeanclaudes neutral beautiful face watched us all we had been naked and sweaty in a bed together hell some nights the pile had included asher and jason it just depended on who had fed whom last so why was i suddenly bothered by jeanclaude watching micah take off his shirt i suddenly had a smart idea i dont have that many of them not about my own emotional life anyway i know whats wrong i said again they all looked at me i touched micahs naked back but looked at jeanclaude it was what we did tonight with augustine jeanclaude sat on the corner of the bed one arm still wrapped around the bedpost what exactly are you referring to ma petite we did many things with augustine tonight i know that everyone thinks were all snogging each others brains out but tonight was the first time id ever seen two men kiss ive never even seen someone doi faltered god was i still such a baby no damn it i was a grownup ive never seen anal sex before let alone between two men let alone between my lover and a stranger i took in a big breath and let it out and went to the edge of the bed a little closer to jeanclaude am i making any sense you were disturbed by what you saw he said wait nathaniel said the wait turned me to him he was propped up on the pillows the sheet forgotten in his lap so that he was barely covered at all but his face showed he wasnt even thinking about it how did you feel when jeanclaude kissed auggie i opened my mouth then closed it because i wasnt sure what the answer was how had i felt i didnt mind it it was interesting that wasnt true i looked down at the bedspread and said no i it was interesting interesting bad or interesting good nathaniel said without looking up i answered good someone sighed and i wasnt sure which of them had done it i looked up slowly and no one was looking at me like id said something awful i dont know why i thought anyone in this room would think it was wrong that i liked seeing jeanclaude kiss another man but i did think it i was waiting for someone to tell me to be ashamed of myself id seen someone i loved kiss another man and not only hadnt i been horrified but id liked it was that wrong i had waited for it to feel wrong but it hadnt it had felt strangely right as if id been waiting my whole life to see it it had felt right in that way that only the things that truly speak to your heart can feel i hadnt felt bad when it was happening i was feeling bad now why was it guilt no i felt uncomfortable and a little squeamish but not guilty so what was it micah touched my arm so many thoughts flying over your face what are you thinking that i dont feel bad and shouldnt i feel bad about it he looked puzzled frowned bad about what shouldnt it bother me that i saw jeanclaude kiss another man a stranger at that did it bother you i shook my head not at the time no he smiled eyes still a little uncertain but its bothering you now why did it bother you to watch us like that he gave me a look ive watched you have sex with other men before anita i suddenly felt thirteen again embarrassed and confused about the whole thing i believe ma petite he is asking how you felt about watching me with augustine i looked at him happy hed helped me but uncomfortable that hed had to help me did it bother you micah asked me i shook my head no it was amazing we did him we owned him it wasmy breath shivered out of me it was a rush power and sex all mixed up together then its okay micah said dont feel bad because you dont feel bad of course that was exactly what i was doing it sounds stupid when you say it out loud he hugged me and i wrapped myself around the warmth of his skin its not stupid anita its how you feel feelings are never stupid they just make us feel stupid sometimes i drew back enough to see his face youre okay with everything we did tonight you dont think were evil or something he chucked me under the chin thats richards voice in your head not mine i nodded he was right on part of it he went to hang up his shirt in the armoire nathaniel reached a hand out to me take off the robe and let me hold you all naked and warm i wanted to in fact i couldnt think of anything better but still i hesitated i took his hand but i didnt touch my robe and i didnt climb on the bed micah came up behind me wrapping his body around me his body pushed against the back of my robe the silk was thin and parts of him were not i turned with a little gasp youre naked he frowned at me yes we always sleep naked i shook my head and said butthen i realized what was wrong id sort of known before today that jeanclaude had had male lovers i mean i knew that he and asher and julianna had been a true menage à trois i shared the memories to prove it but that had been memories and theory it hadnt been fact until tonight i tried to put it into words i knew in theory you liked men as well as women i said and looked at jeanclaude while i said it his face was as empty as id ever seen it as though if i blinked hed vanish but now you know in fact and you think less of me he said in a voice as empty as his face no not less justi tried again in college i had a friend a girlfriend a girl who was a friend she and i went shopping together slept over at each others dorm rooms i undressed in front of her because she was a girl then toward the end of college she told me she was gay we were still friends but she went into that guy category for me you dont undress in front of people who see you as a sex object you dont sleep with them or oh hell i looked up at micah wont it weird you out to sleep nude beside him now micah laughed are you worried about my virtue more now than before i frowned at him i donti pushed him hard enough that he stumbled fuck you i said but i was starting to smile and that usually meant id lost the argument i wasnt even sure it was an argument not to take anything away from the attractiveness of your nimirraj ma petite but i believe i can restrain myself his face held a hint of humor now i looked at nathaniel and he was trying not to grin at me i was perilously close to being laughed at and that was just not cool stop it all of you stop what nathaniel said in a strained voice but his eyes were shiny with suppressed laughter dont you dare laugh at me did you think that because i had tasted my first man in years that i would suddenly be some sort of rampaging beast jeanclaudes neutral face was beginning to crumble around the edges humor was filling his eyes tweaking at the edges of his mouth no i said and it sounded sullen even to me did you expect nathaniel and me to be more shy around jeanclaude because we saw him with augustine micahs mouth was twitching at the edges i glared at them all maybe anita micah said but he had to stop and fight the smile that kept threatening to get away from him he started over anita remember i thought id have to be coming across to jeanclaude when i joined you the entire preternatural community believed that richard and jeanclaude and you were a true menage а trois i considered this before i ever asked to be your nimirraj i frowned at him so it doesnt bother you no im not into men but i dont seem to have the same hangups that you and richard do dont compare me with him i said and was all set to be angry if it was another woman sleeping naked with you youd have the same problems that he does micah said ive slept with some of the female wereleopards before but never nude either you or them micah said i started to deny it then stopped was he right i dont know i i might be able to sleep nude if its just sleep with another woman i dont think id like it though id rather sleep pressed between two men and thats fine he said but if you knew for a fact that a woman saw you as a potential sex partner youd treat her differently yes shed go in the boy box according to your thinking nathaniel and i should put jeanclaude into a different box now right i thought about it then nodded he smiled anita seeing him with auggie wasnt the first clue i had that jeanclaude liked men i looked from one to the other of them have i missed something not what you are thinking ma petite jeanclaude sat more solidly on the corner of the bed his back against the foot of it his knees drawn up for his arms to wrap around i have not seduced either of your cats behind your back i hadnt really thought he had but then what is micah talking about anita nathaniel said pay more attention the next time that jeanclaude feeds off one of us or asher feeds off me you wont have to ask but ive been in the bed while you guys did that what did i miss the three of them exchanged a look no no looks just tell me you said you were tired micah said i think you dont want to know this or you wouldnt have to ask dont want to know what again they exchanged that look stop that i said and i had to fight the urge to stomp my foot at them let us cuddle together ma petite let us hold you and give you the comfort that we all need tonight it has been a long night a good one in many ways but long you are tired i was tired but the rush of anger and confusion had chased back the tiredness i am tired and all i want to do is crawl into bed and let you hold me but damn it youre all looking at each other like theres an elephant in the room and i cant see it claudia spoke from the edge of the room where she and the rest of the bodyguards were so quiet we were close to kicking them out of the room okay i was close to kicking them out i think i can catch this one she said i looked at her go ahead i said jeanclaude feeds from a man the same way he feeds from a woman most vampires differentiate when they feed heterosexual vamps take more liberties with oppositesex victims homosexual vamps take more liberties with samesex vies jeanclaude doesnt differentiate do you understand when have you seen him feed on other women aha claudia said and that is exactly why he doesnt feed on women except at the clubs in public youd be jealous of other women if he took them in private but you arent jealous of men you dont see them as sexually competitive for jeanclaudes attention my head was beginning to hurt youre giving me a headache claudia only because you dont want to think this one through youre saying that jeanclaude likes both men and women but because id be jealous of women he takes mostly men i get it i get it thank you claudia jeanclaude said youre welcome do i apologize to anyone everyone i asked just take off the robe and get in bed nathaniel said silk is cold without another body to warm it up i smiled at him shook my head and started to undo my robe i stopped and said everyone thats not getting in the bed outside if its an invitationgraham started can it graham claudia said and went for the door he hesitated but he followed her lisandro was already going for the door claudia had sent most of the others out when things calmed earlier probably sent them to watch over our guests the bodyguards piled out the door shut and we were alone micah crawled onto the bed on the other side of nathaniel leaving room for me youre looking a little overdressed he said i undid the sash and let the robe fall to the floor i crawled up onto the silk with the help of their hands they pulled me down between them so their naked bodies pressed in against me there was a moment where i had to close my eyes the sensation of their warm bare skin sliding against mine was almost overwhelming it was like wrapping myself in a favorite blanket with my favorite stuffed toy in my arms and my gun close at hand sandwiched between micah and nathaniel was the safest best place id ever known nathaniel kissed me my arms slid around his shoulders automatically he took that as an invitation to press his upper body against mine micahs hand slid across my hip until his hand found the inside of my thigh he stroked his hand back and forth and without thinking about it i moved my leg so he could reach other things if he wanted to my hands slid down nathaniels back found the curve where his waist met lower things traced the two dimples in his very lower back the kiss had grown into something more and his body responded to that promise swelling where he lay trapped against my hip the feel of him hard and firm against me made me shudder into his mouth he drew back enough to watch my eyes fluttering open and shut you are my most favorite toy it was more effort than i would have admitted out loud to focus on his face micahs hand kept stroking my thigh as if he was coaxing me to open my legs for him but id already done that his fingers kept trailing on that last inch before he touched intimate parts i wanted him to touch me wanted his fingers to finish that teasing promise i thought you were tired micah whispered but his mouth was just above my neck so hot so close i was my voice was thick but not with sleep what do you want he breathed against my neck that alone made me shiver touch me i am touching you his fingers trailed just below where i wanted him to touch back and forth back and forth but not the back and forth i wanted please micah no more teasing his fingers slid over me and that first touch drew small sounds from me so eager he said and he rose up enough to see my face his own face was eager too but there was also a soft wonder to his face he raised his hand from between my legs to touch lightly along my face i love that look on your face he said what look i whispered he smiled that look he leaned in for his own kiss nathaniels hand curved over my breast as micahs mouth found mine nathaniels touch made me more eager at micahs mouth so that the kiss was more than it would have been i fed at micahs mouth my hand running over his body i tried to use both hands but nathaniel caught my hand pressed it to the bed so he could lower his mouth to my breast he filled his hand with my breast pressing it until it was just this side of pain his tongue flicked over my nipple micahs tongue slipped inside my mouth tasting me nathaniels mouth slid over more of me and he sucked hard and fast it brought me screaming off the bed screaming my pleasure into micahs mouth i tried to raise my other hand off the bed but nathaniel held it trapped he bit my breast and i raked nails down micahs back nathaniel let go of my other hand and bit me harder not hard enough to draw blood but hard enough to dance that line between pain and pleasure i put a matching row of scratches down his back and they let me go i lay gasping on the bed between them trying to focus my eyes around the white cottony edges of the world micah said that was fun nathaniel said mmmm he flicked his tongue across my nipple quick and gone i writhed across the bed my hands grabbing at the silk sheets oh god a hand caressed my ankle that one quiet touch opened my eyes made me gaze down my body to find jeanclaude kneeling there he was still wearing the robe belted tight his face was neutral pleasant micah invited me to touch you but ive found that it is your invitation i need translation sometimes in the midst of all the men i got pissy if someone touched me without my saying yes first just because one of the men was touching me didnt mean that everyone got to touch me equally a girls got to try to draw a line somewhere you cant have intercourse until youve fed again i said he smiled so american there are other ways to pleasure a woman but you wont be able to his hand slid up my calf the most delicate of touches i will be content ma petite we can stop now micah said if you want this was fun i gazed down his body and saw just how fun he thought it was he was long and thick and ready and long and thick for micah was very long and thick indeed i glanced down at nathaniel and found him just as ready no he wasnt as big as micah but then the only one of the men who could compare was richard though richard didnt seem as aware of it as micah nathaniel was definitely more just not as more as micah not in length anyway but in width well yeah men are hung up on length trust me girls pay attention to width too frankly an inch or two less length wasnt always a bad thing depended on what you wanted to do with it i ran fingertips over both of them and just that light touch made them shudder and me writhe so pretty i said seems a shame to waste them well get more micah said i agree with anita nathaniel said grinning micah smiled at him a bright flash of teeth in his tanned face i will join asher jeanclaude began to slide off the bed dont go i said he looked at me it was a very searching look i do not have the patience of your two cats ma petite they have served blood for asher and myself more than once then watched us have our way with you we had to save them for the ardeur the next day or next night i said oui but i am not the voyeur that asher is and if i am not to join in completely i would as soon leave it is not a complaint merely truth i still think you shouldnt go that far away micah said i dont trust belle jeanclaude smiled wise and correct he spread his hands wide if it were just sex between the three of you i could watch and be content to join the cuddling afterward but it is the emotional content that makes it difficult to be excluded i frowned i dont understand i know that you love me ma petite but my arms do not fill you with that last drop of something i see you with micah and nathaniel and that last drop of emotion or contentment is there he held up a hand as if someone had started to speak it is the truth i do not begrudge it especially with the news we have had tonight you will need that bond but it is he shook his head discomforting to watch and know that i am not a part of it i didnt know what to say to that i mean what do you say to the man you love when hes just told you that he realizes that you love two other men more besides ma petite you have expressed doubts about me now you say you enjoyed our time with augustine but your actions state otherwise i think your cats are what you need tonight ma petite not the memory ofhe gave that gallic shrug and got off the bed he stood there adjusting his robe with smooth nervous gestures when he was nervous and not policing his movements he smoothed his clothes it was one of the few truly human gestures that had survived centuries of being dead i liked that he did it and that he didnt realize he did it because once he noticed it his hands went still as still as his face the little bit of sex id had with micah and nathaniel had helped me clear my head do you think that i think less of you for having seen you with another man i asked you have implied it he said in a voice that was almost neutral i raised myself up on my elbows i guess i did but i dont mean it i think i thought it should bother me but it didnt i tried to talk myself into it bothering me but the truth is i sat up folding my legs tailor fashion the truth is jeanclaude i liked seeing you kiss auggie i dont know how i feel entirely about the rest but it didnt bother me at the time so why should it bother me now i shook my head im not going to talk myself into an issue i dont have he gave a small smile uncertain around the edges was it my reaction that had made him uncertain or was it that id trained him that after a major metaphysical or sexual breakthrough i pulled back and ran i guess either way it was my doing that uncertain smile i didnt want him uncertain i loved him i shouldnt be the one making him insecure not if i loved him sometimes the hardest thing about having so many men in my life wasnt the sex the sex we could handle but the emotional stuff the emotional stuff was harder i couldnt help richard tonight because his issues were things i couldnt really help him with but this issue this i could fix or i could try to i smiled at him and tried to put into that smile everything a man wants to see in a womans smile i watched his eyes fill up with that dark light that has nothing to do with vampires and everything to do with a man his smile matched his eyes confident sure of itself anticipatory what would you have of me ma petite his voice curled over my bare skin like the tickling edge of fingernails it made me shiver youre overdressed i said are you certain you wish to do this ma petite you have never taken three of us before and the ardeur will not rise again tonight it has been too well fed he was offering me an out but if i said no then hed leave the room id already watched asher and richard walk out i did not want to lose another of my men tonight i needed as many around me as i could manage saying it made me almost want to call asher back but id never done the full deal with three of my guys at the same time four would have to wait i said you are overdressed and i made it a very firm statement jeanclaudes smile widened easily remedied he undid the robe and let it fall to the floor he stood there pale and perfect i had seen him nude a thousand times or more but i never got over the shock of him it was as if he were some amazing work of art and i had stolen him away from the museum where they kept him roped off and safe stolen him so i could run my hands over the smooth flawless surface of him youre too far away i whispered he smiled wide enough to flash just a hint of fang that too is easily remedied he crawled up on the bed and i watched his body small and loose more than his face until he fed hed be small which meant i could indulge in something that i didnt get to do much by the time you get most men out of their clothes theyre not as small as they can get no definitely larger i know what you are thinking of ma petite his voice was chiding did you read my mind non ton visage hed said hed read my face i was picking up a little french here and there in selfdefense he hesitated at my feet and i realized he was looking at micah and you nimirraj what do you say to this micah smiled at him im here to try to make things work better not make them worse i dont try to make things worse i said shh micah said dont take it personally i opened my mouth realized i was going to start a squabble if not a fight and i didnt want to fight anymore tonight fine i wont take it personally youre not going to argue about it nathaniel asked i shook my head and lay back against the pillows nope micah and nathaniel exchanged looks what i said they both shook their heads nothing micah said nothing nathaniel said but he was smiling i dont argue about everything of course not micah said i dont i said not anymore nathaniel said i slapped his shoulder he grinned hit me harder if you want it to hurt i didnt hit him again youd enjoy it too much he grinned wider i am no longer the only one who is not ready jeanclaude said i glanced down at the other two men he was right they definitely werent ready to go weve talked too long nathaniel said i waited to be uncomfortable at the thought of three men and just me with no holds barred on the sex i waited but the discomfort didnt come i lay there and waited to feel overwhelmed or uncomfortable but i just wasnt i think i can fix it i said and started to slide lower on the bed turning toward nathaniel as i did it i started kissing my way down his body then thought of something i looked back at jeanclaude where he knelt on the bed you didnt ask nathaniels opinion micah is your nimirraj nathaniel is not but hes still my sweetie its okay anita nathaniel said petting my shoulder thanks for thinking of me but im okay with not being asked i looked up at his face with my face almost to his groin if it seemed an odd time for a indepth talk he didnt complain why are you okay jeanclaude is right im not anyones leader and im okay with that if we were all completely dominant our happy little domestic situation wouldnt work but just because youre not dominant doesnt mean that your opinion doesnt count no he said and gave a little laugh no but it does mean that i dont have as many opinions but you want me to be more dominant he asked id like to know how you feel about this yeah suck my dick so we can fuck he was smiling while he said it i blinked at him for a second or two then shrugged and said okay i did what he wanted and a lot more i used hand and mouth to get both micah and nathaniel back to the smooth hardness that they had been before all the soul searching i didnt want any more soul searching tonight i wanted to touch and be touched sex was the only time i let myself go let all the worries the issues everything wash away when i had sex i just concentrated on the sex it was the only time i was truly in the moment with no hesitation and no other thought i held them both in my hands when id first tried to play with them both at the same time id found that i couldnt do it i couldnt concentrate on both hands equally and when youve got a handful of the most delicate bits on a mans body you want to be able to concentrate but practice makes perfect and i could do it now i could hold each of them in my hand and stroke and play with them id finally found something i was ambidextrous at jeanclaude stayed sitting at the foot of the bed he made no move to join us i looked at him that careful face hed made his position clear he didnt just want to watch id never tried to entertain three of the men at once cuddling blood sharing but not for sex i went to him where he sat so still his back touching the foot of the bed hed gone as far away as he could without leaving the bed had he thought i would make him watch and not touch him the very blankness of his face said yes he had i had a memory not a vision just a memory it just didnt happen to be my memory not originally i saw belle in her big bed so similar to this one she had two other vampires with her i was watching her from the foot of the bed where she had tied me to the posts i could feel the pull in my shoulders where the ropes were a little too high for comfort but she didnt want me comfortable she wanted me punished tied to her bed where she had taught me us what true desire could be bound helpless knowing that i could not touch her and that no one would touch me when wed been far away from her we could resist wanting her but standing there smelling her skin and sweat we couldnt help but want her she was an addiction and the only way to save yourself was to never take another drink another hit another taste of her i fought free of the memory enough to think jeanclaude had been tied to that bed not me too tall to be my body too male not me but the memory still burned still had the power to make his face close down to that carefulness i touched his face and i let my face show how sorry i was that all those awful things had happened to him so sorry that i hadnt been there to save him we were shut down too tight behind our shields for him to read my mind probably just as well but he saw what i meant him to see he came to me with a sigh that was almost a sob he kissed me as if he would breathe me in through his lips and i kissed him as if he were the last drop of water in the world and i were dying of thirst i tasted the sweet metal of blood in my mouth it made him draw back from the kiss i am sorry ma petite i stopped his apology with a kiss feeding at his mouth and he fell into that kiss with his hands on my body his nakedness pressed as tight to mine as it could be the only reason his body did not respond was that it couldnt until he fed i drew back from the kiss my breathing ragged the taste of my own blood in my mouth a drop of blood grew and trembled on my lower lip he kissed that drop away and stared down at me as he knelt in front of me his face was fierce and full of some wonder as if id done something amazing i hadnt id just finally decided to get out of my own way out of everyones way i moved back along the bed with his hand in mine i pulled him along with me on our knees until we reached micah and nathaniels feet one of the things id noticed in dealing with more than one man in bed at a time was there were only two ways to go about it choice one the men took turns completely separate lovemaking except that they both got to watch each other have sex with me choice two they both touched me at the same time and they did foreplay or more with me at the same time choice two was harder to choreograph harder on the egos involved it took more concentration on my part it was just a higher level of skills needed all around and a larger dose of secure masculinity too i realized now after auggie that there was a choice three but i didnt think any of us was up to it tonight i knew i wasnt i had no idea how to even raise the question to micah and nathaniel would they kiss another man i mean when did this sound like a good conversation to have never i think i let go of jeanclaudes hand leaving him kneeling while i lay down between the other two men i traced a hand down their bodies until i touched the smooth heads the skin so soft but the flesh underneath so hard so firm micah made a soft sound as my hand smoothed over the top of him i looked up at nathaniel and found his face intent on me his eyes bright and eager alit with anticipation a gentle caress wouldnt do it for him i had to still my hand on micah to wrap my hand around nathaniel and squeeze hard it fluttered his eyes shut and forced small noises from his mouth id found that i could play with two at once if the pressure was the same for both hands but if one man needed something different i had to concentrate separately micah could rev up to a level that was close to nathaniels preference but it took time to get micah in that headspace nathaniel came out of the box wanting rougher handling than most men ever liked i went back to playing with both of them at the same time running my hand up and down the shaft of them sliding over the head firm but gentle too hard and most men experienced the pressure as discomfort too gentle and it wasnt enough stimulation it had taken me a while to find a happy medium i loved the sensation of my hand running up and down and around all that velvet muscle it made me close my eyes arch my back with the anticipation of it when i could focus again i gazed up at jeanclaude he knelt where id left him close enough to touch us but not touching anyone i want you in my mouth while i play with them he looked at micah and nathaniel does everyone agree to this for i will have to be very close to both of you to be in the position that she requests i tightened my grip on both the men just enough to make their eyes flutter shut non ma petite that is cheating let them go long enough for them to answer without your sopersuasive touch i mumbled sorry i put my hands on my stomach and behaved micah swallowed hard enough for me to hear it then nodded im fine with it nathaniel smiled that lazy catwithcream smile that he got sometimes during sex it usually meant he was going to suggest something that id never done or that wed never done together or he was going to make some observation i just want to see if she can concentrate on all of us at once i give it a difficulty rating of eight i frowned at him are you saying ive never attempted anything that took more skill than an eight before he shrugged remember i did this professionally for a while my ten on this scale is probably stuff that you dont even want to know is physically possible i opened my mouth to ask him like what but decided that he was right i probably didnt want to know lets try i said jeanclaude didnt ask again he simply crawled over my body he ended with his legs over my shoulders so that he was sitting in front of my face which put him exactly where i wanted him i traced my hands across the other two bodies nathaniel turned on his side first and micah followed him that gave me a better angle since my movement was about to become limited i wrapped my hands around them and raised my mouth up to slide over jeanclaudes body he was as small as he got loose and delicate it always amazed me how something so small could become so large nothing on my body could change so much maybe thats why it fascinated me i loved the texture when a man was totally soft until we shared blood i could roll that soft soft flesh around my mouth suck on it all normally i would have tried to draw his testicles into my mouth too but with both my hands busy i didnt dare too delicate a work to risk when i wasnt sure i could concentrate on it all i rolled my hands up and down micah and nathaniels bodies while i sucked on jeanclaude drawing him harder and faster over and over glorying in the fact that i could take all of him in without a struggle like this it was all about sensation i could roll and flick and suck with my mouth and tongue able to do things with his body that i could never have done with him erect jeanclaude cried out his hands clutching at the dark wood of the headboard he looked down at me and i rolled my eyes upward to catch that frantic look that look that said the sensations were almost too much i found a rhythm for all of them but it was the rhythm of the sucking quick fast as fast as i could do it over and over and over i ran my hands over nathaniel and micah in that same frantic rhythm pulling firm and quick over and over and over micahs hand grabbed mine stop or im going to go he squeezed my hand as if id made some move to keep going please anita please i looked up at jeanclaude his eyes were closed his shoulders hunched his body shuddering above me i realized that though he was enjoying it it was treading that line between feels better than anything else and too much he probably wouldnt have said anything hed have let me do it as long as i wanted but then hed been trained by someone who was a much harsher mistress than i would ever be i drew back from his body he half collapsed above me his body spasming he rolled to the side and micah gave him room jeanclaude lay on his back spine bowing hands clutching at the black sheets i was left with only nathaniel in my hand i looked at his face eager happy he leaned in toward me you win he moved in for a kiss but i squeezed him hard and tight it threw his head back closed his eyes spasmed his body no one else in the bed would have wanted me to squeeze that tight but he loved it what do i win i asked i let him go he gazed down at me with eyes that didnt quite focus everything he kissed me it started as a slow kiss but then he was just suddenly kissing me as deep and hard as he could id forgotten that jeanclaude had bled me earlier i knew that part of what made him so eager at my mouth was the taste of my blood he kissed me as if he would crawl into my mouth his tongue searching for every last drop of that precious fluid his body pressed on top of mine he was so hard so firm the feel of him trapped between our bodies made me make small sounds into his mouth as he kissed me he drew back from the kiss what do you want he asked you inside me i said he gave me a fierce smile and raised himself up off my body i grabbed at his waist and shoulders what are you doing you said inside you didnt say where inside he crawled over me his body not touching me and i knew where he was going is this more foreplay or do you want to finish here finish he said without the ardeur i dont like to swallow i know he said and straddled my chest leaning forward using the headboard much as jeanclaude had i stared up the line of his body his face so eager so sure of itself id worked a long time to have him look like that during sex he knew with me he could ask for what he wanted that his pleasure was as important to me as my own i cupped my hand under his balls they were already tight and close to his body the caress brought his breath in a long sigh i kept one hand on his balls and spilled the other hand up and over the length of him he smiled down at me what do you want micah to do while im busy here wed only very recently begun having sex at the exact same time nathaniel micah and me id thought it had been my idea initially but now it seemed like nathaniel initiated it more i knew what he wanted me to say and truthfully dawn was going to come and i had one other man in the bed whatever we were going to do we needed to be doing it i kept playing lightly with nathaniel and called micah he crawled until i could see him he just looked at me with those chartreuse eyes his face made no demands but his body spoke for him so hard so eager you inside me weve never done this without the ardeur he said i know i said he gave me a look then he smiled and crawled back down along the bed suck me while he does it it was more a command than a request but id worked long and hard to have nathaniel that commanding anywhere in his life hard to bitch about it now besides he was so temptingly close so hard so ready i had to mound the pillows up a little higher to get the angle we needed micahs hands slid over my hips i licked the tip of nathaniel slid my mouth over him took him inch by inch into my mouth slow so slow so we could both enjoy the sensation of it i went down about halfway then back up we needed him wetter so hed slide better but theres something about putting that much of a man that far inside your mouth that makes you wet both above and below micahs hands spread my legs his finger plunged inside me it made me cry out and shove all of nathaniel inside my mouth at once he put his hand on the back of my head held me against him so that i was trapped and had a moment of choking around him it wasnt a gag reflex it was a suffocation reflex he let me go and i fell back from his body gasping for breath choking when i could talk i said dont do that again micah said are you okay i nodded wasnt sure he could see it and said yeah you do it with the ardeur nathaniel said were doing it without tonight i think the look i gave him was not entirely friendly im sorry but im used to being able to do that twice weve done that twice twice is not a pattern im sorry he said and that look came back to his face that uncertain lost look he started to move and i grabbed his hips to keep him from moving he looked down at me his face so fragile so hurt as if all the new bravado were only skin deep scratch it and it goes away i did the only thing i could think of to chase that look from his face i drew him back into my mouth sucked him fast and hard until his head went back and his eyes closed when he looked at me again he was smiling but there was still a flinching around his eyes a shadow of that hurt there was only one thing that would take that hurt from his eyes i had to prove i trusted him i slipped my mouth over him again and gave myself over to the pleasure of him filling my mouth i let my face show just how much i enjoyed the sensation of all that velvet muscle inside my mouth the sensation of it wet and slick from my own saliva but i didnt stop at the comfort point that point where it just feels good and full i sucked past that point where my body told me too much i sucked until my mouth met his body and there was no inch to spare i sucked until he was shoved as hard and deep inside my throat as i could manage i sucked until my body stopped complaining about needing to gag and started to complain about needing to breathe but id learned to be able to fight past that too i stayed there pressed tight and solid against his body until he looked down at me stayed until my throat convulsed spasming around the length of him he stared down at me his eyes wild eager and something more his hands stayed in a death grip on the headboard as if he didnt quite trust himself i drew back from him coughing before i could get a good breath i finally let myself swallow all that extra saliva and lay back panting as if i were behind on my breaths and had to catch up his body shivered above me a shiver of pleasure that went all the way up his body to throw his head back close his eyes bow his spine as if the memory alone were that intense and for nathaniel it might have been he finally looked down at me eyes slightly unfocused he smiled and said thank you and the look on his face held something much more precious to me than passion it held soft gratitude wonder love for lack of a better word there were men who loved me who never wore a look like that maybe it was his youth or his years of therapy or his lack of hangups what nathaniel felt he felt down to his toes no hiding no holding back not once he gave himself to someone it had been one of the things that made him such a danger to himself with the wrong person with the right person he was magnificent in his abandon he put the rest of us to shame with our wariness our unease our holding back he was the only one of us who simply gave i gazed up into that face and was happier than i knew how to say that he was in my life i felt the bed adjust a moment before fingers slipped inside me two searching slender fingers those fingers found that certain spot and began to flick back and forth back and forth fast and faster until the feeling threw my head back and tore a scream from me there were other men who could do that to me but no one else was that quick at it i knew who it was before i looked past nathaniels body to see jeanclaude kneeling between my thighs his eyes had bled to solid blue light nathaniel moved off me and i had a moment to try to focus and find micah before jeanclaude slipped his fingers back inside me and brought me again screaming tearing at the sheets grabbing for the headboard grabbing for anything to hold on to i found a hand and grabbed it nails digging into the wrist as i writhed when i could see again i found it was micah he stared down at me with such a look on his face he spoke staring down at me wait jeanclaude wait until im in place i blinked up at him in place where my voice sounded as thick and unfocused as i felt he squeezed my hand tight and said i want you to scream your orgasm with me in your mouth i said okay then thought enough to say cant deepthroat you from this angle he put his other hand against my cheek and turned my face to the side toward his body how about now the way he asked made me smile and staring at the front of his body so thick so ready stole the smile and made me whisper lets try thats our girl he said he put my hand on the headboard wrapping my fingers around it he did that when the body part closest to me wasnt somewhere he wanted nail marks nathaniel came in from the other side he took my free hand and put it against his hip one telling me clearly dont mark me there the other one saying please do it micah turned my face back to him nathaniel put my hand higher up his chest so i could get a running start on his skin he wouldnt be working at guilty pleasures this weekend so i didnt have to worry about marking him micah slipped inside my mouth he pushed slowly easing his way in but he already tasted salty bitter and sweet all at once hed been enjoying the show that taste meant he wouldnt last as long as he might have not a bad thing in oral sex with someone his size intercourse you want to last as long as possible orally duration is not always an asset two very different skill sets i moved forward to meet his careful thrust and it was as if id given him permission he began to thrust into my mouth hitting the back of my throat with every thrust pulling out just before i would have to call uncle i had a death grip on the headboard and my hand was mostly just steadying myself against nathaniels side not digging in i was concentrating too hard on doing micah to think about doing myself now micah said and it took me a second to understand who he was talking to jeanclaudes fingers slid inside me and he found that sweet spot found it like he knew exactly where it was he brought me with quick sure flexing of his fingers quick quicker quickest i screamed around micahs body screamed and thrust my mouth harder and deeper onto him i rode his body as i rode the orgasm so that he suddenly didnt seem too big too wide but just right i screamed and thrashed and drove my nails into nathaniels hip as if i were trying to dig my way through him i screamed screamed and screamed screamed my pleasure but it was a sound that would have been pain for most people it wasnt pain it was release i gave myself over to that moment completely and utterly jeanclaudes hand inside me micahs body in my mouth nathaniels flesh under my nails i let go of the headboard and had just enough of me left to mark higher up on micahs back while my other hand just kept digging at nathaniels hip and ass i heard voices and knew vaguely that they werent us i heard jeanclaude say get out but i was too far gone to look or care he shoved more of his hand inside me in one quick motion and that brought me too hed worked me until my body would give orgasms like a gift so wet so excited so thick so tight swollen with pleasure micahs body was beginning to lose its rhythm he tasted close the apex of his thrust climbed down my throat and back out my own saliva poured down my mouth because there was no time to swallow jeanclaude leaned over me with his fingers still inside but his mouth licked between my legs while his fingers kept going in and out of me he couldnt do the deep sucking that the others could fangs got in the way but i didnt need deep hed worked me to the point where quick flicks of his tongue back and forth back and forth started to bring me that warmth building up up inside me as if the center of my body were a cup filling up drop by drop with pleasure until with one last lick the cup spilled and i screamed around micahs body he thrust one last time so deep that i choked and i knew in that moment that hed been careful and now he wasnt now he finally did make me take those last two inches i finally touched his body for longer than a second i started to pull away his hand went to the back of my head as if hed hold me in place but he moved and let me draw back and drew himself out i watched micah fight for control jeanclaude moved inches to the side so his mouth nestled in the very upper very inside of my thigh jeanclaudes fangs plunged into me and i was to that point where pain was pleasure and the feel of him piercing my skin his mouth sucking on me brought me up off the bed throwing my upper body upward screaming my body brushed against the front of micahs body and it was that little bit too much my body came back to rest on the bed and micah spilled himself across my breasts hot so hot the liquid thick and heavy running between my breasts down the side of my body pooling trickling down my stomach the sensation of it made me cry out jeanclaude raised his mouth off me his mouth was smeared with my blood and his body was hard and ready full of my blood so he could pleasure my body and his he usually started out slow for intercourse but tonight he like micah had done his slow he was suddenly above me held up on his arms like a pushup but his lower body didnt stay up he thrust into me as hard and fast as id ever felt him and i could watch every thrust as he moved in and out of me three strokes five and he brought me i thrust my hips up to meet his writhing under him he brought me twice more before i felt him begin to lose the rhythm of it and with one last thrust he spilled himself inside me he stayed above me holding himself on shaking arms while he gazed down at me lips open fighting for breath he normally collapsed on top of me afterward but my chest was covered in micahs juice it was already growing thinner beginning to trickle down my sides like icing melting in the heat he stayed above me panting and smiling his mouth still smeared with my blood he bent down carefully keeping his upper body and hair out of everything but he kissed me kissed me with my blood like sweet copper in his mouth he pulled out and left me blinking dazed with it all he had barely moved out of the way and nathaniel was there above me i couldnt remember when hed moved from the head of the bed id lost track i stared down the line of his body poised above me and i thought didnt i promise to start using condoms but the worst had happened i was already pregnant it didnt matter anymore jeanclaude had caught me by surprise but i let nathaniel plunge himself inside me naked his flesh inside mine with nothing between us he found that rhythm that he did sometimes like a shuddering wave down his body like he was dancing inside me and with each shuddering wave he thrust into me thrust into me right over that spot jeanclaude had given himself over to the sex but nathaniel was doing his usual careful job of it as if even after all the foreplay he was going to give me my moneys worth his emotions were raw but his intercourse was controlled he wouldnt come until i did he just wouldnt hed made a game of making me come over and over until i begged him to it wasnt going to take long tonight it didnt i felt that weight begin to build between my legs slow and steady but faster than normal because of all that had gone before close i whispered close my hips began to rise up and down with his movements so we danced for each other my hips thrusting upward as his thrust down so that we met again and again the orgasm caught me and there was no more dancing for me there was just screaming and nails along his sides me writhing but no rhythm no control i came to myself panting doublevisioned and found his body back in the same rhythm he kept going in and out of me as if he could do it all night he damn near could he brought me again and this time i wound my upper body around him pressed our chests together dug claws into his back he pressed his upper body against me putting his upper chest against my mouth while his body kept pumping away i knew what he wanted and i gave it to him i bit him bit him until i tasted blood i held his upper body against mine so that he wouldnt jerk away and cause me to hurt him more than i planned my mouth filled with blood and his rhythm faltered pleasure he could fight off all night but pain pain would bring him faster but he brought me again first and i tore my mouth away from his body so i didnt bite him too much i turned my face to the side and screamed i wrapped my legs around his body locked my heels at the top of his ass and pinned him to me so he couldnt get the rhythm he wanted he raised himself up on hands and knees with me clinging to the front of his body he crawled us both to the head of the bed and used one hand on my ass and the other on the headboard to lift me up and put my back against the headboard his voice came in a strangled whisper i want to move more and he did he moved in and out of me over and over and over while i clung to him with my arms and legs he brought me again and again and finally one more time and then he asked please please some nights he liked to beg before i said yes but tonight i didnt think either of us could stand much more i whispered it against the sweet smell of his neck yes go go go inside me god go please he stopped trying for rhythm and thrust inside me as hard and fast as he could he brought me again i dug my nails into his shoulders and back and he finally thrust up inside me thrust as far and hard as he could he stayed there like that for a heartbeat forever then he slumped lower on his knees while i still clung to him our bodies were slick with sweat and blood and other things he clung with his hands to the headboard his heart beating so fast i could see it god that was good he said voice breathless and not quite like his voice at all yet i tried to say yes and couldnt do it it was as if i couldnt figure out how to form words and i still couldnt make my eyes work the world was still a whiteedged blur like something wrapped in cotton anita micah said are you all right i managed to give him a thumbsup because it was the best i could do it wasnt the first time that micah and nathaniel had fucked me wordless damn micah said i thought with three of us we might finally fuck you unconscious his voice was teasing it took me three tries to say in a very hoarse voice you need more men micah leaned in close kissed my cheek i think we can arrange that i managed to whisper not tonight he kissed my cheek again not tonight he turned to nathaniel you need help nathaniel nodded wordlessly micah and jeanclaude helped peel us apart then they went into the bathroom to clean up nathaniel and i still couldnt move enough to leave the bed we lay side by side touching but not in each others arms our bodies werent working well enough for that yet god anita i love you he said voice still breathy i love you too nathaniel i said and i did i thought that micah might protest when jeanclaude got into bed as naked as everyone else but he didnt if it had been another girl cuddling up against my naked behind i might have protested but micah was a lot less trouble than i was to deal with i guess someone had to be less trouble i fell asleep like i did most nights with my stomach cuddled against the back of nathaniels nude body the warm curve of his ass tucked up tight against my stomach one arm up so i could touch his hair the other around his waist or maybe a little lower micah cuddled in behind me mirroring me almost exactly except that his arm didnt curve in around my body but stretched across so that he was touching a little of nathaniel jeanclaude cuddled in against micah as if hed done it before putting his arm across micah so that he could touch me his hand curved around me and i raised the arm around nathaniels waist so i could touch jeanclaudes arm dawn was close and that warm living arm wouldnt be warm or living for long vampires lost heat faster than a dead human i wasnt sure why but they did i enjoyed the warm curve of him while i could nathaniel snuggled closer to me as if hed pressed his ass through me into micah but i didnt mind i liked it close besides i knew he was missing me holding him tight my fingers played on the small hairs on jeanclaudes arm back and forth tracing his skin the feel of him like that made me regret for an instant that it wasnt my body he was pressed up against i fell asleep in a nest of warm bodies and silk sheets id had worse nights i came instantly awake in the pitch black my heart in my throat i didnt know what had woken me but it was something bad i lay there pressed between micah and nathaniel looking around the room in the dim light from the halfopen bathroom door it was the light jeanclaude left on for us when we slept over the room looked empty so why was my pulse in my mouth bad dream maybe i lay there pressed between the men straining to hear something but there was nothing but their quiet breathing jeanclaudes arm was across micahs body but it was no longer warm dawn had come and gone and taken him from me again then i saw a shadow a shadow sitting on the foot of the bed when i looked directly at it it wasnt there but out of the corner of my eye i could see it a blackness that began to take on a shape until there was a dark outline of a woman sitting at the foot of the bed what the hell i shook micahs arm trying to wake him but it didnt work i tried nathaniel and the same thing happened nothing their breathing never changed what was happening i couldnt wake them was i dreaming and didnt know it i drew breath to scream if it was a dream it wouldnt matter if it wasnt a dream then claudia and the guards would come but the moment i drew a sharp breath the voice floated through my mind do not scream necromancer the breath left me as if someone had pushed on my stomach i finally managed a whisper who are you good this guise does not frighten you i was hoping it would not whothen i smelled it night night out of doors night some place warm and soft with the scent of jasmine on the air i knew who it was marmee noir was the least rude of the nicknames the vampires called her she was the mother of all darkness she was the first vampire and the ruler of their council though shed been in hibernation or a coma for more than a thousand years the last time id seen her in a dream shed been as big as the ocean as black as the space between the stars shed scared the shit out of me the shadow smiled or at least thats what it felt like good i struggled to sit up and the men slept on not even moving in their sleep was this a dream or was it real if it was real we were in deep deep shit if it was a dream then id had powerful vamps invade my dreams before i put my back against the wood of the headboard it felt real and solid but i didnt like sitting there naked in front of her i wished i had a gown and the thought was enough i was suddenly wearing a white silk gown dream because id been able to change it dream it would be okay it was just a dream the knot in my gut didnt believe me but the rest of me tried to believe i thought of several questions to ask that shadow and finally settled for why are you here you interest me it was like having the devil suddenly take a personal notice of you not good ill try to be less interesting i am almost awake i was suddenly cold down to my toes i can taste your fear necromancer i swallowed hard and couldnt keep my voice from being breathy why are you here marmee noir i need something to wake me after such a long sleep what you perhaps i frowned at her i dont understand the shadow began to grow more solid until she was a small female figure in a black cloak i could almost see her face almost and i knew i did not want to to see the face of darkness was to die jeanclaude has still not made you his still not crossed that last line with you until he does another more powerful than he can take what is his and finish it i am bound to a vampire i said yes you have a vampire servant but that does not close the other door she was suddenly sitting at my feet i tucked my feet up and pushed myself against the headboard it was a dream just a dream she couldnt really hurt me but i didnt believe it she spread a hand wide and the hand was carved of darkness i thought this guise would make me less frightening but you cringe from me i am wasting a great deal of energy to speak to you in dream rather than invade your mind further yet still you fear me she sighed and the sound of it flittered through the room perhaps i have lost the knack of being human even to pretend perhaps if i have lost the knack i should stop trying what do you think necromancer should i show you my true form is this a trick question i asked i felt her frown rather than saw it because i couldnt see her face yet i mean is there a good answer here i dont think seeing your true form would be a good thing but i dont really want you to keep playing humanish for me either then what do you want i wanted jeanclaude awake to help me answer this question out loud i said i dont know how to answer that question of course you do humans always want something you to go away i felt her smile this is not working is it i dont know what was supposed to work i said i was hugging my knees now because i did not want her touching me not even in dream she stood in the middle of the bed then i realized that wasnt exactly it she stood but then she kept growing stretching up and up like some black flame the light reflected off whatever she was becoming as off water or sparkling rock how could something gleam and give no light how could something both reflect light and absorb it if you are afraid of me anyway then why pretend her voice echoed through the room like a rush of wind i could smell rain on the edge of that wind let there be truth between us necromancer she vanished no she became the dark she became the darkness in the room one minute she was a central point almost a body the next she was the darkness she hung in the dark of the room and that darkness had weight and knowledge i was like every other human who had ever huddled around the fire because they could feel the darkness pressing around them feel the darkness waiting for them she didnt try to talk to me now she simply was not words not even images but something i had no words for she simply was a summer night does not talk to you but it exists the dark of a moonless night does not think but it is still alive with a thousand eyes a thousand sounds she was that night with one addition she could think you dont want the dark to be able to think because it wont think anything you want to know i screamed but the darkness filled my throat cut off my air i was choking on the scent of night drowning in jasmine and rain i tried to call my necromancy but it wouldnt come the darkness in my throat laughed at me like the cold twinkling of stars beautiful and deadly i tried for my link to jeanclaude but she had severed it i tried for my link to nathaniel and micah but her animal to call was all cats both great and small my leopards could not help me now the darkness whispered them to sleep i remembered the last time shed been this close to me metaphysically and thought of the only thing she hadnt been able to control i thought of wolf it had taken richards tie to me and jasons closeness to waken my wolf in me and chase the darkness back but wed grown closer now my wolf and i and it came a huge pale wolf with markings of darkness leapt out of the darkness its eyes filled with brown fire it put itself between me and the dark it let me wrap my fingers in its fur and the moment i touched it i could breathe again the scent of night was there but it wasnt in me the darkness swelled around me like some great dark ocean building up up to crash upon the shore the wolf tensed against me so real against my body i could feel its bones its muscle under the fur pressed tight against me i could smell its fear but knew it would not leave me alone it would stay and defend me because if i died so did it it wasnt richards wolf it was mine not his beast but mine that black ocean reared above us so that the bed was like some tiny raft then it fell toward us with a sound like a thousand screams i knew those screams victims eons of victims the wolf sprang to meet that blackness and i felt teeth sink into flesh i felt us bite her i had an instant to see the room where her real body lay all those thousands of miles away i saw her body jerk saw her chest rise in a sharp breath her breath sighed through the room necromancer the dream shattered and i woke screaming jeanclaudes bedroom was bright with lights micah was on his knees looking down at me petting my shoulder anita thank god we couldnt wake you i had time to see nathaniel on the other side of the bed and jeanclaude standing beside him id been out of it long enough for jeanclaude to die and come alive again hours lost to the dark claudia graham and others were in the room it must have been hours the shift should have changed i had time to see and think all that then the wolf from my dream tried to climb out my body it was as though my skin were a glove and the wolf were the hand it filled me impossibly long i could feel its legs stretching out and out into my arms and legs but its limbs and mine werent the same shape it didnt fit the wolf tried to make me fit my fingers curved tried to form paws and when that didnt work it tried for claws to come out of the human fingers i screamed holding my hands up trying to get breath to explain then i didnt have to because my body started to try to tear itself apart it was as if every bone and muscle were trying to tear itself free from every other piece of me the pain of it was indescribable parts of my body that were never meant to move were moving now it was like the meatandbone of my body was trying to move out of the way so something else could take its place micah pinned my arm and shoulder nathaniel had my other arm jeanclaude pinned one leg and claudia had the other they were yelling shes shifting shell lose the baby claudia yelled help hold her damn it graham put his weight across my waist i dont want to hurt her i heard something in my shoulder pop a wet sound that you never want to hear from your own body i shrieked but my body didnt care it wanted to tear itself apart it wanted to remake itself the wolf was there just under my skin i felt it pushing pushing trying to get out other bodies threw themselves on the pile and gradually the sheer weight of them held me but still the muscles and tendons kept writhing another convulsion shook my body forced some of them to shift their grips an arm came close to my face and i smelled wolf that sweet musky smell quieted my body my wolf sniffed at that pale skin and thought not quite in words or in images but somewhere in between pack home safe the arm moved away and took that calming smell with it the wolf tried to leap after that scent tried to follow it but the other smells held me down leopard rat and something not furred not warm nothing that would help us the wolf clawed at my throat like it was an opening to be dug at enlarged so it could crawl out the wolf couldnt get out couldnt get out trapped trapped i tried to scream but a scream wasnt what broke out of my throat a low mournful howl spilled out instead the sound cut through the frantic voices around me froze the pressing hands it echoed up and up dying in the sudden silence then as the last quavering echo faded another voice rose high and sweet a third voice joined deeper so that for an instant their voices entwined in glorious harmony then one voice fell octaves lower breaking the harmony but the discord had a kind of harmony of its own i answered them and for a moment our voices filled the air with quavering music the bodies pressing against me slid away the smell of wolf pressed close a hand touched my face and i turned in against that hand pressed it to my face breathed in the scent of wolf there were other scents on that hand a scented map of everything he had touched that day but under it all was wolf i tried to raise both hands to press his skin against mine but only one of my hands would rise something was broken in my left shoulder something that wouldnt let me use that hand fear flared through me and i whimpered and that warm skin pressed closer to me id never realized that you could cuddle a scent around yourself as if it were an arm but i hugged that scent around me smelling it so intently that it spread around me like someone taking me into their arms i kept his hand pressed over my nose and mouth but rolled my eyes up along his arm until i found the black shirt and finally clays face his eyes were wolf eyes and my wolf knew that i had done that i had called to his wolf and it had answered the bed moved beside us i pulled my face away from clays skin so i could sniff the air as i turned to look i saw graham but his scent meant more than what my eyes told me he smelled so warm so good i reached my good hand for him because if i could touch him id carry some of that good warm smell with me my hand touched his chest and only when my hand touched bare skin did i realize he was nude it was like the hierarchy of reporting from my senses was backward smell touch sight primates didnt reason that way but canids did vaguely i remembered seeing grahams smooth muscled body but he smelled safe and right clothes didnt matter to safe and right but my hand on the warm bare hardness of his chest startled me as if i hadnt expected it i wasnt thinking straight i stiffened my arm pushing against his chest as he tried to get closer to me now that i was seeing him and not just looking at him i could see that he wasnt unhappy to be nude in front of me that pissed me off i ached my muscles burning hurt in places that i shouldnt even be able to feel and he was excited about getting our nude bodies up close and personal damn him i found i still had a human voice no my voice was hoarse and abused but it was still clear no claudia appeared near the head of the bed i told him to get undressed anita you need as much skintoskin contact as you can get i tried to shake my head found it hurt so just said no she knelt beside the bed pleading at me with her eyes it was a look id never seen from her anita theyre all the wolves we have right now please dont make this harder i swallowed and it hurt as if id damaged things in my throat that wouldnt heal for a while no jeanclaude came to stand beside her kneeling figure please ma petite do not be stubborn not now i frowned at him what was i missing what was i not understanding something something important by the looks on their faces but i just didnt want graham to put his naked erect body up against my naked body i did not want to have sex with him and once we were naked and in bed the odds of that went up sure i was hurt and id supposedly fed the ardeur really well but call me paranoid i just didnt want to risk it but for my last shreds of moral dignity graham could have been in the running for daddytobe that more than anything else kept my arm straight and my lips saying no claudia said you dont understand its not over what isnt over i managed to say it in that deep notme voice and then i knew the wolf had thought it was getting out getting help that the pack would help it escape free it from this prison but id kept the feel of other wolves at bay id refused to let them slide wolf scent and skin over my body so the wolf went back to trying to get out and join them my arm didnt stay stiff nothing on me did i writhed on the bed like a bag of snakes muscles and tendons moving in ways that should have ripped me apart my skin should have split and i almost wanted it to i wanted the wolf to get out of me to just stop hurting me id thought the wolf was me now i thought it was trying to kill me the smell of wolf was everywhere thick and nosewrinkling sweet musk my body lay still on the bed while tears leaked down my face and i whimpered not wolf sounds but small hurt human ones i thought id hurt before but id been wrong if you could force someone to feel this forever theyd tell you anything do anything to make it stop i was lying between graham and clay their naked bodies were pressed as close as they could get without putting any of their weight on top of me as if they knew that that would hurt they cradled me gently between them their hands on my head and on my good shoulder they touched me as if id break and it felt like they were right grahams eyes had bled back to brown the look on his face was worried what had they seen that i hadnt what was happening to me clay leaned over pressed his lips against my cheek and kissed me gently he whispered change anita just let it happen it wont hurt like this if you just let it happen he raised his face up and i saw that he was crying i heard the soft click as the door opened i wanted to turn and look but it had hurt the last time i did it it didnt seem worth it besides grahams chest was blocking my view in that direction how dare you order me into your presence richards voice already angry i tried to make it a request jeanclaude said but you did not respond so you order me like im your dog ma petite needs your aid and jeanclaudes voice held that first hint of anger as if he was as tired of richards moods as i was from what i can see richard said it looks like anita has plenty of help clay sat up enough to show a tearstained face help her ulfric we are not strong enough if you want tips for satisfying her in bed ask micah im really not that into sharing are you ulfric to her lupa or not micah came to stand at the foot of the bed still nude just like wed woken up thats wolf business kittycat not yours stop it clay yelled stop being an asshole richard and be our leader anita is hurt richard finally came to the edge of the bed to peer over grahams reclining body his hair was sleep tousled a thick browngold mass around his arrogantly handsome face the arrogance slipped and the guilt id begun to dread almost as much replaced it anitahe made a painful sound of my name so much pain in that one word he crawled onto the bed and showed that he was still wearing shorts hed either taken the time to dress or slept clothed very unlycanthrope the other men made room for him but they didnt leave the bed he started to crawl over me but the first touch tore small pain noises from me he went up on his hands and knees above me keeping his weight off me but my wolf was too close to the surface richard putting himself above us like that meant he thought he was superior to us and my wolf didnt think hed earned that neither did i i felt the wolf crouch to spring felt it gather itself as if it could spring from my body to richards i had a moment to realize that it could do just that id felt richards beast and one of mine fight once it had hurt i was already hurt i did not want to do this move richard my voice was an abused whisper its all right anita im here i put my good arm against his chest and pushed move now youre in a dominant position over her graham said i dont think she likes it richard looked at him while his body stayed over mine shes not a wolf graham she doesnt think like that a low growl trickled out of my throat i didnt mean for it to richard turned his head slowly the way you do in horror movies when you finally look behind you he stared down at me his hair like a thick frame around the soft astonishment of his eyes anitahe said but my name was a question this time as if he wasnt sure that soft deep roll of growl vibrated across my lips again i whispered in a voice deeper than any id ever had move please ulfric clay said please move richard went back on his knees still straddling me but in a position that a wolf couldnt exactly duplicate it should have been enough but my wolf had found another way out a hole that it could climb through always before when id shared my beast with other lycanthropes id only felt fur and bone as if some great beast were walking around inside me but this time i saw it i saw the wolf as id seen it in the dream it wasnt truly white but the color of cream with dark markings like a saddle across its back and head that dark cape was every shade of gray and black intermingled and even the white and cream wasnt truly white or cream but mixed like milk and buttermilk i stroked my hand across that fur and it was real i jerked so hard it hurt made me cry out but i could still feel the memory of fur under my good hand as if id touched something solid she smells real graham said richard had gone very still where he knelt over me yes he said in a faraway voice she does bring her wolf clay said voice soft make her change so shell stop hurting herself shell lose the baby richard said but he was staring down at me with a look on his face that i couldnt read or maybe didnt want to shes going to lose the baby anyway claudia said he looked down at me and his eyes were lost i can see the wolf inside you anita just behind my eyes i can see it we can smell it what do you want me to do do you want me to bring your beast his voice sounded empty as if he were already in mourning he didnt want to do it that much was clear but for once we agreed no i said dont he didnt slump but a tension went out of him you heard her i wont do it against her will say that after youve seen the convulsions ive never seen anyone fight like this not for this long claudia said once someones this far along they shouldnt be able to fight the change even her eyes are still human richard gazed down at me face solemn thats our girl but he didnt sound happy when he said it he let down his shields not all the way but as if he blinked metaphysically i got a glimpse at his emotions his thoughts just a glimpse if i shifted for real he wouldnt want me he valued my humanity because he felt like he had none if i shifted i would cease to be anita to him he still didnt understand that being a werewolf didnt stop you being a human being but underneath those thoughts were others though thoughts might be the wrong word his beast was in there his wolf and it wanted me to change it wanted me to be wolf because then i would belong to it cant be lupa and nimirra if youre actually wolf for real the thought made me look across the bed until i found micah i saw it in his eyes the loss as if he were already certain of it no way i would not lose him not now i turned to look around the room for my other leopard turned too fast hurt the muscles in my left shoulder muscles id torn nathaniel came to the side of the bed as if he understood that i was looking for him there were tears drying on his face as if hed cried and hadnt bothered to wipe them away you could date outside your species i knew that but i remembered richard saying once that dominants dont if you were high enough up in the power hierarchy you didnt date outside the pack i was lupa there was no higherranking female than me i was bolverk which would have made me like an officer anyway either way you cut it if the wolf i could touch came out for real then id lose more than a surprise pregnancy i knew i had at least one more beast inside me i held leopard the way i held wolf if i was finally going to go all the way furry could i choose what kind of furry looking into nathaniels face watching micah look away so i wouldnt read his face i knew i had to try i gazed up at richard i said it out loud you dont want me to change thats why you wont help you dont want to be one of us not for real his face was sliding back to that arrogant angry mask youre right his anger showed almost a pleased anger as if that one statement proved that i was no better than he was no more comfortable in furry skin i looked at micah and nathaniel micah had moved so that he could hug nathaniel micah nathaniel help me call leopard micah looked startled its not a choice anita i can smell what you are i started to shake my head but whatever id done to my left shoulder made it hurt too much i hold four different strains why cant i pick which way i go graham and clay looked at richard as if wondering what hed say i think youre out of choices he said but if you want to try i wont stop you he was hurt and his trying to hide it made it more painful to see if i changed hed look elsewhere i didnt think hed find someone willing to share him with what amounted to a permanent mistress furry or not but hey it wasnt my life it was his life i could see the wolf in my head like a waking dream all subtle cream and white and black and gray it looked at me with eyes that were an amber so dark they were almost brown it was like looking into a piece of your soul and having it look back richard slid off the bed the wolf didnt panic it stood there in me patient waiting graham started to follow sliding off the wolf paced closer to the surface again agitated i grabbed his arm stay he froze under my touch half kneeling beside the bed clay looked from me to richard stay until she says go richard said in a voice that managed to be closed empty and angry all at the same time micah nathaniel help me raise our beast they didnt argue or hesitate they simply crawled up on the bed they crawled toward me in that graceful way that the lycanthropes had as if they had muscles that we mere mortals didnt have as if they could have balanced a cup on their backs hurt as i was watching them crawl toward me nude quickened my breathing sped my pulse it made the wolf start to pace in tight agitated circles i didnt have a hand to touch clay clay touch me he closed the small distance hed made for richard to straddle me he pressed his body against the line of mine but was careful not to touch my left shoulder he was a quick study and he seldom argued it was sort of refreshing micah touched my legs but nathaniel crawled around clay so he could be by my head micah asked what do you need us to do id never tried to call one animal instead of another wed only learned about a month ago that i held three different kinds of lycanthropy wolf and leopard hadnt been all that unexpected but lion that had caught me off guard such a delicate injury so little blood but sometimes a nick is enough with bloodborne diseases i dont know yet i knew how to call someone elses beast if it matched mine richard had taught me the theory of that i thought of leopard i simply thought of it and i felt it stir inside me it was always the oddest sensation as if there were some deep cave inside me and the beast lived there until called now it uncurled itself stretched and began to rise my body was like a dark liquid that the beast rose inside of that was all pretty typical of being a lycanthrope the problem was that my body lacked the switch to actually shift and once the beast got to the surface of my body there was no place to go or there hadnt been up until now but somewhere during the rising liquid feel of fur curving against places that nothing should have touched i realized that there were two shapes rising for the surface id tried to call leopard but i was about to get double for my money the wolf bristled his ruff standing up his body stiffening i felt his fear he knew he was about to be outnumbered and inside my body there was no pack to call the wolf stood his ground making himself look as large and fierce as he could then the cats hit the surface of my body and the wolf fled i could feel him running running back the way he had come like he was heading home it was the first time i realized that my body wasnt just a prison but also a den a place of safety the cats hit the surface together and the force of it bowed my spine threw my body upward as if some great force had hit me from behind i fell back to the bed screaming with the pain of my abused body taking yet another hit tonight i needed this to stop we needed it to stop i saw the cats the leopard looked small beside the lion small sleek and gleaming black it had backed away from the larger cat i didnt blame it the lioness was huge a great tawny beast of a cat maybe it would have looked smaller if i hadnt been looking at wolf and now leopard the lion was staring at the leopard in a way that was patient waiting for the leopard to decide what to do next the lion had the confidence of several hundred pounds of extra muscle on its side i let go of graham and used my good hand to reach for nathaniel he bent over my face so that when i touched him his face was nearly above mine i buried my face against the sweet warmth of his neck he always smelled like vanilla to me but underneath that was the scent of leopard sharper than the musk of wolf less sweet more exotic for lack of a better word the leopard stopped being defensive and looked up with eyes that were soft and gray with just a hint of green in them i didnt call here kittykitty but i called it all the same the leopard rose up through me and hit the surface of my body it filled me like a hand sliding inside a glove so that i felt it stretch out and out filling me i waited for that fullness to finally split my skin and step out but nothing happened i could feel fur rubbing against my skin on the wrong side i could feel it in there i gazed down my body and watched things roll under the skin of my stomach like the cat was rubbing against me the sensation left me nauseous but that was all it wasnt as violent as the wolf had been but i still wasnt shifting graham and clay slid off the bed so that micah could move up beside me its there but its not coming out why nathaniel slid down so that the two men framed my body with their own i dont know micah said give your beast to me nathaniel said i looked up at him and thought at the furred thing inside me it was patient because i wasnt afraid of it id embraced it welcomed it now it slid inside me waiting for release a release that i couldnt give it ive taken your beast once before he said i remember i turned my head just enough to see micahs face i looked a question at him give your leopard to him anita nathaniel pressed his body closer to my side so i could feel him pressed soft against my hip he leaned over me propping himself across my body with one arm so he laid no weight on my upper body he leaned in for a kiss and i felt the leopard roll toward him like something half liquid and half solid fur his mouth found mine and we kissed the last time id given him my beast had been almost as violent as tonight but id been fighting now i simply gave it to him and nathaniel didnt fight he kissed me hard and deep as if he were trying to taste that furred shape and the next moment that shape spilled up through my mouth i felt it as never before as if truly it slipped up and out through my mouth i had a moment of choking and then it was in him my leopard smashed into his body smashed into his beast the force of it pushed his body off the bed like a blow but he fought to keep on kissing me fought to kiss me as thick heavy liquid ran over my body from his so warm hot as if he were bleeding to death i opened my eyes enough to see that the liquid was clear but had to close my eyes to keep it from getting in them his hands were on my face trapping us in the kiss but i wanted the kiss i wanted this i wanted needed the release and my body couldnt give it i wrapped my good arm across his back so i could feel his skin split and the fur flow out like solid water hot velvet under my hand his mouth reformed against mine so that the kiss had to change because the mouth he had now couldnt kiss like his human body not enough lip i licked my tongue along teeth sharp enough to eat me for real he drew back and i was left to wipe the heavy liquid off my face so i could see him the face was leopard and human a strangely graceful mix leopardman worked better than wolfman maybe because the cat had a shorter muzzle naturally i raised both my arms toward him and realized that the left arm was working now i hadnt shifted but something about giving him my beast had given me some of the benefits of healing that shifting would have done interesting i hugged him and found his fur dry though my body was covered in the clear goo that shifters bled when they changed i never understood how their fur came through dry but it always did i ran my hands over the unbelievable softness of his fur felt the muscled strength of him and felt that his body wasnt at all unhappy to be pressed against mine wed made love once before when he was in this form and at that moment it didnt sound like an entirely bad idea but there was someone else inside me waiting the lion roared where it was still standing patient it let me know that it she was still there shit i whispered nathaniel snuffled next to my face lion micah rolled off the bed we need a werelion fast before it decides to try to tear its way out we have no lions jeanclaude said i thought about it i thought i need a lion i thought about the golden fur the dark orangeamber eyes i put the call out not for my lion but for a lion i felt an answer like a distant voice i felt two answering tugs almost as if i held two leashes one was reluctant the other was eager theyre coming or at least he is i whispered whos coming nathaniel said in that growling voice cookie i said because for the life of me i couldnt think of his real name all i could think of was what id nicknamed him in my head because of his cookie monsterblue hair we heard raised voices before anyone knocked at the door mens voices arguing just outside the door lisandro went to the door after claudia nodded he opened the door to reveal cookie with his blue spiked hair and the brunette werelion cutting no pierce his name was pierce cookie was smiling as he came through the door wearing nothing but jeans with a gun stuck inside the waistband as if the reason for the pants wasnt modesty but a place to put the gun pierce glowered as he came through the door he was completely dressed though his shirt was buttoned crookedly and his jacket tucked badly on one side to flash the shoulder holster the gun looked like a beretta not my choice for concealed carry but then i have small hands i wasnt surprised to see them id called them i was surprised to see octavius augustines human servant at their heels he was dressed as impeccably as hed been earlier except that he had no tie and his cuffs were loose in the sleeves of his elegant suit jacket if the cuffs hadnt been loose he wouldnt even have looked like hed rushed this is outrageous he said first you insult and humiliate my master then you try to steal his lions did you think that since augustine is asleep for the day you could simply take them he got a good look at me on the bed he stopped i think because some of the people in the room had moved so he could see me on the bed me and nathaniel i dont know what he thought wed been doing but i suddenly saw it through an outsiders eyes me nude on the bed covered in clear sticky liquid nathaniel nude and excited in leopardman form cuddled in my arms other men in the room already nude what would i have thought if id walked in on all this probably the same thing octavius was thinking the look on cookies face showed that he was thinking the same thing but he was happy about it he started toward the bed but pierce grabbed his arm held him cookie growled at him and that one trickle of sound made the lion inside me tense dont let her mindfuck you pierce said you heard her call too cookie said you couldnt say no either but i dont want to go to her i dont want her to use me he turned the other man so he was facing away from the bed cookie had a tattoo of cookie monster as in sesame street on his right shoulder a happy little cookie monster eating cookies so the hair color wasnt an accident i want her to use me fight it pierce said i dont want to fight it cookie said if our master were awake you would not dare do this octavius said he walked around them both walked closer to the bed claudia and lisandro stepped between him and the bed but it was when he saw jeanclaude stepping out from the wall that his face fell apart fear fear and confusion chased over his face he was totally shocked to see jeanclaude there he fought and finally mastered his face but the first look was enough the first look and his remark that augustine was asleep for the first time i figured it out it wasnt that wed slept the day away and claudia and the rest were back on duty it was that wed barely been asleep at all and jeanclaude had not died at dawn he like damian did not die at dawn if he slept touching me octavius gave arrogance but shelved the anger as if he didnt want to start the fight he bowed jeanclaude i did not think you would be up i did not see you standing there i do have better manners than this my anger made me forget myself please forgive me his words were clear but he said them a little too fast i think it was his version of babbling nervously there is nothing to forgive octavius if you do not hinder us that is octavius faced him and nothing could keep the discomfort out of the set of his shoulders hinder you in what way jeanclaude stood before the man still nude but as comfortable as any of the shapeshifters he wore his body as if it were the most costly robe in the world or as if he were not aware he was naked augustine said that these two werelions are supposed to be pomme de sang candidates for ma petite octavius gave a small nod that is true we may have been too hasty with our rejection of them earlier i believe that there were errors of etiquette on both sides would you not say that was true perhaps perhaps we were all a little hasty earlier octavius admitted his voice showing that he wasnt sure where this was going and was trying to be cautious without being insulting i think if jeanclaude hadnt been standing there and his own master dead to the world hed have been less cautious and more angry hell if it had just been me and the shapeshifters i think hed just have told us to go fuck ourselves or some polite version of that ma petite would taste one of your lions now i think in light of all that has happened it might be well to cement a stronger tie with your master we are after all two of the most powerful masters in this country and between us we are certainly the most powerful territories in the middle of this country i followed the phrasing it implied but did not say that between the two of them they could rule the middle of this country and wouldnt it be better to be allies than enemies or maybe i was actually picking up a little of jeanclaudes thoughts just a touch he had no intention of doing some sort of war of conquest but to imply it gave us both the leverage of fear and greed fear of being our enemy and greed to take part in the spoils if we did decide to conquer jeanclaude played him octavius licked his lips then stood a little straighter as if hed realized he was slumping perhaps i know that augustines intent was to offer the lions as pommes de sang or as barter for one of your females i do not barter my people i believe ma petite made that clear to your master octavius nodded yes very clear anger threaded through his voice and he fought it off so that his next words were empty and inoffensive i think it would please my master if you found his pomme de sang candidates worthy of attention jeanclaude looked at me then his face was empty lovely but it was his voice in my head soft the merest brush of contact that told me what he wanted call them i held my hand out to them and said come to me cookie turned immediately only pierces hand on his arm stopping him dont make me fight you pierce if he is not strong enough to resist octavius said release him to his fate cookie looked at octavius you dont understand i dont want to resist her i want her to take me pierce tried to turn cookie back to him dont you see thats wrong shes already rolled you man shes already done you and you dont even know it maybe but if thats whats happening im okay with it the edge of smile i had seen vanished and his voice was low and serious when he said take your hands off me pierce i wont ask again let him go octavius said that is an order pierce pierce gave him an angry look but he let the other man go he even raised his hands in the air as if it wasnt his fault there was a small part of me that wanted to see if i could force pierce to come too but cookie was coming one lion was enough for now claudia stopped him standing in his way towering over him it was probably the first time hed met a woman tall enough and muscular enough to do that just seeing his reaction to it would say a lot about him call your rat off blake cookie said give up the gun and i move she said i was more armed than this when she touched me earlier then you were bodyguarding your master now youre about to get up close and personal with one of mine her voice was low and matteroffact i thought it was interesting that she implied i was one of her masters news to me i could see one shoulder enough to know he shrugged then he must have handed the gun over because claudia moved aside he padded toward the bed on bare feet the first button of his jeans already undone had it been before or had he caught the gun on it as he pulled the last would be careless was he careless i was way too calm i watched him come toward the bed with a detachment that surprised me it was like a type of shock almost or the lion was utterly dispassionate about the man walking toward us in some ways animals are more reactive than we are people mistake that for emotion but its not there was no emotion from the cat in my head she waited waited with a sort of cold wary patience as if she could have watched him forever and felt nothing it was his choice whether we got along or chased him away if he did something stupid or weak she wouldnt accept him shed kill him before shed accept him but there was no passion to the decision it was colder than any thought id ever had except when id decided to kill then there is a moment of cold clarity a moment of something that is almost peaceful my moment of peaceful sociopathy was stretched to an eternity in the head of that big cat nathaniel moved and that made me turn to him but the lion in my head roared at me swiped a claw across the inside of my body she let me know that she needed my eyes and had no interest in leopard the pain of her claws spasmed through me i was partially healed from what id done with nathaniel but that one swipe showed me that i was still hurt hurt in places that thered be no way to bandage part of me wanted to fight her and turn to nathaniel but i knew if i did shed do worse i fought my own stubbornness for a moment eyes closed concentrating trying to decide if id grown up enough to let this small loss go or if i had to win at every damn thing if i let the lion think it could boss me around would that set a bad precedent for later then a thought came to me the lion was me i was fighting with myself how terribly freudian or would it be jungian either way how strangely me the thought was so me that it opened my eyes cookie was standing beside the bed his hands were at his sides the look on his face was eager but wary as if hed finally figured out that something might be wrong his blue hair was flattened on top as if hed been asleep when id called him his eyes were very blue as he stared down at me i could see the tattoo on his left shoulder now the faces of bert and ernie i sensed a theme any more tattoos he grinned yeah want to see i dont know i said you called me he said and his voice was softer as if he wasnt sure what was happening and was finally not sure he was happy to be here cautious at last it pleased the cat in my head pleased me too i guess micah said she needs to give you her beast cookie turned to him frowning i dont understand his nostrils flared as he scented the air she smells like lion but she smelled like leopard earlier she smelled like wolf too he shook his head as if clearing his mind from the scent he looked down at me frowning speaking softly what are you the truth would have been i wasnt sure but some of the people in this room werent our friends octavius would be our enemy if he could i was about to try for halftruth when jeanclaude stepped up beside the bed and spoke ma petite seems to have the ability to acquire the animals of the vampires she comes in close contact with i knew she gained wolf through me as some servants do she gained leopard through contact with another it may be her closeness with your own master that has brought lion to her not a lie but it certainly wasnt the whole truth but hey i had no better suggestions that would make her very dangerous octavius said from near the door he and pierce were still close to the door as if for a quick getaway it would make her powerful yes jeanclaude said dangerous octavius said do the other masters know that they risk seduction and the loss of their animals to you jeanclaude or are we your first victims jeanclaude sighed and the sound echoed through the room and slid over my skin the lioness paced growled low and deep and the sound slid from my lips dont i said my apologies ma petite he said he turned to octavius truth then between us octavius before you think even worse of us i know you of old you will spread these rumors so i give you truth and i will know if you tell because no one in this room will tell but you i do not gossip you have always gossiped he motioned to me anita holds different types of lycanthropy inside her that is not possible nor is it possible for her to have a vampire servant or an animal to call that is not mine but those are true things we had heard but we thought the servant was rumor jeanclaude shook his head augustine is powerful enough to see truth when he sees her with damian he would know the truth anyway i tell you only a night early oh a day early he said it as if he had just remembered that he was up at dawn he had so not forgotten i swear to you that human doctors have drawn her blood and tested it she carries more than one strain of lycanthropy and yet has not shifted to any she holds the animal but seems unable to turn they have tried to tear their way out tonight and still she cannot shift micah added shes stuck at that point where the beast is trying to get out and you dont know how to let it out ouch cookie said he looked down at me smiling youve had a hard morning you have no idea i said yes he does nathaniel growled from beside me the two shapeshifters looked at each other it was a long look yeah i remember the first time we all do she fought fought it to a standstill he looked at me eyes narrowing you cant do that no one can never underestimate how stubborn anita can be richard said from across the room youll regret it if you do i looked at him hed taken one of the chairs near the fireplace as far from the bed as he could get without leaving the room he was mostly in shadow so that i couldnt see his face well but then again maybe i didnt want to see his face right then dont mistake force of will for stubbornness micah said there is a difference it looks the same to me richard said it would micah said a low growl trickled from richard and it echoed through the room much the way jeanclaudes sigh had the sound made me shiver but not with the promise of sex it flared across my skin like heat and the lion reacted to it she spilled into my skin like the leopard had done like the wolf had done i was suddenly writhing on the bed screaming again i did not want to hurt again but if i didnt want to be wolf i sure as hell didnt want to be lion i didnt even know the lion pride here well shit if sheer force of will was keeping me in human skin my will was getting worn down eventually id lose this fight i didnt want it to be now i reached out for cookie he grabbed my hand almost by reflex i dragged him down to me and he didnt fight me he could have but he came to me he laid his body on top of mine while the lion tried to come out she stretched stretched impossibly huge trying to thrust claws out through my fingers and toes she couldnt come out but those metaphysical claws cut through my skin i screamed i raised my hands up to hold him to me and there was blood flowing down my fingers sweet jesus help me from far away i heard cookie say what do i do kiss her someone said he kissed me the moment his mouth touched mine i let the lion go i let it plow into him with nathaniel id tried to be a little controlled but i was all out of control today it hurt for it to leave me like someone had thrust a shovel down my throat and was digging out my internal organs in one ripping burning line i screamed into his mouth and he screamed back he kept his mouth on mine even while his body began to writhe in pain his hands dug into the bed on either side of me holding on holding on while that line of tearing ripping burning power ripped him open there was no moment of bones sliding or reshaping one minute he was human the next his skin had exploded outward raining on the room in thick wet globs the body under my hands was dry and furred and the cheek i touched had a fringe of thick golden mane i had to wipe thick goo out of my eyes to be able to see i wiped off bits of him that were thicker than clear liquid the power had literally blown him apart i had a moment to wonder if his tattoos would survive then i could see his face his eyes were golden in a face that was a pale gold with a mane around his head like a furry halo the face was that strangely graceful mix of human and cat his shoulders were broader than the leopards everything more muscular his suddenly nude body was pressed between my legs but not happy to be there i had a glimpse of his tail flicking behind him then he collapsed partially on me and partially beside me where his weight hit my body hurt i made a small sound and he rolled off me and lay there on the liquidsoaked sheets he looked like some primitive golden god hunted to death i lay where i was covered in something i didnt even want to see it felt too thick too just too i tried not to look at it or think about it i lay there covered in bits of his body and knew id hurt him badly im sorry i said and my voice was an abused whisper he rolled golden eyes up to look at me that fucking hurt micah came to the edge of the bed he took one of my hands in his and looked at my fingers you were bleeding from under your nails if he hadnt taken your beast when he did he shrugged it might have been too late that scared me it tightened my stomach and even that hurt as if id abused muscles that i didnt know i had thank you cookie more than youll know the lionman said did you just call me cookie sorry its the hair cookie monster blue and the tat haven my names haven i think he smiled but it was hard to tell on the lionish face from the angle i had though cookie monster works just fine i said cookie not monster you havent seen me at my best yet he said and smiled for sure i did not understand the comment micah did hes implying hes big oh i said then had to smile up at micah he shouldnt brag until hes seen the competition the lionman rolled his face to look at micah he wasnt looking at his face micah said you arent seeing me at my best either even through the lions face i could see the arrogance as he looked up at me not at micah trust me ill measure up auggie was shopping for size not just talent i wasnt sure if i was supposed to say oh really oh goody or oh boy under normal circumstances his assumption that he was going to get to fuck me would have pissed me off but one i didnt have energy left to get pissy two hed saved me saved us micah nathaniel and me i could ask for our local pride to give me some lions to follow me around but this morning right this moment haven had been the only rescue i had i owed him also id ripped his body apart and caused him massive amounts of pain oops didnt really cover that one when you can walk nathaniel said ill take you to the feeding area nathaniels fur glistened under the lights wetter from being so close to havens violent shift than from his own he slipped off the end of the bed and padded around to join micah who was still holding my hand micah pressed my hand to his face and it left a wet glistening stain on his cheek i was so going to need another bath i can walk haven slipped off the side of the bed and went straight to his knees shit nathaniel reached down to help him stand haven asked did you take her beast too yes it didnt hit you this hard did it no nathaniel didnt bother to explain that it hadnt been as violent and no one else did either i wasnt sure we were keeping haven but if we were then nathaniel would need to establish some sort of dominance with the other man that nathaniel could take that much pain and keep on ticking would help haven leaned against the bed nathaniel still holding his arm those golden lion eyes looked at me dont take this personally or anything but the fringe benefits better be fucking amazing they are nathaniel said depends on what fringe benefits youre talking about i said sex he said straightening up slowly obviously still in pain youre belle mortes line there is no other fringe benefit for you guys i couldnt argue with the last part but i could with the first dont assume youre getting sex haven he gave me a look all this and you dont think ive proved myself enough for sex damn girl what does a man have to do to meet your standards when you figure it out let me know this from richard he stopped near the bed and looked at me you could have been my lupa for real but you didnt want to be you chose him them over me if id been lupa for real you wouldnt have wanted me i saw it in your head he shook his head you could have been my lupa at the lupanar with the pack but i would have lost the baby he wouldnt meet my gaze you cant stand the thought that this isnt your baby no i cant im already your lupa i said im already bolverk nothing would have changed for you and me if id become wolf for real my being wolf would have meant you looked harder for that human ms right he stared down at me you wont even let me have the illusion of it will you i tried to sit up and micah had to help me so stiff so sore what illusion richard that we could be together as a couple at least with the wolves and what happens to my life when the moon isnt full would it be so bad to be with me for real without the others i looked up into his face and maybe i was tired physically mentally emotionally after everything id been through tonight and this morning all he could think of was himself his problems his pain is everything about your pain richard is that all you think about answer me anita answer me would it be so bad to have been with me for real just the two of us would that be so bad i tried one more time not to answer you dont want me to answer that question richard i leaned in against micah let him hold me mon ami jeanclaude said let it go he shook his head again no not this time i had this idea that if he and he pointed at jeanclaude hadnt interfered wed be a couple wed have been happy but i see you with him he pointed at micah and him he pointed at nathaniel and i have to know tell me the truth anita tell me the truth i wont break the triumvirate i wont run away but tell me the truth so i know where i stand i need to know how hard i need to look for ms right tell me the truth and maybe i can move on i know i cant stand watching you take another lover that i know i cant stand he sat down on the messy edge of the bed he gave me a solemn face if youd become wolf for real and had to live with me give up micah and nathaniel would that have been so bad my throat hurt but it wasnt from what the beasts had done my throat was thick and tight my eyes burned why did richard always make me want to cry dont make me do this i whispered just say it anita just say it i had to swallow twice and the tears spilled over as i said yes it would have been bad why why would the two of us living together raising our child be so bad if it is mine i want a place in his life that was it hed brought the baby up and suddenly in all the tears was the anger never far behind for me you dont see me richard you see this ideal of me but its not me i dont think it was ever me what does that mean i dont see you i see you youre right there what do you see richard tell me i see you im naked on a bed being held by a naked man with two other naked men in the room who are also my lovers youve just said you cant stand to watch me take another lover when you know im supposed to be looking for a new pomme de sang to feed the ardeur i thought you werent really going to look just pretend that should not have been said in front of our company im not sure i have a choice right now richard the next time the wolf comes just dont fight it and you can be my lupa we can be together because you wont be able to be with anyone else that was it i told him the truth i dont want to be just with you richard i dont want to lose micah and nathaniel or jeanclaude so if i said choose id lose i thought youve already lost me out loud i said i cant be with just one person richard you know that even if the ardeur cools youre never going to choose just one of us are you we stared at each other and the weight of his gaze was so heavy so heavy in his own way he was just as stubborn as i was and this was one of those moments when it was about to destroy us no richard i dont think i am he took in a lot of air and let it out slow he nodded as if to himself stood and said without looking at me thats what i needed to hear not this weekend well be busy but next weekend ill still want you to go to church with me if you want to i wasnt sure what to say so i said okay family dinner afterward like always he said as he headed for the door he hesitated at the door turned with his hand touching it i will find someone who wants the life i want i hope you do i whispered i love you he said i love you too i said and meant it i hate you anita he said with almost no change in his voice i hate you too richard i said and i meant it another mess another bath thanks to the violence of havens change i wasnt the only one with gobs of him in my hair and other places if a forensics team had come on the scene god knows what they would have made of it jeanclaude and micah got in the tub with me nathaniel had taken haven to the feeding area where they kept livestock or i assumed it was livestock truthfully id never seen the feeding but nathaniel and jason had both told me that it was legal food and that meant animals though i loved several shapeshifters i did not want to see them eat some visuals i did not need octavius and pierce had tried to go back to their rooms but claudia had stopped them shed asked where the guards on their door were pierce said they tried to stop haven and me from leaving the room that was their job claudia said then they arent that good at their job he said did you kill them he looked down at the floor then back up they were breathing when we left them that had prompted her to send lisandro and clay to check shed kept graham with her and made octavius and pierce wait for the news both of the wererats were alive but hurt badly hurt thanks to the problems wed had with the masters of both cape cod and chicago we had extra guards they had actually put guards on the coffin room which was fortunate meng die had cracked her coffin when she got the power rush that all of jeanclaudes people got from our sex with augustine meng die more powerful not a good thought now the extra guards came in handy claudia put four guards on octavius and pierce she sent lisandro to supervise them with orders to check in with fredo who turned out to be in charge of the coffin room detail claudia stayed with us and kept clay with her the two of them were outside in the bedroom now while we cleaned up claudia and clay were messy too but would wait to clean up jeanclaude drew me through the warm water until my body rested against his i laid my head back against his shoulder and said didnt we just do this not precisely ma petite he whispered against my wet hair micah moved through the water until he knelt beside us his hair was plastered to his head looking straight and black his chartreuse eyes were startling in his tanned face without the hair to distract from them he moved in close enough that a strand of his hair touched mine and the illusion of blackness faded because even wet his hair was not as dark as mine or jeanclaudes impossibly rich dark brown but not black i whispered against micahs cheek no not precisely micah kissed me then leaned back enough to see us clearly now that were clean why couldnt we wake you and jeanclaude i thought jeanclaude was awake the whole time i said not at first at first he was as out of it as you were how did you know he wasnt just dead to the world like normal he was breathing i felt jeanclaude stir against me as if that fact had startled him breathing how interesting his voice was very careful shouldnt you have been breathing i asked no he said i turned around in his arms until i could study his face that face showed me nothing it was as beautiful and unreadable as a painting as if instead of a face with movement and breath it were just a moment caught in time a single lovely expression he was at his most careful hiding when he was like that why is your breathing more surprising than your not dying at dawn i asked i also dreamed he said i frowned at him you were asleep you dream when youre asleep i have not dreamed in almost six hundred years what did you dream micah asked a very practical question mon chat i looked from one to the other of them am i missing something jeanclaude looked at me what did you dream ma petite who did you dream of his voice never changed from that friendly lilt you ask like you already know i said you must say it ma petite the mother of all darkness i said softly and just saying it seemed to make the room not quite bright enough marmee noir he said nodding yes i said i tried to read past that pleasant exterior and failed you dreamed of her too oui you both dreamed of the head of the vampire council she is much more than that jeanclaude said she is the creator of our civilization our laws are her laws some say she was the first vampire and that she truly is the mother of us all i cuddled in closer to him and he tucked me under his arm so i could wrap my arms around his waist somehow close wasnt close enough when talking about the mother of all darkness what did you dream exactly micah asked she tried to play human for me but god she was bad at it i saw her bend over you ma petite i saw her begin to take you away from me but i could not reach you the darkness held me as her figure bent over you he shuddered and held me right against his body i could not reach you and her voice taunted me for my carelessness he kissed the top of my head but she also told me that if i had given you the fourth mark that she would have killed you for if she could not control you then she would destroy you micah came to us tucked himself against me pressing jeanclaudes arm between us his own arm going across jeanclaudes shoulders micah was on his knees beside me because their heads came together over mine and micah wasnt tall enough for that without some help but you woke before anita micah said why i thought if i could break my dream it would free ma petite it did not but i was able to break marmees hold on my mind that in itself is a surprising thing surprising doesnt begin to cover it i said how did you break free how did you he asked i called the only animal i have that isnt a cat she only does cats i saw her in that room where her real body is i saw her body jerk my wolf bit her for real i think the two men held me tighter pressing me between them as if something about what id said scared them i guess it was scary but am i missing something here guys youre suddenly both even more afraid the ability to send a spirit animal through dream and harm another is rare among us among vampires you mean i said oui us too micah said butthen he stopped abruptly but what i asked when he didnt answer i pulled away from them both so i could see his face jeanclaude if he wanted to could hide anything behind his face but micah wasnt that good if i looked hard enough i might get a hint he lowered his eyes as if he knew what i was doing i touched his face turned him to look at me what micah what is it chimera could invade your dreams could he hurt someone that way no then he seemed to think about it not when he took over my original pard he couldnt he had grown in power in the years i was with him so maybe ask some of the dominants he took who survived ask them if he could hurt them in their dreams it is very rare for a lycanthrope to be able to invade dreams like a vampire jeanclaude said chimera was a rare kind of guy i said and just thinking about him scared me he was dead id killed him but he had been one of the scarier things id ever fought micah looked at me and his face held such pain as if whatever he was thinking was something so awful what i asked we learned last month that you carry lion lycanthropy that had to come from your fight with chimera i nodded he was in lionman form when he cut me up yeah micah licked his lips as if there were any possibility in the hot misty tub that his lips were dry what if you gained more from him than just lion lycanthropy i frowned at him im not following he means ma petite what if you gained not simply lycanthropy but the kind of lycanthropy that chimera held he was not a werelion he was a panwere he held over a halfdozen types of lycanthropy did he not micah nodded leopard lion wolf hyena anaconda bear and then he took the cobras leader i think if hed lived until next full moon he would have been cobra too chimera thought that once he hit his first full moon the animals he had were all he got i dont think that was true micah said are you sure it wasnt true i asked he shook his head no but it would explain whats happening to you what do you mean whats happening to me anita you almost shifted tonight blood came out from under your nails it was close were not sure im a panwere no but if you are then you wont lose the leopards when you shift i shook my head ill pick leopard if i have to pick thanks just in case i agree he said but if you are a panwere and youre close to shiftinghe stopped talking then looked down you are thinking what i am thinking mon chat and you know she will not like it jeanclaude said what i asked jeanclaude answered if you are to be a panwere and there is a chance that you will gain new animals until your first change of shape then we have the opportunity to gain great power what are you talking about if you are going to shift then wouldnt it make sense to add more types of lycanthropy micah said make sense no i said no it wouldnt make sense why not ma petite you called the lions and they came to your call you call the leopards and they come you call wolves and i begin to wonder if it is my power that attracts them to you or something more youre saying i should deliberately infect myself with other types of lycanthropy they exchanged glances put that way no micah said it is a thought ma petite merely a thought are you always thinking about how i can help you be more powerful he sighed we must be powerful and stable we must show the other masters that we do not pose a threat to the council in europe or anyone else powerful we can do but stable i shrugged i dont know about that one we arent a threat to the council micah said but they may not believe that they may not jeanclaude said there was a knock on the door who is it jeanclaude called remus is there something you need remus claudia ordered me to check in physically with you for the shift change jeanclaude glanced at us he held an arm out come to me ma petite let us make certain you are hidden from sight then allow him to enter i dont see why he needs to enter i said we will ask him jeanclaude took me into the curve of his shoulder micah moved in front of me i wrapped my arms around micahs shoulders drawing him in against my breasts yeah the water covered me but remus was still one of the newer guards i didnt know him well enough to be comfortable in the tub with him in the room you may enter jeanclaude said the door opened remus stepped inside but kept his hand on the doorknob as if he were no happier about invading our bath than i was his eyes were greengray nice eyes if hed ever look directly at you he never did or at least he never did at me or jeanclaude or micah or nathaniel why remuss face had been broken at some point and been put back together there was no one thing you could point to and say thats out of place but the overall effect was lopsided and looked almost uncomfortable like a ceramic mask that had been glued back together wrong i couldnt make complete sense of remuss face because he wouldnt look at me i wanted badly to tell him to just look at me but i couldnt without raising a subject that was probably painful and none of my business so i let it go the rest of him was dressed in the usual bodyguard black if there were injuries under the clothes it didnt show when he moved he moved like there were steel springs in the lean muscles of his body claudia ordered anyone who takes over to check with you in person eye to eye her orders did she say why i asked because it was a change he looked up then gave that lopsided smile i had a moment to see disbelief on his face before he looked away she filled me in on whats been happening she wants at least two guards in the room with you at all times i dont think so i said thats what i told her youd say he gave another glance at me and i had a second of those greengray eyes angry then down and away again with micah with you its not a problem but if it were only jeanclaude he shrugged if you shift for the first time and its wolf then he may be able to control you but if you shift to an animal he doesnt control then what if you eat him hes a master of the city i think he can handle it you dont get it remus said and he came into the room a step letting go of the doorknob he finally looked at me and held my gaze since i give absolute eye contact it left us staring at each other his eyes flinched but he kept the gaze it was a relief to be able to see his face straight on jeanclaude is powerful but in plain unarmed combat shifters beat vampires unless they can mindfuck us we will win a fight i glanced at jeanclaude to see how he felt about that he gave the same lovely blank face i turned back to remus so what you guys get to watch do you think this makes me happy he said and his power flared through the room like a hot wind he closed his eyes and counted to ten or something because the heat vanished he gave calmer eyes to all of us but he knew it was mostly me he had to persuade so he stared at me the angry defiance was back in his eyes you have no idea how dangerous you could be when you first shift you wont just be a lycanthrope thats bad enough but youll be this uberpreternatural power youll be a shifter with powers over the dead if you lose control of one power maybe youll lose control of all of them do you have any idea what could happen i stared up at him scared and not liking it i could be scared or i could get angry guess which i picked the beast blocks the necromancy once i give in to one hunger that completely the others go away are you a hundred percent sure of that he asked i opened my mouth to say yes then hesitated micah answered for me patting my arm as he did so no no was truthful but so what do we do you have to have at least one shapeshifter with you at all times someone powerful enough to handle the emergency handle how i asked keep you from hurting anyone too badly whos on the list of powerful enough i asked me claudia fredo lisandro socrates brontes bobby lee mickey ixion a lot of the wererats are exmilitary and mercs but some of them are better at killing than minimizing the damage he shrugged claudia and bobby lee will be in charge of the list but i know that you wont be left with just graham and clay again maybe one of them but theyll need to be paired up with someone with more realworld experience reallife experience i made it a question exmilitary merc excop professional bodyguard raphael recruits from some very hardcore places narcissus doesnt i asked remus shrugged again he does now he lost nearly three hundred men when chimera took them over they slaughtered them narcissus had a lot of muscle and athletes but he didnt have many real fighters one of the reasons that the werehyenas got taken over by such a small force was that they werent the real deal narcissus found out that martial arts training doesnt stand up to true warriors war aint an olympic event its no place for amateurs and you are not an amateur jeanclaude said in that pleasant empty voice no sir remus said i am not i went to the bathroom for a few minutes and came back out to find that jeanclaude wasnt the only vampire in the bedroom elinore stood near the bed she was dressed in a white gown with a high lacy collar and a cream robe that managed to look graceful and not like jammies at all her long blond hair fell in a pale wave around her body like a second robe so long she was a vision in pale delicate colors then she looked at me her eyes were a pale icy blue the wrong color of blue for that delicate face her face was a nearperfect oval dainty and unreal as if someone had carved her from some white pure rock and breathed life into her unless she worked at it hers was a cold beauty if her eyes had been a brighter blue i think it would have made her look warmer the eyes gave the lie to the rest of her the eyes were serious careful watchful hidden under all those clothes was a round curvy body soft she didnt believe in weight lifting too unladylike but she had a body that was as lovely and desirable as the face if a little soft for my tastes she had the blond nordic beauty that id craved as a child craved so id fit in with my blond blueeyed father and his new family id tried to hate her just on principle id failed why under that ladylike exterior she was tough fair and harder than a box of nails she just hid it much better than i did we got along besides all the male vamps were prettier than me why shouldnt some of the female vamps be prettier too elinore i said whati checked my wristwatch what are you doing awake before noon that is what i was asking jeanclaude she said in that silky voice that matched all the lace and cream satin jeanclaude looked at me from where he sat on the edge of the bed he was in his black brocade robe with all the fur on it they looked like opposite ends of a dream one so pale the other so dark all our people have gained from what we did last night ma petite he motioned toward elinore this is proof of just how much they may have gained i started walking around the end of the bed toward them is this the earliest youve woken as a vampire she nodded how do you feel i asked she seemed to take the question seriously she screwed that pretty little face up in a look of concentration i was never sure if elinore really had that many cute mannerisms or whether shed spent so many centuries using them as camouflage that she couldnt get rid of them now whatever she was always doing things that made me think little girl dolllike cute until she decided not to be cute then she was positively frightening i wondered how many enemies had been lured in by that softness only to find the steel dagger inside all that silk if id been willing to play to my packaging i might have pulled it off but it just wasnt in me to try i feel fine she said at last have you fed i asked can you not tell she asked giving me a very direct blue gaze you always look a little ethereal to me so no i cant tell with you she gave a small smile quite a compliment that the executioner cannot tell whether ive fed do you feel the thirst jeanclaude asked she thought about that for a second making the pretty little face no i could feed but i do not have to i felt a stab of triumph from jeanclaude triumph and right on its heels fear then he closed the leak in his shields tight why afraid why triumphant why both i asked jeanclaude fed the ardeur well and truly last night and it is sustaining me that is very impressive elinore said yeah i get that buti tried to think how to form the question why are you both so pleased if we wished to travel as a group in countries where we are illegal only one of us would need to feed it would mean jeanclaude could take quite a large group of his own vampires into another territory without leaving much evidence behind certainly we could hide from the human authorities but were not going to invade anyones territory no jeanclaude said but it is always good to have options ma petite wheres your sweetie your knight he did not wake with me and there was just a hint of sadness to that so are you the only one who gained there was a knock on the door yes remus jeanclaude called remus opened the door and closed it behind him requiem is out here requiem elinore said interesting send him in remus jeanclaude said he held jeanclaudes gaze for a moment then looked down and did his talking to the side of the face all right but if anyone else shows up early like this i will have to insist that you let two of the guards inside the room so whatever secret shit youre discussing discuss fast you really think theres going to be that many more vamps waking up this early i asked yeah i think there will be we will discuss whether guards come back inside when someone else comes to my door jeanclaude said let requiem pass remus remuss face struggled he didnt like it i am caught between masters here claudia says dont leave you guys alone you say i cant stay we need a chain of command here too many generals i said he gave me a quick direct glance yes i am sorry remus jeanclaude said but elinores arrival has changed things fine but requiem is the last or im calling claudia and telling her i cant guard you because you wont let me as you see fit remus he gave another angry look around the room then opened the door a moment later requiem glided through the door he had his black hooded cloak close around his body so that the only thing that showed was the spill of his vandyke beard framing the curve of his lips how badly are you hurt mon ami jeanclaude asked requiem shrugged back the hood without using his hands the way youd flip long hair behind your back the hood slid down and the right side of his face was a mass of deeppurple bruises one of his eyes was almost swollen shut just a glimpse of that startling bright blue that had made belle morte try to buy requiem from his original master belle had wanted to have a matching set of blueeyed men ashers were the palest blue jeanclaudes the darkest requiems the brightest his master had refused and they had fled france his long straight hair so dark it mingled with the black cloak made his pale skin all the paler and helped the bruises stand out like purple ink on his face wow i said how much blood are you using to heal that he looked at me then and the look on his face said clearly id said something smart much how fares the rest jeanclaude asked requiem spread the cloak wide with a gesture of both arms so that it was like a curtain spilled dramatically around his body his upper body shone like white flame against the darkness my eyes adjusted to all that contrast and i realized that some of the whiteness was bandages his right arm chest and stomach were all thick with gauze and white tape jesus did meng die really do all that yes he said that and no more requiem rarely gave just a oneword answer to anything he came toward us the cloak flying out behind him which said he was moving faster than that gliding walk appeared ma petite if you could fetch scissors from the bathroom drawer we can look at his wounds i did it without being asked id noticed the bruises last night but hadnt seen all the bandages under his shirt i had had no idea how hurt he was i hesitated in the bathroom with the scissors in my hand i caught sight of myself in the mirror i looked sort of startled had he really dumped meng die because of me dumped another woman on the off chance that i might take him as a pomme de sang i stared at myself in the mirror and just didnt see a woman who could make a man dump someone on the possibility of sex elinore maybe but me i just didnt think so i went back to the other room and found requiem sitting on the bed beside jeanclaude who was turning his face to the light checking his bruises requiem was talking as i entered she said if she could not have my pretty face on her pillow then no one would have it someone had brought one of the chairs by the fireplace so elinore could sit and not be on the bed so she tried to ruin your face she said softly yes he said in that strangely clipped voice that wasnt at all his usual i held the scissors out to jeanclaude he took them and laid them on the bedside table i think perhaps we can take off the tape if you will help me ma petite i had to move requiems cloak where hed draped it on the end of the bed the bed was tall enough that i had to make certain i was sitting far enough back from the edge so i wouldnt slide off silk coverlet silk robe makes for slippery i took requiems hand in mine the bandages wrapped around his hand and up nearly to the elbow you didnt get this from her hitting you i said she had a blade he said and again his voice was clipped and to the point i looked up at him and even the uninjured half of his face showed me nothing he was lovely and empty like jeanclaude was sometimes like looking at a painting of some handsome prince come back from battle even as i cradled his arm in my hands he was as distant and remote as if hed been hanging on a museum wall jeanclaude was already peeling tape from around requiems chest i bent over his arm and worked on the tape there holding his hand in mine while i started unwinding the gauze his hand was crisscrossed with shallow and notsoshallow slashes i raised his hand as gently as i could so i could keep unwrapping the bandages fell away and i made a sound i couldnt help it i put my hand at his hand and elbow and lifted gently his forearm was a mass of slashing wounds two of them needed stitches i looked at his face and he met my eyes and for an instant there was a flash of anger in those eyes then it went back to being empty these are defensive wounds you held your arm up in front of your face because thats what she was going for not entirely ma petite jeanclaudes voice drew me back to him and requiems now bare chest i let out a hiss of breath because he was right his pale muscular chest didnt have as many wounds as his arm but the ones he did have were deeper i traced the one under the sternum it was deep and i could see the mark of the blade in his flesh i looked up at him and it must have shown on my face so shocked anita why she was trying for your heart she was really trying to kill you i told you that last night ma petite i know you said she was trying to kill him buti traced my fingers just above another wound that went between his ribs the stab wounds were well placed shed tried to hack his face and the marks on the arm showed that she just wanted damage but the wounds on his chest and stomach they were kills she knew just where to place the blade my respect for meng die went up and so did my fear and she did all this where the customers could see not all of it requiem said but much of it yes i looked at jeanclaude and no one called the cops he had the grace to look away not embarrassed but what did you do i asked mass hypnosis is not illegal ma petite only personal hypnotism you bespelled the crowd i said i and asher i laid my hand above the wound that looked like it had come closest to his heart i had a bad thought you said she attacked asher is he this hurt no i think she knew that you and jeanclaude would kill her if she slew asher i think she believed i was of less value to you again his voice was empty but the very emptiness of it made me look at him that sounded bitter i said he looked away from me a small smile on his face i meant it to sound like nothing ive listened to a lot of empty vampire voices and theres flavor even to the emptiness i was a fool to tell her in a public place but she pressed me asked me and i told the truth he looked at me then and i had to fight to meet his gaze not because of vampire powers but because the bruises looked painful and i knew somehow weirdly they were my fault did you really tell meng die that you dumped her because you thought id turned you down because of her not in those words but yes i sighed and shook my head oh requiem i mean i didnt think shed take it this badly i motioned at some of his injuries but her pride wouldnt let her take it lying down pride he nodded then stopped in midmotion as if it had hurt she has much pride and i seem to have none he looked at me and emotion filled his eyes his face and the emotion was too strong for me to keep looking into his face dont i whispered he slid to the ground went to his knees he made a small involuntary sound it must have hurt he took my hand and i let him because pulling away seemed petty what must i do to be in your bed anita tell me and i will do it i looked into his face saw the pain there and it wasnt the pain of bruises and cuts i looked at jeanclaude its the ardeur isnt it i fear so he said i turned back to the vampire kneeling in front of me i had no idea what to say am i ugly to you he asked no and i traced the line of his uninjured cheek you are very handsome and you know it he shook his head stopped in midmotion again as if it hurt if i were handsome enough you would have taken me to your bed and not turned to these strangers he lowered his head both hands gripping mine he finally raised his face and he was crying please anita please do not cast me aside so easily i know that you did not enjoy the attentions i gave you as much as i enjoyed the touch of your body but i will be better i swear it if only you will give me another chance to show you pleasure i was trying to be too careful of you i did not understand i can do better be better he buried his face against my legs and wept i believe we have our answer ma petite i stroked requiems hair and didnt know what he was talking about i was too stunned to think answer to what i asked the effect you have on vampires that have tasted the ardeur before i think you are addictive as belle was addictive he motioned toward requiem who was clutching at me still weeping into my legs he is powerful enough to be a master of a city ma petite not powerful in the way of augustine or myself but powerful he lacks not power but ambition he does not wish to rule there is no shame to that elinore said non jeanclaude said but i want ma petite to understand that her effect on requiem is not a small thing elinore had sat back in the chair curling her legs under her because her feet wouldnt have reached the ground i had no idea she had bespelled him like this i didnt bespell him i said she gave me a look and motioned at the vampire at my feet pick a different word if you like anita but the effect is the same we can argue semantics but requiem is besotted with you in a way most unnatural i stroked his hair so straight and thick but not warm he was cool to the touch he needs to feed i said healing is going to take a lot of blood and energy i dont think blood will cure this elinore said and her voice sounded almost accusatory what do you want from me elinore what do you want me to do make him your lover she said i have four men that im the only sex theyre getting and two more that are in my bed some of the time hell jason makes it into my bed about once a month exactly elinore said one more will hardly make a difference if it were just sex maybe but its not just sex its the emotional stuff i dont even know if theres enough of me to go around for five men plus extras call me crazy but i dont think requiem is a lowneeds item i stroked his hair felt him shake against my legs no i think he definitely goes in the highmaintenance category i dont think i have enough emotion left to do another highneeds man okay thats the truth im sure hed be a wonderful lover but i couldnt meet his other needs what other needs she asked talk emotion sharing love elinore shifted in her chair turning her head to one side her long hair spilling around her like a cornsilk dream you turned him down as your lover because you dont think you can love him i thought about it for a heartbeat then shrugged and nodded yeah sort of elinore looked at jeanclaude she turned him down because she does not think she could love him jeanclaude gave that graceful shrug she is very young dont talk about me like im not sitting here i said requiems crying had slowed so that he was mostly just kneeling with his head in my lap i kept petting his hair the way youd soothe a dog or a sick child we all understand anita that you are jeanclaudes consort we all understand that you and he and asher are a threesome we all understand that your triumvirate with the ulfric and jeanclaude must be maintained for reasons of power and safety that maintenance includes sex because he is of belle mortes line i admit that i thought him a fool and weak to have allowed you such closeness with the wereleopards but i was wrong out of that closeness came your own triumvirate which has strengthened jeanclaudes powers immensely your tie to damian and nathaniel is a wondrous thing your tie to micah is a puzzlement but i understand now that your powers are much like belles she collected men too i am not like belle morte i said your power is she pointed at requiem this is proof of that i dont want to collect men i said i stared down at the man in my lap i certainly dont want them this besotted this a level of wanting thats just wrong why is it wrong elinore asked because i dont think he has a choice about it i didnt mean to collect requiem he looked up then as if my saying his name had called him the tears had dried to faint reddish lines on his face the red didnt help the bruises look any better i touched the unhurt side of his face and he laid his cheek in my hand as if that one touch were something wonderful how do i fix this i asked you mean how do you set him free elinore asked yes you dont i stared at her what do you mean i dont there is no cure anita there is only going far away from you he will still crave your touch but he will not be able to act upon it like an alcoholic i said she nodded yes there is a cure for it jeanclaude said i looked at him what love he said true love we both stared at him true love elinore said he nodded we loved julianna and she freed us of the addiction of belle morte belle morte had requiem in her bed before ligeia ever touched him but she sent requiem on a long seduction far away from her it was necessary to seduce both halves of a noble couple so she sent ligeia with him i thought that requiems master fled france so belle wouldnt keep him his master met with an accident and belle was able to collect all the vampires of her line that the old master had made the way you say accident makes it sound like you dont mean accident at all i said it was an accident requiem said softly he spoke with his face in my lap the carriage we were in overturned in a storm we were on a cliff edge and somewhere during the fall a piece of wood went through his heart it was such an ordinary death his voice sounded relaxed distant we tried removing the wood but he did not revive we learned later that the carriage maker was wellsley whos wellsley i asked elinore answered he manufactured carriages in london for many years he was a devout man and hated the idea of his carriages being used for evil purposes so he had them blessed he would make a batch of them and have one of the local clergy bless them when the blessing is fresh some of them glow around us the blessing wears off i made it a question if enough evil and she made quotation marks in the air with her fingers happens in the carriage like a cemetery thats been out of use for a while or had black magic used in it too much i said you have to reconsecrate the ground the analogy will do she said i looked down at requiem and when your master was dead belle could call you to her yes he said and if jeanclaude had not given me a home here she would have done so again how did you get away from her the second time jeanclaude has the right of it ligeia and i were sent far away to seduce some nobles belle wished to control we did her bidding and they did what belle wished but ligeia and i fell in love with each other when we returned to belles court i was no longer drawn to her love jeanclaude said love is the only cure you and asher arent besotted with me not like this jeanclaude is your master and he holds the ardeur as well as for asher she looked at jeanclaude i think love protects him i looked at jeanclaude too and he would not meet our gaze i sort of assumed now that jeanclaude and asher were doing it like bunnies when i wasnt around but id never asked dont ask dont tell worked just fine for me last night seeing him with auggie made me wonder if i needed to ask or if it was confirmed too complicated for me i literally waved the thought away and said i cant count on requiem falling in love any time soon non ma petite what do i do take him as your lover elinore said easy for you to say no ones making you share yourself with anyone but your knight and one of the reasons i came to jeanclaude was that he would let me be with the man i love and not force me into the beds of others i am more grateful for that than i can ever say she turned those cold blue eyes on me but i do not carry the ardeur i am not an addiction ma petite you must meet this obligation i stared at him obligation you have addicted him to you would you be as cruel as belle morte herself and cast him away with this desire riding him he shuddered i have been as one addicted and cast out for some minor infraction i have felt my body ache for want of her and no amount of sex with anyone else satisfied that need he moved so he could lay his hand over mine where i stroked requiems hair he is my thirdincommand he is a good and honorable man you need more and more powerful food ma petite i think if you feed the ardeur well enough it will quiet but until you find food to its liking it will seek its own you want me to sleep with requiem i want you to feed the ardeur from him oui i thought you werent happy sharing me with so many men i mean you once threatened to kill richard i did not understand the nature of our power together then perhaps there is more than one reason that belle collected lovers perhaps it was not merely her appetite but more practical i stared at him feeling the weight of his hand over mine and requiem gone very still under our hands i cant meet all his needs jeanclaude i cant add another date to my card it is not a date he needs ma petite he needs to be your food food is for eating not for dating yeah thats what i said about nathaniel for months it doesnt work like that not for me what do you propose ma petite until we know the extent of your power over other vampires we must be very careful of our visitors we must surround you with powerful enough food that the ardeur will not keep drawing more why isnt your ardeur drawing in people you are his human servant elinore said youre taking some of the edge off his power what does that mean i asked if jeanclaude didnt have you then his ardeur would be doing this and it would make it hard to run his territory your attracting people is less distracting to him i looked at him are you doing this on purpose i swear that i am not its the nature of the power anita elinore said human servants animals to call pommes de sang they are all instruments to help their masters grow in power and control the power will find a place to go and feed that allows the master of the city to rule better you make the power sound alive like it can think for itself i said she shrugged perhaps it can i know that i have seen the power work like this with other masters not the ardeur but other powers i sighed great so im the ardeurs pinup girl because jeanclaude would get too distracted if it were him yes she said wait belle had the full ardeur more full than we have now but she had no human servant and no animal to call elinore said i looked at jeanclaude i thought every master called in help belle does not share power jeanclaude said not with anyone but you guys gain a lot of power from human servants and animals to call she has intimates of her animals to call but she has not chosen among them she makes no one special to her he said i dont seem to be able to choose who i get as animal to call i know you chose richard but i didnt exactly choose nathaniel nor haven jeanclaude said haven is not my animal to call i said but some lion will be and soon i fear jeanclaude said joseph is bringing some of his lionmen around today so you will have more than our guests to choose from choose for what and i sounded as suspicious as i felt so you may bring their beasts and hold off the change that made sense so many metaphysical problems that it was hard to keep track sometimes but one problem at a time i looked at the man in my lap fine whatever what am i going to do with you requiem jeanclaude and i moved our hands and he raised his face so he could look at me make me your pomme de sang i think the pomme de sang needs to be someone who can feed me night or day i said his face filled with panic please anita do not cast me aside i looked at jeanclaude a little help here if you will not feed the ardeur from him then we must send him to another territory he is powerful enough that many will want him as third or even second which will weaken your power base because elinore is only staying until we find her her own territory i said he gave a shrug that meant everything and nothing i cannot believe that my and i hesitated because boyfriend seemed too junior high lover not enough the man i love is encouraging me to take another lover he smiled at me we know now that any who have tasted belles ardeur are susceptible to your ardeur i think any of her line will be too risky to taste as pommes agree to feed the ardeur from requiem ma petite that is all agree because we have two more things to know before the party tonight what two things will you draw and be drawn to all leopards wolves and lions do the ardeurs effects travel outside belles line i looked at jeanclaude tried to read past his face youre still shielding so hard i cant tell how you really feel about this let me see inside your shields he shook his head i think it would be no help to you why not because part of me is happy our powers are growing no matter what the cost part of me is frightened of what the council may do about it do i want you to take another lover no but do i prefer that it is you whom the ardeur hunts to this degree and not me yes i am sorry ma petite but that is the truth i thought about it then nodded if you have a human servant who cant hold her shit together the other masters may forgive you like a bad marriage not your fault if you cant hold your shit together they wont let that pass please anita requiem said please feed the ardeur upon me please i will the look on his face was amazing so joyous even through all the bruises the look scared me no one but your nearest and dearest should ever look at you like that but not right now i said some of the joy faded why not now it is morning you have slept i nodded yeah usually that does raise the ardeur i looked at jeanclaude thats a good question why dont i feel all ardeurish i too am well fed you feasted last night requiem said on augustine and his people i looked back at jeanclaude is he right was it such a powerful meal that were safe for longer perhaps you dont sound convinced the ardeur is not always a predictable power ma petite i would need more than one feeding of such magnitude before i agreed that that was the reason or perhaps elinore said you should be trying to figure out how powerful a meal you would need to abate the ardeur you cannot feast on another master of the city and his people every night she leaned forward in her chair all lace and satin but strangely she didnt look cute she looked too intent for words like cute perhaps what is needed is permanent food of high power few masters would agree to become anitas or my permanent pomme de sang not if they are powerful enough to rule a territory of their own what if they have no choice in the matter she said indicating requiem are you suggesting that i purposefully trap other masters the way i accidentally trapped requiem i asked it would solve a great many problems she said it would be i groped for a word evil i thought you were more pragmatic than this anita doing that would be no different than if we gave in to the requests we get weekly for you to join some other masters kiss as his mistress we give you room to choose elinore how can you ask us to take that same choice away from someone else i would not be bespelled anita i would know every night as he touched me lay on top of me that i hated him requiem adores you and he will adore you until and if he falls in love true love until that time he will be in the bed of someone he adores having amazing sex and enjoying every minute of it it is not the same thing anita trust me on that but its sort of a metaphysical daterape drug used like that just because youre enjoying the abuse doesnt make it not abuse does it not ma petite i shook my head its too late for requiem ill accept that ill try feeding the ardeur on him he kissed my hand thank you mistress not mistress i said anita just anita thank you anita he said and kissed my hand again get up off the floor requiem please he stood i would like very much to sit beside you i sighed and nodded he sat on the other side of me from jeanclaude except that he sat close enough that his legs touched me great just creepy great i looked at his chest where the blades had come so close to taking his life what are we going to do about meng die shes just proven herself too dangerous and so not a team player kill her elinore said i looked at jeanclaude i would rather find another solution but yes it may come to that you are overly sentimental jeanclaude just because you feel guilty that you stole her mortal life it is a great gift not a curse i feel as i feel elinore have a care that your feelings do not get us all killed she looked at me also i think if anita truly is going to be a panwere news travels fast i said looking at jeanclaude i wished an opinion of someone powerful enough to have an opinion i wanted to argue but i couldnt she was the most powerful vamp in his group right now her waking first had proven that as i was saying if anita is truly going to be a panwere then it may not simply be lions wolves and leopards that she attracts it may be all wereanimals or many almost all the visiting masters have brought their animal to call so we must test this theory before she is allowed near them augustine i believe will let the insult go because he is besotted with you both and he attacked you first the breach of protocol was on his side not ours but if anita entices others away from their masters they may not be so forgiving agreed jeanclaude said and we still must see how master vampires outside belles bloodline react to anitas ardeur and where are we going to get masterlevel vamps and other wereanimals to test these little theories on i asked there was a knock on the door its remus jeanclaude enter remus entered closing the door behind him he was actually looking directly at us and he was angry which i guess explained the direct look i told you if there were any more that i wouldnt let them in without me and my guards coming in here i remember jeanclaude said i said any other vampire but definitely these two are not coming in here without you having bodyguards on this side of the door what two i asked wicked and truth are out here remus said wicked and truth elinore said how interesting they are very powerful and they are not of belles line i shook my head truth already got a taste of the ardeur when i bound him to jeanclaude hes not following me around like this i jerked my thumb at requiem did you actually feed from truth she asked no i said then you must try no i said at least suggest it to them she said no i said and put more heat into the word they have sworn loyalty to jeanclaude they are not leaving us elinore said no i said absolutely no very well then perhaps not feed but watch you feed jeanclaude said what does that mean i asked samuel watched you feed and was not drawn to you or me that strongly but haven was drawn so that his companions had to drag him away almost as they did augustine perhaps if wicked and truth are simply in the room when you feed that would tell us if the effect will go outside belles line or no we would need someone from belles line to be in the room too someone close in power i looked at elinore she smiled i am in love anita true love it does not work on me some types of ardeur work anyway i said for a brief time yes but my being in love makes me unusable for the test there was another knock on the door remus opened it murmured to someone then turned back he didnt look directly at us again london is out here too hes belle mortes line isnt he yes elinore said he is so what i feed the ardeur and then they tell us how attracted they are to it it is a way of testing without impinging too far upon your morals elinore said just have sex in a room while a bunch of men watch right jeanclaude shook his head and smiled simply feed the ardeur ma petite it does not have to be sex if you do not wish it it seems a shame to raise the ardeur on purpose when im not hungry i said he sighed yes it does but it is far better to raise it now when we can control it than later when visitors have arrived and we cannot put that way it made sense but who do i feed from i asked he gestured to requiem the damage is already done to him great now im damage i said and feeding from blood as powerful as yours will help him speed his healing that was true but fine but only if you explain the parameters of the experiment to everyone they have to agree to it or i wont do it of course ma petite i would not have it any other way i looked into that beautiful unreadable face and was almost a hundred percent certain he was lying everyone agreed to the test everyone seemed happier about it than i did okay everyone but remus and some of his guards i think that was because he was pretty sure it was going to go horribly wrong and he and his people would have to pick up the pieces i agreed with remus part of me hopes that someday i get over being so damned uncomfortable about group scenes like this part of me hopes i dont its sort of the same part of me that mourns that i can kill without feeling bad about it most of the time yeah that same part thinks that doing metaphysical sex in front of a bunch of men for any reason is just another step down the slippery slope to damnation but if the alternative is having the ardeur go off like a metaphysical bomb during the party tonight well what we were about to do was the lesser evil still it might be nice once in a while not to have to choose between evils just once couldnt i choose the lesser good requiem lay back against the fresh sheets his hair spilling out around his upper body like a dark halo his day job or would that be night job was stripping at guilty pleasures the body showed that but all i could see was the wounds meng die had come very very close to putting out his light forever i traced fingertips across the sternum cut his breath came out in a shuddering sigh i couldnt tell if it had hurt or felt good normally i could read requiem but today there was nothing in his face that helped me he gazed up at me as if i were the most wondrous thing hed ever seen it was a step above or below love worship was the only word i had for it it hurt my heart to see that look on his face there was no requiem left in that look requiem of the somber pretty speeches hed earned his name because he was poetic but damned depressing but there was no force of personality to him now nothing but this overwhelming need god help me i said jeanclaude came to stand next to the bed to me what is wrong ma petite please tell me hell get better than this i said better than what ma petite look at him i said jeanclaude moved close enough that the sleeve of his robe touched my robed arm he gazed down at requiem with me requiems gaze flickered to him then settled back on me as if the other man didnt matter but hed noticed him because he said will you force me to share your favors with another anita or will i be as the heavens stretched between the heat of the sun and the cold kiss of the moon will you do to me as you did to augustine well at least hes back to being wordy and poetic i said its a start did he offer himself to both you and anita elinore asked still curled in her chair i believe so jeanclaude said requiem does not embrace men london said from the far corner hed moved to the darkest most shadowy corner he could find as he always did it wasnt just his short dark curls and penchant for black clothing that got him the nickname the dark knight it was the one thing he fought against most strongly yes elinore said he was always most adamant that he did not do men belle punished him for his refusal to service men jeanclaude said he stared down at requiem with a solemn lost look then he shouldnt be offering to do it for us i said no he should not jeanclaude looked at me and showed for an instant what he was feeling i felt it like a stab through my heart anguish anguish that he had brought requiem here to keep him safe and instead had enslaved him more thoroughly than belle ever managed i felt the bed move a moment before a hand touched my back through the robe i turned but i knew whose hand was on me requiem had sat up with all the damage to his chest and stomach and hed sat up so he could touch me i searched his face for something familiar i finally said requiem are you in there he touched my face i am here but he spoke the words with such emotion that they seemed to mean a great deal more than they should have i moved his hand away from my face held it in mine so maybe he would stop touching me i looked at jeanclaude this is awful how do we fix this isnt there some faster way than finding his true love requiems thumb began to make little circles on my hand as if just being held wasnt enough its almost as if shes bespelled him elinore said as if she were the vampire and he the human fine treat it like its vampire mind tricks how do i undo it a vampires master can sometimes break such enchantments elinore said i looked at jeanclaude help him london stepped back to the edge of the light but it is not anitas ardeur but jeanclaudes ardeur through her he cannot fix his own ardeur can he i do not know elinore said she looked around the room and spoke toward the wall farthest from the door wicked truth you have been very silent through this discussion do you have any suggestions the two brothers came forward into the stronger light near the bed at first glance they didnt look that alike they were both tall and broadshouldered but beyond that they were opposites wickeds hair was sleek and very blond cut long so it framed a face that was all high sculpted cheekbones complete with a dimple in his chin deep enough that i could never decide if it looked adorable or painful his eyes were a clear steady blue and if i hadnt had jeanclaudes and requiems eyes to compare him to id have said his eyes were striking he wore a modern tailored suit of tans and creams that made him look halfway between the college professor of your dreams and an executive gigolo then there was truth truth had obviously slept in his clothes the clothes were made up of bits of leather but not fashionable club wear no more like boiled leather worn smooth and soft with use and wear his pants were tucked into boots so battered that jeanclaude had offered to replace them but truth wouldnt give them up he could have been dressed for any century from thirteenth to fifteenth his straight brown hair was shoulder length but stringy as if it needed a good brushing he didnt exactly have a beard just stubble as if he hadnt shaved for a while but under all that disarray was the same bone structure the same cleft chin and the same blue eyes wickeds eyes always seemed to hold a cynical joy but truths looked tired and wary as if he was just waiting for us to disappoint him what do you want from us truth asked and his voice was already defensive as if he was ready for an argument elinore uncurled from her chair and moved to stand on the other side of jeanclaude not quite to where london was standing but so she could see the brothers more clearly you have been masterless for longer than any other master vampire surely in all those centuries some powerful vampire tried to capture the great warriors wicked and truth have you been bespelled as requiem is wicked laughed save the flattery elinore well help if we can if anita tells us plainly what she wants from us he turned those laughing eyes to me truths somber eyes followed his brothers gaze i met their eyes wicked looked like it was all a big joke which id finally realized was his blank face truth looked calmer blanker but he was ready to be disappointed in me certainty that i would not live up to his expectations was clear on his face isnt it jeanclaudes order you need elinore asked truth shook his head wicked said no no jeanclaude said no wicked repeated and he allowed himself a small tasteful smirk of satisfaction who is your master elinore asked they are and truth motioned at both jeanclaude and me then why is jeanclaudes order not good enough she asked he hasnt bespelled requiem she has truth said you do not agree with london that it is jeanclaudes ardeur flowing through anita they both shook their heads and the movement was so welltimed that you could suddenly see how identical they almost were wicked spoke for them anitas will her intent is what we need he stared at me what is your will anita to have him free of me would you undo the blood oath and cast him back to belle morte wicked asked requiem clutched at my hand please mistress not that i patted his shoulder no requiem youre not going back to belle we would never let that happen he calmed almost instantly and he shouldnt have that much panic shouldnt have just vanished it was just another sign of how far gone he was be careful with your words said truth for they are dangerous things i thought before i spoke the next time i want him to have choices i dont want all his free will sucked away like this why wicked asked why is bespelling him so terrible to you i looked into requiems face where he sat beside me he gave me a look of absolute adoration my stomach clenched tight the thought of anyone being bound to anyone else like that was wrong that id done it by accident made me vaguely nauseous i like requiem hes a good guy especially for a vampire i dont want him like this some sort of slave its just creepy is he better off dead wicked asked no i said quickly no then what would you have us do truth asked requiem said do i not please you i grabbed his good shoulder and said i know youre in there requiem come back to us hear me requiem hear my voice and break free of this i dont wish to be free he said simply i pulled away from him and he tried to hold on i actually slapped his hands away from me he looked so hurt please anita how have i displeased you so i will do anything anything that you ask if you will only feed the ardeur from me anything i said anything you have but to speak it and i will do it break free of this i said i do not understand he said and he looked as puzzled as his words thats what i want requiem i want you to break free of what ive done to you the moment i said it i knew it was true that was what i wanted youre a master vampire you could be a master of the city if you were a little more ambitious you can fight this i searched his face to see if he understood what i was saying come back to yourself or i wont feed the ardeur on you anita i i dont you said youd do anything i asked this is an anything and its what i want you to do you may be asking something he cannot do wicked said ive felt his own version of the ardeur or whatever you call the other gifts of belles line that arent exactly ardeur he is powerful i looked into his face and tried to show him how much i knew he could do this i want to see requiem staring at me out of these eyes not some besotted fool be the strong man i know you can be fight free of this enough to talk to me i wont touch you ever again unless you can give consent he looked so stricken so wounded that i went up on my knees and cradled his face between my hands you told me once that you considered your power rape because it affected only the body and not the mind do you remember saying that requiem he frowned but finally whispered yes if i take you like this its rape and i wont do it i watched the emotions struggle across his face anita i do not know how to break these soft chains once love was strong enough to break them but without love let me be covered in your silken chains tie me down and let me drown in your sweet flesh he moved in for a kiss as he said the last and i had to pull back i slid off the bed away from him i wanted to run screaming with frustration i had not meant to do this fuck if another master had bespelled requiem what would you do ma petite jeanclaude said i thought about it frowning i would try to break the spell i would use my necromancy and try to break the spell exactement but i did it i cant break my own spell can i why can you not i thought about it again because well it is not your necromancy that has bespelled him ma petite but your power through the vampire marks through me use your necromancy to free him as you used your ties to the wolf to free you from marmee noir it made sense but i dont know he spoke softly in my head you broke willie mccoy free of the traveller when he had possessed willies body you used your necromancy to drive him out willie was one of our least powerful vampires he was manager at the laughing corpse our comedy club the traveller was one of the vampire council he had come to town in person except that he traveled by jumping from body to body he could use any vampire body that wasnt strong enough to keep him out he had possessed willie and tried to use him to hurt me i had used my blood and my tie to willie to find him in the dark where the traveller had hidden him find him and bring him back to himself i thought carefully because i was still not that good at the mindtomind thing id accidentally raised willie from his coffin during the day once i already had a tie to him that i dont have to requiem he whispered through my mind through the ardeur you have a bond to him that you did not have with willie how can i use necromancy to break him free of the ardeur if im counting on the ardeur to be his bond to me that doesnt make any sense perhaps the logic is a bit circular but what do you have to lose ma petite he spoke aloud finally look at him i pressed as much of me against as much of jeanclaude as i could then turned and looked at requiem he watched us like a man who was dying of thirst and was only inches away from a cool soothing pool but there was a glass wall between him and it i finally realized something its not just the ardeur hes craving its the blood hes hurt and he needs blood jeanclaude ran his hands up and down my back in soothing motions oui but the ardeur overrides the other thirst i thought that wasnt possible i said i have seen it with belle i have seen her give ardeur to vampires while they neglected their blood hunger to the point where one night they did not rise from their coffins she did it on purpose i said she wished to see if the ardeur alone was enough to sustain other vampires she had hoped to travel with us across europe but the marks of blood taking give us away the ardeur leaves no trace i stared at requiem nothing physical oui there are signs but nothing the authorities would have recognized nothing that would have given away her plan but it didnt work i said she could share her ardeur with others so they could feed upon it she could sustain herself with it for long periods as can i but unless the ardeur is truly your gift to own then it does not work the travellerhe stopped me with a hand on my mouth he spoke in my head again quietly ma petite i thought you said no mindtomind that some of the other vamp masters might overhear us they are still dead to the world but the people in this room can hear us you dont trust them i would not like to have it well known that you were able to force a member of the council to do anything he had a point i thought slowly carefully the traveller was taking blood from me when i called willie i called him with the blood then feed our requiem i wasnt sure that was a good idea hes fed from me once what if drinking my blood is part of the problem asher thinks that any vampire who feeds from me is drawn to me you are very tasty ma petite its not just that its something more we want our vampires bound to us ma petite that is why we bloodoath them we simply do not wish them bound to this level of slavishness i was close enough in his head to feel that he believed that he did not like to see requiem this bespelled youre almost as creeped out by this as i am why this strengthens our power base right perhaps but i did not invite requiem or anyone into my lands so i could enslave them i wanted to give them shelter not chains auggie said you were too sentimental for your own good sometimes out loud he said perhaps but you have taught me that sentiment is not always a bad thing i stared up at that impossibly beautiful face and felt love swell up inside me like a physical force it filled my body swelling upward until it made my chest ache my throat tighten and my eyes burn it sounded so stupid but i loved him loved all of him but loved him more because loving me had made him better that he would say that i had taught him about being sentimental made me want to cry richard reminded me at every turn that i was bloodthirsty and cold if that were true then i couldnt have taught jeanclaude about sentimentality you cant learn if you dont have it to teach he kissed me he kissed me softly with one hand lost in the hair to the side of my face he drew back and whispered i never thought to see that look upon your face not for me i love you i said and touched his hand where it lay against my face i know that but there are different kinds of love ma petite they are equally real buthe smiled and said such soft tenderness i thought you had reserved for others what others i asked because i couldnt leave it alone he gave me a chiding look as if i knew the answer to the question and i guess i did i knew richard was almost desperately jealous of micah and nathaniel but for the first time i realized jeanclaude was jealous too and jealousy always hurts i was sorry i ever made him doubt how much i loved him he would never hold my hand in a delivery room or vacuum a floor but within the parameters of his life i could ask anything of him i dont mean to interrupt this little lovefest london said in a tone of voice that said clearly he did want to interrupt and maybe be cruel on top of it but could you try to free requiem or did you not mean to free him and it was all just talk london elinore said with a warning in that single word i am allowed my cynicism elinore i have been disappointed too many times in too many different masters havent we all wicked said truth just nodded i frowned at all of them and suddenly even cuddling with jeanclaude wasnt quite as comforting thanks guys no performance anxiety here we do not mean to make things more difficult for you truth said but like most vampires who have not spent their entire existence with one master we have been ridden hard and cruelly by those who were supposed to take care of us the idea of the feudal system is that the people at the top take care of the needs of those on the bottom but i have seldom seen it work that way wicked said yeah i said its like trickledown economics it only works if the people at the top are really good decent people the system is only as good as the people in power the brothers nodded as if id said a wise thing maybe i had i laid a kiss on jeanclaudes bare chest caressing the slicker skin of the crossshaped burn mark i drew away from him and went for the bed i prayed as i walked toward requiem let him be free but dont let me hurt him i told requiem to lie down on the bed and he did without hesitation elinore was right he was like a human hit by a vampires gaze i knelt beside him the robe tucked up under my knees tied close around my waist i stared down at him and wondered if there was anything i could ask him to do that he would refuse was there really no limit to it id seen humans rolled by vampires who had turned on their friends in the blink of an eye and tried to kill people they loved would requiem have killed for me for no reason than that i asked it of him i wanted to know and i didnt i looked at jeanclaude is this just about sex or would he do anything i asked like a human rolled by a vamp i do not know ma petite if you never plan to do this on purpose what does it matter london asked and he let me hear all the distrust in those words i didnt really blame him i wouldnt do it to any of our people on purpose but sometimes im on my own in a nest of vamps that im supposed to kill they get testy about stuff like that im just wondering if i could raise the ardeur as a weapon is there a way to make it an asset instead of a disaster london frowned at me but said i dont believe you anita london elinore said never use that tone again with her ive seen what the ardeur can do elinore you havent not really his face tightened in lines of anger so raw it almost hurt to see it ive seen my face look like requiems i remember what it feels like his hands gripped the bedpost until the skin changed color just a bit the mottling would be more after he fed the wood creaked in protest and he dropped his hands part of me still wants to feel like that its like being on a drug all the time being pleasantly high pleasantly happy it may not be real happiness but its hard to tell the difference when youre in the middle of it he hugged himself tight the world is a colder darker place without it but with it youre a slave a slave to someone who makes you do thingshe shook his head so hard it looked dizzying maybe london should go before i start this i said no he said no if i cant bear to watch you feed the ardeur on someone else then i need to find a new master and a new city if i cant bear this then i need to go somewhere where no one carries the ardeur jeanclaude is your master london you will need his permission to leave elinore said we have already discussed it jeanclaude said when i asked he is an addict ma petite an addict to the ardeur i saved him from belle morte who would have addicted him again but london and i discussed that even your ardeur and mine might be too much for him if it is he gave that graceful shrug i will find him some place far away from such temptations but it will take time to find a home for someone as potentially powerful as london especially someone with his bloodline and male if he were female there is a waiting list but not for men i said non ma petite the female masters seem convinced they would become bespelled by males of our bloodline the male masters seem convinced they could master the women of our line well isnt that just typical i said i looked back at london if this gets to be too much for you promise me youll leave why do you care i raised a hand before elinore could chastise him again because im going to have enough trouble freeing requiems mind i dont want to have to do it twice today he nodded i swear to you that i will leave if i feel it is too much the look on his face was very solemn with none of that dark defiance or anger i took a deep breath and turned back to the man on the bed he gave me peaceful eager eyes it was as if the lamb wanted you to slit its throat i moved up beside him so i could touch the unbruised side of his face i cupped his face and he leaned into that touch eyes closing for a moment as if that one innocent touch was almost too much to bear i called to him requiem requiem come back to me he laid his hand against mine pressing me tighter against his face i am right here anita right here i shook my head because this wasnt him it was his body but whatever made requiem who he was that wasnt in his eyes it was a strangers face what makes people people is not just bone structure and eye color but the force of their personalities the years of experience painted on their faces them for lack of a better word them oh requiem come back to us he gazed up at me so puzzled he didnt understand that he was lost i closed my own eyes so i could concentrate and not have to see his eyes so trusting and empty my necromancy was unlike any other power i had maybe because it was mine whatever the reason i didnt have to decide to use my necromancy i just had to stop fighting it stop blocking the power blocking my necromancy was like making a fist tightclenched squeezing squeezing so hard so the power didnt get away from me i spread that metaphorical fist wide let go all that effort and the necromancy just was before with auggie there had been so much happening so many different powers that it had distracted me but now there was nothing but the necromancy it felt so good to finally let go so amazingly good i opened my eyes and stared down at requiem come to me i said come to me he rose up off the bed arms reaching for me i put a finger on his chest and said requiem stop he stopped instantly as if he were some sort of toy hit one switch and he goes another and he turns off sweet mary mother of god this was so wrong ma petite ma petite have a care i turned and glanced at jeanclaude im a little busy here i said and couldnt keep the impatience out of my voice i would be more specific with your calls if i were you you told only requiem to stop the others are still compelled he motioned at the other vampires london had a death grip on the bedpost he looked panicked wicked and truth were fighting at the edge of the bed truth wanted to get on and wicked was holding his brother back truth looked scared and wicked looked angry i found elinore standing by her chair holding on to it as if only the chairs weight kept her from coming to me i felt myself go pale i didnt mean your necromancy has gained in power ma petite as have your beasts be more specific on your orders use his name i looked at elinore if i called you would you have to come to me she swallowed hard enough for me to hear it i would fight but the compulsion would be strong i am not yet a master of the city as you must be of a certain level of power to rule a city so the ruling of it and the oaths that are taken the magic that binds gains a vampire more power i do not have those ties yet so i i am not augustine or samuel i think if you forced the issue it would be difficult it was my turn to swallow we are all bloodoathed to jeanclaude london said through gritted teeth i think her call is stronger for her ties to him truth broke from his brother and went to the chair by the fireplace he strode to it and hid his face in his hands wicked turned back to me he wanted to go to you we are both bloodoathed to jeanclaude why was my brother more drawn to your call he fed on ma petite when he oathed to us jeanclaude said you took my blood i told you when you brought him over that i had to be brought over in exactly the same way you assured me that it wouldnt matter he gestured angrily toward his brother this matters requiem wrapped his arms around me and laid a kiss upon my neck he was bending his stomach to do it didnt it hurt i said the only thing i could think of i didnt know we must always be bound the same wicked said we must always be the same it is our strength it is who we are whatever you have done to him you must do to me or undo to him i nodded ill try im beginning to understand why we used to kill necromancers on sight london said is that a threat jeanclaude said voice mild no no master but i understood what london meant requiem licked along my neck and that one touch made me shiver just a little requiem stop touching me he froze against me but he was still touching me he simply stopped kissing and licking me i guess id have to be careful how i worded things i had to find requiem not just a vampire or the dead i needed him his individual self id done something similar once in the church of eternal life when the police and i were searching for a vampire murder suspect id sought the flavor of one person and that had been someone i hadnt known i knew requiem i was holding him i wrapped my arms around him moved all that thick hair to one side so i could bury my face in the bend of his neck i breathed in the scent of his skin he didnt smell warm i could smell his cologne the soap he used his shampoo but underneath all of it was the faint smell of death not of corpses and rot because vampires did not do that but the scent of longclosed rooms vaguely like the smell of snakes musty not warm nothing that you could cuddle yet his arms were strong the edges of his wounds on the one arm catching in the silk of my robe he was real but he wasnt exactly alive i held him close and pushed my necromancy into the body i held pushed it carefully just into this one body nowhere else i searched not for this befuddled stranger but for that spark that was truly requiem i found him in the dark inside himself he wasnt afraid but softly confused lost i called to him i felt him look up hear me but he could not come i could see his prison touch the door gaze at him through the bars but i did not have the key then i realized what we needed blood no matter what type of undead youre dealing with blood is usually the key i rose up from his neck and swept my own hair to the side feed requiem feed from me he showed me a face with eyes wide with shock as if he couldnt believe i would let him do it but he didnt ask me to repeat the order his hand wrapped in my hair his other hand at my back he pressed me tight against him holding my neck to the side and he brought me down to him for he was sitting and i kneeling he brought my neck down to his mouth the way you would do for a kiss he could not roll me with his eyes and he didnt try there would be nothing to change the pain to pleasure i felt him tense and i tried to relaxed but you never relax you tense up just a bit and it hurts more he bit me fangs sinking in pain sharp enough to make me push at his shoulders as i tried to get away i just couldnt take that much pain out of the box without pushing against it i felt him begin to drink me down his throat convulsing swallowing something that could be so erotic and it just fucking hurt like this but it was just like beheading a chicken to raise a zombie or spreading blood on a vampires lips to heal him it was blood with a purpose and i sent my magic down with that blood i used it to call requiem used it to find him in the dark and set him free he drew back from my throat gasping as if hed been running there was blood on his lower lip as he stared up at me one moment he still looked dazed the next he spilled into his eyes they flared with blue fire with that hint of turquoise in the center his power danced over my skin like a cold prickling breeze i am here anita you have cleared my mind what would you have of me i moved back from his arms touching my neck and came away with blood remus was already sending the young guard cisco to the bathroom for gauze and tape i wanted you free and yourself weve got that he shook his head and winced as if only now did the bruises hurt he leaned back against the mounded pillows favoring his stomach and chest holding his injured arm carefully it was like being on drugs nothing hurt that badly when you touched me i am free but everything hurts isnt that always the way i said but i smiled he was himself again i looked around at the other vampires i looked at elinore still gripping the back of her chair i felt her felt her as if she were a flavor of ice cream that i could have put in a cone and licked mostly vanilla but with chocolate chips i looked at london not vanilla definitely something darker chunkier full of hard crunchy bits wicked filled my mind like icing chocolate icing to spread on skin and lick clean i shook my head at the imagery and looked for truth still huddling by the fireplace something fresh and clean strawberries maybe strawberry ice cream to melt down the skin and be licked away so you could suck the cold around the nipples anita and it was jeanclaudes voice anita you must stop this he never called me anita it made me look at him why cant i taste you i asked because i am your master and not a toy for your power the look on his face frightened me because he was frightened i licked dry lips and said i guess this answers the question i dont touch anyone elses vampires no he said no he was at the edge of the bed now shut it down it took me a second to realize what he meant my necromancy i needed to turn it off again i closed my eyes and drew it back in i drew in tight and tighter closed and squeezed that metaphysical fist tight and hard but it was like the hand wasnt big enough to hold it all now i could squeeze it down but it leaked through as if the fingers were trying to hold sand no not true i didnt want to stop it felt so good to wander through the vampires better than playing with zombies the moment i realized i was the one letting the fist leak i was able to shut it down it almost hurt but i did it i could do it but i wondered if there would come a day when there was so much power that i wouldnt be able to shut it down completely i needed to talk to my magical mentor marianne about that sooner rather than later i opened my eyes and said hows that good he said but his voice was not happy that was frightening elinore said i felt your power as if you were licking along my skin myshe shivered not in a happy way sorry i said you could roll me london said roll me the way i can roll a human you could i felt it you must undo to my brother what you have done to him wicked said or bind me as you bind him i nodded well discuss it later okay ive got a full plate today you promised me wicked said i sighed look i didnt know that taking blood from me instead of jeanclaude would be that big a deal okay im doing the best i can here wicked truth was dying when i offered him blood i saved his life if i remember correctly so stop being so pissy about it i was getting angry because i felt guilty and that almost always led to anger for me anita can work on your problem another day requiem said today is mine something in the way he said it made me look at him he lay like he hurt but the look on his face wasnt about pain it was almost anticipatory what are you thinking requiem i asked that you still need to feed the ardeur in front of all these good people i shook my head i dont think thats a good idea the test is to see what will happen if you feed the ardeur in front of our visitors you know not to use your necromancy in front of them now but this question has not been decided i nodded yeah i think it has im with anita on this one london said no ardeur in front of the guests no anything much in front of the other masters that is not your call to make elinore said do you think im wrong he asked no one answered so i did no youre not wrong my powers are too unpredictable to use in public right now i just have to shield like a son of a bitch perhaps you can control the necromancy to that degree but the ardeur is not broken to bit and bridle yet requiem said she just freed you wicked said how can you want her to enslave you again i dont want to be enslaved but i do want her to feed i want it more than ive wanted anything in a very long time i looked at jeanclaude is he free or not you called me back so i could choose anita i looked at requiem i dont understand you said you would never feed the ardeur on me again unless i broke free and could choose you said it would be like rape unless i could choose i wasnt sure youd remember everything i said i remember he said i think its too dangerous to feed the ardeur on you you swore that you would feed from me if i broke free i have broken free i broke you free are you certain of that are you certain that my will did not help you some little bit i started to say no then hesitated i dont know then i choose for you to feed i was shaking my head feed anita feed upon my flesh drink deep of my will until it doth spill upon your body like blood youre not thinking clearly i started to get off the bed he grabbed my arm in one of those tooquicktosee movements he winced showed that it had cost him i have not made the choice you would make if our places were reversed i have not said what you wished me to say but i have chosen let go of me requiem he looked at me and smiled i do not wish to and i am free not to obey i fought to come back because you said only if i did only then would you feed from me would you deny me now that i have fought the battle and won what if one feeding undoes it what if the ardeur consumes you again if i am never again to be consumed by love then what better than to be consumed by the ardeur you sound like a junkie whos had another taste after a long dry spell my heart has died twice once when my mortal life ceased and the second when ligeia was taken from me i have felt nothing for so very long anita you make me feel again he sat up drew me in toward him i put a hand on his chest missing the knife wound by fractions the ardeur makes you feel again he touched my face with his wounded hand no there is something about you that has awakened my heart i had a panicked feeling he was about to profess undying love maybe jeanclaude did too because he moved forward and laid a hand on my arm requiem kept his wounded hand against my cheek but let go of my arm he reached out to jeanclaude laid his hand against the other mans waist i knew he couldnt feel much through the thick robe but it was still the most intimate gesture id ever seen him make toward jeanclaude always before your ardeur tasted of hers jeanclaude he wasnt talking about me he meant belle morte because her without appellation always meant belle for them last night jeanclaude you did not taste of her you tasted of no ones power but your own i knew you were a sourdre de sang but until last night you were still a planet circling the sun of belle mortes power last night you became the sun and she the moon belle was the moon i said he looked at me smiling no anita you were the moon the moons an arrant thief and her pale fire she snatches from the sun youre quoting something i said shakespeare ma petite hes quoting timon of athens havent read that one i said my pulse was in my throat and it was making blood trickle from the wounds hed made in my neck i dont need to feed the ardeur right now requiem and with everything going all weird i think ill wait until i have to feed that is sense requiem london said requiem gazed at the other vampire would you wait with permission london said i would like to leave the room go jeanclaude said london didnt run for the door but he didnt stroll either hell if i could have run from it i would have but you cant run from yourself any who wish to go go jeanclaude said the test will not work if we are not here elinore said the test is over we are too dangerous and we know it elinore didnt argue she just walked out wicked took his brother by the arm and led him out truth seemed to be weeping what do you want us to do remus asked guard us if you can we can guard you he said sounding slightly offended that jeanclaude doubted it can you guard us from ourselves jeanclaude asked i dont understand remus said cisco had the gauze and tape he stood by the bed as if unsure what to do with the bandages i touched my neck and came away with a little blood but it had been a clean bite it wouldnt bleed all that much not if it had been done right and knowing requiem it had been do you need antiseptic cisco asked remus came to the bed impatient you treat anita like another shapeshifter oh cisco said he started to set the firstaid supplies on the bed then hesitated as if he didnt want to put them between requiem and me he was still wearing a gun but the confident guard had vanished replaced by an awkward eighteenyearold give her some gauze so she can hold it against the wound remus said the bandage is mostly to keep the cleanup to a minimum not really for the wound cisco nodded like he understood but he held the gauze out to me with his eyes nowhere near my face in fact he was sort of studiously trying not to look at me i finally realized part of his problem more of my chest was showing than when id started requiems feeding had moved the front of the robe around so that a lot of breast was showing not all not more than a really low neckline would show but it was distracting him he was both trying not to stare at my chest and staring at it as he warred with himself i pressed the gauze to the bite and closed my robe up with the other hand id need two hands to retie so all i could do was hold the robe closed that let cisco know id noticed what hed been doing he suddenly met my eyes and he was embarrassed it showed in the almost panic in his own eyes and the dark blush that crawled up his neck the panic turned to anger and he looked away as if id seen too far into his soul remus took the firstaid stuff from him go to the coffin room and tell nazareth to send someone to take your place on this detail cisco protested why youre staring at her chest shes not a piece of ass kid when youre on the job youre on the fucking job you can notice shes pretty but you dont stare you dont get distracted im sorry remus it wont happen again no it wont remus said go to the coffin room please remus i gave you an order cisco follow it cisco lowered his head not a bow but dejection the gesture itself at something so small said how young he was but he didnt argue again he went for the door when it closed behind him remus turned to me are you still bleeding i let go of the gauze it stayed in place pasted there by blood hard to tell i said he started to touch the gauze then stopped letting his hand drop to his side i actually looked down to make sure my chest was completely covered nothing was showing so why did remus seem as reluctant as cisco to touch me can you take the gauze away he asked i didnt argue just pulled it off it didnt hurt to move it so i wasnt bleeding that badly good turn your head to the side so i can see he added please i did what he asked which put me watching jeanclaude he looked way too solemn for comfort whats wrong now i asked are you so ashamed of us that you would hide our mark of favor under bandages and tape i frowned at him what are you talking about remus touched more gauze to my neck can you hold it in place while i get tape i put my hand up to the gauze automatically jeanclaude motioned at my hand at remus who had his back mostly to the other man remus moved in to tape the gauze in place i stopped him with a hand on his arm he stepped back immediately out of reach the tape still in his fingers i glanced up at his face but he wouldnt give me a direct look so i didnt know what was in his eyes hed stepped back like id hurt him i hadnt i turned away from the guard to jeanclaude remuss problems were remuss problem not mine i had enough problems you mean why am i bandaging the bite he nodded i always bandage the bites pourquoi he asked why i opened my mouth closed it and thought about it its a wound it usually pierces a vein or artery you smear antiseptic on it and slap a bandage on it to keep it from getting infected have you ever known a vampire bite to become infected he asked i frowned and thought about it it took me nearly a minute to say no why is that ma petite because vampires have a natural antiseptic in their saliva vampires actually have fewer types of bacteria in their saliva than the average human you are quoting now he said i nodded and stopped because the bite was a little tight it didnt exactly hurt but it let me know it was there yeah they had an article in the animator some doctor actually wondered why vampire bites dont get infected like an ordinary human bite or an animal bite theyve known for a while that you guys have an anticoagulant in your saliva but this was the first study on other properties of vampire saliva so i ask again why are you hiding our mark of favor i thought about it then shrugged habit i took the gauze off the bite mark it had two small round red circles on it but it had almost stopped bleeding they usually did unless you were cut up a violent vamp bite was more like a dog bite it bled the two neat holes stopped sooner than youd think and rarely rebled without the wound being reopened id known vampire junkies who tried to hide their habit by having a vampire bite the same wound several times it didnt really work if you knew enough about vamps to know what a bite should look like but it fooled the tourists or the boss at work on monday repeated trauma to an area is still repeated trauma and that was one of the few times outside of violent attacks when a vamp bite started to bruise and tear i handed the used gauze to remus who took it gingerly from me as if he didnt want to touch my fingers i dont need the bandages thanks anyway remus jeanclaude came to me smiling he touched the bite delicately coming away with minute drops of blood on his fingertips he lifted them to his mouth and i knew what he was going to do before he licked so delicately i watched him lick my blood off his fingertips and wasnt sure how i felt about it i didnt enjoy it i didnt not enjoy it i felt neutral about what hed done but why had he done it he usually went out of his way not to spook me not to be too vampiric he leaned over me put his hands delicately around my face and tried to raise me up for a kiss normally i would have met him hallway but i didnt do it this time i stayed sitting forcing him to bend down for me i kept my hand on the robe holding it in place and watched him bend lower he stopped just before he would have kissed me and drew back enough so i could see his face clearly you have kissed me many times with the taste of your sweet blood upon my lips but now i see reluctance on your face feel it in your body why he searched my face though i knew he could drop his shields and know exactly what i was thinking maybe he was afraid of what hed find why hed asked because hed licked my blood off his fingers id kissed him when hed come directly off my vein id kissed him when one mouth or the other had gotten nicked on his fangs id learned to think of a little sweet copper taste as almost an aphrodisiac because id begun to associate it with him and others even richard liked a little taste of blood he hated that he liked it but he did jeanclaude drew back letting my face slide between his hands as he stood a look of such sadness came over his face i grabbed his arm dont dont what ma petite dont stop hiding what i am i cannot be human ma petite not even for you i thought the worst of playing human for each other you and i was the crippling of our power but that is not what hurts my heart i let go of his arm i didnt want to ask the next question but i knew i had to or be branded a coward i swallowed hard enough that it hurt and asked what hurts your heart it was a whisper but i asked it brownie points for me that you turn away from me for such a small thing i licked your blood off my fingertips and now you will not kiss me i would have kissed you he shook his head but you did not wish to that i couldnt argue with part of me wished i could have part of me didnt what do you want me to say i asked i want you and richard to embrace yourselves and i am out of time to await this miracle what does that mean i asked you promised to feed the ardeur from requiem if he fought free of your power will you go back on your word i glanced at the other vampire lying on the mounded pillows then back to jeanclaude the ardeur hasnt risen for either of us yet i think we should use the time we have before it does to plan strategy strategy for what ma petite this is not a battle of guns and knives this is battle of a softer sort though no less dangerous in the end i was shaking my head and felt the first little trickle of blood down my throat it wasnt the shaking that was making me bleed a little more but the fact that my pulse was speeding up we are not going to feed the ardeur before we have to your power rises and you are more like belle morte requiem said and he sounded sad i glanced at him what are you talking about requiem answered belle used to promise to feed the ardeur on us then say she had not meant right this moment but later always later later could be very late indeed when she wished to play cruel games im not playing i said im scared if you feed from him and he becomes besotted again then you cannot feed off any of the pomme de sang candidates we will show them requiems state of mind and tell them you have grown too powerful for such games and if he doesnt fall under my spell again i asked then you may taste some of the candidates without sex i was shaking my head the ardeur is growing ma petite you must accept that what we have seen today and last night proves that pretending will no longer work im not pretending i said you are pretending pretending what i asked i am sorry ma petite so sorry but we must accept the truth i had crawled to the foot of the bed blood was trickling down my throat like tickling fingers i was so scared i could taste metal on my tongue i dont know what youre talking about you are succubus to my incubus ma petite you feed as a vampire feeds but on sex instead of blood i know that i said and sounded angry because i didnt want to sound scared you say you know but you know here and he touched his forehead not here and touched his heart you do not truly believe you are vampire im not a vampire not in the traditional sense non but only because you have damian and nathaniel to draw upon without them to draw energy from when you did not feed the ardeur in a timely fashion your own body would feel the weakness you went for years without feeding the ardeur for real the old master of st louis wouldnt let you feed the ardeur not completely oui nikolaos feared what i would become if she allowed my powers full rein the master of the city that traded me to her feared me as well he sent me to nikolaos because he knew that her childs body would not be something i would willingly seduce she looked about twelve or thirteen thats legal in some places he shook his head not for me he said then he shivered you met her ma petite could you ever see me purposefully doing anything to draw her attention to me in that way i shook my head no she was creepy as hell and not in a fun way he nodded oui creepy will do as an appellation though there are other words he shook his head as if to clear his mind from such thoughts if you were a different woman one of more casual lusts then your being succubus to my incubus would not be a hardship you would simply feed from whomever you wished you are human so your use of vampire trickery is not illegal not true i said it is illegal to use magic or psychic ability to induce or bespell into sexual acts its looked on like a daterape drug he nodded i had not realized the law had been broadened to include that i shrugged i keep track of the new laws part of my job he nodded again but still ma petite there are many who would come eagerly to your body you would not lack for food if you were willing to feed on strangers i frowned at him he gave a small smile do not frown so ma petite i know you do not do casual in fact you are the least casual person that i have ever met so serious you are so deadly serious about everything is that a complaint i asked no but it is the truth i nodded and put a hand to my throat to try to stop the blood from getting onto the silk robe i looked for remus gauze please or this will have to be drycleaned remus handed the gauze over without a word i tried to stop the blood but my pulse was pushing it out i couldnt seem to calm myself enough to slow my pulse so much for the meditation practice id been working on whats your point i asked that you need food that you know and are comfortable with a pomme de sang is never meant to be the only food for a vampire it is more like food you always know is on hand but it is assumed that the vampire will feed off many humans casually feed you mean oui i dont do casual sorry true and that is why the pomme de sang candidates are even more important for you than for a normal vampire im not following you i said you must pick pommes de sang and other food you must choose enough food that you are not a danger to others youre babbling he came around the bed so he could touch me but i moved out of reach if you bespell requiem again then you cannot seek a pomme de sang among our visitors your food will have to be chosen even more carefully and quietly behind the scenes from the very few masters i trust but it would be better to do it now while we have so many willing princesses for our prince charming because choose you must ma petite choose you must i thought the whole pomme de sang choosing was a trick to make everyone behave nobody wants to piss off their prospective inlaws that sort of thing anita my name not good we must know how dangerous you are before augustine wakes for the day if you can feed from requiem and not bespell him then you can free augustine but if requiem is not free then he and augustine will be like humans that we have let go but we know that we can call them to us at any time we take away our mind spell to please the human police but we know which ones are so deeply ours that we can still whisper through their dreams we can still call them he stood at the foot of the bed letting me see how scared he was but under that fear was eagerness if we can control this then we are powerful beyond my wildest dreams if we cannot control this then we are dangerous beyond my deepest fears if requiem falls to the ardeur again then we must cancel everything i dare not even take you to the ballet among so many vampires and if requiem is okay then it is controllable incredibly powerful but controllable it is something our enemies and allies will fear and lust after but they will not fear us too much or lust too greatly it is the difference between having a weapon that one can use and one that you dare never use like nuclear bombs i said he nodded oui i frowned at him define feed the ardeur he made a sound that was half tsk and half throat sound feed feed ma petite he is not ugly feed upon him completely no tasting no holding back feed and if he can withstand it then the ballet tonight goes on the party after i looked behind me to requiem he was trying for a neutral look and failing let me test my understanding you want me to make love to another man and feed the ardeur off him yes he said if ronnie had been there shed have shot herself or maybe shot me i wasnt planning on keeping requiem this was supposed to be like a onenight stand but i didnt believe it id never had sex with anyone just once i cant do another permanent man in my life jeanclaude i cant think of him as you think of jason what did he call himself your fuck buddy i raised my eyebrows at him then turned and looked at requiem did you hear that i did do you understand what the term means it means someone who is your friend that you sometimes have sex with but it is not a relationship though i prefer the term fib for it fib i made it a question friends in bed fib prettier i said fine you okay with just being my friend in bed your heart speaks to others anita i know this my heart speaks to no one else but this is not a matter of hearts but a matter of flesh and blood he held his hand out to me come to me anita please i have thrown off your silken chains for this chance to be with you do not deny me maybe it was the way requiem talked all poetry and so emotional sounding i was a modern girl i wasnt used to it jeanclaude could talk pretty when he wanted to but he was my serious sweetie and hearing it from someone who was supposed to be casual just didnt ring right it was as if the words didnt match the situation how could you talk about silken chains if you werent serious fuck buddies didnt say things like that did they of course my experience with the whole concept of fuck buddies was pretty limited so maybe i was just wrong wrong about so many things i stared at requiem and felt nothing he was pretty but pretty had never been enough for me i was almost perfectly happy in parts of my personal life for the first time in a long time i did not want to screw that up and id learned that every new addition had a chance of blowing it all skyhigh requiem let his arm fall you simply do not want me do you he sounded sad and more lost than when id rolled him i dont know what i would have said because the door opening saved me asher glided in as if his feet werent quite touching the ground under the golden satin robe his hair spread out around the robe putting the shiny cloth to shame by contrast he glanced at the bed and flashed a wide smile oh good im in time to watch i gave him an unfriendly look he shrugged and smiled way too pleased with himself elinore has filled me in on whats been happening in here when i woke early i realized that if i was awake then so was meng die that stopped us all made us all turn to him remus actually stepped away from the wall as if hed go running asher waved him back shes still in the coffin though she does want out shes agreed to behave herself she vowed she would kill me or scar me so badly that anita would not want me requiem said asher went to jeanclaude where he still stood by the bed he hugged the other man from behind laying his head on jeanclaudes shoulder so that his scarred cheek was bare to the light yes i was there when she made that particular threat she looked at me and said shed forgotten that anita liked scars his face tried for neutral when he said it but failed a flash of anger flared through the paleness of his eyes making them flicker for a second like icy sapphires caught in light jeanclaude hugged his arm where it lay across his chest he leaned his face against the top of ashers hair and said how did you get meng die to see reason she said for such power as she felt when you did augustine she would play virgin theres always another lover but this kind of power is rare i looked at the two of them standing there the light and the dark entwined i realized in that moment that i had never seen asher enter a room and simply go to jeanclaude and touch him like that i had never seen them hug let alone more they touched but it was seldom this deliberate did they touch like this when i wasnt around did they do more did i care maybe but did it bother me more that they were lovers or that they were doing it behind my back doing it without me jeanclaude pulled away from him asher held on for a moment then let him go with a flash of annoyance on his face but he didnt fight to stay closer he simply let jeanclaude move a little closer to the bed and me i wanted to say you dont have to hide but i wasnt sure about it i wasnt sure how id feel watching them act all loveydovey around each other but the thought that they couldnt touch in front of me bothered me too i sighed and hung my head god i was confused even in my own head without any help from anyone i felt the bed move and looked up to find requiem getting off the bed he stood carefully showing how much he hurt but he stood straight his pale untouched back military straight like most of the older vampires they came from a time when good posture was beaten into you sometimes literally where are you going i asked he turned his whole body rather than just his head as if he knew that it would have hurt to do it otherwise i see how you watch asher and jeanclaude i said that you do not want me and you do not it is plain in your face in your lack of reaction to me the irony cuts deep anita so many women have wanted me over the centuries but i did not want them now it is my turn to burn and be unquenched non jeanclaude said you are not going requiem motioned with his good hand see her face taste her lack of pulse her body does not respond to me she does not even see me in that way anita sees you or youd have never gotten to feed the ardeur twice for her asher said he walked wide around jeanclaude to climb onto the bed with me there was a look in his face that i hadnt seen before it was eager almost angry but not unhappy he touched my face and his hand was cool to the touch he hadnt fed i woke before noon today for the first time since i died he leaned in toward me as if for a kiss so much power running through my veins even without blood i feel wonderful he stopped with his mouth just above mine so close that it seemed wrong not to close the distance and kiss so i did i meant it to be a goodmorning kiss good but not too sexual but it takes two people to keep a kiss chaste and asher wasnt feeling the least bit chaste he explored my mouth with lips and tongue i melted into that kiss i danced my tongue over the dainty points of his fangs slid between them deeper into his mouth he pressed us together hands urgent on my body one hand undid the sash of my robe the nude fronts of our bodies were suddenly touching i didnt even know when hed undone his own robe only that the naked press of our bodies drove my hands under his open robe to slide along the smooth skin of his back and buttocks when i cupped the tight smoothness of his ass he drew back enough to see my face whatever he saw there painted a fierce look across his own his voice came harsh and breathless let me feed i just said yes he wrapped his hand in my hair hard enough for it to hurt just a little that little bit of hurting made me gasp but it wasnt just the pain it was the feeling that with that one harsh grasp he could expose my neck and hold me exposed while he fed i might never have admitted it aloud but there was something about a little bit of force that just flat did it for me asher dug his hand deeper into my hair jerked brought a cry from me it wasnt exactly a cry of pain his free hand found my wrists held them behind my back while my robe slipped down my shoulders he stretched my head to the side so that i could no longer see his face i saw us reflected in the fulllength mirror on the other side of the room my robe had fallen like a dark frame around the paleness of my body the robe covered our hands and not much more it looked in the mirror like my hands were bound the sight of it made me strain to be free and asher tightened his grip bruising my wrists just a little just enough to let me know i couldnt get away i trusted him trusted him enough to let him trap me movement in the mirror and i saw jeanclaude reflected there his own robe was tight in place but his eyes glowed with midnight blue fire the audience is a little large for ma petite shes not objecting asher said and do you not find that strange jeanclaude asked asher seemed to struggle to think then finally said i do not know i cant seem to think with her here in my arms he looked out into the room their presence seems to make it harder to think the guards or just certain guards jeanclaude asked remus and he looked to the far corner of the room and the new one and what of pepito do you sense him as strongly ashers body began to relax against me i didnt want that i wanted him to feed needed him to feed dont stop i said please dont stop asher looked down at me with those glowing eyes he seemed to be searching my face for some sign you wish me to take you here with the guards watching of course i did yes i said yes god yes he looked at jeanclaude something is wrong wrong and right jeanclaude said he came to the edge of the bed you have possessed her completely you could do what you wished with her but when she sobered then she would never forgive you asher turned back to me whatever he saw there calmed him tore the light from his eyes anita are you in there the question made no sense at first then i said i am here asher right here some part of me heard me say it and thought id heard that phrase before i closed my eyes tried to not see ashers face it helped to look away i knew where id heard the words now requiem i was echoing requiem when id rolled his mind asher had rolled me before but not like this never like this remembering requiem helped me think but closing my eyes helped more i was too big a fish for ashers gaze to keep but staring into his eyes had lost me myself id stared into augustines eyes and not been swept away so how did ashers gaze rate higher than a couple of thousand years of master of the city i was supposed to be immune to vampire gaze my necromancy and jeanclaudes marks should have kept me safe asher let go of my wrists i felt him move back from me i opened my eyes and reached for my robe drawing it back around me whats happening i asked jeanclaude spoke from beside the bed are you yourself ma petite i think so i glanced up at ashers face but he turned away the spill of golden hair hiding his face look at me asher i did not mean to bespell you with my gaze i did not even know that my gaze could capture you its never been able to before i said i looked at jeanclaude what is happening i was as bespelled as requiem before i freed him non you were able to fight free once you realized what had happened yes but why did it happen in the first place what just happened and why and dont avoid the question again jeanclaude i mean it he made a gesture that was half bow and half shrug managing to make it both apology and an idontknow gesture not good enough you do know whats going on i know what i believe has happened fine tell us i slipped off the bed so i could tie the robe in place better all our people gained from what we did last night with augustine asher has been a master vampire for a very long time but he has never had many of the masterlevel powers that are taken for granted among many of us his gaze has gone up a few notches i get that i said jeanclaude shook his head now ma petite it is more than that what is ashers greatest vampiric ability i thought about it for a second or two then said his bite is orgasmic jeanclaude gave a small smile that may be his most alluring power for you ma petite but it is not his most powerful i thought harder fascination he makes you fascinated with him once hes fed off you using full power once hes made love to you its like a sort of love spell but it works the way that love spells never work i believe his ability to fascinate has grown in power i glanced at asher who was still sitting on the side of the bed but carefully not looking at me i shook my head and walked closer to him look at me asher please why he asked in a very still voice carefully not looking at me i have to know if your gaze can just roll me or if it happened because i dont protect myself against you he almost glanced at me then but gave me only the perfection of his profile and a wave of shimmering hair what do you mean you do not protect yourself from me i trust you so i dont shield from you i want your power to take me i dont want to fight it but before it was a choice now i need to see if its still a choice or if youve just outgrown me give her the weight of your gaze mon ami let us see asher turned reluctance plain in the way he held his body he gave me a face as blank and unreadable as any id ever seen on him id perfected the art of looking at a vampires face without meeting their gaze years ago i was a little out of practice grown arrogant with power but old skills never truly desert you i studied the curve of his lips then raised my eyes slowly to meet his they were as beautiful as always such a pale pale blue a pure clear blue but pale as a winters dawn i stared into those eyes and felt nothing this wont work unless you try to capture me with your gaze i do not wish to capture you he said softly liar i said he managed to look offended then dont try to kid me asher you like power games entirely too much you love the effect you have on me you love that you can do to me what jeanclaude cant you love the fact that you are the only vamp who can vamp me his face went to cold neutrality i have never said such things to you your body said them for you he licked his lips then an old gesture that he still made when he was nervous what do you want from me anita truth he shook his head and looked solemn you ask for truth a great deal but it is seldom what you truly want id have liked to argue that but i couldnt not and be honest youre right probably more right than i want to know but right now try to capture me with your gaze really try so well know how careful i need to be around you i do not want you to have to be careful around me i shook my head please asher we need to know why so you can hide from me so you can deny me the gaze of your own eyes please asher just do it just try i will ask as a friend jeanclaude said but the next request will be as master do as she asks his voice sounded so sad sad enough that it made me look at him i felt like i was missing something once i would have just ignored the warning in my head but id learned to ask questions am i asking something bad here i mean youre both way too bothered by this am i missing something thats going to come back and bite us on the ass jeanclaude smiled almost laughed ah ma petite how delicately you phrase it yeah yeah just answer the question we fear what your reaction will be if asher can indeed capture you with his gaze i looked from one to the other of them jeanclaudes carefully pleasant face ashers arrogant blankness i caught sight of requiem against the far wall beyond them his face was as blank as theirs but it wasnt pleasant like jeanclaudes or arrogant like ashers he simply tried to show nothing his upper body was still decorated with the wounds meng die had given him for the first time i wondered if i fed the ardeur off him would the wounds heal id healed before with metaphysical sex i frowned and turned back to jeanclaude you had more than one reason for me to feed the ardeur from requiem didnt you you are not going to do it so what does it matter there was the slightest flavor of anger to his words i turned to him the pleasant mask was gone and in its place something close to the arrogance that asher hid behind i know im difficult but lets pretend im not lets pretend that im not a huge pain in the ass just talk to me tell me your reasoning my reasoning about what ma petite i walked toward him talking as i moved all the reasons for me to feed from requiem now all the reasons why youre so nervous about asher being able to capture me with his gaze i was in front of him now and realized that he must have moved back from the bed at some point and i didnt remember him moving away id been too caught up in ashers eyes just tell me i promise not to panic i promise not to run away just talk to me like im a reasonable human being he gave me a look and it was an eloquent look he let me watch thoughts chase over his face but finally he said asher is correct ma petite you ask for truth but you often punish us for telling it i nodded i know and im sorry about that all i know is that ill try to stop being a pain in the ass ill try to listen and not overreact good intentions ma petite but you do know the old saying i nodded again yeah the road to hell is paved with them i know i touched his arm where it lay folded across his chest even his body language had closed down please jeanclaude i feel like we dont have time to play to my insecurities if we crash this weekend with all the other masters here i dont want it to be because you were afraid to be honest with me i dont want the disaster to be my fault okay he uncrossed his arms and touched my face so sincere ma petite what has come over you i thought about that then said it out loud im scared of what i put my hand on his pressing his touch against my face of failing us all just because i didnt want something to be true ma petite that is not it not entirely i looked away from those suddenly knowing eyes of his i think its the baby thing i made myself meet his eyes the gentleness in them was both easier to meet and harder if we really are going to do this keep the baby then we have to make this work we have to make it all work i dont have the luxury of being a pain in the ass if its going to get us hurt you find out but hours ago and you are suddenly more willing to compromise he looked at me considering serious tender all mixed together i am told that pregnancy changes a woman but so quick as this maybe i just needed a wakeup call wake up to what ma petite i keep telling richard ive accepted my life but hes right im still hiding from parts of it you and i looked at asher then are all still tiptoeing around me afraid of what ill do arent you i turned back to jeanclaude arent you you have taught us caution ma petite he tried to hug me but i stepped away dont comfort me jeanclaude talk to me he sighed you do realize ma petite that these demands for complete honesty that come over you from time to time are another way of being a pain in the ass i had to smile no i hadnt realized that i thought this was being reasonable non ma petite this is not being reasonable this is another way of being very demanding well hell then tell me what to do because i dont know how to be anything else you are a highmaintenance item as they say ma petite but i knew that before we became a couple youre saying you knew what you were getting into he nodded as much as any man can when he decides to love a woman there are always mysteries and surprises in every love affair but yes i had some idea what i was getting myself into i did it willingly eagerly the difficulties were outweighed by what the power you might gain he frowned at me see already you grow angry you do not want truth ma petite you do not want lies either you leave us all with no clue to what will take us safely through your rocky shoals ive never heard you use a sea metaphor before perhaps seeing samuel reminded me of my voyage to this fair land perhaps i said and even to me it sounded suspicious asher made a sound low in his throat you seek a reason to be angry so you can blame us and run like richard was trying to pick a fight earlier i said asher nodded i thought about that for a second or two its not that richard and i are too different were too much alike jeanclaude gave me a look like id finally come to something hed understood long ago too much alike in many ways but you have compromised more and your very alikeness in character makes him keep trying to force you to make the same decisions he has made he sees the echo of himself in you and understands even less why you do not see his rightness in all things and its maybe why he frustrates me too hes enough like me so why cant he make the decisions ive made oui ma petite i believe that is part of your immense anger toward each other hes right im trying to make him into something hes not and hes trying to do the same to me shit what ma petite i hate being this slow about something that feels so obvious it is only obvious once you have thought of it he said im not sure that makes sense but okay fine im not saying ill like hearing it but tell me why youre so worried about asher using his gaze on me ill answer this one asher said he came to me his robe still open over his body it took more concentration than id have admitted out loud to give him eye contact and not look lower if i can capture you with my gaze we are both afraid you will exile me from your bed your bed and jeanclaudes im not in charge of jeanclaudes bed you and he sleep together in your bed whenever i sleep by day in his bed the two men exchanged a look i couldnt read i touched ashers arm brought his attention back to me what is it he looked down at me using all that gold hair to cover the scarred side of his face he didnt usually hide from me anymore what do you think that jeanclaude and i do in my bed when you are asleep in this one i frowned then couldnt quite meet his entirely toofrank gaze vampire powers didnt make me look away embarrassment did youre right i dont want honesty i just think i do you are blushing asher said and he gave a delighted laugh you think we are lovers dont you i was blushing so hard i was dizzy and i felt like he was making fun of me so i got angry i crossed my arms over my stomach and said yeah asher looked at jeanclaude she believes what most believe of us i finally looked at jeanclaude his face was very empty i had to lick my suddenly dry lips to say are you saying that youre not doing it when im not around all the touch i am allowed is when you are with us asher said and it was his turn to sound angry but his anger had warmth to it to fill his voice i kept staring at jeanclaude you do not believe us jeanclaude asked its not that itsi tried to put it into words finally i said how could you be so close to him and keep turning him down thank you for that asher said and what would you have done ma petite if you had found us in an embrace i i dont know i guess it depends on what you mean by embrace sex ma petite sex i opened my mouth closed it and didnt know what to say i dont know i do you would have stormed away you would have abandoned my bed damaged our power base the triumvirate you might have run to our soconservative richard or left us both again so shocked you would have been so unready to conceive of such things maybe but i didnt freak about you and augustine you were involved we shared him if you had come upon the two of us alone you would have taken it differently well yeah hes a stranger for one thing wait asher said are you saying that you would share jeanclaude with me we share each other now he shook his head we share you anita we barely touch each other do not do this tonight asher i ask this as your friend and as your master when our guests are gone then we will continue this discussion your word on that asher said my word i nodded when were not assdeep in alligators and ive had a few days to digest the news is this news to you that i want him as my lover asher asked i shook my head truthfully i thought you guys were doing it like bunnies behind my back you know the whole dont ask dont tell policy it never occurred to me that all the touching you did was with me i thought you would see it as cheating jeanclaude said with another woman yeah but i dont have the same equipment i mean if guys do it for you i dont have those parts but it wasnt guys i thought i was sharing you with it was asher hes not just one of the guys to us are you saying that asher is your exception to the rule im not sure i had a rule but i wont share you casually with anyone any more than id expect you to share me but i assumed that you and asher were lovers without me there that was the truth why did you assume it i motioned at asher look at him look at the way he watches you asher laughed are you saying i am so adorable how could anyone turn me down i nodded yeah i am his face softened and he came to stand beside me oh anita you make my heart young again i took his hand in mine and sometimes you make me feel like such a baby pourquoi that i can take you both to bed but i assumed you were doing each other behind my back to save my sensibilities it was a neat clean solution i thought i didnt have to decide how i felt about you two being a couple but we all got what we needed instead jeanclaude has been a very very good boy and youve felt neglected rejected he said and gave jeanclaude a dark look i touched his face turned him back to face me that was my fault not his hes right asher you know me i can ignore the elephant in the living room until im eyeballdeep in shit but if you make me look at something before its that big sometimes i take it badly if id walked in on you guys together id have used it as an excuse to run for the hills jeanclaudes right about that and now he asked im not sure thats the truth before i saw jeanclaude kiss auggie last night before we shared him i would have just said no not only no but hell no i looked down not sure if i was embarrassed unhappy or just out of my depth but i want everyone that i love to be happy i know that i want us all to be happy and to stop running i touched my stomach so nice and flat with all the exercise to stop pretending that were something were not i looked up at him no one asked you how you feel about the baby thing i mean you have as good a chance at it as jeanclaude being the father i mean he smiled at me i am a selfish clod he dropped to his knees gazing up at me i wake power drunk and forget you have been through so very much in the last few hours forgive me i shook my head no ive been ignoring your problem for a lot longer i am in the bed of two people i love there is no problem i am luckier and happier than i ever dreamed to be again but he put his fingertips against my mouth hush you ask how i feel about your pregnancy how could i be anything but happy about the possibility of a little you or jeanclaude coming into our lives julianna regretted that she never gave me a child he said her name without aching sadness for the very first time i kissed his fingers and moved his hand so i could say youre happy about the pregnancy not happy or unhappy but i am very happy with you right now i am very proud to call you my lover you truly want us all to be happy anita you have no idea how rare it is for two people in a relationship to truly want the happiness of the other but you juggle many hearts and seek happiness for all it is a rare gift this desire how could you love someone and not want them to be happy he smiled up at me his hair falling back he smiled broad enough to flash fangs which he did rarely a smile this broad stretched the scars made him notice how tight the skin was but it was the effect on others that made him not do it or the perceived effect on others i remembered this smile from centuries before i was born it was a smile he had before julianna died before holy water was trailed over him to try to chase the devil out i smiled back because it eased something in my heart to see that smile again i was almost certain that the feeling of ease was jeanclaudes and not mine but it felt real asher hugged me putting his face against my stomach he went very still as if he were listening i stroked his hair always a surprise because it was soft and foamy not as soft as jeanclaudes but as soft as mine hair that looked like spun gold shouldnt be that soft should it he spoke low and soft in french i caught the word bebe baby i waited to be irritated but all i could think while i stared down at him whispering to my stomach was how cute it was that didnt sound like me i looked across the room and found jeanclaudes face gone soft with emotion i knew who thought it was cute and it wasnt me but with that much of jeanclaudes emotion going through me i had to agree i held my hand out to jeanclaude while the other hand stroked ashers hair jeanclaude took my hand and hugged me from behind pressing his body to ashers arms around my waist so happy jeanclaude was so happy it filled us both so warm so good like being wrapped in your favorite blanket cuddled against someone you love i leaned into jeanclaudes arm and he laid a kiss against my neck asher raised his face and smiled up at us both his face somehow looked younger the way he must have looked centuries ago when he was alive the happiness was real touchable then the thinnest slice of regret crept into jeanclaudes mind i caught the thought before he could hide it that happiness like this does not last that the last time hed been this happy it had all gone horribly wrong he buried his face in the crook of my neck to hide his expression from asher i touched his face gave him my eyes and let him see that id heard his thought and it was all right it was all right to fear thegreatbadthing coming to get you because i believed in thegreatbadthing too when i was younger id wanted someone to promise me that things would work out and nothing bad would ever happen again but i understood now that that was a childs wish no one could promise that no one the grownups could try but they couldnt promise not and mean it i stood there between the two of them and knew that i would do whatever it took to keep them safe to keep them happy id been willing to kill for the people i loved for a very long time now i had to start living for them everyone i considered a boyfriend or a lover left i wanted some alone time but truly alone was too dangerous requiem and some bodyguards stayed i dressed in the bathroom which seemed stupid since everyone had seen me naked but i needed some privacy while jeanclaude and asher were with me i felt utterly calm about the baby even happy once they were gone the panic set back in one of them i wasnt sure which had used vampire wiles on me or maybe i was just picking up someones emotions hell i was bound metaphysically to so many different men it didnt even have to be jeanclaudes emotions i was picking up all i knew for certain was that they werent mine i got dressed in the emergency clothes id started keeping in jeanclaudes room jeans black tshirt jogging shoes good leather belt and enough underwear to go under it all the belt helped hold my shoulder holster the familiar tightness of it made me feel better more secure the security had little to do with being able to shoot people most of the people making my life hard i loved and didnt want to shoot no the gun was more psychologicalbetter than reallifebetter guns only work against things youre willing to kill if youre not willing to kill then a gun is in some ways a false sense of security the wrist sheaths and silveredged knives that was extra security short of a heart blow most of the people in my life would survive a knife i didnt expect to argue that hard with anybody but the wrist sheaths helped me feel better i left the bathroom dressed and armed much better i added another thing i kept at jeanclaudes an extra cross i got it out of the bedside table it was cool against my skin hidden under the shirt i am the only monster in the room that a cross will stop do you distrust me that much requiem said from the bed his comment made me glance at remus and another new werehyena sitting near the fireplace its nothing personal requiem but ive been visited by belle and marmee noir the cross helps keep them at bay they are terrible powers yeah i rummaged in the overnight bag until i came up with my cell phone then headed for the bathroom you can talk in front of me anita i will not bear tales youre bloodoathed to jeanclaude youll talk if he wants you to but frankly i just want some privacy again nothing personal requiem i sighed because this kind of shit was one of the reasons id been able to keep turning him down as pomme de sang he was messy or at least not neat and i didnt need more emotionally messy men in my life look this isnt going to work between us if you take everything so damned personally fuck buddies dont fret this much okay his face had closed down to that handsome blankness okay he said and that one empty word let me know his feelings were hurt shit i did not need this i closed the bathroom door and used my cell phone to call my gynecologist id finally realized that a little piece of plastic wasnt quite good enough it was ninetynine percent accurate for this i wanted a hundred percent it took me nearly five minutes to convince the receptionist that i needed to talk to a nurse or the doctor the doctor of course was with a patient but five minutes on hold snagged me a nurse what seems to be the problem she asked in a voice that was part cheerful and part impatient how accurate are those home pregnancy tests i mean i know what the box says but really how good are they very good very accurate her voice had softened a little i swallowed hard enough that she probably heard me so if one comes back positive then then congratulations she said but its not a hundred percent right no but a false positive is very rare ms blake very rare isnt there like a blood test thats a hundred percent accurate there is a blood test yes but normally the doctors trust the home tests too but if i wanted to schedule a blood test to be absolutely sure then i could well yes today ms blake if youre that worried take a second home pregnancy test but i doubt that the second test will give you a different answer false negatives those we see but false positives are very rare how rare i asked i heard paper rustling when was the date of your last period first week of september do you have the exact date no i dont i fought not to sound angry who the hell kept track to the day of their period ms blake anita i think we need to schedule you a prenatal visit prenatal no i mean yes i mean oh hell anita i talk to a lot of women most of them are happy about the news but not all of them you dont sound like this was good news to you it wasnt dr north is just coming out ill let you talk to him silence then the sounds of movement cloth rustling and a mans voice hey anita hows my favorite vampire hunter doing not so good today i said and my voice sounded small and hurt im sorry about that we need to schedule you an appointment i dont want to be pregnant he was quiet for a moment youre not very far along anita you still have options abortion you mean yes i cant not unless theres something majorly wrong i mean ill need to be tested for vlads syndrome and mowgli syndrome i figured the vlads syndrome test but you only need the mowgli test if youve had sex with a shapeshifter while hes in animal form i put my forehead against the cool marble tiles of the wall and said i know that oh he said in that overly cheerful way the way people say it when what they really want to say is oh my god he recovered quickly he was after all a doctor peggy im going take this in my office transfer it please hang on a minute anita lets get some privacy i listened to a mercifully short amount of muzak then the phone picked up and he said okay anita well need you to come in as soon as possible i heard paper rippling we had a cancellation at two oclock this afternoon i dont know if i can make it if this were just a regular prenatal visit anita id say fine do it next week but if were testing for both of the syndromes and youre telling me theres a chance especially for mowgli syndrome then we need to do the blood work now i wanted to say id only had sex with one lycanthrope in animal form just one time but as they say once is all it takes doc ive read up on vlads syndrome i dont know as much about the other i mean if i really am pregnant then its just this little bunch of cells right i mean id be at best two months along right theres no chance of the baby trying to eat its way out until its bigger right just saying that made my stomach tight there might be no option of keeping anything humans have a pretty long gestation period for a mammal i am assuming mammalian shapeshifter here yes does that make a difference it can you see the problem with mowgli syndrome is that sometimes the fetus grows at the rate of the animal and not the human i flipped back through every biology class id ever had and nowhere had i ever learned the gestation period of a leopard it just hadnt been covered anita talk to me anita im here doc i just i know if its vlads syndrome that i have to abort the baby wont live anyway and will try to take me with it but like i said im not as clear on the other syndrome its a lot more rare very rare in fact less than ten cases reported in this country if the worst happens and its vlads syndrome then we have time to fix it if its mowgli syndrome depends on the animal i heard computer keys clacking do you know what type of shapeshifter he was it was only once and yeah i stopped defending myself and just said leopard okay leopard sweet jesus i couldnt believe i was having this conversation i heard the computer keys again leopard is between ninety and a hundred and six days an average of around ninetysix days so i said a humans gestation is two hundred and eighty days still so what so this ill assume you dont have severe mowgli syndrome or youd know it by now youd be almost ready to deliver youre joking i said no he said but you dont have that obviously you could still have a less severe version of mowgli syndrome if you do then the pregnancy could kick into high gear and you could go from being barely pregnant to being ready to deliver in a matter of days youre joking im looking at the medical literature as we speak the internet is a wonderful tool sometimes two cases in this country of women who had milder forms of mowgli syndrome even with the test anita all we can tell you is yes or no think of it like down syndrome we can test and know if you have it but even an amnio wouldnt tell you the severity of it vlads syndrome is an automatic abortion what about mowgli syndrome i asked he hesitated then said slowly not automatic no but the birth defects can be pretty um severe its never good when your doctor sounds nervous dr north what am i missing thats put that tone in your voice if you have even a mild form of mowgli syndrome then by monday the fetus could come up on an ultrasound as over the age limit for abortion in this state you really do not want to be out of options on this particular birth defect anita okay i thought two oclock right meet me at st johns just come straight up to the maternity ward my heart pounded up into my throat maternity ward arent you getting a little ahead of yourself there doc at my office well have to send out the blood for testing at the hospital well get all the results back much faster depending on the test results if we want a closer look the hospital is set up with the ultrasound equipment well want for this youve got ultrasound at your office i said we do but theyve got more sensitive equipment at the hospital well get more information much quicker and speed really is of the essence here anita okay ill be there at two great your bedside manner sucks today by the way he laughed i know you anita if i didnt scare you youd find excuses to delay coming in did you exaggerate to scare me i asked no sorry but no i just told you more bluntly than i would normally have told a patient but then most of my patients dont need rough treatment just to get them into the office youre not wanting me in the office doc youre wanting to see me at the hospital i only go to hospitals when ive gotten hurt in the line of duty are you backing out on me he asked i sighed no no ill be there i thought of something and figured i should ask i can bring company with me to the maternity ward right i mean its not like when i was a kid and all restricted is it you can bring a friend to hold your hand if you want but since we may have to do a pelvic exam it should be a close friend pelvic exam shit at least one of them will be close enough to stay in the room the rest can wait outside the rest he made it a question at least one boyfriend maybe more and bodyguards bodyguards are you in danger almost always but this isnt its not like bad guys trying to hurt me or anything lets just say that i think this will be a pretty stressful visit for me and for the foreseeable future i shouldnt be going anywhere stressful without muscle is that supposed to be a riddle he asked not on purpose i said youre usually pretty straightforward anita sorry but this isnt something i can really explain on the phone okay does it affect your health and this situation i thought about it then said maybe yes i guess it does i realized if i shapeshifted for real that id lose the baby and this entire medical emergency would be over before wed even decided what to do about it but i just couldnt think of a quick way to explain what had been happening to me can i bring the extra people if i say no then we have a problem how many extra hopefully no more than four i did quick math in my head two bodyguards and at least one of each beast i held inside me five five he said at least two of them will be boyfriends potential fathers yeah if theyre not disruptive then i guess so if anybody gets disruptive its gonna be me i said and i hung up on him it was rude but my nerves just couldnt take any more talk about it i was scared so scared that my skin felt cold with it cold i touched my forehead and tried to decide if i really was cold if i was then i was endangering damian my poor vampire servant who was the first of my metaphysical men i started draining energy from if i went too long between feedings was i draining him to death so hed never wake from his coffin id tamed the ardeur so that it wasnt as demanding i could push it off for a few hours but the price was high and sometimes the price had almost been damians life theoretically after damian was dead then id start draining nathaniel i never wanted to find out if the theory was right i checked my watch ten am god it had been a long damn morning it was incredibly early for so many of jeanclaudes vamps to be awake so far only master vamps had woken up and that didnt include damian but still was i already draining him just because i hadnt fed the ardeur or eaten any breakfast real food helped keep the other hungers back from the ardeur to the beasts i hadnt even had a cup of coffee yet it wasnt the time of day but how long id been awake without eating that made it a mistake maybe wed eaten a big enough meal from auggie last night but i couldnt chance that i needed food the only question was which hunger to feed first sex or coffee hmm let me think it turned out to be coffee first requiem wasnt in the bedroom and micah came through the door with a tray of breakfast he didnt say that id waited too long to eat and maybe endangered damian or risked raising my beasts again and hurting myself or losing the baby or that by neglecting myself i could make the ardeur more uncontrollable no he didnt say any of that he just brought in the food and put it on the bedside table two cups of coffee croissants cheese and fruit all food in the circus was catered because there was no kitchen the old master of the city hadnt kept many humans with her and hadnt given a damn for anyones comfort but her own jeanclaude had remodeled the bathrooms first priorities frankly you could get good takeout food but a decent bathroom that they dont deliver still as i looked down at the tray of food i thought we need a kitchen i took one of the chunks of cheddar first wed found that protein worked best at keeping my energy up some of us just arent meant to be vegetarians are you all right anita you look verymicah seemed to give up on finding a word i smiled at him thanks for the food and ive got a two oclock appointment with my gynecologist today he asked is that wise i nodded picking up the first cup of coffee id been good and eaten a piece of cheese first but that wasnt what id really wanted i took that first sip of hot strong coffee later in the day id drown it in sugar and cream maybe but first thing i wanted it black naked the way i used to drink all my coffee i closed my eyes as i sipped letting the warmth flow through me was i addicted to coffee probably but as addictions go it could have been worse i opened my eyes and looked at him good coffee he smiled im glad youre enjoying it but by two well have most of the vampires awake and moving around down here well have daywalking visitors too i nodded and took a smaller sip this time i know i told micah what the doctor had told me he blinked at me that long slow blink that i used sometimes when i was trying to process too much information too quickly you have to go i know i said i sat down on the edge of the bed and made myself take a bite of croissant the croissant was good soft and buttery but i wasnt hungry i wanted the coffee but the rest of it i was eating because i had to eating to keep everybody alive and well id never been a big breakfast eater but today i think i was just too nervous fine too scared ill go with you as boyfriend and leopard i nodded nathaniel probably wont be back in human form by then i know you know that richard had arranged today off from his job i nodded he arranged a substitute hes going to want to go you know he will i nodded probably he can be your wolf micah said someone cleared his throat remus was closer to the bed than i remembered i couldnt help overhearing ill have to have at least two guards with me so you needed to know anyway he nodded good but anita from what claudia told me richard wouldnt let you bring his beast what good is his wolf if he wont let you bring it i nodded point but hell still want to go how about if i make sure one of the guards is a wolf remus said do it quietly ill make sure richard doesnt know remus said though maybe hell come through i shook my head if he wouldnt change here in the underground then he is so not going to want to change in the middle of st johns maternity ward cant say that any of us would want to its a good way to get the cops called on you remus said i nodded i know and i will do my damn level best to hold my shit together but im scared and its going to be stressful you need a lion the new guy isnt going to be in human form in time for the appointment remus said didnt someone mention that joseph is bringing some of his lions by today so i can pick someone micah nodded we need to call him and see how early he can be here i said id made myself finish the croissant and one cup of coffee was gone i took the lid off the second cup and leaned back against the headboard i had some food in me now so i could allow myself to sip this cup without ruining it with food ill check he pulled a tiny folding cell phone from somewhere on his person and stepped away from the bed to give us some privacy it was illusionary privacy because he would hear anything we said but i appreciated the effort micah was wearing a mans white dress shirt unbuttoned around the tan of his upper body the sleeves were buttoned tight but he wore it more like a jacket than a shirt the jeans had started life black but were now sort of gray when he curled up on the bed beside me his feet were bare youre dressed in clothes you wouldnt mind shifting in i said he nodded hed pulled his hair back in a ponytail but missed a few curls so they framed his face here and there he looked very winsome except for his eyes which were way too serious for comfort you think im going to have another i waffled my hand back and forth attack he smiled but it didnt quite reach his eyes lets just say im prepared i drank my coffee a little faster because it was cooling have i eaten enough no he said softly i hung my head my stomach feels like a hard knot today either one more croissant or a whole piece of fruit or all the cheese i finished the coffee and reached for the bread when you didnt want to eat bread was less objectionable i started nibbling at it jeanclaude needs to know about the appointment i know i could tell him i frowned at him you dont trust me to do it he sat up raising his hands i will do whatever will make this easier for you anita but he needs to know as soon as possible that you are going to take his human servant his animal to call and at least two or three blood donors with you this afternoon i tossed the halfeaten croissant back on the tray if there is another way to do this tell me and ill do it i didnt say that all i said was that jeanclaude needs to know then go tell him i said and the first flare of anger came he didnt give me hurt eyes he gave me careful eyes he tried to hold my hands and i jerked away if you hold me im going to fall apart he pulled back no one would blame you if you fell apart i would he sighed you always have to be so strong i nodded yeah i do he slipped off the bed to stand beside it gazing at me i didnt want him standing there looking scrumptious i wanted to be angry and i always had trouble being angry when he looked cute hell i had trouble keeping any fight going with any of the men in my life all they had to do was strip and they usually won it was true and that pissed me off too anger is a luxury anita i screamed fullthroated deep and loud i screamed until it echoed off the walls i screamed until the door opened and more guards poured in i yelled at them get out get the fuck out they turned in a blackshirted mass to remus he motioned them out but he kept two of them so i was back to four guards i guess i couldnt blame him tell jeanclaude and send requiem to me my voice sounded deeper thicker anita if you comfort me im going to lose it i looked up at him please micah please just do what i ask ill talk to jeanclaude but are you sure about requiem you mean am i sure i want to feed the ardeur on him he nodded no im absolutely sure i dont want to feed on him but jeanclaude and i talked if i feed on requiem and hes mindfucked again then im too dangerous for the other pomme de sang candidates i need to feed on requiem before auggie rises for the day because if i truly freed requiems mind from the ardeur then we may be able to use the same technique to free auggie of us a lot of ifs and maybes he said and maybe i can heal requiem while i feed i seem to heal during metaphysical sex with or without intercourse sometimes meng dies little temper tantrum is not going to impress the visiting masters and we cant hide it if hes as hurt as he is now you could feed off someone else someone whos already one of your sweeties you mean i dont need another shock for the day i said and i started to laugh but it ended in a sob that i bit my lip to keep inside panic was eating at me eating holes in all my bones and organs so that i was getting more and more fragile and when i needed it most thered be nothing there to use thered be nothing but the fear i whispered because i didnt trust my voice any louder i was either going to start screaming again or crying i didnt want to do either jeanclaude thinks requiems power can overcome my reluctance i have to feed the ardeur and i so dont want to if requiems power can make me want him then send him because right now i dont want anyone i just want to be left the fuck alone anyone else would have looked hurt but micah didnt he took it with that quiet face he said quietly we all have a breaking point anita all of us i shook my head over and over we cant afford for me to break today micah he sighed someday id like for us to have a little time for you to be able to break down if you wanted to i realized his eyes were glittering with unshed tears dont cry i said why not one of us needs to he turned away with the first tear shining down his cheek i grabbed for his arm and crawled over the bed and pulled him in against me and just like id known i would i lost it i cried and screamed and clung to him and hated myself for doing it so weak so fucking weak somewhere in the middle of breaking down i realized there were other hands holding me besides micahs i pushed at the hands halffought and halfclung as if i couldnt decide whether i wanted not to be touched or never to be let go i heard a voice a hysterical voice saying dont want to do this cant do this i cant do this i realized it was me and even realizing it i couldnt stop the babbling cant do a baby tests dont want to do the ardeur anymore no more no more men no more adding to my life the talking fell into sobbing and finally even that stopped in the end i just lay in the curve of their arms and was quiet too tired to move too tired to protest because somehow in the midst of it all richard had ended up holding me his body cradling me i didnt feel anything about him holding me nothing i felt nothing and i was glad id been feeling too much lately too much her energy feels different he said and his voice sounded farther away than it should have he was tall but i was only in his lap not that far away other hands touched my face my hands my arms my eyes were closed and i kept them that way i didnt want to see them didnt want to see any of them she is cold jeanclaudes voice his hand moving away from my cheek cold yes i was cold so cold cold down to the core of my being as if id never be warm again fur brushed my arm and it made me open my eyes enough to see nathaniel kneeling on the bed his face was still a strangers face behind the mix of animal and human once just once that face had been above me while we made love just the one time hands touched my face moved me to look at jeanclaude and richard their hands one on either side of my face their hands were so warm against my skin it took me a long second to realize that both of their hands felt warm had jeanclaude gained so much power from feeding on augustine so much that he was hot to the touch i was having trouble focusing on their faces i whispered warm youre both warm richard spoke slowly carefully as if he thought i might have trouble understanding him anita youre colder to the touch than jeanclaude i frowned at him and tried to focus on his face i could almost do it but it was as if my attention kept wandering before i could make my eyes do what i wanted wrong somethings wrong still a whisper but i said it out loud yes he said something is wrong he looked at jeanclaude i cant feel her shes in my arms and i cant feel her energy she is drawing away from us jeanclaude said drawing away what does that mean richard asked i believe ma petite is trying to break the bonds that bind her to us you mean break the triumvirate out can she do that someone asked anita can do anything she wants to do nathaniels growling voice said i do not know if it is possible but i know she is trying jeanclaude said it will destroy your power base ashers voice though i couldnt make my eyes search the room for him so be it jeanclaude said i fought to see him clearly watch him look to richard why the tragic face richard you could be free of the triumvirate richard free of me you know its what i want but what would it cost us shes cold to the touch jeanclaudes face loomed into view ma petite drop your shields drop them just enough for me to sense you let me share energy with you you are unwell i shook my head and the world swam in streamers of color i had a moment of nausea and that was the moment that i realized i was sick sick at heart sick of soul sick of it all somewhere deep inside me i was trying to undo all my decisions i was trying to do a takeback on a game that had played too far for a doover the front part of my brain knew it was too late but it wasnt the front part of my brain that was in charge how do you argue with the subconscious how do you argue with a part of your brain you dont even know is there most of the time the real bitch of the situation was i wasnt sure i wanted to argue i smelled the musk of leopard and knew nathaniel was beside me before his voice growled damian i opened my eyes and found myself staring into a black blur of a face nathaniel moved back far enough for me to have a chance to focus on him i repeated what hed said damian damian will die nathaniel said i blinked at him id heard what he said but it didnt seem to make sense to me it must have shown on my face because jeanclaude said i do not know if what your despair attempts is truly possible but if you succeed damian will die his blood flows only with your power anita without your power your vampire servant will rise no more from his grave he will die and remain dead i stared at him and again it was as if his words didnt truly reach me he gripped my arm tight and tighter until it hurt but even that was a distant hurt anita i will not be blamed for this if you accomplish this miracle and break free of all of us then you will kill damian i will not have you later say you did not understand i will not take the blame not for this he was angry but his anger could not touch me and i was glad his anger was no longer mine i could cut him out cut them all out of me micahs voice from the other side of me breaking the triumvirate wont change the fact that youre pregnant anita youll still need to go to the hospital at two oclock that doesnt change i turned and looked at him though it seemed to take a long time for me to do it the ardeur will go away are you sure of that he asked quietly jeanclaudes voice in truth i do not know if the gifts and curses you gain through the vampire marks will vanish if the triumvirate breaks it may leave you as i found you alone and safe in your own skin if that is what you truly desire or you may retain some abilities but lose the aid ofhe hesitated finally finishing with all of us in your struggle with the ardeur i turned until i found his face still out of focus like i wasnt working quite right the ardeur will go away i whispered i simply do not know what will happen because what i feel you doing is impossible only true death should be able to break you free of my marks since what you attempt has never been done i do not know what the outcome will be his voice was utterly bland empty as if his words meant nothing i tried to think about what hed said even my thoughts seemed sluggish what was wrong with me i was hysterical that was what was wrong with me the moment i thought it that clearly i started to calm i didnt feel any better really but i could think that was an improvement i thought about being free of the ardeur and that was a good thought i thought about being free of jeanclaudes marks and all the metaphysical mess that came with it my life being my own again that sounded good i thought about being just me as jeanclaude said just me in my own skin just me alone again alone again i had a moment of absolutely joyous nostalgia for my life before id acquired so many people to come home to an empty house didnt seem awful it seemed relaxing micah touched my face turned me to look at him i could see him clearly finally his kittycat eyes were so serious nothing that is happening is worth dying over anita please i thought he meant damian then realized he didnt i wasnt cold just because i was trying to break the triumvirate there was only one way to be free one of us had to die could i break free maybe would i die trying maybe the thought should have scared me but it didnt and that scared me i know it sounds stupid but it didnt scare me to think i might die but it did scare me not to be scared stupid but true i had to do better than this jesus mary and joseph i had to do better than this richard hugged me from behind bending all that sixfeetplus of warmth and muscle around me please anita dont do this his breath was so warm almost hot against my hair i looked up at him from inches away his eyes were perfectly brown warm and full of so much emotion youd be free he shook his head his eyes shiny i dont want to be free that badly dont you i asked no this price is too high dont leave me not like this he held me close his hair long enough now that it tickled along my face i buried my face in the warm sweet scent of his neck but i knew it was a lie i cuddled against him as tight and close as i could i buried myself against the warmth and strength of him and it still felt wonderful it still felt so right but i knew it wasnt we were both too stubborn for it to work i was crying again and wasnt sure why crying my regrets out against the warmth of richards neck the couldabeens shouldabeens wouldabeens i wrapped myself around him legs arms all of it and clung to him clung to him and cried a hand stroked the back of my hair and a voice said ma petite ma petite drop these shields let us inside again i turned my head to look at him while i clung to richard i stared up into that face those midnightblue eyes his hand stroked along the edge of my face and it wasnt enough whatever id done to myself id walled myself up tight since i hadnt tried to cut myself off on purpose i didnt know how to undo what id done how do you undo an accident i tried to explain im headblind i cant feel anything metaphysically i didnt mean to cut us up i knew now id survive what id tried to do but would everyone else i reached out to damian even dead in his coffin for the day i should have been able to sense him nothing fear washed over me and all the warmth id started to regain flowed away on that tide of fear i grabbed the edge of jeanclaudes robe i cant feel damian i cant feel him at all we must breach your shields ma petite we must reawaken your powers i nodded yes i am your master anita my very marks can keep me out of your shields we are running out of time for damian i would ask that you allow asher and requiem to help me breach your shields i dont understand i do not have time to explain but it does not truly matter which of us breaks down these new stronger walls only that they break once broken then your own power will be set free and it will find damian i wanted to argue but that emptiness where damian should have been scared me i nodded do it you must take off your cross first i didnt ask how he knew i was wearing one richard let me slide down his body enough so i could use my hands to unhook the chain jeanclaude had stepped away not far but far enough that he would not accidentally touch it i spilled the chain into richards waiting hand i met his eyes while his hand closed around my cross put it in the bedside drawer i said he nodded so it wont glow i nodded i admitted to myself in that one moment why id stopped wearing a cross most of the time oh i kept one in my vampirehunting bag but i didnt wear one much to bed but oh hell i kept waiting for the cross to glow when i did something i kept waiting for the cross to glow because of some vampiric ability that id inherited from jeanclaude i kept waiting for it to glow against me what was left of my nerves couldnt have handled it today richard moved across the bed enough to lean over and open the bedside table drawer he set the cross in carefully and closed the drawer he crawled back across the bed until he was kneeling in front of me again i spend so much effort keeping you out of my mind my heart and now its like this void inside me i keep trying to break up with you stupid me its like trying to break up with your own hand you can live without it but youre not whole can you sense damian jeanclaude asked i can sense vampires with a cross on jeanclaude thats never made any difference to my necromancy humor me he said i humored him i shook my head empty like hes not there id managed to chase the fear back but it fluttered through my stomach tingled the tips of my fingers is it too late please god dont let it be too late inside my head i added dont let me have killed him i watched jeanclaudes eyes spill blue until his pupils and the white were lost to the glowing deep blue of his power i sat on the bed only a few yards from him while his power rose enough to fill his eyes with fire and i felt nothing at least my necromancy should have felt it if not the vampire marks id been psychically blind headblind from shock or illness before but never to this degree it both scared me and gave me hope maybe i couldnt sense damian because i couldnt have sensed anyone right then richard shivered beside me then slid to the floor you dont feel that do you his eyes were a little wide the small hairs on his arms were standing at attention no i said he looked at micah and nathaniel who were still on the bed though theyd moved back to give us room i think we all need to clear a space for them to work micah kissed my cheek nathaniel brushed his cheek against mine scentmarking me they slid off the far side of the bed jeanclaude moved up until he was beside the bed he raised a hand above my face i felt it the press of his aura but faintly as if my skin were wrapped in cotton and he could not touch me he laid his hand against my face and that one touch spread in a shivering line across my skin ma petite the words breathed along my spine as if hed spilled a line of water down my skin i shivered for him again and it felt great but i opened my eyes and looked up at him its like years ago i always felt your voice your touch but you have shut yourself away ma petite in a tower formed partially of my own vampire marks you have used my own power against me not on purpose i said asher glided into view his eyes were already full of pale blue light hed called power and id felt nothing he came to stand beside jeanclaude more drastic measures i think i looked up at him in his satin robe the deep burnished gold of it that was nothing to the shine of his own hair what did you have in mind i asked jeanclaude stepped back giving his place to the other man asher raised his hand laying it against my face in an echo of what jeanclaude had done moments before they had always been able to echo each other like that i thought and on the tail of that thought memory crashed over me id shared jeanclaudes memories before but not like this it wasnt one memory or two but hundreds hundreds of images flooding my mind drowning me in the scent of ashers skin the spill of belles hair around our bodies like a second body to caress us all a woman with hair the color of copper spilled across our pillows and our mouths locked on her neck her hands struggling at the scarves that bound her to the bed a blond whose breasts we marked together so that she bore twin love bites a man in a long powdered wig his pants down around his knees and both of us between his thighs not for sex but for blood and it was what he wanted women with their clothing in disarray red hair in every shade from nearly blond to darkest auburn blondes from white to gold brunettes from deep brown to true black skin like ripe grain or dark coffee or wood tall short thin fat starved bodies flowing under our hands against our bodies so that it was as if i experienced a thousand nights of debauchery in heartbeats but in every memory they moved like shadows of each other jeanclaude took the woman or the man for sex or blood or both and knew that his golden shadow would be there that asher would match his movements that he would be there to help to catch the pleasure and make it more i hadnt realized until that moment that they werent lovers but more than that they had been truly the best and closest person in each others lives i drowned in their memories drowned in the scent of a thousand lovers a thousand victims a thousand pleasures won and lost i drowned and like any drowning man i reached out to save myself i reached out metaphysically for someone anyone the memories hit richard like a flood hitting a boulder i felt the memories crash against him sweep up and around him i heard him cry out and waited for him to push me away to lock me out but he didnt he let me cling to him let me try to make him my rock in the flood of sensations and memories i felt his confusion his fear his revulsion and his desire to push it all away to not have these memories of all memories the thought came there are worse memories jeanclaudes voice non ma petite mon ami enough enough his voice was soft coaxing i was lying on the bed with him holding my hand he was rubbing my hand the way people do when theyre trying to warm you im here i said but my voice sounded echoing tinny the bed moved violently richard had collapsed on it his breathing was ragged his eyes showing too much white he grabbed my other hand he felt frightened shocky and i realized that hed taken over some of my reaction hed sucked it away like metaphysical poison i licked dry lips and said im sorry you asked for help he said in a strained voice i gave it he usually cut himself out of the memories i got from jeanclaude of all the times to not shy away he picked these memories i would have preferred other memories to share ma petite but when you breached your unnatural shields i did not dare restrict your access to me i did not dare shut the marks down again he stroked my hair like i was still sick but he cast a worried look at richard i wont run richard said i knew what you were what you both were he glanced at asher who still stood near the bed asher put his hand on jeanclaudes shoulder and it was too soon after the memories to see them touching except this time they werent jeanclaudes memories i just had to wade through the fact that some of that flood of memories had stayed with me richard flinched as if hed been slapped and i knew that i wasnt the only one who had kept some of it micah yelled nathaniel i looked around the room for nathaniel and couldnt see him micah was on the floor i fought to sit up and richard helped me jeanclaude was already around the bed and kneeling with micah beside nathaniel he was human again all that lovely hair spread around his body he wasnt moving i screamed his name and reached out to him not with hands but with power i felt him breathe but his heart hesitated as if it was forgetting how to beat i screamed nathaniel jeanclaude just suddenly appeared beside the bed nathaniel is trying to keep damian alive but he does not know how you must feed them energy now ma petite right now or what i asked and i leaned into the death grip i had on richards arm or they will die jeanclaude said i stared at him because i believed him but feeding the ardeur meant sex and in that moment id never felt less like sex in my life richard said feed anita you have to feed i looked at him you going to help he shook his head not me my concentration isnt this good jeanclaudes voice cut across the panic requiem your moment has come he looked at me if you fight him they will die drop your shields and let his power take you let him awake the ardeur and feed i was suddenly staring at a chest decorated with stab wounds i looked up into requiems eyes clear blue an almost painful brightness hed raised his power and i felt nothing hed crawled across the bed and i hadnt noticed shock had set in again but for different reasons minutes ago id wanted to be alone just me again but i hadnt meant it i prayed i didnt mean it as if somehow my thought was responsible for this new disaster richards body still cradled me requiem had to wrap his hands around my upper arms and pull me out of richards arms richards fingers slid over my skin and i felt the loss of his touch like a blow i felt like some small animal torn out of its nest and thrown into the heart of the storm that storm was made of flesh and bone and eyes that glowed as if you could set the ocean afire jeanclaudes voice whispered through me let go ma petite let go or all is lost i did what he asked i let go let go and fell into eyes the color of sea water where it runs deep and clear and cold and the blue dark glows with the cold light of phosphorescence shining off the backs of creatures that never saw the light of day i floated in that cold emptiness with the dim light and a voice whispered through me but it wasnt jeanclaudes it was nathaniels voice in my head he didnt ask for help or chastise me he whispered love you those words echoed through the emptiness and i followed them up through the cold dark cold wasnt what we needed it wouldnt keep him alive we needed heat i hit the surface of requiems gaze fell out of the power id let him try i fell out of his eyes and was left panting struggling to breathe i would not let nathaniel go even if it meant going with him i reached out to him felt his heart slowing my chest ached with the need to draw a good breath i stared up into requiems glowing eyes and whispered help us he turned to jeanclaude i cannot break her i cannot get through the last time hed used his powers on me it had taken a while we didnt have a while he couldnt roll me but i had rolled him before could i bring his powers on line i prayed prayed for help i whispered requiem his voice echoed through the room and he turned glowing eyes to me i didnt have enough air to say what i wanted out loud i fell back toward the bed and only his arms caught me i knew what i wanted what i needed i willed it i commanded it and i shoved that command into him i was losing my words and it was a wordless longing that i filled him with that longing flared like heat across my skin threw me off the bed gasping my body was suddenly swollen with need wetness dripping between my legs my breasts ached with the need to be touched the ardeur rose to that ache and i welcomed it embraced it i threw the door of my selfcontrol open wide and didnt care where it landed it was jeanclaudes mouth that found mine first i knew the taste of him with my eyes closed tight he gave himself up to the ardeur and i fed through his kiss fed in a rush that flowed through my body in a tingling rush of energy id fed the ardeur a hundred times and it had never been like this he drew back from the kiss eyes filled with midnight fire how do you feel i tried to think past the pulse of my own body id fed the ardeur but the swollen longing in my body wasnt gone i felt for nathaniels energy and found him still there still alive distant as a dream damians spark like a match flame in a wind more i whispered i need more he nodded i gave you enough to bring you back to us he moved back from me and i tried to hold him against me non ma petite you need food i kept my arms locked around his neck and he reached out and brought requiem into view when you helped him raise need in yourself you raised it in him as well would you deny him i frowned at him i couldnt think i whispered no but wasnt entirely sure what i was saying no to no i wouldnt deny him or no to other things requiems hand slid over my bare arm that one touch threw my head back fluttered my eyes shut i knew where my need had come from i could taste it on my tongue taste his need jeanclaude slid away and requiem was above me so lonely so heartwrenchingly lonely lonely for so long you feed the ardeur on sex but its gifts are more than that sometimes you can see into people see what they most desire most need and you can offer it to them you can offer them their hearts desire and sometimes you can even give them exactly what you promise i had an instant of seeing so far into requiem that i started to cry weeping not my tears but his he wanted the ardeur again yes but more than that he wanted a place of refuge a place where he could stop being afraid hed been afraid for so very long afraid that belle would drag him back and make him suffer for all eternity for falling in love with someone else i felt his fear his loneliness his loss like blows to my heart and in the end i did the only thing that would keep him well and truly safe i made him mine most of the clothes vanished in a blur of hands and bodies but it was when he wrapped his hands around my belt and tore it in two jerking my body up off the bed that i remembered i had just enough presence of mind to make sure he didnt destroy the shoulder rig but it fell to the floor with the pieces of the jeans and tshirt requiem with his poetry his gentlemanly restraint vanished under the crash of the ardeur and the power of his own magic i fed on the touch of his hands the brush of his lips the sensation of his naked skin brushing along mine the weight of him above me requiem and i had never been nude together and that first time was shared with nathaniel and damian they knew what i was doing they could feel it because id opened that mark between us so that each touch each kiss each movement fed energy to them nathaniels heart began to beat sure and strong but damians spark still flickered hesitating between life and death nathaniel could make his own heart beat but damian couldnt damian needed more than these small touches of ardeur id gotten to where i could feed the ardeur in small ways from less touching but i needed orgasm for a full feeding okay for a really truly full feeding you needed orgasms from everybody involved but one was enough to get you through we needed to get through requiem rested above me pressing every inch of his nakedness against the front of me but he laid his body on top of mine not inside it he pressed me down into the bed kissing me as if he would eat me from the mouth down and only luck kept us from cutting our lips on his fangs the feel of him swollen and hard made me spread my legs and try to wrap my legs around him but he moved away moved above me holding most of his weight away with his arms and legs as if he were afraid to touch too much of me it had all seemed to be going so well and then hed climbed back into himself regained control somehow requiem in control went back to being a gentleman in a situation where i would not have blamed him about taking full advantage he still seemed painfully aware that he wasnt my first choice or even my seventh he tried to feed the ardeur without crossing that last barrier because he knew or thought he knew i didnt want him requiem please please finish it finish it he said voice showing the strain of his control your words betray you anita you use me only because you must not because you want me anger flared through me my body wants you requiem but your heart does not i screamed half from anger half from the need in my body that hed raised and wasnt going to satisfy the thought came that i could make the ardeur stronger that i could overwhelm him with it an old thought from belles memories i think but in his way requiem had made it clear he did not want to be food or my fuck buddy when push had come to shove he wanted to be more than that i understood that but i couldnt give it to him this was one thing i could not do i could not love him i need food requiem if you arent food then get off i watched emotions struggle across his face i think he was fighting his own bodys need but finally that sorefined sense of self won and he slipped to the side burying his face in his arms he did not leave the bed but he wasnt touching me the ardeur was still there but faded under the anger and frustration of the riddle that was requiem i reached outward for damian and he was still fragile the energy i felt in him now would never wake it wasnt enough to bring him back to life for the night if he tried to wake now and failed would he die would that fragile spark rise and fall never more to burn with life i yelled jeanclaude he came to stand by the bed on the other side of requiems softly weeping form i reached out to him but he stepped back just out of reach i make all the other vampires of this city wake at dusk we cannot risk trading one life for many i screamed wordless my hand reaching skyward reaching for anyone in that moment i used the ardeur to call food not deliberately because id never purposefully used it to call a victim to me jeanclaude had said that the ardeur was calling food of its choice now i knew he had been right because i could feel it i felt the ardeur spread not randomly like some sort of shrapnel bomb but like a hightech heatseeking missile i felt the ardeur brush asher i knew the taste of him but his energy signature was weak he still hadnt fed the ardeur brushed against a dozen lesser fires but finally it found one it liked i knew only three things about the energy it called it was vampire it was no one id ever touched and it was powerful a hand grabbed mine and that one touch stabbed through me a hard tight thrust of energy that tightened my body and tore a cry from my mouth so much need god it was london who crawled over the footboard of the bed london whose hand in mine had already fed me more energy than all of requiems touches i didnt know why i didnt care it was too late to care he pressed his fully clothed body over me settling between my legs so that i could feel him tight and hard through his clothes the sensation of it fluttered my eyes closed i felt his face above mine and opened my eyes to see him so close it was startling i stared into his eyes from inches away and realized they werent brown at all they were black a black that made his pupils vanish into them an island of darkness in the whites of his eyes his face lowered toward me his breath escaping in a sound like a sob before he pressed his mouth against mine that sound made me remember that there was something important about london and the ardeur something i needed to remember but he kissed me and i stopped thinking about anything but the feel of his mouth on mine it wasnt just the force of his kiss but that i fed from that kiss as if his energy were some sweet liquor spilling into my mouth down my throat there was no effort to feeding from london he gave himself to the ardeur with an abandon that was exactly what i needed i poured that energy into damian and felt his spark begin to grow to a small flickering flame i wrapped my arms and legs around londons body pressed my most intimate parts against the hardness still locked behind his clothes he made that sobbing sound again his breath hot inside my mouth i thought he would pull away from the kiss but he kissed me harder pressing exploring and i kissed him back sending my tongue between the sharpness of his fangs it was as if i had more room to explore as if his mouth were wider than jeanclaudes it was almost a clear thought and i might have remembered what id forgotten but london chose that moment to feed at my lips kissing me fiercely with tongue and lips and teeth and with the intensity of his kiss the ardeur fed harder the sweet salt of blood filled my mouth and i knew one of us had been cut on his fangs if hed given me time to think i might even have known who but he didnt give me time to think he mounded my breast in one hand jerked his mouth from mine and pressed his mouth around my breast he sucked hard and fast tongue flicking across my nipple i cried out for him my arms and legs falling away from him enough so he could move that fraction of an inch that let him suck me harder faster always the press of his fangs like a promise or a threat against my flesh he made a sound eager almost whimpering then he bit me fangs plunging into my breast it brought me screaming and only his weight kept my upper body from rising off the bed he rose up his lips decorated with my blood his eyes drowned in black fire filled with his own power he pressed his mouth back to mine but raised his body off me the taste of my own blood was like sweet metal in my mouth i tried to draw his body back on top of mine but only his mouth touched me when he lay back on top of me his pants were undone and all that hard length pressed against my naked body the feel of it made me break the kiss so i could cry out he raised his upper body off me angling himself to enter me i got only a glimpse of him before he shoved himself inside me and my gaze tore from his body to his face above me his eyes were wide lost even to vampire glow there was something frantic about them he drove his body as deep inside me as he could drove until there was no more room then he froze above me he froze with his body plunged inside mine and stared down at me his face was slack with need and lust but underneath it all was fear that one look and i remembered he was addicted to the ardeur shit i said london london im sorry im sorry he started to draw himself out of me i thought he meant to stop but he drew out only so much then plunged back in and he fucked me he fucked me as hard and fast as he could i stared down my own body and watched him plunge in and out of me and somewhere in the middle of it i came i came screaming my hands clutching at his jacket trying to find flesh to touch but there were too many clothes he brought me and the ardeur fed on the waves of pleasure on the sensation of him plunging in and out of me on the sound of his breathing as it changed he picked me up at the last minute he picked me up sat me in his lap with his body still inside mine he sat me across his body and i wrapped arms and legs around him to help hold me in place he sat back on the bed still plunging in and out of me but less sharp from this angle less deep i stared into his face from inches away my hands in the short curls at the back of his neck i watched his face grow frantic felt his rhythm change he buried his hand in the back of my hair held me in place so we had to stare into each others eyes with one last hard thrust he came and brought me with him i screamed and it would have bowed my neck back but he held me in place forced us to stare into each others faces as his body spasmed inside mine i couldnt look away i had to watch his pleasure and his pain his hand eased from my hair and he hugged me his arms loose instead of frantic his heart pounded against my body his breath so fast so terribly fast he clung to me now softly and i hugged him back he had given me his everything he had let me feed damian was awake i could feel it london had helped me save him but as i held him his pulse thundering against my cheek i had to wonder at what price what had it cost the man in my arms when londons pulse had slowed he sat me down gently on the bed and asked jeanclaudes permission to use the bathroom for cleaning up jeanclaude gave it london had taken his pants off the rest of the way so that he was nude from the waist down though his dress shirt and suit jacket were long enough that they hid him from behind he held his shirt up in front to keep it out of the mess and his pants wadded in his other hand he looked at no one as he went inside and closed the door behind him he left behind him a silence so loud that i could hear the blood in my own head i knew that the vampires could be so still it was like they werent there but it was the first time id realized that the lycanthropes had their own version of stillness of course there were fewer people in the room than we started with it was almost as if people had fled before things got bad some bodyguards though admittedly i didnt look around too much to see who was left in the corners of the room maybe they were all there huddled around each other trying to keep the big bad succubus from getting them jeanclaude moved first and it was as if the pause on a television program had been turned off he moved and everyone else breathed moved voices broke into a low murmur jeanclaude helped requiem stand from where he had apparently fallen on the floor he must have left the bed sometime during londons and my little feeding even in my own head i heard so thats what theyre calling it these days requiem gripped jeanclaudes arm tight he spoke low urgently as if he had something important to say damians coming nathaniels voice turned me to look at him micah was helping him climb onto the bed nathaniel lay down beside me his lavender eyes blinking at the ceiling as if he was still having trouble focusing he was right about damian i could feel him coming down the corridor from the coffin room where hed spent his day asleep it would take him a few minutes to get here so i turned to nathaniel dont ever do that again try to save damian he tried to make a joke of it and i wouldnt let him i touched his face dont joke nathaniel he snuggled his cheek against my hand you saved us my throat was tight and id be damned if id cry again today it was a near thing and you know it micah put a hand on both our shoulders he gripped us tight as if he were fighting an urge to shake us his face said how scared hed been more clearly than any words requiem gathered his cloak from the floor wrapped it around himself and went for the door he never looked back maybe he understood finally that he wasnt food i hoped so because i needed less complication in my life not more remus went to jeanclaude he stood very straight and started a salute then stopped himself in midmotion like an old habit come back to haunt the voice he used was one of those hardy soldier voices request permission to get me and my men out of here jeanclaude looked at him his head to one side like remus had done something more interesting than i was seeing and what if we need protecting remus remus shook his head we cant protect you from this sir jeanclaude looked behind him closer to the fireplace i was still lying down so i couldnt see what he was looking at i think some of your men would disagree remus i think several of them would have been more than happy to help protect ma petite in these circumstances his voice was mild as butter as he said it remuss jaw tightened so hard that it looked painful his voice came out strained as if he were gritting his teeth i dont believe that that was what our oba had in mind when he let you hire us sir perhaps you should ask narcissus what your rules of engagement are remus jeanclaude said remus gave one curt nod ill do that sir but with permission can i get my men the hell out of here i watched the thought travel across jeanclaudes face that he might say no but that it was that clear to read meant he was doing it for remus to see go and take the men with you who wish to leave remus shook his head hands in fists at his side no sir i am in command here and i say we all go jeanclaude looked around the room as if memorizing faces he finally nodded go and take your men remus i will speak with narcissus remus looked uncertain then but shook his head again im not saying that narcissus wouldnt enjoy the show sir but i think if the detail included this kind of thing he wouldnt have sent exmilitary and excops to you he stared as hard as he could at jeanclaudes shoulder i realized that remus was avoiding the vampires gaze if narcissus wanted our duties he seemed to search for words expanded he has other men to send but not all the men in the room are hyena remus jeanclaude said do you speak for raphaels rats as well i am in command until relieved so yes yes sir i do another voice came from the far wall male and deep but i couldnt place it at first pepito walked into view im raphaels man and i agree with remus pepito was a large unshakable man but he looked shaken now positively pale he was what had they felt when the ardeur moved through the room testing them for yumminess whatever they had felt it had scared both pepito and remus badly or maybe offended them maybe then by all means go jeanclaude said and he made a sweeping gesture toward the door remus headed for the door but he didnt go through it he opened it and held it pepito motioned to the men farther back in the room i would have had to sit up to see past the headboard and i wasnt sure i wanted to see i started to tug at the sheets for some reason i wanted a little covering as the guards trailed out micah pulled the sheets up and covered most of me and nathaniel micah stayed kneeling by us on the bed while the bodyguards trooped out i fought two opposing instincts i wanted to hide under the sheet so no one would see me and i wouldnt have to meet anyones eyes but i knew if i did that id never be able to look any of them in the face again i did the only thing i could do i glared at them a defiant front was all the hope i had to maintain any level of control or respect from any of them yeah it had been an emergency and i had had to feed the ardeur technically the guards understood that but in reality as remus had said most of them were exmilitary or excops which meant a woman was always working uphill with them anyway theyd seen me have sex with one man and once the story got around it would be more the really weird thing about the rumors would be that some of the men who had actually witnessed everything would be convinced that id had sex with more men id be lucky if some of them didnt claim they themselves had had sex with me id had rumors start after crime scenes where id done nothing sexual this had not been nothing most of the guards seemed as eager to avoid eye contact as i was but not everyone i glared most of them down but a few gave me bold eyes the kind of look you dont want to see outside a strip club the look that said youd gone from a human being to just being tits and ass i tried to remember who looked at me that way so i could keep them away from me later micah leaned over nathaniel and me whispering i see them he was memorizing faces too good because i was still shaky and didnt trust my own eyes to hold the right faces in the right places i always have trouble holding a glare when im more naked than the rest of the room nathaniel cuddled against me under the sheet he brought one arm free of the covers so he could lay his bare arm across my covered waist he rubbed his chin along the side of my breast dragging the sheet down so that i had to hold it in place i looked at him ready to tell him to watch it but the look on his face stopped the words before they could start he was staring at the men too but he wasnt glaring his face held heat and the promise of sex but over it all was possessiveness that look that a man gets when another man encroaches on his woman nathaniel who shared better than any man in my life was marking his territory that dark possessive look never wavered from the parade of men he rested the side of his chin against the mound of my breast making it clear that he had a right to be there like that with me and they did not i didnt think nathaniel would grasp the problem but he had there was a holdup at the door a confusion of movement like a traffic jam i saw the flash of bloodred hair and expected it to be damian on his own power but it wasnt richard came through the door his arm around damians waist the vampires arm over his shoulder damian leaned so heavily on him that richard halfdragged him toward the bed i sat up leaving the sheet at my waist and not caring that i was topless nathaniel sat up too we both reached toward them i said damian i reached for him with lessphysical parts his energy was weak but it was more as if he hadnt woken up completely from his daytime torpor his legs gave out completely and richard carried him in his arms like a child the last few feet he laid damian beside me the long red hair hid the vampires face i moved the hair away so i could see his face he blinked up at me eyes a perfect bright green green as summer grass it was damians eyes that had raised the bar so high on greencolored eyes no one elses eyes could compare he tried to focus on me but didnt seem able to do it i touched his face and his skin was icy i fed the ardeur why isnt he better than this jeanclaude came to lay his hand on damians forehead richard said i found him collapsed against the wall just down from the coffin room when remus called for reinforcements all the guards came here damian was trying to crawl to you what made you think to check on him micah asked still kneeling on the bed i remembered how bad he got the last time his tie to anita broke i thought someone should check on him very good thinking mon ami jeanclaude touched my cheek then nathaniels while keeping his other hand on damians face he finally stepped back from all of us frowning i believe part of what is wrong is simply that damian has woken too early only the very powerful masters among us wake before noon even deep underground damian is no master i believe you ma petite called him from his coffin but even with extra energy it was too soon i held one icy hand in both of mine will he be all right did i hurt him ill be all right damians voice was slow heavy as if he were drugged i smiled down at him damian im so sorry he managed a weak smile it would be nice he took a labored breath if youd stop almost killing me because you dont want to screw other people i didnt know whether to smile or be exasperated i believe that damian would feel better if nathaniel touched him as well jeanclaude said nathaniel took damians other hand in his and the power jumped between us it made me gasp it was as if a circuit had been completed the energy hummed from my hand through damians body into nathaniels hand and back again damian drew in a huge gasping breath almost like it hurt he swore softly does it hurt nathaniel asked looking worried wonderful damian whispered feels wonderful youre so warm strangely i was almost certain he was talking to nathaniel sir excuse me sir it was remus nerves always made him default to militaryspeak of course it worked jeanclaude and richard both turned to look at him we all looked at him except for damian who had closed his eyes yes remus jeanclaude said he finally looked at me sort of he never liked direct eye contact but he seemed unable to stare at my shoulder like normal because too much of my breasts were in the way i owe you an apology blake he said it in such a way that apology or no it was obvious he didnt want to be saying it i gave him as good an eye contact as hed let me what apology do you owe me remus he blushed and it filled some pieces of his face with bright color but lines in between paled so that you could see where all the pieces of his face didnt quite match up i thought you were just ahe stopped seemed to think about it and finally said well you know what i was thinking i could have been mean and said nope i didnt know and tried to force him to say it all out loud but truthfully i didnt want to hear him call me a slut thinking it had been enough its okay remus i might think the same thing if i were on the outside of it looking in he gave a small smile if it really is life and death for you and your people then you need to talk to narcissus about guards and food he almost laughed maybe give them a different color of shirt he shook his head and just stopped talking he turned on his heel and left as if whatever hed been about to say he wanted to stop before he said it and leaving was the only solution when the door closed behind him and we were totally guardfree micah spoke for most of us i think hes an odd one i just nodded odd one about covered remus id thought my not understanding him was because i didnt know him that well but i was beginning to think that months from now id have no more clue to why he did or didnt do things some people are mysteries and knowing them well doesnt make them less mysterious less confusing sometimes but not less mysterious asher leaned against the post of the bed near us he had a look on his face that i used to think meant teasing but now i knew meant worse and darker things richard he said so pleasantly did you truly leave us because you worried for damians safety richard gave him narrow eyes yes really asher managed to put in that one word a world of doubt richard shifted uncomfortably as if he didnt know what to do with his hands i didnt want to see anita feed on requiem does that make you happy to know that he asked of asher asher leaned his cheek against the carved wood and nodded actually yes it does why why does my discomfort please you asher wrapped his hands around the post using it like a prop as if the scene were staged most of the vampires had a certain flair for the dramatic belles vamps had more than their share sometimes he didnt answer richards question but made a statement you could have stayed richard because she didnt feed on requiem stop it asher i said stop what he asked and the glint in his eyes let me know he knew exactly what and that he was angry about something angry with richard maybe or maybe angry about something else entirely mysterious and confusing didnt apply only to remus if youre mad about something say so if youre not then stop the whole angry teasing routine damians grip on my hand tightened maybe he was just feeling stronger or maybe he was trying to remind me not to get angry one of his jobs as my vampire servant was to help me fight off those angry impulses his own iron selfcontrol had been forged by shewhomadehim any strong emotion was eventually punished horribly punished id shared enough of damians memories to know that his creator made belle morte seem the heart of kindness by comparison damian had learned to control all his emotions his urges because to do otherwise had been disaster he gripped my hand not as tight as normal he wasnt well by any means but i felt calm flow from him to me that calm not of gentle meditation and the modern ideal of peace of mind but of the older ideal when control was carved from pain and hardship and painted in scars across your flesh is damian whispering peaceful things in your head anita asher asked his tone was still teasing and light but underneath was a razors edge of spite you know how wanting total honesty is just another way for me to be a pain in the ass i said asher looked at me his eyes like winter sky yes what youre doing now is your way of being angry without being angry teasing with a bite to it he wrapped his arms around the post letting his hair slide forward to hide the scarred side of his face it was an old trick one he rarely did when it was just jeanclaude and me he gazed at the room with the perfection of his profile framed by his glittering froth of hair am i angry he made the question winsome yes i said and it was a statement question is what are you angry about i have not admitted to being angry but he kept that perfect profile that shine of hair so that he showed himself to what he considered his best advantage he was breathtaking but id begun to value the fullface view imperfections and all more than this angry coyness this show meant he was uncomfortable or trying to persuade us to do something asher seldom flirted without an agenda sometimes it was foreplay or just to make us smile but other times well i did not trust his mood asher wants me to know who you fed on and you dont want me to know richard had summed it up nicely i hung my head damian laid his lips against my knuckles not quite a kiss i only had to open my eyes to stare down into his face where he lay on the bed he gazed up at me and his eyes held not sympathy but strength control you can do this his eyes seemed to say you can do this because you must he was right i looked up at richard i thought about raising the sheet and hiding my breasts but everyone left in the room had seen them before modesty wouldnt get me out of richards reaction to my newest conquest who was it he asked i turned to asher and said you told me earlier today that you were sorry that you were putting your hurt feelings ahead of my disaster you apologized and tried to make amends is that all your apology is worth asher an hour of remorse and you go back to being a bastard his eyes flashed with anger and his power trailed over my body like a cold wind then he swallowed it the power the anger he turned a mild if empty face to me i can only apologize once more ma cherie you are absolutely right i am throwing a fit he stepped away from the bed and did a low sweeping bow that trailed the edge of his hair on the floor he rose up with a flourish as if he were moving a cape with one hand why are you throwing a fit i asked truth he made it a question i nodded not truly certain i wanted this particular truth because he will never be my lover he will be your lover but never ours together for a moment i wasnt sure which he he was talking about it the confusion must have shown on my face because he said you see ma cherie that is it that is it exactement my statement could refer to so many of your men that you do not even know to whom i refer damians hand squeezed mine again i wasnt certain whether it was to comfort me or to comfort him damian was a touch homophobic and asher was not a comforting presence if that was your particular phobia are you saying youre pissed because i keep picking men who arent bisexual asher seemed to think about it for a moment then nodded i believe i am i dont think i knew until you asked so pointblank but yes i believe that is why i am angry he looked past me to jeanclaude as he will not turn to me for fear you would leave him so i do not turn to others for fear that he will use it as an excuse to pull even further away from me we agreed that we would have this discussion at a later time jeanclaude said in a voice that was as empty as any id ever heard from him asher nodded i thought i could wait but i am choking on things unsaid jeanclaude he pointed to richard but we must be careful in front of him too it would not do to frighten him away we wouldnt want him to know that we find him beautiful would we asher i started to say but micah finished it for me after the visiting masters leave town and we know what were doing about the baby then well all sit down and talk about your grievances no we will not asher said for there will be another crisis another reason to put it off i give you my word that nathaniel anita and i will sit down and talk to you about it i cant promise for anyone else asher turned that winterblue gaze on me does he speak for you i nodded he does asher turned to jeanclaude and you master there was a lot of sarcasm to the master i will not be bound by micahs word in all things but on this i will agree we will discuss it in detail if you but leave it alone for a little longer your word asher said jeanclaude nodded you have it some tension went out of asher almost like an energy release the room felt lighter the air easier to breathe i will behave myself he looked at micah i thank you micah dont thank me asher youre part of anitas life if were going to make this work then we have to talk to each other always perfect arent you richard said and his own anger raised the heat in the room no i said no no more fights until after ive seen the doctor this afternoon i want every one of you to behave like a fucking adult okay richard had the grace to look embarrassed he nodded ill try inheriting your temper makes it so hard not to be pissed all the time he gave a small laugh if this is just a shadow of how angry you feel all the time im amazed you dont just start killing things god such rage he looked at me his brown eyes full of so many emotions you told me once that your rage was like my beast and i belittled you i told you that your anger couldnt compare to my beast that you didnt know what you were talking about i was wrong god anita god you are so full of rage everyone needs a hobby i said he smiled and shook his head you have to learn to control the rage anita if youre really going to shift you have to get a handle on the rage first his face sobered and he stepped close enough that he could touch my face the moment he did our energy jumped to him both offering energy and asking for it richard and i jerked back at the same time because it had almost hurt a slap of electricity he rubbed his hand jesus anita i used my free hand to touch my face the skin tingled where hed touched ive got the shields wide open between the three of us here could you piggyback the energy of anitas two triumvirates micah asked piggyback jeanclaude made it a question double the energy i said since no one has ever before forged two triumvirates at the same time i have no answer the energy did respond to richards touch i rubbed my cheek you could say that again are you hurt richard asked i shook my head just tingling he nodded yeah he rubbed his hand along the side of his jeans as if he were trying to rub off the lingering sensation the bathroom door opened london walked out fully clothed now adjusting his blackonblack tie except that his eyes were still drowning black with power he looked like he always did he stopped and looked at us all because we were looking at him his face was arrogant his version of blank i stared at him and it didnt seem quite real that wed had sex hed never really been on my guy radar and now he was food funny damn world where is everyone his voice was coldly arrogant and didnt match the words at all the guards asked to leave i said and truthfully i dont remember when everyone else left london walked along the edge of the bed without looking at me he was back to his cold isolated self as if the sex had never happened he almost made it around the bed but his foot tangled in the covers on the floor and down he went his arm caught at the bed and he brought himself up to his knees he peered at us over the bed like a cat thats just fallen off something and is trying to pretend it meant to do that he got to his feet leaning on the bed he jerked the fallen coverlet to one side then kicked at it repeatedly hands on the bed to steady himself he kicked at the coverlet as if it were some kind of enemy that he had to vanquish when the floor was clear enough for him he smoothed his clothes again then started walking carefully around the bed his shoulder clipped the bedpost and he fell into the bed again this time he managed to sit on it and not end up on the floor but he didnt try to get up again either he sat there on the bed his blacksuited back very straight he kept looking at the far wall youre drunk i said he nodded without turning around not precisely but drunk will do as a description jeanclaude walked around the bed until he was standing in front of the other man he stared down at him and i couldnt tell if london met his gaze or not how do you feel he asked him at last someone giggled a high almost hysterical sound it was a moment before i realized it was london he fell back on the bed with his arms wide and his legs hanging off the edge he lay there all black and stark against the pale sheets giggling the giggling turned into laughter he gave himself to the laughter as hed given himself to the ardeur the laughter was a good clean laugh a good sound but none of us joined him because london did not laugh this was not the dark knight with his love of shadows and dislike of everything else this laughing pleasant man on the bed was someone wed never seen before tears trailed from his eyes faintly pink with blood like all vampire tears he rolled his head back so he could see me i wanted to hide it from you but i never could hide it hide what i asked and my voice sounded almost afraid how good the ardeur feels belle said once that shed never known anyone who fed the ardeur as well as i did or addicted to it as quickly the laughter faded from his eyes leaving them desolate from such joy to such loss in a blink of his eyes are you addicted once more mon ami jeanclaude asked he turned his head to look at jeanclaude i do not know for certain but most likely oui i am he sounded neither happy nor sad about it he was almost matteroffact god london im sorry i said damian tried to sit up but nathaniel and i had to help him so that he was propped up between us im sorry as well london curled himself on the bed so he was lying on his side and could see us dont be sorry i feel better than ive felt in centuries he closed his eyes and drew a shivering breath i feel so warm so alive i remembered when the ardeur was searching for food how hed hit the radar so powerful but more than that the ardeur recognized you as the tasty power in the room is it because you were addicted to it once requiem was addicted once london said did he seem tasty too not as yummy as you no belle said that my power is to feed the ardeur to use a modernism i am a battery for it if you are such a good feed then why doesnt damian feel better nathaniel asked i did not mean to but i think i drank a great deal of the energy myself it was like being lost in the desert for years and suddenly seeing a river running cool and deep my skin soaked it up i couldnt stop it i kept most of the energy and im sorry for that no youre not nathaniel said his voice soft but certain london laughed an abrupt happy sound youre right im not i knew it would be enough energy to keep damian alive and beyond that i didnt care he curled all that tall strong frame into a ball and looked at me with a face more uncertain than anything id ever seen from london i am at your mercy i tried to hide how much it meant to me but i cannot i could never hide it from belle either she tortured me with it he gazed up at me with those lost eyes and said will you torture me anita will you make me beg for another taste my pulse was suddenly in my throat not from passion but from fear the proud scary london was curled on a bed staring up at me with a look id only seen in nathaniels eyes i knew that look it said you can do anything you want to do just keep me ill do anything you want just keep me ronnie had always been able to find men to have a nice uncomplicated fuck with me i seemed to be running a home for amazingly complicated men as for a nice uncomplicated fuck i wouldnt have known one if it bit me on the ass by two fortyfive we were in a maternity room at st johns hospital if id been further along someone might have called it a birthing room but not in front of me not if they wanted to live to say that i was not happy to be there was an understatement of amazingly gigantic proportions dr north had taken one look at the crowd with me and managed a private room for the exam or maybe hed known me well enough to arrange it ahead of time the room had pink flowered wallpaper and all the furniture tried to be homey or at least to pretend we were in a nice hotel all except the bed the bed was nicer than most but it still had railings and one of those trays on wheels at the foot of it it was still a hospital bed no matter how dolledup the surroundings might be i wasnt lying in the bed i was pacing the room because we were waiting for the blood test results wed find out in minutes just how bad the news was going to be micah was in a chair in the corner staying out of my way smart man we had two werelions with us one standing quietly against a wall and the other in the rooms only other chair reading joseph had shown up with six werelions for me to choose from joseph seriously didnt like haven auggies lion and was hoping id pick other less dominant lions to play with okay by me but how do you choose from relative strangers how do you choose the ones who will at the very least let you change them violently into their animal forms how do you trust that they wont fight you joseph assured me and jeanclaude i picked submissives as i discussed with jeanclaude i think theyll be like nathaniel was for you once for the ardeur whats that supposed to mean id asked i think youll be able to feed the ardeur from them without full sexual contact if i understand how the ardeur works its only dominance and power that keeps you from feeding from a kiss thats the theory i said they all seemed soft and unfinished and too fragile for my life but i chose two of them travis and noel blondish and brunette respectively travis was a business major and noel an english major noel wore glasses and had a test monday hed brought books to study travis just brought himself noel was reading for his test and ignoring everything around him travis was watching everything with those pale brown eyes of his he watched the way cops watch as if he were memorizing everything he seemed particularly interested in richard my bodyguard shift had changed over so claudia and lisandro were in the far corner near the door doing that bodyguard casual that was almost a slump but not quite if either of them had ever been military or police it never showed they were just badasses and that was enough there were two more guards outside the room by the door which dr north had objected to but claudia had looked at him hard and hed okayed it one of the guards outside the door was graham the other a werehyena that i didnt know ixion was his name though he said it like he hated it and hadnt had it long narcissus had more fun than he should have passing out names to some of his new men ixion was so exmilitary that he still had the haircut and looked uncomfortable in civilian clothes we didnt really need four bodyguards but it was the only way claudia could see to get us a wolf who would shift for me at the hospital if i needed it without letting richard know that none of us trusted him to take my beast in an emergency graham was my wolf in the hole so to speak and ixion got to come along because claudia preferred all the guards to be in pairs if we were pretending we had to make it good pretend youre going to wear yourself out anita richard said then ill wear myself out i snapped and knew that i snapped and didnt have nerves left to care he pushed away from the wall and walked toward me he reached out as if hed hug me or comfort me dont i said and kept walking until the window made me stop and turn around i just want to help anita he said pacing helps i said not looking at him why couldnt he understand that i just wanted to be left the fuck alone micah understood it nathaniel had wanted to come but shapeshifting so early had exhausted him once you hit animal form you usually spend between six and eight hours in it if you shift back early it comes with a price if he was going to be any good tonight he needed rest id left him tucked in with damian so they could both feel better before nightfall richard touched my shoulder as i went past i jerked away from him and kept on walking if we could have figured out a way to bring damian with me we would have he helped me be calm and i needed it but vampires do not travel well in daylight if you dont calm down richard said you may call your beast you dont want that not here i stopped and glared at him it would take care of the problem though wouldnt it you dont mean that he said the hell i dont ulfric it was travis from his corner of the wall richard turned to him ulfric shes burning off her nervous energy by pacing i know that richard said in a less than friendly voice if you make her stop pacing then where will the energy go richard opened his mouth shut it and nodded youve made your point i guess its making me nervous to watch her pace then dont watch travis said as if it were the easiest thing in the world richard drew a deep breath and said im going to get some air ill be right outside i promise i paused in the pacing to say i know you will he nodded and he walked out when the door was shut behind him travis said thank god one of you that nervous is enough for a room this size i looked at him is richard that nervous micah laughed yes i hugged my arms tight i guess im so nervous that i didnt notice youre entitled to be nervous claudia said from near the door i nodded but not like i believed it there was a knock on the door i jumped and turned toward the door my fingers digging into my own arms i wasnt hugging myself now i was clinging as if my fingernails were digging into that last piece of rock ledge before you fall screaming into the abyss graham opened the door enough to stick his head in and said the doctor is here let him in claudia said and her voice held tension was i making everyone crazy with nerves dr north came in with a glance at ixion still by the door your men are making the nurses and patients a little nervous could they come in the room i looked at claudia she was the one in charge she nodded and sent lisandro to open the door and invite graham and ixion inside graham just found a piece of wall to hold up he gave me a nervous smile that i think was meant to be comforting ixion scowled at the entire room and didnt seem to know where to stand the room was getting a little crowded the window ixion claudia said not everything that hunts us comes through doors we werent really in that much danger from direct attack but it gave the man somewhere to stand that was far away from the bed and whatever wed be doing though if there was a pelvic exam coming up then everyone who couldnt be the father was leaving when ixion had settled against the window dr north looked around the room do you want this discussed in front of everyone you just had me bring two extra people inside doc he smiled i mean maybe youd want some of them to go to the cafeteria i sighed and shook my head how could i explain that if the news was bad enough i might need one or all of my support staff i couldnt so i didnt just spit it out doc okay the suspense is getting to me he nodded adjusted his glasses the door opened behind him and richard came in did i miss anything i shook my head anita dr north said youre going to bleed if you dont stop digging your nails into your arms i stared down at my hands as if theyd just appeared at the end of my arms my fingers were stiff with tension when i peeled them away from my arms little half moons from my fingernails decorated my skin almost blood almost richard offered me his hand i hesitated then took it the energy spiked between us we were both too nervous to be of much help to each other he shut down shielded up and his hand was just warm and real in my hand i appreciated the effort on his part after hed seen what id done to my own arms but i finally lost the battle not to look behind me at micah i was too scared to play to anyones ego too scared not to want to wrap myself in as much comfort as i could find micah came to my other hand richard stiffened not wanting it and not able to hide that he didnt want it but he didnt throw a fit i squeezed his hand and bumped my head against his shoulder to let him know how much the effort meant to me because it did it really did the extra attention earned me a smile that smile that brightened his whole face the smile that once id have given my heart to see i turned back to the doctor clinging to both of them and feeling better for it id have liked to play it cool but i clung to their hands as if they were the last pieces of wood in a drowning ocean i had them run the blood work a second time anita that cant be good i said is this where you ask her to sit down claudia asked dr north glanced at her she can sit down if she wants he turned back to me with a smile do you want to sit down do i need to sit down his smile widened and he glanced at the men on either side i dont think so but if you do i think youve got enough support he nodded at micah and richard just tell me doc i said my voice strained but normalish points for me can i be absolutely candid in front of everyone in this room he asked i fought the urge to scream and managed to say yes yes just say it god please just say it he nodded again are you aware that you have lycanthropy i nodded then frowned im aware that im carrying lycanthropy funny you should say it that way he said your blood work is just unique anita i learned a few weeks ago that im carrying leopard wolf lion and something that the doctors couldnt even identify he gave me a look you know that its impossible to carry more than one strain of lycanthropy they cancel each other out you cant catch it more than once i nodded again squeezing the hands that held me i know all that its a medical miracle yaddayaddayadda just get to the pregnancy part do i have mowgli syndrome or vlads syndrome he gave me very good eye contact way too serious and said yes as far as the tests can tell us my knees went and i might have hit the floor but micah and richard caught me someone brought one of the chairs up and the men lowered me into it they kept their hands on mine and each of them put a hand on a shoulder as if they didnt trust me not to fall forward i wasnt that bad not yet not yet what do you mean as far as the tests can tell micah asked the two syndromes are like lycanthropy you cant have both a fetus cant carry both vlads and mowgli syndrome if anita werent carrying four different kinds of lycanthropy a medical impossibility id say we might have twins but because of the other blood work and some of the other tests his mouth kept moving but all i could hear in my ears was the blood roaring through it richard and micah helped me put my head between my knees and kept me from falling out of the chair the head between my knees helped after a few moments but i was glad for their hands on me holding me in place i dont faint but id passed out before and this felt awfully similar jesus twins talk about karmic payback with interest twins with two of the worst birth defects known to modern science sweet mary mother of god help me on this one dr norths voice came from just in front of me he was kneeling by me anita anita can you hear me anita i managed to nod my head i dont want to give you false hope here because to my knowledge the only way to test positive for these syndromes is to be pregnant but you tested negative for pregnancy twice i raised my head slowly one because it was as fast as i could move it safely and two because i didnt believe id heard what id heard what i asked in a voice that didnt sound like me at all he was kneeling in front of me and he was tall enough and me short enough that we had perfect eye contact his face was sincere worried around the edges he spoke slowly carefully you tested negative for pregnancy i frowned at him but you said he nodded i know i dont understand the test results either in fact the nurses and interns are armwrestling right now for who gets to help me do an ultrasound armwrestling do you want the truth yeah no matter what happens with the ultrasound this is a medical first as far as any of us know either you arent pregnant and youve tested positive for two syndromes that we thought needed a pregnancy to test positive or you are carrying twins from different fathers and for some reason our tests deny that youre pregnant unusual enough and dont forget as we discussed on the phone the mowgli baby could be viable in weeks but the other baby wouldnt be i just stared at him what do you mean doctor richard asked it he gave an abbreviated lecture on mowgli and the potential for a speedy pregnancy or something about anitas blood work makes her test positive for all of it he looked at me still on his knees are you a lycanthrope i mean do you shapeshift i shook my head then added not so far what does not so far mean he asked it means i came close micah said we thought she was going to shift earlier today how long has she been carrying multiple strains of lycanthropy micah glanced at me i shrugged about six months we think when she didnt shift we just assumed she hadnt caught it dr north nodded as if that made sense logical up to a point the literature says the first full moon and you shift period but youre saying shes had six full moons and nothing dont talk about me like im not here i said im sorry anita i thought id give you a few minutes to recover im as recovered as im going to get i said i took in a deep breath and let it out slow i pushed at their hands i can sit up im okay anita and this time it was micah let us help please i tried to find the energy to get grumpy about it but i didnt have it to spare fine just hold me dont hold me down in the chair its like being trapped trapped yeah that about covered it micah held his hand down and after a heartbeat i took it richard did the same on the other side and i took his hand too i was being brave but if the news kept being so interesting i might need something to hold on to the blood work results came back with the same results on all the tests twice since according to everything we think we know thats impossible i want to do an ultrasound the ultrasound will show whether youre pregnant or not well be able to see it if we dont see it then you arent pregnant the home test was a false positive and the blood work is right and if i am pregnant he fought his face trying to find some bedside manner that would fit then well do this two babies one that may grow so fast that it will be ready to deliver in weeks and a second baby that may try to eat its way out of me or eat its twin my voice was mine again matteroffact i could have been talking about what to have for dinner someone said jesus richards hand tightened on mine until it almost hurt but i didnt tell him to let go i wanted to feel him there micah added a second hand holding my arm too at least neither of them told the big lie that it would be all right it wasnt going to be all right dr north blinked at me its never good to see your doctor do that slow ohmygod blink i think that would be worstcase scenario anita lets get the ultrasound done then well know what were dealing with he stood up shaking out his pants legs and not meeting anyones eyes i think id been a little too accurately pessimistic for dr north me being too pessimistic hell yeah i got to lie down on the bed doc north put the railings down so he could get the ultrasound equipment and himself close enough the railings on the other side went down so that the crowd could gather round he hadnt been exaggerating about the interns and nurses armwrestling well maybe about the method of choosing but they all wanted to be there we were making medical oddity if not medical history no matter what happened i felt like a display at the zoo dr north beat me to it by saying we dont need this many people one of the interns said lets clear some of her people out i looked right at him and said get out he started to argue dr north said get out the intern got out the remaining junior doctors were way more polite the nurses got squeezed out completely though one of the doctors was a woman claudia saved the day a little by saying anita he was an asshole but for this we can get some of us outside im going to assume and she glared at the white coats that some of these people are here to help out regardless of what the ultrasound shows we dont have the medical expertise to offer suggestions she motioned her people out saying well be right outside if you need us she called to travis and noel the two of you come with us were not guards travis said joseph gave us to anita not to you now is not the time to be a pain in the ass travis i said my voice wasnt calm anymore it was starting to crumble round the edges he didnt argue after that he just walked out noel followed him clutching his book and his backpack claudia gave me a look before she went out i almost called her back in but didnt we werent close friends but i trusted her i trusted micah and to a point i trusted richard but they werent neutral parties and we might need a cooler head one not so personally involved the door closed behind her before i could decide to say stay decision made dr north started sending interns out until we were down to three that left enough room for micah and richard to stand near the head of the bed on the opposite side of the ultrasound stuff i had only one hand to offer and micah got that richard ended up gripping my shoulder but bless him he didnt argue about it maybe grownup reality had finally hit us all and the squabbling would stop we could hope id had to take my jacket off which showed the gun and its shoulder holster i was using the extra belt id kept at jeanclaudes but i was down two so id have to send nathaniel shopping for more leather belts soon the lone female intern kept looking at the gun with quick flashes of her eyes as if shed never seen one before i had to slide the belt off and unhook the bottom part of the shoulder rig so the doctor could snake my jeans down around my hips the gun didnt stay put when i lay back on the bed and i had to use both hands to pull it down i suppose i could have taken it off and let micah hold it but i wanted the gun touching me it was the only security blanket i had with me except for micah and richard and since both of them were a little responsible for my being in this mess well i was having mixed feelings about clinging to anyone who could even remotely have gotten me pregnant for the first time i wondered if a vasectomy on a lycanthrope was an absolutely sure thing this is going to be cold dr north said before he squirted clear gel all over my stomach it was cold but it gave me something else to occupy my mind and i was taking it micah had a vasectomy about three years ago wed discounted him as the possible father but he is a lycanthrope i mean dr north looked at micah did he just burn the ends or did you put in silver clips both and i was tested about six months ago and came up clean ive heard about using silver clips are you aware that thereve been two cases of silver poisoning from vasectomies like yours micah shook his head no i wasnt aware you might let your doctor run a blood test for silver levels just to be safe dr north looked down at me and his face was all soft good bedside manner he held up a chunky piece of plastic im going to run this over your skin it doesnt hurt i nodded you explained how it works doc just do it he started running the chunky wand over my stomach spreading the clear gel around as he worked i watched the little tv screen behind him he was glancing at it too it was gray white and black and fuzzy if it had been my television at home id have been calling the cable company and raising hell the images seemed to make more sense to him than to me because hed glance and move the wand then he just started moving the wand without looking at it looking only at the screen the tallest intern said well damn he sounded terribly disappointed north didnt even glance at him he just said get out but now and my kindly doctor sounded as mean and serious as id ever heard him he might have good patient manners but i was beginning to get the idea that his bedside manner ended by the bedside fine with me whats wrong richard said he was leaning over me trying to decipher the images i asked what are you seeing that im not nothings wrong mr zeeman dr north said without looking at him and what am i seeing nothing what does that mean nothing micah asked and for the first time i heard a thread of tension in his voice that iron control cracking just a little north turned back to me with a smile you are not pregnant i blinked up at him but the test he shrugged a rare very rare false positive anita youre outside normal parameters on every other test weve run why should we be surprised if a home pregnancy test gets a little confused with your internal chemistry i stared up at him not willing to believe it yet youre sure im not pregnant he shook his head he put the wand back on my stomach he made a slow circle of a surprisingly small area wed see it here it would be tiny but we would see it if it were there to see its not then how did i come back positive for mowgli and vlads syndrome i dont know for certain but i would guess that the same enzymes the test looks for would come back positive if you yourself were a lycanthrope its designed to test human mothers not mothers who are already lycanthropes what about the vlads syndrome this from the female intern north frowned at her well discuss the case when the patient has had her questions answered dr nichols she looked suitably chagrined im sorry dr north no shes got a point i said what about the vlads syndrome he touched my chin moved my head so requiems bite marks showed do you donate blood on a regular basis yes i said were testing for enzymes in the blood at this stage anita ive never read a study on what regular blood donation does to blood test results we know it can cause anemia but beyond that i dont think anyones really studied it may i ask a question please it was the female intern nichols north gave her a cold look it depends on the question doctor he said the doctor part like it was an insult i was seeing a whole new side of my doctor its not about the pregnancy but about the bite you can ask he made it sound like he wouldnt if he were her but nichols was made of sterner stuff and didnt back down though she looked nervous bordering on scared theres a lot of bruising around the bite i thought it was just two neat puncture marks i looked at her youve only seen bite marks in the morgue right i made it a question she nodded i took a preternatural forensics course what are you doing in obstetrics i asked nichols is going to be one of the first doctors well graduate with a specialty in preternatural obstetrics i frowned at them both id think that would be a very limited specialty growing every year north said i answered her question a vampire bite is like any other wound if death results from the bite then you dont get the same bruising it can leave just two neat puncture wounds because once the fangs go in the blood flows easily from the anticoagulant in their saliva its drinking not really eating some of the older vamps pride themselves on being able to leave no marks but the two puncture marks younger vamps will leave more impressions of teeth but its rare for them to break the skin except with the fangs the few times ive had vamps leave bite marks that involve more than the fangs they were going for pain not just feeding they wanted it to hurt we saw one body that they thought a vampire and a wereanimal had attacked because they got impressions of fangs but the collarbone and neck area were savaged i shook my head and now that north had brought the wound to my attention it ached a little requiem hadnt been a gentleman about this bite in the heat of his need hed done more than just insert fangs i dont know the case but it could have been just a vampire she shook her head it was a lot of damage i held out my right arm with its mound of bite marks at the bend vampire i said i pulled down the neck of my tshirt stretching the neck out a little so i could show her the scars on my collarbone different vampire he broke my collarbone and worried at the wound like a terrier with a rat she paled a little but said i would love to contact the forensics program and suggest you come and lecture i think just seeing your scars and talking to you in more detail might help coroners and medical examiners across the country in correctly attributing the damage on some of the victims she started to reach out then stopped herself i said you can touch the scars if you want she glanced at north he gave a small nod she touched the collarbone scar very tentatively as if it were more intimate than it should have been at the bend of my arm she trailed her fingers over those scars like she was memorizing them she trailed down to the claw marks lower on the arm lycanthrope shapeshifted witch actually her eyes got wide a real shapeshifted witch with an animal skin object not a lycanthrope she was excited about it and i was impressed that she knew the difference most people didnt yeah she finally touched the crossshaped burn scar a little crooked now because of the claw marks this should mean youre a vampire but you arent nice that someone was sure out loud i said some vampires flunkies amused themselves by branding me while we waited for their master to wake for the night she gave me wide eyes i would love to talk to you at greater length thank you so much for answering my questions at a time like this i fall into lecture mode pretty easy i said im used to being the resident expert on the preternatural thank you she said and sounded like she meant it i finally turned back to north i searched his face im not pregnant you promise your fucking word of honor that im not pregnant he smiled at me i swear my hand to god that there is nothing inside you but you you are not pregnant id needed nicholss distraction to give my mind time to process id needed time to let it sink in i turned to micah and richard i looked from one to the other of them the other intern was using a towel to wipe the goop off my tummy i let him do it i stared up at two of the men in my life and said as if they hadnt heard im not pregnant we heard micah said smiling well say something i said richard said what do you want us to say are you disappointed happy relieved were waiting for you to tell us what reaction wont piss you off micah said for some reason that made me laugh and the laughter turned to crying though i had no idea why i curled on my side and wept while they tried to hold me dr north and the interns left us to it left me to cry away the stress and fear and underneath that a tiny tiny piece of regret that microscopic bit of regret gave way to a planetsized wave of relief by the time we all left the hospital i wanted to skip and shout to strangers that i wasnt pregnant i didnt do it but i was as close to giddy as i get giddy with relief it was like being on a happy drunk it was so bad that micah suggested he drive us back to the circus two miracles occurred i let him do it and richard didnt argue that he should drive in fact richard was positively quiet he slid into the backseat without a word a look on his face like he was thinking very serious thoughts i left him to it because i wasnt thinking anything sad claudia and lisandro shoved themselves into the seat beside him the three of them had such wide shoulders that i always wondered if theyd all fit but they did noel got in the very back travis rode with graham and ixion in the second car i started to use the cell phone to tell jeanclaude then realized i didnt need the phone not for this i opened the marks just a little until i could feel him down the cool line of power what are you doing anita richard asked telling jeanclaude the good news use a phone please with me this close in the car i looked back at him his skin was running with goosebumps from what little id just done i thought about ignoring him but that seemed cruel and i didnt want to be cruel but i didnt have a chance to decide jeanclaude whispered through my head ma petite richard closed his eyes as if it hurt him but i knew that look it wasnt that it hurt it was the opposite it felt good he didnt like that it felt good i said out loud im here he whispered through my head you do not need to say it i can read it off the tip of your mind so loudly do you think it you are not pregnant i fought the urge to bounce in my seat but managed to say yes yes i felt him smile i am very happy that you are so happy about it you feel light as if you could fly it was how i felt so i just agreed with him richards thread of warmth trailed through my mind but he spoke out loud to both me and jeanclaude will you please stop this while im trapped in the car with it jeanclaudes voice seemed to grow so that it filled both of us we will talk later about these glad tidings then he was gone i turned in the seat so i could see richards face why did that bother you i dont want him crawling in my head right now noels voice came from the back i cant study if power is crawling all over my skin sorry i looked at claudia did you feel it too she fought it then finally shivered i can usually tell when you are using the triumvirate but it does seem more powerful today she tried to rub her hands on her arms but with the three of them squished in the seat there really wasnt room to finish the movement but she made her point okay i said and turned to face front micah offered his hand over the middle of the seat and i took it his hand was warm but not too warm in mine he was trying not to up the power level in the car id had small versions of the ardeur rise while i was driving not good not good at all i held his hand and tried not to have my delirious relief bring my power up and cause his beast to rise for me our beasts could flow in and out of each other but that would be bad right now so i tried to hold on to my shields and not let happiness break them down i knew that sorrow and anger could cause my concentration to break but id never realized that happiness could do it too i controlled my happiness all the way to the circus the long stone stairs flew by under my feet jeanclaude met me in the living room and i bounced into his arms wrapping my arms and legs around him i kissed him long and deep and only when we came up for air did i realize that we had company augustine sat on the love seat draped in a black silk shawl that left the tops of his bare shoulders like pale islands peeking out his yellow curls were in disarray as if all hed done was run his fingers through them he was wearing the bottoms of black silk pajamas that were too long for him it seemed wrong to call such a muscular man winsome but that was the word that came to mind i looked at him and i felt something similar to what id felt when i looked at jeanclaude it didnt have the depth and richness that my feelings for jeanclaude or micah or even richard had but it was that first burst of love when lust has worn away a little and you realize that you still like someone that it wasnt just lust but something deeper i stood there staring at auggie and thought that it sounded like a good idea to wake up some morning beside him when he looked all sleep tousled and winsome i was in love with him i should have been terrified or angry but i wasnt it wasnt vampire powers that made me stay calm about it maybe we could fix this the way wed fixed requiems attraction to me there were options we could work around it i wasnt pregnant we could work around anything else ma petite i turned back to look at jeanclaude i hadnt even noticed the brush of the black satin shirt underneath my hands the shirt was untucked over black jeans he had very few jeans he usually only wore them if he suspected hed be ruining the clothes or he was trying to portray himself as accessible in some media event his feet were bare the flesh only a little less white than the carpet ma petite he said again and this time the nickname made me look back to his face his hair was a careful fall of curls his version of casual how do you feel when you look upon augustine i started to look back at the other vampire but jeanclaude caught my arm turned me to look at him answer before you look back ma petite i think it sounds like a really good idea to have him wake up beside me all tousled and half naked is it merely lust i shook my head no no its the beginning of the real deal its love not just lust you do not sound upset i smiled at him im not pregnant we can work around everything else i mean isnt this similar to what i did to requiem with the ardeur if i can free him then shouldnt a master of the city be able to free me jeanclaude how do you feel about augustine this from richard who had come to stand just behind us i see him as lovely but strangely i am not in love with him he is not in love with me i had hoped that meant the worst or best had not happened buthe looked beyond us to augustine i looked with him i noticed that from this distance auggies charcoalgray eyes looked almost black do you need to ask how do i feel about your human servant he asked jeanclaude nodded it is all i can do to stay here on this seat i want to touch her to hold her if my heart could beat it would break why should your heart break i asked and was surprised at how ordinary i sounded even felt because you belong to another and i love you i took a step forward and jeanclaudes fingers began to let me go richard grabbed my other arm no anita dont go to him why not i asked looking up into those brown eyes he started to say several things but finally said the only thing that was really true because i dont want you to that stopped me more surely than any anger could have i was left staring up at him watching the pain on his face and not knowing what to do about it why is sharing me with auggie different than sharing me with all the rest you dont love the rest i started to smile stopped then said who dont i love he let me go then as if my skin had suddenly gotten hot ill go get changed for the ballet he actually started for the far hallway it is a little early to change mon ami richard shook his head i cant watch this i just cant what do you think is going to happen richard i asked he answered without turning around youre going to have sex with him again maybe you and jeanclaude he shook his head again it was bad enough to feel some of it i dont want to watch im in love with him richard that doesnt mean were going to fuck you of all people should know that just because someone has my heart doesnt mean they have my body that stopped him just at the far doorway he turned around looked at me you dont feel compelled to fuck him i shook my head i am losing my touch auggie said it made me turn and waste a smile on him my smile made him smile that goofy smile that you only do when youre truly gone on someone you havent lost anything and you know it he made a gesture that was half bow and half shrug he managed to look modest but not like he really meant it if i have lost nothing and you do not fear what we feel for each other then come to me anita you come to me i said he grinned at me wide enough to flash fangs which was rare for a vampire his age he stood up the shawl still covering most of him master do not go to her octavius his human servant came around the side of the love seat the werelion pierce came with him i think they meant to outflank him and keep him from touching me he stood in front of auggie blocking our view of each other you are the master of the city of chicago you go to no woman they come to you auggie moved octavius to one side gently but firmly i dont think this one will he looked at me halfsmiling will you come to me why should i he grinned again i dont know if its my own power backfiring but i see what you saw in her jeanclaude an ambitious target for love and i would think harmful to the ego but worth the effort oh yes worth the effort he pushed past his men flinging the shawl into the air so that he was suddenly nude from the waist up the sight of him like that pushed my pulse up into my throat i remembered what it was like to be held down by that body what it was like to hold all that muscled strength in my arms i took a step forward and i think we would have met in the middle of the room but i suddenly smelled sunwarmed grass felt heat lion i smelled lion i turned around to look for noel and travis they were standing near the far door as if they werent sure what to do i couldnt blame them for that but it wasnt them i was sensing i turned the other way toward the far hallway where richard was still standing but it wasnt richard who was making my skin creep with power haven stalked down the hallway human again nude and beautiful in truth he was a little thin for my tastes but it wasnt truly the washboard abs or the slender hips the long graceful legs or even the swelling of promise between those legs but his beauty as a whole that drew me if hed been unattractive would i have felt the same about him walking toward me would i have been able to resist walking toward him if he hadnt looked so damn cute my view was suddenly blocked by travis and noel of all the men in the room that might interfere they hadnt been on my list traviss soft face was utterly serious as he said our rex said that you werent supposed to touch him again before youd fed on one of us i could feel haven behind them moving closer move travis i said he shook his head noels eyes were wide behind his glasses but he added joseph wants you to feed the ardeur or give us your lion before you touch him again i knew he was close before haven loomed over the two shorter men i guess he loomed over me too but he wasnt going to move me out of his way his blue eyes stared down at me with a look that was almost frantic i felt it too an almost overwhelming need to touch him what was wrong with me my hand started to lift up to try to move between noel and travis so i could touch havens bare chest i wanted needed to touch his skin the look on his face said he felt the same what the hell was happening now noel and travis moved closer together and stepped forward at the same time bumping me forcing me back a few inches farther away from the man at their backs i didnt want to be farther away and neither did haven he tried to grab them by the collars but they must have felt it coming because they threw themselves forward on top of me bringing us all to the ground get off me i said but i didnt have to worry haven reached down and grabbed travis suddenly travis wasnt on top of me anymore he was airborne and hit the wall with a sharp brittle sound and i knew a bone had broken somewhere in his body that fixed it whatever the hell was wrong i could think again haven reached down for noel and i wrapped my arms and legs around him tight so if the big werelion threw him hed have to throw us both it was the only thing i could think of in a split second he grabbed a handful of noels curls jerked his neck back at a horrible angle i yelled let him go haven snarled at me and came to one knee beside us i am your lion cant you feel it i could but that didnt give him the right to break noels neck which was what was going to happen if he didnt stop pulling his head back i couldnt draw my gun it was trapped under noels body if i let go of him i was afraid of what haven would do to him i slid one hand through noels hair until i touched havens hand the moment we touched energy shot through my body as if id touched a live wire so much energy that i cried out in pain noel echoed me getting the backlash of it haven threw his head back and roared a coughing harsh sound out of his human throat he looked down at me with eyes that had gone lion gold oh god yes yes i was shaking my head i whispered no no auggie tried ordering haven away from us but it didnt do a damn thing octavius was a pain in the ass but hed been right about one thing haven didnt belong to auggie anymore he might not be mine completely but he was no longer auggies richard loomed up over us you want him moved his voice was low and careful his face full of a dark eagerness i knew that look it was my look the look when you want a fight want to hurt something because its simple and you can stop thinking i said yes i said yes with havens energy running through my body like a warm hurtful blanket richard said thank you i wasnt sure what he was thanking me for but he knelt down beside us he was on one knee facing haven he wrapped his hand around the other mans wrist where it was trying to pull noels head backward the pressure eased on noels hair and his head began to lower havens hand shook with the effort to pull noels head backward but richard pushed his hand down it was a struggle and slow but it was like an armwrestling match when one person is simply the stronger of the two the match wasnt over but one arm against one arm richard was the stronger man he just was but haven was one thing that richard was not a professional thug he did two things simultaneously he released noels hair and he tried to hit richard with his other hand that fist going over us was a blink of the eye too fast to see more just an awareness of air moving and the afterimage richard saw it because when the fist tried to land on his face he wasnt there to take the blow he rolled backward and pulled haven with him with one hand on the other mans wrist havens own momentum made him fall forward and richard did a move that id showed him ages ago his sport was karate mine was judo but if it had been me trying for the tomenage throw id have failed because haven was halfcollapsed on richards legs not high enough above the ground unless you had the strength to plant your feet in the mans stomach and lift with your legs i would have just ended with haven on top of me not an improvement in a fight but richard pushed him skyward and was strong enough to keep the momentum going haven flew across the room and hit the fireplace richard had time to stand before the other man got to his knees then charged him the fight was on the fight rolled over the couch and vanished from sight for a minute noel shivered on top of me and it wasnt pleasure are you hurt i asked his voice was breathy from pain or fear i didnt know him well enough to guess which anita youre about to pick an animal to call i patted the top of his curls gently youre not thinking clearly noel i started to try to sit up but he wrapped himself around me not pinning me but making it so sitting up would be an effort richard was the one who staggered back from the couch blood spattering his face haven got to his feet like he was on springs and they squared off both of them went down into fighting stances that said that haven knew some kind of martial art too not good let me up noel he raised his face so i could see how frightened his eyes were behind his glasses you are about to have another animal to call nathaniel is my animal to call hes your animal for damian and you but richard is your animal with jeanclaude richard and haven were circling in the bare area just in front of the far hallway they feinted with legs and hands but they werent fighting they were getting the measure of each other once they had it the fight would get serious i didnt want that noel gripped my arms turned my attention back to him joseph thinks that something about the vampire marks is giving you an animal to call to match each of your beasts thats not possible everything you do is impossible anita my rex thinks it is possible he hopes that if you feed from more than one lion your power wont bond to any one person travis collapsed to his knees beside us blocking my view of the growing fight he was cradling his arm tight against his chest the side of his head was bleeding into his browngold curls but if you do have to bond to a lion joseph would prefer that the strongest preternatural power in his territory not bond itself to a lion who would try to take over his pride it seemed stupid having this conversation flat on my back with a nearly perfect stranger on top of me but i couldnt figure out how to sit up without getting rough with noel and haven had been rough enough why did joseph send you to me travis shrugged and winced his shoulders hunching around his arm our first task is to keep you from bonding with blueboy over there whatever it takes to stop that from happening i looked at them both youre kids you dont want to be bound to my life to me forever you dont want that you cant want that im only five years younger than you travis said hell im two years older than nathaniel but nathaniel needed me you got drafted noel pushed himself up on his arms which meant i was able to get to my gun not that it would help but it was still a thought his lower body was pressed a little closer to my lower body but for once it wasnt erotic it wasnt anything our lion group our pride works anita its our home i felt blueboys power just walking down a hallway you can feel it now coming off him in waves noel licked his lips joseph is powerful but im not a hundred percent certain hes more powerful than whats behind us let me sit up noel noel glanced at travis and the other man gave a small nod then hunched over his arm again noel moved back so i could sit up but he stayed kneeling between my knees i think so he was close enough to grab me if i tried to go to haven again richard and haven were fighting now fighting with a capital f if youre not planning to kill each other it was a kind of fighting that i would never be able to do pounding the shit out of each other and being able to take the damage it was guy fighting for the sake of a point yes id asked for help to move haven and protect the other men havens fist got past richards arms and richard staggered back two steps but hunched his body so that the blows haven tried to rain on him hit only shoulders and arms richard on the other hand landed two solid body blows that doubled haven over richard followed with a fist to his chin and only haven throwing himself backward kept the next blow from hitting richard didnt give him time to recover he came at him with a flurry of blinding kicks that put the other man into a defensive crouch against the far wall richard was winning i realized in that moment that i hadnt thought he would noel touched my face turned my gaze back to his scared face anita please dont touch him not until youve at least tried one of us i checked richards progress one more time haven was against the wall simply trying to keep the kicks from hitting him not even trying to fight back now i looked at travis and his wounds noels eyes so scared the lions pride worked they were one of the few wereanimal groups in town that let their people lead nearly ordinary lives no power struggles no hiring bodyguards josephs people were people first animals second if haven stayed in town hooked up to the power that i had through jeanclaudes marks would the lions world go up in flames you dont think joseph would win the fight i asked he is not the fighter that your ulfric is travis said travis said it like it was just true and no big deal that was the biggest difference between wolf and lion culture all the big cat shapeshifters seemed to be less about combat and more about what was best for the group the wolf culture was much more about strong is right weak is just dead someone had suggested that it was because the werewolf culture passed through the vikings culture more than any other shapeshifter society maybe real wolves certainly werent more vicious than lions or leopards wait a minute i said joseph won his fight with haven joseph got lucky travis said he motioned at the fight he got real lucky richard had the other man in a defensive ball against the wall haven had given up fighting back and was just trying to keep the damage down richard did a very richard thing he backed up the fight was over as far as he was concerned since he wasnt going to kill haven the fight should have been over but havens day job was mob enforcer its a different mentality richards voice sounded tired but not strained stay down haven got to his knees shaking his head i cant you cant win richard said doesnt matter haven said still have to get up stay down richard said no haven said and he used the wall to push to his feet he fell back to his knees one hand holding him swaying against the wall i said stay down haven cant was all he said and he gathered himself for a rush he came up off the floor in a blur of speed still dangerous for all the damage hed taken richard sidestepped him let his own momentum send him crashing to the floor this fight is over richard said and he made the mistake he offered haven a hand up i had time to yell no i wasnt even sure who i was yelling it at haven kicked out with everything he had left he tried to dislocate richards knee richard had time to avoid some of it but not all of it his knee collapsed and he went down my gun was out and pointed i got to my feet if haven had pushed the attack id have shot him but he didnt he lay back on the floor as if that last kick had taken all the fight out of him the fight is over i said just in case yeah haven said and his voice held pain now it is i stared down the barrel of the gun at him and he didnt even seem to see the gun he certainly didnt react to it most people dont like having guns pointed at them if he didnt like it it didnt show im thinking you need to go back to chicago why because i hurt your boyfriend no because you hurt two people who couldnt fight back and the fight was over you gained nothing from that last kick hes hurt i gained that i shook my head thats not how we play here he lay on his back covered in blood and too tired or too hurt to sit up he was still breathing hard tell me the rules here and ill follow them ask augustine i follow the rules once you make em clear to me i called out without looking away from haven is that true auggie does he follow the rules once he knows them its true but you have to make damn sure that he knows the rules and the consequences if he breaks them that one statement let me know that i should pack his ass home to chicago but i couldnt do it standing there while he bled knowing what hed just done to richard and the two young werelions knowing all that i still wanted to drop down and spill my body over his fuck i stilled my breath and sighted the gun in the middle of that face the eyes had bled back to blue they looked almost artificial with the blood all around them i swallowed hard and let my body go very still my voice was soft but strangely carried through the room as if everyone had gone quiet the rules are you dont harm the weak ive got no use for bullies if you get into another fight like tonight when you know youve lost youve lost you dont try for one last bit of damage thats street fighting and thats not what we do here you wont shoot me he said and he sounded sure of that i felt myself smile and knew it was the smile that creeped me out when i saw it in a mirror it was a cruel smile a smile that said not only would i kill you but id enjoy it his eyes went a little uncertain at that smile good i will shoot you ill kill you if i have to do you want to touch me he asked his voice less breathy now yes i said i want to strip off and roll on top of you like a dog scentmarking i gave a very small nod i feel the call of your power haven if you kill me that all goes away then it goes away i dont compromise my rules haven not for lust or power or love i was going to have to either shoot him soon or lower the gun important safety tip if youre going to do the big threatening speech be in a comfortable shooting stance when you do it my hands hadnt started to waver but they would soon ask the men in my life i dont compromise i watched him think about it think about coming off the floor and trying me dont haven dont what he asked all innocent but innocent just didnt work on him dont try me right now if you do ill pull the trigger why i wont hurt you ill just try to take the gun away ill shoot you because this is our moment of understanding you will either live by my rules or you will die by them i dont believe you he said i let all the air out of my body and the twohanded shooting stance didnt seem hard to maintain at all i was suddenly focused and ready i felt myself sinking away into that white staticky place where i killed i dont know what my eyes look like when im like this but whatever was on my face haven saw it i watched his face change and stop being sure of itself tension ran out of his body his muscles and he lay quiet on the floor and very still as if he were a little afraid to move suddenly good its my way or no way i said and the words were squeezed out because id let my air go so i could shoot him he licked his lips and spoke softly carefully being sure to move nothing but his mouth your way if i put this gun away are you going to try to hurt me no he said why not i asked still staring at him down the barrel of the gun youll kill me you sure of that some look passed through his eyes pain fear something close to all of it i know that look the one on your face i know it because i have one just like it you will kill me and i dont want to kill you i cant win so i wont play i stared at him a heartbeat longer i thought about pulling the trigger one because i was ready to two because i was almost certain he was going to be trouble but in the end i lowered the gun and backed away until i was out of reach of him i backed away and made certain i didnt give him my back i didnt offer him a hand up and neither did anyone else i went to one knee beside richard my gun not pointed at haven anymore but still out we just werent that far away from the fallen werelion tosay i didnt trust him was an understatement the awful thing was even knowing that he was bad news knowing that hed tried to cripple richard just because he wanted him to hurt knowing all that part of me still wanted to touch him part of me wanted to go over and start licking the blood from his wounds but the image in my head of me doing it wasnt of me not human me the image in my head was of a huge golden lioness licking his wounds i shook my head hard to clear the image i glanced at richard he was huddled over his leg hands over his knee but not touching it as if that had hurt not good i put my gaze back to haven i didnt want him getting up without my knowing it if i shot him i didnt want it to be because hed startled me and years of training with a gun took over no if i shot him i wanted it to be on purpose how bad is it i asked he spoke through gritted teeth its not dislocated but it hurts i called claudia she came to stand over us we need a doctor i thought of traviss arm maybe more than one dr lillian is on her way doc lillian was a wererat and the local shapeshifters most popular doctor for emergencies we didnt want anyone else to know about good i fought the urge to look at her and kept my gaze on haven he didnt seem to want to do anything but lie there and bleed but i wanted to be sure of him sure meant looking at him could you guys earn your pay and actually secure him i didnt try to keep the irritation out of my voice yes maam she said she motioned and lisandro ixion and graham came up to stand around the fallen werelion haven didnt seem to notice had he passed out not my most immediate problem i got to holster my gun without firing it a rarity for me i touched richards face the docs on the way he just nodded face pinched and pale with pain i looked up at claudia where the hell were you guys while haven was abusing travis and noel if i say right over there will you get pissed i stood up yes she gave me empty cop face though i knew shed never been a cop this was a dominance challenge we are not allowed to interfere in challenges of other animal groups this wasnt a challenge for leadership of anything i said claudia gave me a look that said clearly id missed something whatever showed on my face finally let her know that i didnt know what the hell she was hinting at she sighed sometimes i forget that you miss the obvious what did i miss i asked your ulfric has established himself as dominant to this guy she smiled down at richard truthfully i didnt think the ulfric had it in him there was a grudging compliment in her voice you needed for someone to establish dominance over him if you planned to keep him she jerked a thumb in havens direction guys like this have to be forced to obey the hierarchy you mean the hierarchy of the werelions she shook her head anita if you add this guy to your men then someone had to beat the shit out of him at least once so hed know who was boss im boss i said she smiled at me i like you anita i respect you i take orders from you but a guy like haven is going to see you as a girl a piece of ass unless you can personally beat him to a pulp hes not going to behave for you hell tell you to your face what you want to hear but youve got nathaniel micah damian i mean you have a lot of noncoms around you you dont want to bring home a lion to play with your kittens unless you have a big dog to balance it out i frowned at her are you saying that richard is my big dog maybe its a bad example but its the best ive got you dont think he would respect me haven i mean she shook her head hes got trouble written all over him anita you think i should throw him back her dark eyes widened surprised does my opinion count i trust your judgment and youre the only girl here why do you need a girl opinion she asked because im tired of all the damn testosterone she grinned at me im not sure ill say anything that the men wont say on this one anita estrogen doesnt make me stupid and youd have to be stupid to want to keep cookie monster over there i mean he could be a bodyguard if we made the rules clear but to take home as a lover no way i nodded i agree then why ask i hugged myself because knowing all of it i still want to touch him she shrugged all that muscled upper body then youre fucked richards voice came strained you cant want to keep him not now not after this i knelt beside him he grabbed my hand so hard and sudden it startled me i dont want to keep him i watched him try to think past the pain but he said but its not always about what i want his hand convulsed around mine until i had to fight not to cry out shift richard you can heal this if you shift he shook his head if i shift ill have to spend at least four hours in animal form cant go to the ballet as a wolf youre not going to enjoy the evening like this his grip on my hand loosened just holding me for a moment he stared into my face like he was trying to memorize it do you want me not to go i frowned at him why would you ask that of course i want you to go he almost smiled but winced instead youve got a lot of men to juggle maybe one less would make tonight easier i drew his hand against my breasts and touched his face you didnt just assume i needed help to handle haven you asked me first and waited for me to answer i know you wanted to wade in and pull him off us thank you for asking for waiting he grimaced and tried to make it a smile im glad youre happy about it but my waiting cost travis a broken arm josephs not going to want us to borrow his lions if we keep breaking them that made me smile good point but the lioness in me is looking for someone strong i looked at the wall because i could feel that beast moving around inside me as if it were pacing the cage of my body i did not want another round of almostshifting i raised richards hand to my face i sniffed it and it didnt help yes it was richard but hed touched haven and the smell of lion was on his skin along with wolf the prickling warmth started to swell inside me i let go of his hand and stood up whats wrong claudia asked her beast is trying to rise again richard said from the floor i nodded and stepped farther away from richard and kept moving i wanted distance between me and haven this didnt feel like the way id bonded to nathaniel this instant attraction to haven felt like i turned and found micah standing there closer than id realized he hadnt wanted to interfere with me and richard i could feel my eyes widening i reached out to him and the wolf and lion quieted leopard stirred and the movement almost doubled me over micah caught me helped me stand up straight but the leopard liked him too much and i had to push him away from me i stumbled and jeanclaude was there to catch me i clung to him burying my face against his chest drawing in the scent of clean silk and him i actually ripped his shirt open so i could put my face directly against his skin i drew in the sweet clean scent of him as if he were air and id been suffocating his cologne was sweet and always smelled as expensive as it was but it was the scent of his skin underneath it mixing with the cologne that i needed it helped clear my head helped me ease the beasts back to sleep i rubbed my face along the smooth outline of his crossshaped burn scar jeanclaude didnt see the scar as an imperfection and neither did i it was something extra to play with when i kissed his chest his arms held me tight and he whispered i felt your fear flare to life ma petite what has happened i spoke with my face still buried against his chest im trying not to make haven my animal to call jeanclaude stroked my hair trying to soothe me like a child whos woken from a bad dream but this bad dream wasnt going to end with me waking up it wasnt going to be all right you are drawn to haven and he to you ma petite you have broken his link to augustine i nodded my forehead against his chest yeah but hes not auggies animal to call hes just one of his lions i felt jeanclaude look behind him thats right and that was auggie hed come to stand near us hes bound to me but not as an animal to call i nodded again my face still buried against jeanclaude i didnt want to see auggies naked chest i didnt want to be distracted by yet another metaphysical problem one at a time was plenty what did i do with the leopards before i got an animal to call jeanclaude i do not understand ma petite whatthen he went very still he was still holding me i was still clinging to him breathing in the scent of his skin but his heart had stopped beating his breathing stilled he was doing that be very still that the old vampires could do but this time i was pressed against him while he did it id never been this close to him when he went this still until it stopped i hadnt even been aware his heart was beating it made me look up at him made me meet that beautiful flawless face and see it look unreal masklike as he stared not at me but behind me i turned and looked where he was looking micah stood there staring at us the look on his face was enough hed had the same awful thought id had i licked my lips and whispered do the lions have a name for their queen he said it out loud i felt it when you saw him coming down the hallway he wont be your animal to call hell be rex to your regina richard ended up back in jasons room dr lillian pumped him full of painkillers so hed sleep and heal i had to promise him guards i trusted at his door to make sure none of our guests visited him while he was drugged and helpless seemed like a reasonable request to me in fact it was so practical that it gave me hope that he was finally beginning to realize that life wasnt a boy scout jamboree lillian said if richard had been human hed have been on his way to the emergency room and on crutches for weeks afterward but he wasnt human and two hours of sleep would heal a lot of the damage why not try to heal him with metaphysics because richard had never let me heal him with magic it was his choice and i was okay with it hed done so much right in the last hour that id cut him slack acres of slack haven was unconscious in the guest room hed started the day in with additional guards he wouldnt be going anywhere for at least fortyeight hours so said the doc fine with me out of sight was just dandy for the cookie monster and me id started to get upset again like pacetheroom upset but jeanclaude had touched me and auggie had joined him i ended up on the couch cuddled between them and feeling strangely calm youve rolled my mind havent you you have the ability to keep me out ma petite merely decide to push me out and i will be forced to go i think you need the calm i couldnt argue with that i turned with my head in jeanclaudes lap and looked at auggie who had my legs across his lap but hes helping you a very little bit auggie said and did that face that was supposed to be humble but never made it you should really stop trying for the humble head dunk thing i said it doesnt work for you he gave me wide eyes innocent i think he was going for he didnt pull that off either are you saying i am not humble he grinned spoiling any attempt at innocence that smile said he was thinking nefarious things fun things but nefarious nonetheless you wouldnt know humble if it bit you on the ass he laughed mouth wide flashing fangs if you hadnt seen the fangs youd have said it was a very human laugh jeanclaude had once explained to me that vampires learn to control their faces voices every reaction to hide from their masters because any strong emotion can be used against you after a few centuries you could lose the knack of true laughter of smiling just because you were happy not because you thought it would get you something facial expressions for the very old vamps become more like flirting something you do on purpose for a purpose auggie just seemed to laugh i raised my head so i could look at jeanclaudes face i asked is that real that laugh or is it part of auggies game plan ask him ma petite i looked at the other vampire well i said well what he asked is the laugh real or a performance he shrugged those massive shoulders sending the black shawl sliding down a little lower at the rate it was slipping hed be naked from the waist up again i wasnt sure if i wanted the shawl to fall faster or make him tuck it back over himself seeing him nude sounded good and the wanting of it made me not want it at all crazy i know but true i seldom trusted anything that i wanted too badly i smelled vanilla warm vanilla nathaniel was coming i heard bare feet running and the next moment he was airborne above me he caught himself with hands and toes on the couch just before he would have landed on me hed done it before but it always startled me and made me make that girly eep sound i hated that i even had that sound inside me somewhere nathaniel laughed his face alight with it i tried to be grumpy about him startling me but failed the grumpiness rolled away under the delight of being this close to him and the soothing touch of vampire not pregnant he said i shook my head and laughed too suddenly i remembered how gloriously relieved i had been he brought back the rush of joy that id had before haven misbehaved nathaniel let his body fall those few inches so he pressed his weight against me he kissed me and i kissed him back my hands slid over the muscled heat of his skin and the silken warmth of his hair unbound and sliding over us all his body started to react to the closeness and the kiss grew if they actually have sex on our laps do we get to join in auggie asked i drew back from the kiss and nathaniel stopped but he didnt move i had to actually move some of the thick auburn hair to one side so i could see auggies face no i said then i am at a loss as to where to put my hands i gazed past nathaniels shoulder to realize that the most natural resting place for auggies hands was probably nathaniels ass where it peeked from between the fall of his own hair auggie lifted a strand of that hair i have not seen hair like this for a century he rubbed the hair along his cheek it brings back memories though the body would be female he gazed down at nathaniel its the longest hair ive ever seen on a man i didnt like the way he was looking at nathaniel not that we could really blame him it wasnt auggie who had jumped naked into our laps i pushed at nathaniels chest move okay he gave me a look that managed to be both innocent and not then he rolled to the floor yeah hed wanted to surprise me but he was an exhibitionist and loved to flirt it didnt mean he wanted sex just that he enjoyed the way people reacted to his body or at least thats what micah and i thought it was entirely possible that nathaniel didnt know why he did it micah came up behind the couch your leopard didnt try to rise when nathaniel touched you micah said from behind the couch no it didnt i looked at him and found that jeanclaudes hair blocked my view micah moved so he was standing more between the two vampires so i didnt have to strain you touched a lot less of me and it did rise try again i said and held out my hand to him he hesitated as if he were a little afraid of what might happen but he took my hand i waited for my beast to rise but it didnt it was just micahs hand in mine i squeezed his hand and gave him a smile some tension in him eased as if hed been holding his breath about something he still seemed so serious almost sad was he jealous was the man who shared me best suddenly jealous there was no anxiety with the thought it was just a thought jeanclaudes power let it just be a thought without emotional baggage attached to it was this how welladjusted people reasoned if so damn it was peaceful i wanted to reassure him and take that worry from his eyes there was no thought to it no reasoning i wanted to reassure micah so i sat up and used our clasped hands to draw him downward we kissed but he pulled back from it those chartreuse eyes still held a shadow of worry i wanted that shadow gone i wanted him to know how much he meant to me i used both hands to drag him half over the couch back and give him the kiss he deserved i licked kissed ate at his mouth as if the taste of him were a drug and i needed a fix he fell into that kiss and spilled over the couch on top of me and into everyones laps he rose from the kiss laughing the worry erased from his eyes we ended up laughing together in a big pile not just micah and me but nathaniel and auggie with his big fangflashing laugh jeanclaudes laughter spilled over us all like something thick and sweet that you should be able to lick off your skin the sensation of it made me catch my breath micah shivered above me nathaniels hand grabbed my arm and micahs his fingers convulsing against our skin auggies hand tightened almost painfully on my leg i couldnt see him past micahs body but i could feel his body reacting to that touchable laugh it wasnt just auggies body that reacted his power flared from his hand and the warmth of his lap through the silk jammies and my jeans i felt his body like heat through the cloth that heat found the ardeur curled inside my body auggie called it and like a welltrained dog it followed his power micah whispered oh god i think he would have rolled off and fled for safety but nathaniels arm tightened on us both and auggies other hand pressed into his back he wasnt trapped but with the ardeur willpower is so hard to come by that small things can tip the balance jeanclaudes power pulsed to life against me but it wasnt his ardeur that rose the cool power of the grave spread out from his body like cool soothing water to quench the heat that auggie had awakened jeanclaudes power spilled through me over me and spread it spread to micah so that his eyes lost their panic nathaniels hands began to relax in their desperate hold on our bodies auggies breath came out in a long shaking sigh that was very bad of you augustine jeanclaude said in a voice that was thicker than normal with his french accent which meant hed had to work harder at stopping the ardeur than that easy flow of power had led us to believe micah halfcollapsed on top of me his head burying against my shoulder so that i could suddenly see auggies grinning face he was totally unrepentant jeanclaude can you truly blame me with all this bounty writhing on my lap he slapped micahs ass micah rolled off the couch and took me with him because i let him we ended on the floor close to nathaniel micah and i stood drawing nathaniel to his feet we moved back from the couch so the three of us faced the vampires faces no longer friendly id shut both vampires out of my head because i wasnt sure how to shut auggie out without shutting jeanclaude off too i just didnt have the finer points of metaphysics down yet i may not blame you but they will jeanclaude said and he sounded almost satisfied i got just a flash of why he was pleased that auggie was falling into the same traps that once had been his own downfall then he shut the link between us shut it tight as if he didnt want me to know what else he was thinking fine with me i had my own reasons for not wanting to share there had been a second just a second when the ardeur rising while all four of them were touching me hadnt seemed like a bad idea micah nathaniel and jeanclaude were one thing but auggie had rolled me yeah i was in love with him too but it was because of vampire wiles auggie had trapped me into love and that should be punished not rewarded richard would probably say that i was pretty good at punishing true love so love by deceit should carry a higher penalty shouldnt it i dont know you micah said and you dont get to touch me auggie spread his hands wide and made a howwasitoknow gesture my deepest apologies but if people keep falling into my lap im allowed to take a little advantage no i said youre not he narrowed those charcoalgray eyes at me i love you anita do you love me i almost said no but knew hed smell the lie i shrugged yeah thanks to your power yeah i do i shrugged again but what has that got to do with anything most women who love me dont act this angry most women in love are generous to their lovers in sex im generous everything else you gotta work for it auggie looked at jeanclaude she tastes of the truth jeanclaude nodded ma petite is a demanding lover in every way usually when a man says a woman is a demanding lover its a good thing but somehow i dont think thats what you mean auggie said jeanclaude gave me a smile that smile that was only for me and sometimes for asher the smile said he loved me and i had to smile back i felt my face soften and the anger fade i wasnt angry at jeanclaude i had finally gotten better at not spreading my anger over everyone ma petite and i have labored long together to form the love that you have gained by subterfuge he turned and looked at auggie i was your friend but you have used your arts to make me feel for you what you have not earned but i like ma petite know how to love and not be a prisoner to that love you can win or steal our love but you cannot steal a true relationship with us that must be won he turned and curled his long legs up on the couch he put his arm across the back of the couch not quite touching the other mans bare shoulder he cradled his head on his outstretched arm letting all those black curls spill along the white of the couch i couldnt see his face but i knew the look it was a charming seductive look his teasing look when he really didnt expect anything to happen he just wanted to remind you how scrumptious he was he usually used the look only when he was mad or i was it was a look to either end a fight or begin one auggie looked at him and the look was pained he saw jeanclaude understood the potential in that body and knew now that having had it once didnt mean youd get it again jeanclaude played hard to get when he thought it would gain him an advantage the look on auggies face said it was a really big advantage right now if it was real love true love then shouldnt it have made me feel bad to see auggie wanting hurting with doubt maybe but it didnt it made me happy in that small petty vindictive way that always promises a really bad relationship there are different kinds of love id learned that not less real or more real just different maybe what auggie could cause a person to feel wasnt true love after all maybe it was that kind of love that seems to come quick and leave slow but in the middle its just fights and pain punctuated by great sex until one of you has the courage to end it and walk away auggie turned that pained expression my way you would both turn me down he sounded genuinely surprised he glanced back at jeanclaude i understand jeanclaude hes maneuvering for power though my pride is hurt i must not be as good with other men as i thought i was jeanclaude answered with his head still poised on his arm if i feed your ego now then i may lose the advantage i have gained auggie nodded i understand that he looked at me but her i dont get her i know im good with women hell im an amazing lover i laughed i couldnt help it he gave me a dirty look do you disagree i shook my head no youre great i didnt sound like i meant it but i did maybe i just like my men a little more modest thats all he stabbed a thumb at jeanclaude if hes ever been modest about his prowess in bed it was false modesty why thank you jeanclaude said auggie shook his head thats not what i meant what did you mean i asked that he doesnt have a modest bone in his body i actually didnt agree with that but auggie didnt deserve the explanation that went with it so i let it lie youre entitled to your opinion which means you dont agree with me auggie said it means what i said auggie shifted his gaze to micah he looked at him looked at him the way that men usually reserve for women like he was wondering what micah would look like without his clothes here i stand all naked and youre not even looking at me nathaniel said should i be insulted he moved a few steps ahead of micah tossing all that heavy auburn hair over his shoulders so his body was framed by it he stood there and gazed at the vampire he gazed at him from those lavender eyes with that beautiful body maybe i like a little modesty too auggie said nathaniel moved his muscular arms to cover himself let the hair spill over one shoulder so that more of him was hidden he peeked coyly around his own body and hair gave innocent eyes let his face be as young as it was in years i was never sure how he did it but he could play the innocent down to his toes he could hide those jaded eyes and play the ingénue auggie laughed that bright happy laugh hes good he turned to jeanclaude where did you find so many beautiful men i didnt he said he looked past nathaniel to me anita you have a true eye for talent they arent talent to me theyre people i care about and i dont like games he motioned to nathaniel this one plays games and very well i think i nodded nathaniel likes games better than i do better than micah does but he doesnt play them with us auggie gave me a look that seemed to imply i was being naive once a hustler always a hustler anita was that meant to be mean i asked i thought you liked honesty he said it was meant to be mean micah said i know whore when i see it because i was one so was jeanclaude and asher and requiem and london mustnt leave out the ladies elinore cardinal anyone who was ever belles line was a whore were created to be whores nathaniel is not a whore i said and reached for him he pulled away from the touch and gave me eyes full of loss i was you researched us before you came here micah said you bet auggie said i touched nathaniels face and tried to put into my eyes how much he meant to me whatever he saw in my face made him smile a little he pressed his hand over mine pressing my hand against the curve of his jaw micah stepped in front of us both you knew looking at me like that would be an insult nathaniel stepped up took the attention because it wouldnt bother him something about him protecting me bothered you why jeanclaude raised his head curled his legs over each other in a way that let you know just how flexible he was but still managed to be ladylike for lack of a better word i know why i put one arm across nathaniels back and asked why jeanclaude and auggie exchanged a look if you think you can read me that well go ahead auggie said jeanclaude gave a small nod then looked at us augustine prefers women to men but one would have to be very very heterosexual indeed to ignore the beauty of both of you in his defense you did fall into his lap he behaved himself admirably there are vampires among our own kiss who would not have shown his restraint he offered such a small insult and you took it as a large one anita and i are not falling over each other to profess our love for him and that irks him it puzzles him then you who are animal thus lesser in the eyes of most vampires insult him too but i think it is more than that he looked at auggie i think he watched nathaniel use the only gift he had to protect micah did it bring back old memories augustine bad memories he leaned in toward the other man auggie stood up abruptly and wouldnt look at him my memories are my own then he realized what hed said and gave a bitter laugh for now at least until she dictates otherwise he wasnt referring to me jeanclaude lay back on the couch spreading his hair over the arm of it one arm carelessly above his head the other across his stomach one bare foot trailed over the carpet the other was tucked up on the couch his knee leaning against the back of the white couch he looked fetching and he knew it but it was the way auggie watched him that made the show there was real anguish in his eyes it hurt me to see his face like that you give me another taste of heaven and now i am in purgatory again you and she and he pointed at me can bring me into heaven at a whim and cast me into hell if it is your will he closed his eyes his face etched with pain i remembered you as gentler than this jeanclaude i remembered you as my friend friends do not use their powers against each other you woke ma petite s ardeur deliberately you meant to have her the fact that we both had you was an accident of power you remembered me gentler and less powerful you underestimated me and you have mistaken ma petite auggie opened his eyes and stared at the other vampire i dont understand what you mean by that ask our nathaniel how he won her heart i see his body i know how he won her heart you see nothing know nothing jeanclaude said mon minet tell him how you won her heart you call him my pussycat and im wrong about him auggie said nathaniel leaned a little harder against the hand i had on his naked back i didnt hustle anita nathaniel said but you tried auggie made it a statement nathaniel nodded i wanted her to want me i didnt know any other way to do that it worked auggie said nathaniel glanced back at me gave me a smile then turned back to auggie no it didnt he motioned at us all of course it worked only when i stopped trying to hustle her and just tried to learn how to love her learn how to love her you make it sound like a class or a degree you simply love people nathaniel laughed jeanclaude made a noise like he was trying not to laugh i looked at micah arent you going to laugh too micah shook his head i know better though there was the edge of a smile on his lips i scowled at them all fine laugh it up i dont get the joke either auggie said you will micah said and it sounded like a threat is it really that hard to date me this time claudia and some of the other bodyguards laughed i was just amusing the hell out of everyone tell me the joke i could use the laugh traviss voice came from the far hallway his face was tight and pinched with pain noel hovered beside him like he was waiting to catch him if he stumbled they both still looked too young to drive was it just age that had made joseph pick them for my feedings or was there some other reason i mean theres submissive and then theres cannon fodder everyone hed offered for my selection even the jocks had that newcar smell like they hadnt been driven around the block enough there had to be a reason hed offered me lambs when what i needed was lions why havent you shifted micah asked he was already moving across the living room toward them walking past auggie the vampire reached out tried to grab his arm micah moved so fast that i didnt really see auggie try to grab him and miss i saw the vampire reach out and micah just wasnt where he was reaching so fast it was like magic micah went to the werelions and started talking to them in a low voice he ignored the vampire auggie looked angry and something else something that was almost pain youve made your point jeanclaude micah does not like to be grabbed that is all the point that has been made jeanclaude said voice mild he was still lounging decoratively on the couch do you envy me my cats augustine i dont envy anyone even i could taste the lie micah started leading the werelions toward the love seat he stopped well out of reach and looked at auggie i really dont want to play games augustine i just want to get travis sitting down if you were in my territory id have to make a lesson of it of you but you arent my kittycat sit down i wont bother you micah walked wide round the vampire but gave him his back his eyes flicked to me and i realized he was trusting my reaction to let him know what auggie was doing i nodded like its okay micah led the two lions to the love seat petty games do not become you augustine you are master of a powerful territory you could have your own collection of lovers to rival mine he left the implication that we were all his lovers and we let it slide i was his lover and neither of the other men was bothered by the rumors im not just master of the city of chicago jeanclaude im a mob boss the mob allows you a family with a wife and kids a mistress whores but nothing else jeanclaude luxuriated against the couch arm you could never let any of them see you looking at me as you do right this moment auggie shook his head if you were a whore or a hustler id have to kill you if they saw me look at you this way but your rivals cannot see you now you can look at me any way you like fuck you jeanclaude youre going to use this look on my face to punish me and try to control me its just another kind of gun at my head we are master vampires we are all about control but i do not intend to punish you unless you punish us first what does that mean it means if you are cruel to us we will be cruel in return if you play nicely then so will we define play nicely i said when you saw the look of pain on his face did it not make your heart ache ma petite i wanted to lie but yeah the look of cynicism on auggies face flickered as if he didnt know what look would help or what look he dared give but so what thanks to his machinations i dont want to see him hurting so what augustine could come and visit us his mob connections could think he was trying to woo us for criminal activities or just that he was solidifying his alliance with us one master to another either way he could visit us periodically without arousing suspicions since he is a known mob figure it would explain why the visits would have to be out of the medias soglaring eye auggie watched the other vampire like a mouse thats had the cat tell him i wont eat you today half hopeful half afraid to hope what are you offering jeanclaude one that you do not try to make things worse for ma petite do not try to raise her ardeur or mine against our will do not abuse my hospitality by using your powers on my people i apologized for that he said you made a joke of your apology jeanclaude said i need to know if you are sincere auggie nodded i am sorry buthe looked away his hands in fists you dont understand what its like to be on the receiving end of the ardeur you gained the ardeur almost from the first moment it awoke with your blood lust youve never been its victim not true jeanclaude said he sat up suddenly brisk and almost businesslike ma petite can feed the ardeur from me as i can feed my ardeur from her we can be the victim of each others ardeurs im sorry i know that i know that you were as much enthralled by belle as any but still you can feed the ardeur and gain the rush of it i have nothing unless i can find a partner who carries it i had hoped that one or both of you would love me truly love me truly want me id hoped to bargain love for the ardeur and now i watch you both again he looked away as if he couldnt stand to look at either of us and you are not moved by me you jeanclaude you watch as belle used to watch me she he pointed at me she watches me like she hates me so cold so angry i dont understand it did my power work on her or only on me i feel the draw of her body but she doesnt seem to feel anything for me except anger ma petite does not like to be in love it always angers her most especially in the beginning auggie shook his head i dont understand that i shrugged join the club i went to the love seat nathaniel trailed me why hasnt travis shifted micah answered hes waiting for you waiting for me to do what bring my beast travis said and his face was almost gray with pain what you do here on your little visits would be a secret from your soconservative fellow criminals jeanclaude said just shift travis heal yourself he shook his head huddling over his arm auggie said and what would i be doing on these visits perhaps we could even visit you in chicago i was suddenly paying attention to their conversation if we went to chicago oh my god the energy there would no no fucking way youd feed on all my people then i felt what one feeding off me and the few people i had here did to your power level no way so you do not want to visit us again auggie forced himself to stand very straight shoulders back an echo of military something you know that i do but i wont trade my people and all my power for it i wont crawl for you jeanclaude i dont want you to crawl augustine what do you want you to stop trying to manipulate us accept that we hold the ardeur and you want it supply and demand dear augustine you bastard jeanclaude was suddenly standing so fast i hadnt seen it magic again you abused my hospitality first you manipulated my human servant so you could feed on the ardeur again you opened the way for belle morte to possess ma petite i am not the bastard here fine im the rat bastard youre right saying that i didnt understand i was inviting belle in doesnt fix it yeah i want to take back one of the women of belles line but no one but anita carries the ardeur she and you so yeah i came with the idea that if i had a chance at it id raise the ardeur you came here wanting the ardeur one more time what do you want now augustine dont make me say it jeanclaude ma petite is not a subtle woman unless you say it she will not understand it auggie looked at me but his eyes flinched like someone who was expecting to be hit i wont sell my people or my power base i wont humiliate myself but short of that i will do anything anything to have you and jeanclaude feed on me again the flinching gave way to fear want someone killed ill do it money drugs designer anything whatever you want whatever you need just dont tell me that ill never be in your arms again his face turned away but not before i saw the shine of unshed tears we do our own killing weve got enough money we are a drugfree zone dont bring that shit here if i want designer stuff ill buy it myself auggie stood there face averted shoulders hunched waiting for the blow to fall i have nothing to offer you then his voice was thick when he said it i am way past uncomfortable about what jeanclaude and i did with you it felt so fucking good to feed off you and that terrifies me auggie looked back at me his eyes held the tears back by sheer willpower but for better or worse i look at you and my heart aches i want to comfort you and that pisses me off ive had people i loved really loved use vampire powers on me i cut them off at the knees for it ive run from them for months not seeing them not even talking to them i moved toward him as i spoke a little closer with every sentence i just met you you arent my friend you forced me to love you but i dont know you he tried to give me angry eyes but the unshed tears that hovered there ruined the effect i underestimated you anita most people do i said i thought you were just jeanclaudes human servant i felt your power as a necromancer it should have been a warning but i went ahead with my plan i wanted the ardeur i wanted it so badly he smiled but not like he was happy and i was arrogant i am master of the city of chicago ive been a mobster since the s i have been powerful and a threat to anything in my path for centuries the only thing that ever truly defeated me was belle the tears trembled but still he held them back i stood there staring at him needing to look up only a little because he wasnt that tall normally i liked that in a man but now i was just pissed i was going to hold on to that anger because rage was the only thing that kept me from running my hands over his bare chest my hands itched with the desire to touch him it wasnt just love it was more and less than that it was a sort of magical compulsion it felt like love but it held elements of almost addiction i realized that auggie had rolled me well and truly his power had rolled me i had fought free of some of it and jeanclaude had helped but i wasnt free of what hed done to me but staring into his face those angry teary eyes i realized he wasnt angry at me he was angry at himself you rolled yourself i said he closed his eyes and turned away he spoke with his face averted from me the blade cuts both ways he whispered but if weve got better armor then more of your power hits you than us doesnt it he nodded still turned away i had a flash of satisfaction served him right but on the heels of that petty pleasure came regret regret like bitter ashes jesus i whispered he turned hed lost the battle with the tears they ran in pale pinkish tracks down his face of all the powers from belles line that ive had used on me auggie yours is the most awful how can you say that he asked the ardeur can enslave requiem can rape with a thought yeah requiems power would be the ultimate daterape drug but he doesnt use it that way he did once auggie said i processed that information tested if it was a lie but i didnt think it was i shrugged whatever he was as a young vampire hes not that now but the ardeur is just lust and so is requiems power it doesnt steal the emotions yours does and you think that is a worse crime i nodded yeah i do you hate me he whispered it i nodded yes he turned away and took a step i caught his arm he froze under that one small touch as if id turned him to stone i knew that reaction that was the reaction when the merest brush of someones hand meant more to you than almost anything in the world and it meant nothing to them it was how id felt off and on with richard as if my entire life were in the hand that touched him and he didnt care it was one of the reasons that id fought free of him it was too hard to love that much and hate that much at the same time i used that touch to turn auggie back to me he let me do it though he could have fought and won i was stronger than a normal human now but auggies bicep was thicker than my thigh in a fair fight id lose but auggies own power had made certain hed never have a fair fight with me i looked into his eyes watching him try to be angry instead of hurt what a terrible power you have augustine i said softly to offer true love and mean it people must have been willing to trade anything everything for such a gift he nodded without the ardeur to trap me back i could have made you love me without risking this much of myself i know everything about my power anita i can make a person love me really love me and not love them back i dropped his arm have you done that youre right anita i have a terrible power at first it was just the ability to make people like me then love but what i didnt realize at first was that it was a twoedged blade i could only cut my prey as deep as i was willing to be cut that changed i said he nodded the tear tracks were drying on his face he made no move to wipe them away i learned control i learned to trap others without trapping myself as jeanclaude learned with the ardeur i dont know if requiem ever learned how to cause lust in only one side of his equation i did not requiem came in moving slowly carefully he was wearing his usual black cloak so the injuries were hidden but he moved like things still hurt someone had used coverup on the worst of the facial bruises it was a good job you had to look to see the discoloration even then if i hadnt known it was bruises i might not have seen auggie glanced at him then back at me but most of us do eventually so if our power hadnt tripped you up youd have been willing to make me love you really love you and not love me back i didnt think that clearly but i would not willingly have loved you no you really are a bastard i said he nodded chicago has no mob but the oldschool italian ive kept out the russians the ukrainians the chinese the koreans the japanese no one absolutely no one takes power from me while almost every other mob stronghold has been whittled away ive held my territory against everyone to do that anita you have to be a bastard a coldblooded murderous bastard you hide it well i said the laugh is great i work at appearing human it makes the other bosses be less afraid the head of vegas is an oldtime mobster too auggie shook his head he stopped being a force in the mob when he became a vampire it takes a while to recover from it and by the time maximillian was powerful enough to take back some of it times had changed and he didnt change with them hes powerful and runs vegas but hes not a boss anymore we stood there staring at each other jeanclaude came up behind me he touched my shoulder and when i didnt pull away he hugged me from behind the look on auggies face seeing us together was painful and strangely satisfying if hed had his way it would be me with that stricken look and him cool and calm evil bastard but even thinking it i couldnt own it damn it the night wastes away soon we will have to change for the ballet jeanclaude said auggie nodded yeah yeah we need to decide if ma petite is too dangerous to go out among the other masters of the city auggie nodded again ill help you figure it out if i can i owe you for the breach in hospitality i owe anita for what i tried to do to her he looked away from both of us staring at nothing its been a long time since ive felt the full weight of my own power id forgotten how much it fuckin hurts excuse me noel was standing beside us we both turned and looked at him i dont know what he saw on our faces but he backed up fast until he was out of reach of both of us may i approach no auggie said yes i said we looked at each other noel dropped to all fours he didnt bow just dropped to all fours where he was standing i dont know what to do i cant please you both what is your problem auggie i said he asked a question i answered it auggie said fine you answered it for yourself not for me i stepped away from auggie closer to noel auggie grabbed my upper arm i tensed but didnt try to pull away i knew id lose if it was just brute strength i looked at him then at the hand on my arm i looked back at him you did not just do that and you did not just step away from me to go to anyone this submissive do you ever want to experience the ardeur again auggie he looked puzzled for a moment but i knew in a way that that was an act he might have been truly puzzled but he worked at human facial expressions you know i do move the hand or you wont ever touch me again we stared at each other for a moment then he let me go i heard you were dangerous powerful and quick to kill what none of my spies caught is that your force of will is the most dangerous thing about you god your eyes the determination in your eyes he shook his head you mean it you would truly cut me off because of this damn straight why because i grabbed your arm because youre acting like you own me nobody owns me micah got off the love seat and started toward us it drew auggies gaze to him your lion injured travis and abused noel i think you owe them some consideration spoken like a leopard auggie said so practical so willing to negotiate he made those all sound like bad things you really are very much your animal to call arent you micah said auggie nodded for those of us who are confused could you explain a little more i said micah said lions are the most aggressive society among all the cats to be a lion is to be always ready to defend your place in the pride unless you are very dominant or very strong or make people fear you enough to be left alone noel and travis are lesser and auggie treats them as if he were a dominant lion a few dominant lions in most prides mate with all the females josephs pride isnt run like that i said its closer to how the leopards run things micah nodded josephs pride is the exception anita remember i spent years trapped with a mixed group it can take forever to do business with lions because everything is a pissing contest joseph thinks more like a leopard very reasonable especially for a lion pussywhipped is what i heard auggie said his wife wouldnt tolerate sharing you know auggie almost everything coming out of your mouth is just digging the hole deeper what does that mean youre on her shit list micah said and you keep digging yourself a deeper pile of shit he actually smiled what are you smiling at auggie asked i thought you might be a threat to our domestic arrangement but you wont be able to behave yourself long enough to be a threat to any other man in anitas life jeanclaude has already invited me down to sample the wares again sample the wares i said what the fuck does that mean am i wares things to be sampled i dont fucking think so see micah said you keep this up and you wont ever get the ardeur again jeanclaude joined us you are being exceptionally careless with your words augustine it isnt like you to be so impolitic hes scared nathaniel said he came in behind me wrapping his arms around my waist pressing his nakedness against my back i didnt have to see his face to know the look it was a look hed only recently worn around me possessive it said mine it said ill share but its mine he usually only brought the look out when someone was behaving badly or he didnt like them i think we were all agreed on what we thought of auggie he was such bad news afraid of what pussycat auggie asked disdain thick in his voice wanting anita as badly as you do nathaniel said the comment made me tense but he pressed himself even closer and i relaxed against him he rested his face touching mine so we probably looked like one of those posed engagement shots auggie was right about one thing nathaniel could play games when he wanted to he played less and less as he got more comfortable with his life and himself but he hadnt forgotten how to play you dont like wanting anyone that much you see it as a weakness nathaniel said and youre beginning to realize just how hard to deal with anita can be i turned and looked at him forcing him to move his head enough for us to make eye contact do you find me difficult he grinned i like being dominated i started to say how hard id worked to ensure that he wasnt dominated then realized what the grin meant he was teasing me i tried to glare at him but i wasnt serious enough for it to work do not let your unease be your undoing in this augustine jeanclaude said whats that mean he asked it means that if you continue to say and do such things to ma petite then i will not be able to offer you the ardeur from her auggie had a moment where something flashed through his eyes for just a second i would have said it was fear maybe i am being stupid but i came to her looking for a julianna and what i found is belle jeanclaudes face went very still why would you say that i only saw you love two women in nearly six centuries jeanclaude you dont choose to love belle morte she chooses it for you you chose to love julianna i thought if you had finally fallen in love again that it would be someone like her i thought that the tough talk and the danger were just surface i thought if i scratched deep enough that anita would be more like the only other human i ever saw you love auggie shook his head youve got a physical type you like petite brunettes but beyond that he shook his head again jesus jeanclaude sweet jesus dont you ever have anything in a womans personality that you like every time did you come here thinking that if you pushed ma petite hard enough she would crack open and be gentle and feminine in the way of julianna it wasnt just you jeanclaude but asher too he never seemed to have a physical type but personality he liked gentle laughing comfortable women belle used to accuse him of being addicted to peasants when it came to women and you reasoned that if one woman had kept both of us happy she must meet the criteria for both of us auggie nodded logical jeanclaude said wrong but logical i had forgotten that about you forgotten what that you tried to make of love and emotions something logical something that could be understood auggie frowned at him youre making fun of me jeanclaude shook his head no but i would remind you that asher went on his own and found julianna i loved her with all my heart and soul but she was not of my choosing i came to love her but i did not begin to love her so ive got faulty data if you like jeanclaude said auggie looked at me with nathaniel still wrapped around me micahs right i think like a lion i dont see nathaniel as a problem because hes submissive i do feel the need to prove myself more dominant than the other dominants in your bed but damn there are a lot of them i shrugged holding nathaniels arms like youd keep a shawl from spilling down your arms is that why you tried to grab micah and why you stared at him like he was some kind of hooker auggie shrugged maybe i dont dig the macho shit auggie flex your dominance on your own time not on mine auggie pointed behind us turning us all to look at noel he was still on all fours waiting to be noticed you say your local rex doesnt run his pride the way most do he doesnt micah said his lion is reacting like he knows the rules josephs pride know how to be lions they just dont do that whole serengetiplainsdominancefight at each kill micah said thats what it means to be a lion auggie said actually i said lions native to forested regions dont do that the fluidity of dominance and the complicated social system seem peculiar to the african plains region auggie gave me a look i actually felt myself beginning to blush and fought it off nathaniel hugged me smart girls are so sexy he whispered i managed to say i have a degree in biology and i did research on the various animal forms once the coalition got going auggie gave an abrupt laugh ive been dealing with lions for thousands of years and ive never picked up a book about them i just stared at him how could you not want to learn as much about them as you could i live with lions i dont need to read about them i live with vampires and raise zombies damn near every night but i still read my trade publication and keep abreast of the articles on all the undead i shook my head at the level of arrogance he was admitting to the really scary part was that he didnt see it as arrogance i couldnt deal with auggie anymore i still felt the pull of his power but it was just love i could fight against love richard and jeanclaude had given me lots of practice doing that i patted nathaniels arm he kissed me on the cheek and let me go i went to where noel was waiting on the floor get up noel he got up eyes flicking behind me toward auggie it made me glance back but the vampire actually wasnt doing anything but looking at him i touched noels shoulder turning him so he couldnt see auggie whats up noel travis and i need to talk to you he tried to glance back at auggie i touched his arm kept him from doing it fine well talk i started toward the couch i herded noel with me micah and nathaniel came at our backs i wasnt sure if they wanted to hear everything or were covering my back in case auggie decided to get all weird again requiem was sitting beside travis he had a hand on the mans forehead he is going into shock i knelt in front of travis his face was graytinged jesus travis shift and heal this he gave a small tight shake of his head his voice was tight but breathy give me your beast make me change my beast is fine where it is travis you need to feed the ardeur on one of us or give us your beast anita please i looked into his painfilled face do you really want to have metaphysical sex while you have a broken arm he shook his head grimacing his upper body folded over his injured arm he spoke still bent over no not really but i also dont want you making that bluehaired freak our rex i wont he stared at me from inches away his face was beaded with sweat he was shaky and hurting and should have seemed weak but he didnt there was a lot of force in that look anita if you make him your animal to call or your rex to your lioness then hell share in your power no way would any dominant lion with that much power be able to leave the local pride alone lions arent like the rest of the big cats we arent live and let live were very much about whos the biggest cat in the pool joseph chose his regina for love not power shes nice but shes his wife not a power to be reckoned with if you give that other guy your power then he wont be able to leave us alone the lion in him will be compelled to find us and conquer us i looked back across the room at auggie you agree with his assessment of the situation auggie auggie nodded yes but im not sure that haven being your rex is as certain as you and the other cats think ive bound you with my power anita what if your reaction to my lions is so strong because of that not just your beast but my power helping make my lions more appealing it was the smartest thing hed said in a while it left me wondering which was the real auggie thoughtfulguy or sexistidiotguy i nodded okay maybe how do we test this little theory anita reacted to your lions before you rolled her micah said shit i said micahs right my initial reaction to pierce and haven was funky from the beginning before we had our little power duel auggie nodded then perhaps what your lioness is seeking is a dominant either way the way you react to pierce as opposed to these two will tell you something either my power has made it worse or your power seeks stronger prey jeanclaude believes that your ardeur seeks stronger prey why not your beast i glanced at jeanclaude getting chatty are we i am seeking answers ma petite augustine may not be trustworthy in all things but when he gives his word he keeps it so you asked his opinion after getting his word of honor he wouldnt tell our secrets anywhere jeanclaude nodded i didnt like it but i had to trust that jeanclaude knew what he was doing besides we did need help figuring some of this out the list of masters of the city that he trusted at all was damn small it might be smaller after this visit if i could vote on the list please anita travis said please give me your beast feed on one of us dont give that freak power over us i dont need to give my beast up and i dont want to raise it on purpose i dont know how to stop it once it starts start it and give it to me travis just shift he shook his head stubbornly then feed the ardeur on me noel said i looked into his face those eyes behind his wireframed glasses he looked so sincere and so young you dont know what youre asking noel just mark their necks nathaniel said i looked at him usually nathaniel liked to be the only one that i marked up he shared with micah but he didnt like it when i marked anyone who was just food usually you complain about that i said the jolt of power with pierce could happen with anyone who was a preternatural but what happened with haven when you tried to touch his neck that was different try to do the vampire greeting thing on their necks and see if you get a similar reaction beauty and brains auggie said lucky you i wasnt sure who he was calling lucky me jeanclaude or nathaniel we all ignored him all right nathaniel all right ill try but if this doesnt work at all travis has to shift and heal that arm i looked at travis as i said it travis nodded if you try it on both of us and nothing happens okay requiem tucked his black cloak closer around him the movement made me look at him you are master here jeanclaude but before she uses the ardeur again should we not talk that made me look back at jeanclaude he nodded yes but perhaps our young lions could go back to dr lillian for a time travis gave him a look that said clearly he wasnt moving youre kidding right are you refusing the direct order of the master of the city auggie asked i raised a hand and said dont start that shit again auggie not your city not your call i dont think travis feels well enough to walk back to dr lillian noel said what if we give our word that we wont tell anyone what you say you are young and live in a time where you do not truly understand what it means to give your word jeanclaude said besides micah said if joseph ordered you to tell him youd have no choice travis let out a long shaking breath cradling his arm against his body help me up noel what can be so private that youre making him move i asked we could move nathaniel said yeah i said all the ablebodied except for noel follow me are you really going to let her make us all move so the lion wont have to auggie said i stopped a few steps beyond the group because only nathaniel and micah were following me claudia was looking from jeanclaude to me and the rest of the guards were looking to her we were deep into the pissing contest and claudia was trying to decide what would help and what would hurt i pointed a finger at auggie im getting tired of you i switched the finger to jeanclaude please tell me you are not going to grandstand to save face in front of auggie it will cost us nothing to move down the hallway he lost a fight auggie said it should hurt i waved a hand at him as if waving him away im not talking to you im talking to my master thank you very much jeanclaude it wasnt so much that i could see him think it through because his face was perfect and unreadable but id been staring at that empty face for years now it was almost like i could feel him thinking it through he gave a small nod very well he went to me and i held out my hand to reward this show of common sense i see the local rex isnt the only one pussywhipped around here auggie said i started to get angry but jeanclaude pulled on my hand he told me with a glance that hed take care of it he turned those darkblue eyes on auggie and said and if you knew that she would cover you in the ardeur and love your body would you stay here or would you go where she wished you to go auggie stared at him for a second then started shaking his head over and over again he walked toward us then kept walking he walked into the far hallway and kept walking until he was lost to sight when he faces us again ma petite he will have his people at his back i do not think he will risk himself alone with us again i squeezed jeanclaudes hand it made him look at me i dont think hes afraid of being pussywhipped i said jeanclaude actually managed to look humble perhaps not what do you mean i was about to bind requiem to me forever we were having our supersecret meeting in the hallway it was empty and i didnt want to walk all the way back to jeanclaudes room i have tried to teach you different ways to feed ma petite and you have learned well i could have argued that but i let it go just explain what you said jeanclaude you dont have to protect my ego just say it you have fed on requiem but always before you were holding back or i was so deeply enmeshed with you when you did it that i was in some way controlling what happened i nodded and it is possible to know the innermost desire of a person the ardeur can give you a glimpse into his soul i know that it happens a lot he shook his head but that is exactly the point ma petite it should not happen a lot but it does thats how the ardeur works when i feed completely he shook his head again non ma petite it is not necessary to know someones hearts desire to feed completely it makes a better feeding more energy if you know their deepest wish and give it to them he nodded oui but what is the rule for all the gifts of my bloodline i frowned at him i dont oh that theyre twoedged swords all of belles powers cut both ways oui i was still staring at him if you have a point to make please make it because if that was a hint i dont get it when you first met micah what did you need in your life stop trying to make me reason this through jeanclaude just tell me you will not like it he said im getting that impression but remember im a jerkthebandaidoff kind of girl just tell me you needed help with the wereleopards and with all the other shapeshifters that you were beginning to try to help it was your willingness to help many kinds of shapeshifters that laid the groundwork for our solovely coalition you yourself said that so much that was wrong with the lycanthrope community could be fixed if they would only talk to each other i remember all this so what you needed a man in your life who simply said yes instead of arguing with you or running his own agenda you needed someone to put your needs first he looked at me as if hed been very clear it wasnt clear to me doesnt everyone i said i think i get it micah said softly i turned to him then tell me my hearts desire was safety for my people and a partner powerful enough passionate enough to help me save them we both got what we wanted most out of each other i frowned trying to think then said slowly are you saying that i caused micah to be everything i needed him to be i looked at jeanclaude are you saying that even now hes like under my power that thats why he never argues with me that hes under a spell i looked back at micah to see if his face was as horrified as mine felt he looked the same as ever calm ready to do what was needed so practical so so everything i needed in a man shit he smiled at me dont look so horrified anita do you normally argue more than this he shook his head i was always pretty easygoing and years trapped in chimeras group took care of most of my rebellion it was too expensive to the people around me to be a smartass is everything we have just vampire tricks except im the vampire is it all a lie this was the reaction i feared you would have jeanclaude said what reaction am i supposed to have i asked and it was almost a yell you missed part of his point micah said what part if the ardeur made me into your perfect mate then it made you into mine its a doubleedged sword remember was i under a spell my own spell it was too complicated for me i turned back to jeanclaude i dont understand this i mean if this is true then how could we not have noticed but ma petite you did notice your nimirraj is the first man you have ever had sex with on first meeting he is the first man you have ever allowed yourself not to push away is he not i wanted to argue and i couldnt damn it but i couldnt shit i said i turned and looked at nathaniel he gave me a gentle smile like youd give someone in the doctors office who just got bad news if this is true about micah and me then oui ma petite the same would be true of nathaniel no it was different very different with both of them but they are very different men one hearts desire is not the same as anothers i resisted nathaniel for months before we had sex oui but it was not sex that nathaniel wanted not truly he wanted to be loved and valued for himself not just for his body by denying him sex but loving him you gave him what he wanted most i felt like i was choking i couldnt breathe my back hit the wall i leaned against it trying to think and failing the only two men in my life that i havent seen all the way through are you and richard jeanclaude nodded i knew how to keep you out and richard was strong enough and conflicted enough not to know his own hearts desire but everyone else i stared at him asher damian maybe even jason hell i dont know requiem spoke then i think that your ardeur holds not just lust anita but love as belles ardeur did as my ligeias ardeur did ive been inside belles head she wouldnt know real love if it bit her on the ass he gave a small smile as if id amused him she knows the ardeur as a warrior knows his weapon she knows the art of causing love and devotion even addiction in others without suffering it herself are you saying im doing it wrong he seemed to think about it then nodded how do you know i asked there was a moment when you looked deep into me i felt you see all the way down into my soul anita i felt you caress the deepest pain i own belle morte would have coaxed that pain to life and used it to torment me you were going to try to heal it i was supposed to heal you right physically ma petite not emotionally he touched my face staring at me as if he were trying to read something from my face and certainly not his deepest hurt he let his hand drop away but continued to study my face i dont know how to do anything halfway jeanclaude its all or nothing for me you should know that by now he nodded and looked unhappy you are quite right ma petite i am your master and this is all my fault i should have seen it seen what exactly you have been obsessed with learning to control the feedings ma petite it has made me obsess with you but there are other things to learn about controlling it things i have neglected to teach you you could not have taught her control of this not when the ardeur was fresh jeanclaude requiem said i was with ligeia from the moment she gained the power the first few months are a wild thing i thought she would go mad with it he gripped jeanclaudes shoulder my understanding is the ardeur rose for the first time with micah there was no controlling it he looked at me and at micah it has actually worked out extremely well for all concerned i turned and looked at micah and nathaniel i trapped you both i rolled you they exchanged a look then both looked back at me we love you micah said nathaniel moved in as if hed hug me i moved farther down the wall out of reach but its all vampire powers its a lie doesnt that ruin it for you i trapped you i trapped you both its worse than what auggie did to us its not fake its like real love i made you both fall in love with me thats like evil if you made us fall in love with you but didnt love us back maybe it would be evil micah said but you do love us back but its a lie micah its all a lie he gave me a look that look that said i was being silly but i wasnt being silly was i ive been in love before anita remember becky your high school sweetheart college fiancée i said he nodded that was real anita she was the love of my life and if she hadnt dumped me i wouldnt have known that love could get any better than that becky had dumped him when he survived the attack that made him a wereleopard she just couldnt handle his being furry once a month of course shed had other problems with him before that what i thought was a huge bonus shed thought was a huge downside micah stepped toward me i slid along the wall my hand out i didnt want him to touch me not right then mainly because if he did id lose this fight id always wondered at how my body reacted to him no one had that effect on me not to that degree now i knew it was vampire mind tricks but i was the vampire who had done it fuck i know what true love feels like anita this is it we are all happier than weve ever been the only thing that will spoil what we have is if you freak about this how can i not freak about this micah i felt movement a second before hands touched me the hands brushed my bare arms and i felt calmer i leaned back against damians body let his arms enfold me the fear anger confusion just washed away the iron control of his emotions that he had learned at the hands of his creator was what he shared with me i leaned back into that peaceful control for a handful of seconds the panic was still there but i could ride it i was still horrified but it wasnt the only thought screaming through my brain i leaned my head back against his chest and looked up at him hed tied all that bloodred hair back from his face i stared into a face that my magic had actually made prettier more perfect hed been handsome before now he was beautiful i looked up into those eyes like looking into the perfect green of an emerald if it could look back at you if a jewel could burn with intelligence and need hey damian and my voice sounded almost drugged i was so calm hey he said smiling down at me i blinked at him i feel so good i dont remember you ever making me feel this calm so fast you love micah dont you i frowned at him yes you love nathaniel dont you i frowned harder yes but its all a lie his hand swept up the line of my neck as his face bent toward me does it feel like a lie no and my voice was small he whispered the last few words against my lips you all love each other isnt that more important than how you fell in love with damian touching me it was utterly reasonable to say yes he kissed me those lips that my own magic had made fuller more kissable covered mine he drew back enough to whisper love is too precious to waste anita he was right of course he was right but it wasnt like me to see logic this quickly this wasnt like me at all damian lowered his mouth over mine his hand kneading my throat as he pressed my back against his body always before when he was helping me be reasonable kissing him was a cold thing today i gave myself to his kiss to his hands even as part of me knew this was just more vampire mind games damian was my vampire servant he gained power as i gained power it hadnt occurred to me that he might be able to use that power against me i broke the kiss pushed him away hard enough to make him stumble his eyes were drowning emerald fire didnt it feel good he asked i shook my head not trusting my voice but the moment he wasnt touching me the panic was back the fear and it was worse now i was surrounded by vampire tricks surrounded even inside myself and that was one person i couldnt run from micah tried to hug me again but i moved around him toward the living room nathaniel brushed my arm and i moved away i was shaking my head and wasnt sure why this does not have to be a disaster ma petite yes i said it does anita micah said i dont care that it was vampire magic that brought us together were together thats what matters he held his hand out to me i shook my head no because if you touch me ill give up i wont fight i can never win a fight when you touch me the effect you have on my body overwhelms everything else and thats a bad thing he made it a question his hand still held out toward me i wondered why your touching me always overwhelmed me and now we know its vampire powers its mind tricks its an aftereffect of the ardeur micah he let his hand drop slowly i love the way your body reacts to mine anita he closed his eyes hugged his hands into fists in front of his chest i absofucking love that you react to me like im intoxicating he opened his eyes and gave me the full stare out of those yellowgreen kittycat eyes dont you love it too i opened my mouth to say no but it would have been a lie the vampires could sense lies but wereanimals could smell them i told the truth yes i loved it he shook his head not loved not past tense you love it you love it so much youre afraid to let me touch you now please micah dont do this do what make you happy make us both happier than weve ever been for longer than weve ever been happy in our entire lives were both almost thirty anita it doesnt get better than what we have weve all tried other people other ways of living this works for us dont throw it away because it started with the ardeur he took a step toward me we always knew that you and i began with the ardeur anita maybe but not all of it noti turned away from him i couldnt keep being this stubborn and look at the anguish on his face but looking away put me looking at nathaniel it wasnt an improvement first he was nude and any of the men i loved only had to take their clothes off to win most arguments with me i might never admit that out loud but it was the truth nathaniel nude was a treat but what made it even harder was the look on his face so hurt so terribly hurt anita he said would you really throw us away could you just walk away just like that my throat was tight but not with panic anymore the panic had company now can you choke to death on unshed tears he stared at me those lilac eyes sparkled through the fall of all that hair i stared at his eyes so bright like firelit amethyst as he tried not to cry then the first tear glittered down his cheek and i was undone i went to him i hugged him and he collapsed so suddenly in my arms that it pulled us both to the floor he clung to me weeping and i was left drowning in the vanilla warmth of his hair micah stood there looking down at us was it a lie it didnt feel like a lie the man in my arms felt real and his tears were real the thought that i could turn away from him because of something so petty had broken his heart just a little micah had said it we knew that the ardeur had been the beginning of us hadnt i always known it was the beginning of nathaniel and me too if i hadnt needed to feed the ardeur i would never have allowed him to move in with me i would never have slept with him clothed and strangely chaste feeding by a kiss a touch but never with release for him i would never have done all that without the ardeur to feed i would never have fallen in love with him if the ardeur hadnt kept him in my way i hugged nathaniel and held one hand out to micah he smiled and came to me to us he dropped to his knees and put his arms around us both nathaniel cried harder i held them both as hard as i could micah kissed me and i kissed him back the taste of his mouth was the taste of sex to me just the kiss and my body reacted to it nathaniels hands spilled over my breasts had i taught them that the only way to make up a fight was sex or had the ardeur preordained that sex was our currency of healing it was a chickenegg sort of question i let it go in the sensation of hands and mouths on my face and neck and body we licked the tears off nathaniels face and somewhere in all that closeness i let go of my doubts i could worry about it later right at that moment nothing seemed more important than touching the two of them we both came up for air to the smell of lion micah growled it was noel on hands and knees he had his forehead pressed to the stone floor one hand held out toward us travis collapsed to his knees behind him cradling his broken arm he leaned against the wall heavily and for the first time it occurred to me that maybe the broken arm wasnt the worst of his injuries wereanimals were tough bastards i hadnt even asked if there were other things broken i hadnt even asked exactly what the doc had said they had just been another embarrassing problem another pint of blood to lay on the altar of the ardeur and my beast i looked at micah i agree with the lions i dont want haven i turned to nathaniel he smiled i agree with micah though jeanclaude or someone needs to help you not to bond with them completely agreed i said i looked behind us for jeanclaude how do we do this i can help you not use the ardeur as deeply but i do not know if i can control the lion within you i can and it was auggie hed added a long black cloak his shoulders were so wide that it made him look square his head too small for all that body the bottom of the cloak puddled on the floor because any vampire here that the cloak could belong to was a foot taller the cloak looked borrowed and it was but octavius and pierce were at his back and they didnt look borrowed at all they looked perfectly at home the two bodyguards at their backs looked right at home too standing orders were that pierce and haven got four guards i wondered if haven now unconscious had two of his own probably i want this to work auggie if it can i said i need your word that you wont spoil it tell me exactly what you want me to swear to anita he said his face was empty pale with concentration his eyes looked huge and even darker like the sky before it goes black i thought about what hed asked then looked again to jeanclaude help me to word it okay i will second augustine on this ma petite tell me what you wish him to swear to i want to really try to bond with noel i dont want him to interfere with that but i dont want to bond to noel the way i did with micah and nathaniel i want to see if its just lions im hunting or if auggies lions are especially tasty if my lions are more tasty it may not be because they are my lions but because your power seeks something more dominant than whats kneeling on the floor i think in your rexs zeal not to give power to a rival he has sent you food that your inner lioness will never accept my inner lioness i said though its hard to be disdainful when youre on your knees with men still hanging on to you but i managed it inner beast then he said voice empty his face showed nothing he was finally acting more like all the other really old vamps that id ever met will the real augustine please stand up are the lions more likely to want a dominant i asked i thought you had read up on lions he said i thought about it then nodded if a new male takes over the pride second thing he does is kill the cubs it means he doesnt help the lion he drove off breed successfully and it puts the females into estrus faster so he gets to mate auggie nodded it makes the females of most wereprides very tough to impress i shook my head youre not saying that werelion prides are run like real lion prides that the new leader kills the children thats ridiculous he shrugged those big shoulders under the long cloak it has happened i turned back to noel and travis you guys know about this happening for real they both said no theyre too young to know what we did before we became legal this from pierce are you saying that some men do kill the babies of the old rex ive seen it pierce said in a very clipped voice i almost asked which end of the fight were you on but i didnt there was a look in his eyes almost a flinching either hed been a victim or hed done things that haunted him i had enough nightmares of my own id let pierce keep his to himself i guess that would make you want the strongest lion around i said but my voice was a little thin the pregnancy scare was too recent how would it feel to go through nine months then labor and have some stranger kill your baby after first killing your husband i said it out loud if someone did that to me he wouldnt survive very long prides with really strong females dont get taken over much pierce said because you gotta sleep sometimes he almost smiled when he said it i nodded thats how id be thinking your local pride has very weak females auggie said his voice still that empty masters voice so it could have been almost anyone talking your rexs wife is weak and since the females of the lions are just like the males its forced him to reject a lot of strong women are you saving that if someone killed joseph there wouldnt be enough fight in his pride to do much about it his brother would be a problem pierce said but other than that yeah you would definitely have to kill both of the brothers auggie said but after that the pride would be helpless he looked past me at the lions noel was staring at him with a sort of soft horror it was travis who said sounds like youve thought this through its why you brought dominants i said you came planning for pierce or haven to take over the local pride auggie gave me flat eyes you evil bastard its not me thats left his pride open ripe for the picking anita he did that himself he loves his wife thats not a crime i said auggie shrugged anita noels small voice brought me back to look at him he inched closer to me his hand out his face showing his fear please anita please try me i wanted to say i wont let them hurt you and your people but i couldnt not and be truthful we had an alliance with the lions true but if joseph had truly let his pride get this fucked up and it was truly the lions way to take over the pride like this then no other animal could interfere we could help each other but we couldnt interfere directly in the dominance hierarchy of the other groups not unless we wanted to start glomming us all into some kind of supergroup wereanimals didnt do well in mixedspecies groups too many cultural differences the only way i could send haven home was to find another lion that my lioness liked shit noel stared at me hand outstretched the fear in his face made him look even younger and more inexperienced no animal group could operate without dominants you needed muscle and strength and strength of will if joseph had truly done what auggie said then his pride was in the gravest of dangers if it wasnt haven or pierce now it would be someone else later of course if one of them were my semipermanent pomme de sang then other lions might hesitate to attack them hell master vamps from around the country who hadnt had the ballet troupe go anywhere near them were offering up pomme de sang candidates wed be seeing potential feeds for months even after this batch went home wed already had inquiries from animal groups that werent aligned with any vampire you know youre big fish when all the sharks want to come play i did the only thing i could think of i took noels hand and drew him toward me i wasnt sure what wed do when he got to me but wed think of something noel smelled of fear he smelled like food but not food for the ardeur he smelled like meat that just hadnt stopped squirming yet i pushed him onto the floor raised his shirt to his shoulders i stared down at his bare chest and stomach he was breathing so fast so hard that his stomach rose and fell with it i lowered my mouth over that pale soft flesh i stopped with my face just above his skin so close that my breath came back warm against me with that warm breath came his scent stronger richer it made me close my eyes but i was too far into beast mind for sight to help or hurt that much it was all about the smell of him the sound of his breathing and his heartbeat i laid my ear against his chest so i could hear that frantic beating so clear so wonderfully afraid i put my hand on his stomach so i could ride the movement of it as he breathed slow your breathing noel micah said or youre going to hyperventilate i cant help it noel said voice breathless shes not thinking about sex if you act like food then youre food travis said from behind us i lay there on the floor my head over his heart my hand on the quick rise and fall of his stomach so soft so tender the thought slid my face down his body until i rested at his sternum the upper edge of his stomach so close now that i could not so much see the fast rise and fall of his body as feel it under my cheek i rolled my face over and kissed his stomach he jerked as if id bit him and made a wonderful whimpering sound i buried my mouth in the soft easy flesh of his belly i took as much of his flesh into my mouth as i could hold and not draw blood i bit him hard and deep and it took all my willpower to rise up from that flesh and leave it whole i pushed back from him crabwalked until the wall stopped me the sensation of all that warm tender flesh filled my mouth i could still feel it a sensory memory that would haunt talk to me anita micahs calm voice i shook my head food i whispered just food noel is just food micah said i nodded eyes still closed get up noel traviss voice unhappy angry im sorry noel said i finally opened my eyes to watch him drag his shirt back over his body he wouldnt meet anyones eyes as if hed failed its okay noel auggie and pierce are right joseph shops for bottoms hes not a bottom nathaniel said if he had been hed have enjoyed the biting and the danger it might even have been enough to push you from food to sex nathaniel shrugged hes too straightlaced once i would have argued i would ask one favor travis said we looked at him can you come to me instead of making me crawl to you i remembered what id forgotten to ask and asked it is the broken arm the worst injury at least two cracked ribs maybe a small break dr lillian said shed need xrays to be certain no concussion too hardheaded for it i guess he tried to smile and almost made it i crawled toward him micah moved so i could do it nathaniel crawled beside me i glanced at him i dont think travis will want company on this im the only submissive youve collected everybody else is a dominant that stopped me made me think about it i actually sat back on my knees damian isnt a master no but hes submissive because he doesnt have the power to be dominant im submissive because i like it i frowned at him if you have a point make it ask if the pride has anyone who swings more like i do i thought about all the men was nathaniel right was everyone else a dominant personality except for him richard yep asher yes jeanclaude way yes micah yes jason no jason i said you rang and it was jason coming into the hallway his short blond hair was cut neat and tidy like a junior executive the body would have qualified if the executive worked out in the gym enough he was about my height short for a man and boyishly handsome most of the time but he glanced at noel getting shakily to his feet travis with his obvious wounds nathaniel and i so close together and him so very nude jason took it all in and his face changed i could never put my finger on it but he looked suddenly older more grownup and his eyes the color of spring skies filled up with a knowledge a weight of intelligence he hid it most of the time but there was a very nice mind in that smiling very nice body the look vanished replaced by his usual smartass flirting look but i knew him too well now to be fooled jason subs if he wants to but hes a top at heart nathaniel said smiling up at his friend we were never going to marry nathaniel and i but if we did i knew who hed pick for best man tell me what position you want me in jason said and im your man he wiggled his eyebrows and gave me that grin that grin that said he was thinking cheerful nefarious thoughts most people made sex dark but not jason he was a cheerful lecher i had to smile he just had that effect on me hell he had that effect on most people sorry im shopping for lions today not wolves actually ma petite i think we are trying to establish how you react around all your beasts but lions for now looks like i got here just in time jason said youre not the only wolf in the hallway graham said sounding sullen jason gave him a look that wasnt entirely friendly you didnt see that from jason much i suppose not his tone was dark almost angry i wondered what had been happening between the two of them to get that level of animosity from jason he was one of the most easygoing people i knew as far as im concerned i said jason is the only wolf in the hallway why is he the only wolf that you fuck besides richard graham asked ah now i knew why graham was pissed had he tried to bully the smaller man probably graham had this backward idea that size and strength were more important than anything else i dont know but comments like that are what help keep you off the list i said step back claudia said to him he scowled at her muscled arms folding over his chest she took a small movement toward him are you challenging me her voice was flat and empty as she said it it made the threat all the more ominous graham shook his head and backed up until he was against the wall he sulked but he did what she asked i hoped he got a girlfriend soon because his little tantrums were really beginning to bug me as if the thought had conjured her out of the dimness meng die appeared farther down the corridor it was the first time id seen her since shed sliced requiem up i did not want her here while i tested my beasts she was one of the few women who ever made me think delicate she was tinier than i was so fragile looking maybe that was why she almost always wore black leather very dominatrix the clothes suited her though catlike skintight scary and sexy all at the same time yeah scary sexy that summed meng die up perfectly she slinked on black highheel boots toward graham it was as if claudia had seen this show before because she said hes working meng die meng die made that delicate triangular face pout but it never reached those uptilted eyes she changed direction without so much as a regretful glance at graham and that that was why graham wasnt devoted to her why shed almost broken clays heart shed wanted graham but if she couldnt have him that was fine no man likes to know for certain that it doesnt matter to a woman if hes the man in her arms or not come to that a woman doesnt like it when a man treats her that way either okay no one likes knowing that theyre utterly replaceable we all like to be special meng die slinked toward requiem he backed away from her jeanclaude said you are not to touch him again meng die she looked at jeanclaude never again not unless he wishes it she turned that lovely face to requiem do you truly wish never to touch this body again she made her hands flow over her curves as she said it some of the men in the hallway followed her hands down her body auggie and his men did requiem didnt jeanclaude didnt none of the wereleopards did jason did though the view was nice if you didnt know the mind that went with it meng die walked past me and the leopards and the lions like we werent there she went for jason he had looked and he wasnt on the forbidden list she entwined herself around him head on his shoulder even in the heels she was shorter come play with me jason he laughed and shook his head ive got a report to give i had no idea what report he was talking about afterward she made it a question he smiled but said no thanks but no she ran her hand over the front of his jeans apparently she wasnt feeling the least bit subtle today he grabbed her wrist and said no she jerked away from him why is it no because shes here she pointed at me i hadnt known that jason and meng die had had sex it must have shown on my face because she said you didnt know i shook my head we had a lot of fun until you fucked him until you fed the ardeur off him i stood up and micah and nathaniel moved with me i didnt know he was your boyfriend i said meng die doesnt have boyfriends jason said just people she racks and whats wrong with that she asked not wrong just not my thing you enjoyed it jason i know you did youre good at fucking he said so are you and she made it a purr not a cat purr but that alto sultry sound that some women can make ive never been able to do it jason grinned at her but sometimes i prefer to make love not just fuck i couldnt explain the difference to you she frowned at him the sultry look slipping around the edges making love its all just pretty words for fucking i glanced at jeanclaude you couldnt teach her the difference he gave an elegant shrug some lessons come too late she was much abused by the time i found her no meng die said no my story is not for her i want no ones pity least of all hers jeanclaude gave that gallic shrug again that meant yes no everything and nothing as you like he said you just fuck anita too shed turned back to jason he smiled but gentler this time anita makes it impossible to just fuck her what does that mean meng die asked she was my friend my good friend before we ever had sex you cant just fuck someone thats important to you because if you screw it up you lose more than potential sex you lose your friend her friendship was more important to me than the sex so it had to be making love not just racking i dont understand you she said requiems voice then because sex is almost never casual for anita it makes sex with anita almost never casual meng die shook her head i dont understand i know you do not he said and for that i am sorry dont pity me she shouted it i couldnt see any weapons on her but the leather could have hidden surprises slender surprises but blades can be amazingly easy to hide i want to fuck who will fuck me her words hit the air like a stone and smashed into a suddenly heavy silence she looked at the men one at a time she went to damian but he backed up shaking his head why shake your head she is your master not your wife damian actually looked a little embarrassed as he said we fuck when we cant find anyone else again news to me so i am who you fuck if you cant find anyone else really that purring contralto went from sounding sexy to sounding ominous youve turned me down enough meng die when graham or clay or requiem was available you didnt even look at me it stops being flattering to be last on a womans list she looked at auggie and he just said were doing business she turned to noel he backed away as if shed struck at him you scare me he said but anita does not scare you she scares me less than you do meng die frowned at him why i didnt expect noel to answer but he did anita may hurt me by accident but i think youd hurt me just to see me bleed damn perceptive for walking food i felt london coming down the hallway felt him in a way that i shouldnt have been able to feel him he was seeking me using his vampire powers to find his fix again i looked up and found him coming toward us all dark and pale meng dies face brightened when she saw london she practically skipped toward him he glanced at her but that was all his eyes were set on me as if i were his north star and he were lost at sea without me shit she slid her small hand through the bend of his arm their blackonblack clothing blending together nicely come on london lets leave them to their business not right now he said and didnt look at her when he said it he looked at me she stiffened gazing slowly up at him then followed where he was looking she came to me and started shaking her head no she said not london you think hes dark and morose he is dark and morose i said but you fucked him anyway she said i shrugged and gave her the sorry face i mean what was i supposed to say you dont even like him she said it was sort of an accident i said how do you accidentally have sex it was a good question i did not have a good answer london walked away from her he never looked at her as he glided toward me i watched her face pale with anger her hand slid to the small of her back and i knew she had a weapon i took a breath to say something but claudia and lisandro were ahead of me the guns under their arms just seemed to magically appear in their hands claudias gun touched meng dies shining black hair lisandros hand was hidden by meng dies slender back claudia said one word dont everyone on our side of the hallway moved closer to us everyone behind meng die moved farther down the hallway everyone except the bodyguards that is the bodyguards on pierce and octavius started to join them but i shook my head they stayed at their posts we had four guards on meng die two of them with guns plastered to her two extra guards wouldnt make a difference on her but it might on auggie and his crew it was one of those moments when the world seems to hold its breath because the next breath may be someones last do not die this way jeanclaude said it in a voice that shivered down the skin but he was directing that voice at her especially for her i knew what it was like to be the target of that voice the tension left her shoulders her eyes were unfocused for a second lisandro used that second to take the knife out of her hand meng die reacted to it but too late she started to turn as if she meant to go for her blade but claudia pressed the gun barrel hard into the side of her head meng die wisely chose to stop moving check her claudia said lisandro holstered his gun and frisked meng die he did it quickly efficiently and very very thoroughly there are rivets and ridges throughout the leather they could hide a few things do you want me to rip the leather open he asked it as if it were an everyday question your word of honor that you are not carrying anything else claudia said meng die hesitated then finally said there was just the one knife this outfit doesnt leave much room for hiding weapons claudias eyes flicked to jeanclaude its your call jeanclaude do we back up or do we finish it will you behave yourself meng die he asked and this time in as normal a voice as he could manage she gave him a look of such hatred that she didnt look quite sane i will not try to kill anyone tonight not exactly a rousing yes but jeanclaude nodded claudia hesitated then stepped back and lowered her gun she didnt holster it though i couldnt say i blamed her london went to one knee in front of me head bowed it was a gesture that should have had a cloak and a plumed hat with it so oldfashioned i am able to serve my lady again if she has need it took me a second or two to work out what he meant you mean feed the ardeur again he looked up yes i looked down into that soserious face you know if you act as food for the ardeur too often it can be fatal yes but i can feed the ardeur every two hours or so in a twentyfourhour period without ill effect i stared at him youre joking right why would i joke about such a thing i dont know but london even the strongest most powerful person i feed on can only feed twice in a row with a break of at least six hours between it is my gift anita he said london is the perfect food for the ardeur he can truly feed every few hours day after day to no ill effect in fact belle morte said he seemed to gain power from it jeanclaude said im scrambling to figure out how to feed and control this thing and we have someone who is made to take care of it and you didnt mention it to me sooner and if i had he said simply i opened my mouth to protest then closed it if he had what would i have done id have accused you of trying to set me up with london since he did not wish to be captured by the ardeur again i thought it wisest not to mention his talent to raise the possibility of it would be i felt a betrayal of his trust for it would raise the issue of his being food for the ardeur he was most adamant against it ma petite whats the downside to being able to feed the ardeur like this i asked looking back at the vampire kneeling at my feet everyone is eventually addicted to the ardeur but for me the addiction is immediate youre addicted again i said yes his eyes were so peaceful more peaceful than id ever seen them he looked happier and more at home in his own skin than ever before i looked up and it was nathaniels gaze that i caught he looked solemn eyes not peaceful at all you always look happy at the beginning of an addiction nathaniel said what happens later i asked you die i did try sniffing traviss neck but he hit my radar as wounded antelope since i didnt want to rip his throat out i had to back off touching pierces hand had been an electrifying experience shit i made noel take travis to the hospital room in the back so he could shift and heal the damage i had to give my most solemn word that i would not bond with either pierce or haven and bring disaster to their pride while they were resting i promised i meant it i wasnt sure how to keep the promise but i did mean it we all went to sit in the living room while we tried to get through our list of metaphysical emergencies before we had to get dressed for the ballet we are running out of time jeanclaude auggie said ma petite was able to free requiem of an ardeur related compulsion earlier today we had thought to use the same technique to free you augustine are you saying that your freedom from the slavery of the ardeur can wait i need to send octavius to fetch my clothes for this evening he has expressed auggie smiled reservations about my being here without him at my back i came thinking id get my ashes hauled and make a smash and grab on the local lions still might do the whole lion thing but the rest didnt work out like i planned you are not going to do the whole lion thing i said i was on the love seat sitting between micah and jeanclaude nathaniel and damian were on the floor at our feet damian was touching my leg and that one touch helped me think hed promised not to do anything but help me stay calm there would be a learning curve on damians new power level too the grade on all of it seemed pretty damn steep jeanclaude patted my knee as if warning me to be calm i was calm damians touch almost guaranteed that i was also determined that our invitation to the master of chicago was not going to rain bad stuff all over our local werelions most of the werelions in the midwest owe allegiance to my pride its not your pride i said even if your animal to call is the rex of that pride its his pride or hers his auggie said fine but that doesnt make it yours auggie glanced at jeanclaude she believes that doesnt she know the law ma petite knows that in the vampire world all that my servants own is mine i had known it but i hadnt made the logic jump it cant be your pride because if something happened to your lion to call then you couldnt hold the pride if you cant hold the group without the help of someone else then its not yours auggie your lion dies and your hold on his pride dies with him is that a threat he said softly damian squeezed my calf and jeanclaude squeezed my knee micah moved closer to me sliding his arm across my shoulders so that he was holding me and jeanclaude really it didnt seem to bother anyone but me not yet i said damian laid his head in my lap jeanclaude stroked my leg his way of saying be careful micah was as close as he could get to me nathaniel just cuddled more solidly between jeanclaude and me wrapping his arm around my leg but laying his head on jeanclaudes knee id never seen him do that before to the vampire jeanclaude petted his hair absently like youd stroke a dog as if it were very everyday it wasnt everyday and i realized that nathaniel was helping us negotiate auggie had proved that he liked men maybe not as much as he liked women but still hed remarked on nathaniels hair made a pass at micah nathaniel wasnt flirting he was lying with his body lying that he and jeanclaude had a closer relationship than they did would it bother auggie and if it did which way would it bother him would it disturb him because its guyonguy sex or would he be jealous hell it might bother him both ways a lot of men seemed conflicted about that sort of thing did you say that most of the prides in the midwest owe you allegiance micah said yes vampires arent allowed to wage war on territories that dont touch their own micah said i havent done anything to any other masters of the city vampire law only covers how we treat each others animals to call my lions havent tried to take over any land where the master of the city had lions as his or her animal to call he looked at me as if id like the her comment frankly i was liking less and less about auggie so as long as you only take over prides that arent owned by vamps youre in the clear i said he nodded if we hadnt invited you into our territory how would you have taken over josephs pride sent pierce and haven down on their own then what kill joseph and take over joseph and his brother yes but if lion is one of my animals to call then since everything that i own belongs to jeanclaude you have to leave joseph and his people alone because theyll belong to another master vampire i think youve already chosen a lion to call anita your reaction to haven was pretty intense my reaction to pierce is intense too i havent chosen between the two of them the fact that they belong to you may be why im reacting to them or like you said my lioness is looking for something a little more dominant justins coming to the ballet with us tonight jason said from the chair near the love seat everyone looked at him josephs brother i made it a question jason nodded then winced pulling the collar of his leather jacket a little away from his neck it wasnt that cold in here but he was still wearing his leather jacket why if auggie and his people hadnt been there i would have asked jason had said something about a report he had to make what report take off the jacket wolf pierce said we can smell the wound jason looked at jeanclaude he nodded jason took the jacket off he then turned so we could all see his neck it was either the biggest hickey id ever seen or something had tried to tear out half of his throat i tried to rise but all the men pressed down just enough to let me know dont jason came to us something had bitten him but the teeth marks were like nothing id ever seen what the hell did that jason looked at his master not everyone who wishes to join us wishes to be your pomme de sang ma petite some of the masters have brought people that they simply wish to trade jason was investigating one of them his voice held so little inflection that i knew it was the truth but not all the truth hope the sex was good i said he grinned at me it was meng die made a disgusted noise she was leaning decoratively near the white fireplace i thought you didnt pimp your people out jeanclaude auggie said i didnt order jason to sleep with anyone i asked him to get to know them better his decision to have sex was just that his decision what did you fuck pierce asked ive never seen a bite like that jason flashed a grin in their direction wouldnt you like to know auggie reached up and laid a hand on pierces where it lay on the couch back a look of near pain passed over pierces face what did auggie do when he touched his lions like that whatever it was it wasnt pleasant it reminded me of a shock collar for a dog the fact that auggie didnt want pierce to admit he didnt know something meant we were still negotiating negotiation was over as far as i was concerned is justin meeting us here i asked yeah jason said he settled back on the floor on the other side of jeanclaude because meng die had taken his chair london was in the chair closest to me only requiem had taken a chair closer to auggies group or maybe he was farther away from me who knew with requiem if you liked josephs brother he would have already been on your radar anita dont let misplaced emotion trap you with someone not worthy of you auggie said i decide whos worthy of me he is the strongest dominant the pride has but he is not as strong as your ulfric is he is not the survivor that your nimirraj is would you truly bind yourself to someone who does not lead his group anita your power chooses only the strongest it chose me nathaniel said from where he cuddled on the floor yes auggie said there must be more to you than i can see perhaps it is love jeanclaude said auggie looked at him what do you mean perhaps what ma petite needs is not strength of arms and will alone perhaps there are other needs to be met auggie smiled and for a minute he was the friendly guy who had first stepped into our living room you are a romantic at heart jeanclaude it was always your weakness and my strength jeanclaude said auggie shook his head i gave up such things long ago how sad for you the two vampires stared at each other it was a long long look it was auggie who turned away and put his gaze on me you come off as hard but youre a romantic too anita i dont think you have it in you to bind yourself to someone just for power and safety thats what we did jeanclaude and me we chose our servants and our animals for power there are dozens hundreds that come up on the radar over the centuries but you wait you wait until you are either desperate enough for the choice to be forced or you find just the right one to make you powerful he motioned at all the men since you dont choose your power chooses for you i must say its got high standards since you dont know how to force your power to choose the one you want it to choose i dont think you have the ability to force your power to choose i couldnt keep my nervousness down my pulse rate sped up just a little and i had to swallow auggie would notice it he would know that his little talk had hit home he was right id never been able to force the ardeur to choose or not to choose she forced the ardeur to free me requiem said from his chair she fought her beast not to choose haven micah said i think ma petite is finding her footing with her powers augustine do you truly wish to waste such a powerful alliance with someone who does not rule a pride justin is part of josephs male coalition i said they rule the pride together but he is still not the dominant to match your wolf or your leopard king anita it seems a shame to settle for a prince when youve only bedded kings i didnt know what to say to that because he was right in one way justin didnt do it for me or he hadnt before this maybe my lioness would like him better than i would part of me was hoping yes and part of me didnt want to have to choose at all if i was a master vampire then i should be able to choose or not choose if my power was more vampire than lycanthrope then i had choices if my power was more fuzzy than dead then i was screwed we got dressed in record time i just gave myself over to the makeup and the primping there wasnt time for me to argue the outfit looked totally impractical but the corset top was a dancers corset it meant it couldnt be laced as tight as jeanclaude might like it never tight enough to impede breathing or movement jeanclaude told me id see similar corsets on the dancers tonight the shoes had been dyed to match the shiny black of the dress but they too were dancers high heels made for ballroom dancing actually not ballet when id seen the opentoed sandals id protested hell no there was no way to dance in them id said but damn me jeanclaude had been right the shoes were actually comfortable the corsets piping was made of tiny diamonds honesttogod diamonds the necklace he put around my neck was platinum and more diamonds id almost asked how much money i was wearing but decided that i really didnt want to know it would have just made me more nervous and that i did not need jeanclaudes opera coat flowed like an elegant black cloak but much more modern with a short raised collar to frame his face and the gleaming white of his shirt collar the cravat at his neck was pierced by a platinum and diamond stickpin to match my necklace his vest fit him like a glove because it was laced up the back a corset vest when he first suggested a corset top for me id made the mistake of saying ill wear a corset when you do youd think id know better by now hed just smiled and said yes in fact hed commissioned vests of various styles for all the men who would wear one impeccably tailored black slacks and gleaming black dress shoes completed his outfit oh and a scattering of diamonds across the vest like stars tossed across a night sky when id asked him why not make his vest have the same diamond pattern as my corset hed replied it is not a prom ma petite all the other men were in black tuxes some with tails some just tailored the only difference was the color of the vests or jewelry accessories it was damned subdued for one of jeanclaudes parties the stretch limo had dropped us at the door all eight of us which was why we needed the stretch wed done the gauntlet of flashing lights cameras microphones they could call it a red carpet it always felt like a gauntlet to me something to be endured except instead of running as fast as you could you had to smile and answer questions jeanclaude always fielded the yelled questions and photo opportunities like a pro id gotten better at clinging to his arm and not glaring at the cameras occasionally youd even catch me smiling everyone else was treated like entourage you didnt yell questions at the entourage normally i enjoyed the fox theatre it had been built in the s as a movie theatre but no movie theatre i knew had chinese foo dogs with glowing eyes at the bottom of a sweep of marble staircase the interior was lush and gilt full of carved hindu gods and animals from anywhere that qualified as exotic normally i loved gazing at it all tonight it was shelter from the storm we entered at the side entrance the fox club entrance it was private with valet parking and a nice restaurant if you made reservations people and corporations paid thousands of dollars a year to have a reserved box at the theatre to my knowledge jeanclaude didnt have a permanent box but for tonight he had two reserved the fox club box seats actually ran out of room before they ran out of vips to seat jeanclaude had said that some of the visiting masters were actually on the floor with the peons but in a special reserved front row section along with many local celebrities the media frenzy might have been less if one of the masters of the city coming hadnt been the master of hollywood and his entourage hollywood likes hollywood and they had followed him out here someone had said that his newest girlfriend was some hot young star in a new hit series id never heard of when you work an average of sixty to a hundred hours a week you dont watch much television funny that apparently the media was here as much for her as for anyone else she must have been a very hot property indeed there were too many vampires in the vip section to have dinner beforehand it raised too many questions about what everyone would eat jeanclaude had avoided the problem by simply saying the restaurant was closed for that night the management of the fox was happy with that yeah vamps were legal but st louis is still part of the bible belt no one was sure how people would take it if someone got pictures of vampires feasting on humans in the fox club theatre just better to avoid the problem once we got to danse macabre all bets would be off but then people expected decadence at a vampirerun dance club not only expected it were disappointed if they didnt see at least some salacious activities i knew for a fact that some of the naughty impromptu scenes at danse macabre were very planned the trick was to give the customers a thrill not scare them to death or make them run for a cop we finally got to our seats jeanclaude and i on one side of the little table in the middle and damian and micah on the other side asher nathaniel jason and requiem took the box next to ours claudia and lisandro both in the bodyguards blackonblack tuxes stood near the boxes wicked and truth were in the hallway leading into the box area we had other bodyguards scattered throughout because wed refused to let the visiting masters bring more than two guards per which meant we had to make certain they were safe there were uniformed cops everywhere outside as there usually were when you had a big event at the fox but it was more tonight no one in st louis wanted some rightwing crazy to kill one of the master vamps in front of a television crew no one wanted anyone to die period but lets be honest no one wanted that much bad publicity us either so there were wererats werehyenas werewolves scattered throughout the building the main difference was that the police were watching for hatemongers trying to kill the monsters and our guards knew that the other job was to make sure none of the visiting monsters got out of hand jeanclaude was pretty sure theyd behave but none of us was betting someones life on it nor was he willing to risk ruining all this amazingly good publicity for vampires by some incident now at the last performance best behavior tonight or else i was shielding as hard as i could i did not want my abilities not as jeanclaudes servant necromancer or whatever the hell i was turning into getting in the way but some things are too powerful to hide from some things are too much a part of who you are not to feel them the lights dimmed and i felt vampires felt them through the shields felt them through damians sudden reach across the table so that he could help me shield help me control myself help me not be overwhelmed jeanclaude had my other hand but the tension in him wasnt helpful he was excited i took my hand out of his with a smile and clung to damian i needed something cold and calm not nervous and excited damian wasnt excited he was scared id been nervous about all the masters coming to town but not the ballet itself it was just a ballet just a performance the reactions of the two vampires let me know that maybe i should have worried about it more i glanced at asher sitting so close in the next box his froth of hair hid most of him but there was a tension to him too what was about to happen i heard something though that wasnt exactly it it was as if i heard it with something deeper inside my head than my ears or maybe felt it and my mind could only translate what was happening into sound i dont think they actually made any noise but i heard a soft rustling almost like birds i dropped the tiniest edge of my shields like peeking over it in the midst of battle i was holding hands with a vampire surrounded by them and sometimes when i was that wrapped up in vamps it was hard to sense other vampires but not this one this one was someone i didnt know it was vampire but unlike anything that had ever touched me before i glanced at micah on the other side of damian micah was shaking his head like a fly was buzzing him he looked at me whats happening i shook my head vampire shit beyond that i truly didnt know i looked over and found nathaniels face peaceful waiting as the lights dimmed jasons face lost its fight too i glanced at damian and his eyes were wide a little panicked almost then his face went peaceful as well i looked at jeanclaude he whispered he will try to make humans of us all i actually understood what he meant by that the vampires at guilty pleasures and danse macabre would sometimes use group mind tricks to make performers appear in the midst of the human audience magic whatever vampire was doing this was trying not just to roll the human audience but everyone he was trying to cloud the minds of the other master vamps so that his performers could appear like magic the theatre had gone eerily silent there was no rustling no movement below us the humans had all had their minds rolled next would come the wereanimals and then the vampires would fall at least most of them would i had never felt anything like this i drew my hand out of damians he didnt seem to notice he just kept staring straight ahead i glanced behind at our bodyguards and found claudia staggering lisandro was just standing there all peaceful shit so much for the guards i looked back at micah his eyes were starting to unfocus i grabbed his hand and thought no no way i pulsed a little power down his hand my leopard flowed down my hand like warm water spilling over his skin he looked at me eyes wide power up our cats i whispered he nodded closed his eyes and i felt my leopard slip away and follow his down the metaphysical lines to the other leopards we had two leopards among the bodyguards ma petite what are you doing fighting back i said my leopard began to swell upward and i reached out to richard he was there in the crowd below with his date a prof from a local college he couldnt afford to be outed but we couldnt afford not to have him here hed impressed the hell out of the prof by having tickets to tonights gala event i brushed his energy and he whispered through my mind whats happening i called my wolf and the leopard quieted but i could feel micah reaching out further finding the leopards my wolf rose and i saw through richards eyes his human date stared at the stage waiting unseeing my wolf touched his and i thought what i wanted him to do and i felt his energy our wolves circle out from him seeking where our energy touched the wolves woke having the vamp roll the masters of the city was impressive but rolling the guards was dangerous i didnt like that at all i looked behind and found claudia still struggling she fell to her knees struggling hard not to lose herself to the power i had no tie to the rats but it couldnt hurt to try besides my wolf was starting to rise i didnt need that i got out of my chair and knelt beside claudia her eyes were terrified she reached out i grabbed her hand i thought power her eyes cleared and she gripped my hand so hard it almost hurt suddenly i felt raphael not like i could feel richard or micah but i felt his power like a scent on the air through claudias hand his rats hand i offered power power enough to free his rats who were most of our guards he took it used it and i felt it like a rock thrown into a pool out and out leopards wolves rats awake alert pissed if thered been a werehyena close enough id have tried with them too helping the rats had quieted my beasts the power was awake but they werent trying to tear me apart we were all waiting for the big bad vampire to appear we knew he was out there we could feel him jeanclaudes power flexed suddenly and so strongly that it bent me over nearly sent me to the floor claudia caught me you okay i nodded jeanclaude was waking up his vampires but he needed my necromancy to do it hed borrowed without asking but i was okay with that there wasnt going to be time to ask nicely about a lot of things tonight i glanced at the box on the other side away from ashers box it was samuel and his family samuel looked at me thea glanced in our direction his sons were lost to the magic as were his two merpeople at his back whoever this was was going to succeed at rolling everybody but the masters themselves and maybe one or two powerful servants impressive power that impressive and scary claudia helped me stand and the curtains opened behind us it wasnt truth or wicked but a vamp i didnt know he was tall and meaty in an athletic sort of way not fat just physically bigger than i liked my men tall and broad the way richard was but unlike richard this one knew he was big and liked it he moved in a glide that was already a kind of dance most of his body was nude just enough covered by his leotard to not get him arrested his upper body was beautiful even by my standards careless blond curls covered to just below his ears framing a face that was more handsome than beautiful he put all that beauty into his face so that the gaze of it was like a blow or thats what he tried for claudia made a small helpless sound hed rolled her that quick i dug my fingers into her arm and that didnt free her i looked into his pale eyes and felt the weight of his power it said see me i am beautiful i am desirable you want me i shook my head and had to flex power like unsheathing a blade not to fall into that gaze auggie hadnt been able to roll me but this one could i actually dropped my gaze rather than fight it the moment my eyes werent being bored into by that pale gaze i could think jesus he was good i saw his hand coming claudia tried to stop him i think he just looked at her and she stopped moving lisandro tried too but again a glance and they seemed confused the hesitation was enough he had the time he needed to touch me touch makes it all worse or better he wanted me to look up and i did i met his gaze and again his face was like a beautiful weapon he leaned over me his face painted with the stage makeup he leaned in as if hed kiss me and some part of me that was still sane knew that if he kissed me it would be bad i smelled jeanclaudes cologne and the scent of richards neck jeanclaude had opened the marks wider it made me startle and take a step back away from the blond i reached backward and jeanclaude took my hand the touch of my master and i was proof against the paleeyed blond he smiled an arrogant curl of lips the smile said it all i almost had you he was right he had almost had me and still there was a breathing presence of power out there in the theatre flowing over the crowd and that power wasnt the blond in front of us there was still something even more powerful waiting in the wings something even more powerful that wed invited to our town sweet mary mother of god what had we done the blond flung himself over our heads and out into the air the air was full of vampires they had flown up and over the audience and in that instant the vampire let them go he released his hold on the audience and they were left gasping shrieking not at the fact that their minds had been messed about with because they didnt know that but at the vampires suddenly appearing above them like magic jeanclaude helped me back to my seat i needed the help my knees were shaky i looked around at all of us and only the vampires hid their fear the rest of us were wideeyed and a little pale i leaned into jeanclaude and whispered did they do that every show he shook his head and spoke mindtomind yeah maybe some of the other masters could overhear us but we knew for dead certain theyd hear us whisper he bespelled the humans and some of the wereanimals but he did not try for the vampires he left them alone why now i whispered why tonight of course he didnt know that didnt make me feel any better strangely claudia asked permission to check on the other guards i gave it i like claudia wanted to see for sure that the other guards were up and running lisandro was cursing very softly under his breath fuck fuck fuck over and over like he said it with every breath hed taken the words right out of my mouth the vampires danced on the air at least a dozen of them they defied gravity and made it look effortless it was beautiful but i couldnt enjoy it i was too scared the blond hovered in front of our box for a moment he blew me a kiss i smiled sweetly and gave him a onefingered salute he laughed and flew away other vampires flew low over the crowd and they blew kisses at other women and other men there were three or four women among them it was sort of the reverse of most ballet companies where there seemed to be more women than men the drapes at the back of our box opened and it was auggie i got a glimpse of pierce and octavius on the other side of the curtain with wicked and truth auggie didnt look any happier than i felt he leaned over us smiling pretending hed just come to say hi he did not do this in chicago who didnt whos doing this i asked merlin auggie said troupe leader dance master the blond is adonis he used to be belles now he belongs to merlin i felt that power breathing back on the air like the smell of smoke drifting through the forest when you dont know yet from which direction the flames will come but you know theyre on the way auggie touched my bare shoulder his power slid over my skin like a fall of silk he offered his hand to jeanclaude you rolled me use it now jeanclaude took his hand to a casual viewer they were shaking hands auggies hand tensed on my bare shoulder touching the edge of scars where a vamp had once worried at my collarbone like a dog with a rat i wasnt entirely sure what auggie meant for us to do but jeanclaude was sure and you only need one driver on the metaphysical bus jeanclaude opened the marks between him and me opened them wide if it had been me i couldnt have opened them that wide without involving at least richard but jeanclaude had centuries of control under his belt he used his free hand to touch my arm and that was all we needed it was as if he pulled aside a curtain a thick velvet curtain i could almost feel it sliding through my body and then my necromancy flowed out from me like a chill wind his power met mine and the cold grew but not the cold that blankets and coats would cure this was the cold of the grave spilled down our skins jeanclaude took that cold power and poured it down our hands and into auggie his power burst over auggie sudden enough that he had to close his eyes his power was warmer than jeanclaudes warmer than my necromancy he tasted not just of vampire but of lion more than any vampire id ever touched he was also his beast interesting his cold warm power rose up then spilled down his body to meet ours it was a rush of power that tightened my throat clenched my hand tight on jeanclaudes only feasting on auggie earlier let me know how small this power rush was compared to what we could do with him my lion tried to rise to roll his power it was auggie who soothed the lion like a hand to stroke her quiet but his power far into me found something else to rise the ardeur started to flare and it was jeanclaude who rode it down dampened those fires he took the power firm and hard in his hand the way he could suddenly take charge during lovemaking you go from it being a team sport to suddenly having him on top and holding you still so he can do exactly what he wants in exactly the way he wants it giving you more pleasure than you could have found on your own he rode the power and auggie and i were just along for the ride the audience below us was oohing aahing giving little fake screams it sounded like a crowd at a fireworks display except this display was whirling floating diving bodies i watched the dancers distantly their beauty no longer moved me the power that jeanclaude was building was the only thing that truly touched me but i heard the rustling of birds again that got through the power haze merlin was about to pour power over the crowd again he was going to hide the dancers so they would vanish again poof jeanclaude used our power like a slap a feint to let the other vampire know to back off i heard birds flutter as if theyd been disturbed in their sleep i whispered birds and i couldnt tell if i said it out loud or not his animal to call auggie whispered back and that was a voice in my head i felt the power pull back as if this merlin had taken a deep breath i had a moment to think hed gotten the message but the next moment that breath came back at us power poured over the audience i felt the humans snuff out like matches one by one vampires are allowed group hypnotism because group mind tricks arent permanent once the power is over no harm no foul but this felt different this felt like something that would linger and change what it had touched whats he doing and that was aloud jeanclaudes voice breathed through my mind he is going to try to take us what is he doing to the crowd hes trying to take us all of us auggie said and thats too much power for the humans hell own them i said no jeanclaude said they are ours he didnt try to fight for the minds of the crowd he went straight for the source of our problem he used the power of the three of us to smash into that mind the power staggered as if wed hit him then the sound of birds filled the theatre twittering crying fluttering the sound of hundreds of birds the sound was so real that i searched the theatre for the flock but there was nothing to see nathaniel said i hear birds i didnt have time to wonder why he could hear them too because the birds were upon us feathers everywhere touching beating at me trying to get me to move to run jeanclaudes hand had a death grip on mine auggies fingers dug into my shoulder and the pain helped it helped chase back the beating wings i remembered the last time that a vampires power had beat against my body like wings beat against me not to frighten or make me run but to be let inside the power had cried in the dark to be let inside me obsidian butterfly master of the city of albuquerque had found her way inside me she had filled my eyes with the blackness between suns and the cold light of stars she had also shared her power with me that power came again as if the touch of wings had called it auggie cursed under his breath his hand desperate on my shoulder jeanclaude said ma petite do notbut whatever i wasnt to do he never said because obsidian butterflys gift dropped my shields and cut me open for merlins power that metaphysical wind of wings and twittering calls poured inside me the power poured inside me and i felt merlins triumph like the scream of some huge bird of prey he thought hed broken my shields broken our shields but he was wrong jeanclaude and auggie clung to me trying to shore up what they too thought was a break in our power but it wasnt a breach it was a mouth it felt as if my body were a cave a fleshy soft cave and the birds that i had heard and felt poured inside me as if theyd found a home i swear i could feel the brush of feathers tiny bodies fluttering diving filling me merlins power poured into me and tried to find jeanclaude and auggie the power tried to find a way out of me and into them merlin poured more and more power into me and i swallowed it auggie and jeanclaude clung to me afraid to let go afraid not to let go i think so much power so much that it began to leak through into the other two vampires the moment it touched them they both understood merlin wasnt going to break me we were going to eat him he must have figured it out at the same time because he tried to stop the power just cut it off but i had the taste of him and i didnt want it to stop the torrents of invisible birds slowed but didnt stop obsidian butterflys power called to them helped me know sweet words to use to coax that power the power kept coming and i felt the flash of fear it was sweet and good and i longed to taste the sweat on his skin and i could i licked down his skin where he watched from the shadows he stared at me with dark eyes that held crimson like a pinpoint tear inside them id seen eyes like that before never were human were you i thought he tried to break the contact and he couldnt do it not with auggie and jeanclaude hooked up to me he was big and bad and powerful but he was not a master of the city he was not two masters of the city and he didnt know what the hell i was in that moment neither did i i smelled jasmine and rain i smelled a tropical night that hadnt existed for thousands on thousands of years a voice rode the smell of rain the mother of all darkness whispered i know what you are necromancer i didnt want to ask but it was as if i couldnt stop my mouth from forming the word what mine i screamed and i shut it down i shut it all down no more birds from merlin but in my panic i shut down the tie with auggie and jeanclaude for an instant it was just me and her inside my head i felt rain on my face cool and warm the moon rode full and bright and i was too tall and too male i thought it was jeanclaudes memory but the hand i could see was too rough too dark whose memory was i trapped in mine she said again oh yeah her so why was i inside the head of the man she was about to eat why wasnt i inside her body something moved in the moonlight something huge and pale like some muscular ghost sliding along the ground toward me the head moved and the eyes caught the moon shining at me i stared into the face of that great cat and knew that nothing like it had walked the earth for thousands of years cave lion i thought huh they were striped the cat crouched to spring a wolf appeared between me and it a white wolf with a dark saddle and head me my wolf this was a dream which meant i was unconscious weird the wolfs hackles rose and it gave that low bass growl that all the canids use when they arent kidding anymore the wolf looked fragile beside that crouching figure we were out of our weight class by a few hundred pounds i smelled wolf i smelled pine and forest loam i smelled things that never grew here in this land where the mother of all darkness had taken merlin or whoever hed been once i smelled the trees of home the earth of pack land i smelled the soft musk of wolf the cave lion tensed and i knew this was it the wolf braced for the spring and the body i was wearing readied a spear that would not help something touched my hand i grabbed for it without thinking and the night exploded into white hot light light and pain a great deal of pain voices let go anita let go hands touching the pain i tried to jerk away it felt as if the blood in my hand had been replaced with molten metal i knew that pain a different voice anita let go open your hand anita just open your hand micahs voice my left hand was a lump of agony i couldnt even feel my fingers how could i open it if i couldnt feel it all i could feel was pain it made me open my eyes my vision was ruined spotted gray and black and white as if id looked into a bright flash of light i had a moment to see the ring of faces micah nathaniel jason graham and richard i saw them but all my attention went to the agony that was my left hand i looked at it and on the outside it was fine a thin gold chain trailed out of my fist my hand looked fine but i knew it wasnt there were heavy drapes behind us we were still at the fox theyd just carried me out of the box and put me somewhere where the audience couldnt see i knew why there were no vampires kneeling with us the mother of all darkness had tried to take me again and some fool had given me a cross to hold open your hand anita please micah whispered it again stroking my hair i found my voice and whispered cant richard cradled my hand in his and started trying to pry my fingers open he peeled a finger up i whimpered then bit my lip if i started making noises id end up screaming or weeping loudly theyd managed to hide me away from the crowd if i started screaming that would all be for nothing im sorry anita im sorry richard whispered it over and over as he pried my hand open curse if you want to jason said i shook my head bad burns hurt too much for cursing to make anything better i forced myself to feel past the pain i could still feel my hand but distant as if the hand around the pain were almost asleep the pain overrode everything else as if the nerves just couldnt handle it all so they transmitted the important parts that it fucking hurt all else was secondary richard made a sound and it made me glance at him the look on his face made me look where he was looking my hand most of the blisters had burst so that my palm and fingers were a mass of ruptured skin and clear fluid but the glint of gold in my palm was buried inside the mass of torn flesh the cross had melted into my hand i looked away then i didnt want to think about what was going to be needed to clean it up nathaniel leaned over me blocking my view which panicked me i pushed him away so i could see what richard was doing by my hand no way was that cross coming out without medical help painkillers good painkillers yeah that was the ticket i reached my good hand back up to nathaniel he leaned over so i could whisper doctor i whispered because i was afraid if i talked any louder id start yelling he nodded dr lillian is on her way i nodded not caring how the doc was getting into the event for once in my life i just wanted the help most pain you can ride out but burns just seem made to eat the world the pain eats everything else you cant think about anything but the pain the grinding biting aching nauseating pain id had burns before but this one was going to be the worst weeks of recovery and depending on how deep the cross was embedded maybe permanent damage to the hand shit fucking shit dr lillian came into sight i didnt recognize her at first and it wasnt just the pain makeup had softened her face brought out what she must have looked like ten years ago the soft blue of the dress complemented the soft gray of her hair and the pastel shades of lipstick and eye shadow i didnt look at her and think she must have been lovely a decade ago i looked up at her and thought she is lovely now she shook her head what am i going to do with you people tonight i swallowed hard didnt do it on purpose she lifted the long skirt enough so she could kneel comfortably i would say not her face was neutral pleasant a good doctors face she started to reach for my hand and i jerked away she leaned back giving me a little smile if you promise to do everything i tell you to do exactly the way i tell you to do it ill shoot you up with a painkiller before i touch your hand i nodded your word of honor that you wont argue with me anita that youll just do what i tell you to do if i hadnt been out of my head with pain i might have thought harder about her wording but all i could think about was the pain i nodded and whispered i promise she smiled at me good she looked behind her claudia came into view kneeling so the other woman could whisper to her claudia nodded stood and left lillian turned away to get the shot ready normally i made a fuss about needles i was almost as phobic of needles as i was of flying but tonight ill wasnt complaining i was too busy fighting off the urge to start screaming make it stop make it stop lillian made richard move so she could kneel by my injured hand micah cupped my face so i couldnt see the needle he knew how i felt about them i let him do it but i wasnt sure that id have cared tonight i felt the pressure of the needle then it was as if she shot hot water directly into my veins i could feel it spreading liquid through my body it was the oddest sensation id never had anything that i could trace through my veins like that my upper body flushed with heat then it was hard to concentrate and i was dizzy even lying flat i was dizzy i started to ask if something was wrong then the pain just washed away the drugs bathed the inside of my upper body in hot water and the pain just washed away lillian leaned over me how do you feel anita i managed a smile and knew it was probably goofy doesnt hurt now good she said smiling she looked at richard i think you need to go back to your date richard he shook his head im staying here youre clark kent tonight ulfric not superman you have to go back to your date and pretend youre a mildmannered science teacher ill take care of anita richard glanced at us all are they staying one of them will be lillian said but they arent hiding what they are ulfric the price of hiding is that you must stay hidden now go back before the woman starts to look for you he started to argue dont make me be cruel about this ulfric lillian said go i said and my voice sounded strange go richard go he gave me a look that was full of such conflict even pain but tonight i didnt have any time for anyones pain but mine im sorry he said i wasnt sure what he was sorry about that he had to go that he had another date that he was still hiding in his clark kent disguise or maybe that it was his cross embedded in my hand the cross id given him for christmas once yeah that might need a sorry they spread a tablecloth across me and another under my arm apparently requiem had charmed them out of the restaurant staff hed kept his eyes averted from me as if he feared the cross would flare to life lillian had micah and nathaniel distract me though the drugs did a lot of the distracting for them i was afraid it would hurt but it was like the fear couldnt hold on to me or i couldnt hold on to it jason pressed down on my arm i started to protest nathaniel kissed me hard the kiss swallowed my small noises there was a sharp abrupt tug on my hand i cried out and nathaniel ate the sound as he did sometimes during sex a scream lost in a kiss i could feel them doing something to my hand wrapping it in something nathaniel drew back from the kiss his mouth smeared with my lipstick he put a finger over my lips and i fought to make only small whimpering sounds it wasnt so much that it hurt it was almost as if my body knew it was hurt and wanted to react to it but every time i tried to concentrate on the pain it just slipped away maybe it seemed weird to try to concentrate on it i guess i was trying to fight the drugs stupid of me but i couldnt just slip away i couldnt not fight even when it wasnt good for me nathaniel smiled down at me as if he knew what i was doing he probably did he moved his finger back from my mouth i nodded at him to let him know i understood we were trying not to attract attention sure i looked down and found that my hand was wrapped in gauze like a pristine version of the mummys hand i got a flash of fresh blood on the tablecloths before they were bundled up i tried to care about how wed explain the fresh blood but i couldnt finish caring before it floated away it should have felt good to be so relaxed but i knew that this was a night when jeanclaude needed me everyone needed me the mother of all darkness was still out there what would they do if she came back and i wasnt there fear tried to swell again and it didnt last i couldnt hold on to any one thought or emotion it was like trying to row a boat in the fog you knew what direction you wanted to go youd get a glimpse of the shore and row your hardest then the fog slipped back over you and when it cleared again the shore was somewhere else as much as the pain would have distracted me id have been more functional with that than the drugs but the burn had hurt so much so very much id wanted it to stop someone picked me up and it woke me though i wasnt sure id exactly been asleep passed out maybe nathaniel was carrying me the sleeves of his white shirt showed and i was covered by a black tux jacket his probably i was vaguely proud of myself for figuring it out i looked around for micah and it was as if nathaniel understood micah is going to sit with asher so that neither box will be empty he started down the steps with me in his arms requiem appeared over his shoulder following us lisandro was beside him i looked down the stairs and caught a glimpse of doc lillian before the dizziness became too much what the hell had she given me i lost some more time because the next thing i knew we were all the way down and stepping out under the covered awning outside the fox clubs private entrance i got a glimpse of wicked standing beside the valet attendant the attendants face was blank and peaceful vampire mind tricks to make sure no one remembered us oneonone mind tricks were illegal technically partially because of shit like this that a vampire could persuade a person that the bad things hadnt happened it made witness testimony a bitch fredo was holding the door to the limo as if he were a real chauffeur and not a walking weapons store nathaniel crawled inside with me in his arms he laid me gently on the backseat and lifted the tux jacket off me doc lillian knelt beside me she touched my face and tried to get me to follow her fingers i dont think i did really well at it she smiled at me i dosed you like you were one of us and youre not whatever you are becoming its not lycanthrope i frowned at her what the morphine should have worked out of your system by now and it hasnt it wont be four to ten hours like a human but two at least two she shook her head sometimes we all forget that you are still mostly human morphine i said she nodded yes anita morphine if the master that tried to take us all renews his attack without you i dont think jeanclaude can take him did she think that all that happened had been merlins doing did she not know about the mother of all darkness it seemed like i should explain it to her but i couldnt hold all my thoughts in a row long enough to do it we need you back with us now i nodded then closed my eyes because it made the inside of my head fuzzier for a moment agreed i whispered how i opened my eyes and fought to focus on that lovely face the gray eyes that looked blue tonight with the dress and the eye shadow call the munin anita it will clear your mind and heal much of this damage i frowned at her i must have heard her wrong call munin now she nodded raina could heal this i closed my eyes and fought fought hard to gather my thoughts and explain why this was such a bad idea munin were the ancestral spirits of the wolf pack but they could be a lot more lively than just normal ancestor worship especially if you had psychic ability or most yummy talent with the dead the munin could be much much more lively raina was the old lupa of the pack id killed her because she was trying to kill me the munin could possess people who had the talent for it id become her favorite ride id spent a long long weekend in tennessee with my spiritual teacher marianne learning how to control the munin in general and raina in specific micah and nathaniel had gone with me to help me deal with it id asked richard first wolf business and all but he had flatly refused raina was dead he wanted nothing more to do with her neither did i but i didnt have a choice shed been a sexual sadist but she could also heal with sex it didnt have to be fullblown sex she just liked it that way id tapped into her power a few times to save lives but the cost had been high her memories alone were worth avoiding the ardeur wasnt normally a thing of healing and jeanclaude had speculated that the fact that i could heal with sex and metaphysics might be more because of rainas munin than vampire powers it was almost as if the more often i was used by or borrowed magic from someone else the more likely it became that their magic would become part of my arsenal raina had played with me enough that it had somehow effected the ardeur or that was the theory why not use the ardeur to heal the hand healing with the ardeur was catchascatchcan sometimes it worked without your wanting it to work and sometimes it didnt work at all i did my best to explain it out loud not sure i can control her like this bad if shes in charge you are badly hurt anita if you were truly vampire then youd need more blood a lot more than normal jeanclaude thinks that the ardeur will rise and try to feed that need i frowned harder at her i dont you promised to do whatever i asked if i gave you the morphine you gave your word i swallowed licked my lips and thought about calling her a bitch but since she was the only doctor we had and i was hurt it seemed unwise to piss her off i could control rainas munin now if i hadnt been on drugs i said no then you will miss the ballet and the party and you will not be there to help jeanclaude against the other masters richard will not be there because he is hiding if you think it is a good idea to strip the master of this city of both of his thirds on this night then refuse hell with it i said bitch she smiled and patted my cheek once you are healed your beasts may rise so i will leave you with people who can take your beast if they must i dont understand but i think we should start with someone that raina never touched i knew her you see she always loved new conquests i shook my head gently dont understand nathaniel appeared beside her he was not new to raina shed had him every way a woman could have a man and some that stretched the imagination to the screaming point he was nude except for the amethyst and diamond collar it had been a gift from jeanclaude and me though frankly more jeanclaudes idea than mine it would simply never have occurred to me youre not wearing any clothes he smiled were going to try to go back inside afterward afterward what he glanced at lillian how much is she following all this im not certain a voice from behind us i dont do rape jasons voice then none of us do lillian leaned over me anita anita you must give permission for this for what exactly there that was a clear question raise rainas munin heal yourself and heal requiem requiem raina will like that hes someone new and that hes badly injured i stared into lillians face you really did know her she nodded better than i wanted to i would not ask this if i thought we would survive this night without you raphael felt one of the masters in the ballet one of them can call rats anita do you understand what that means to our people yes i said if they take raphael then they own you all exactly and we invited them here i whispered requiems bare shoulder appeared around lillian merlin their dance master rolled the human audience to make his dancers appear and vanish but he did not try to roll the other masters until tonight i wasnt so sure of that id felt merlins mind if hed rolled them then let them go they might never have figured it out i tried to explain it his mind powerful enough he could let them go they might never know you mean that he rolled them and was so powerful that they dont remember it yes i watched fear march over his face swallowed by that perfect blankness that the old ones have perhaps but i do not believe that marmee noir appeared in the other cities who is marmee noir lillian asked our dark mother the first of us it was her power added to merlins that did what was done tonight it was her power that made richards cross melt into anitas hand is she here with the troupe no i said she lies in the room with windows that probably made no sense to any of them but they let it go they took my drugged assurance that the nightmare of all vampires wasnt physically in st louis drugged out of my ability to concentrate and they took my word about it they shouldnt have done that but more than mommie dearest there was auggie and samuel and hell samuels wife thea if these were the masters jeanclaude trusted then what would the other masters do to us jeanclaude didnt need to be alone tonight something bad would happen get out doc what dont want you here when the wicked bitch comes ill get out and the only ones in the car will be people youve fed on before anita she glanced behind her with one exception exception go lillian jason said jeanclaudes nervous something else has happened not as bad but something lillian moved out of sight and jason knelt beside me he was as nude as nathaniel he was wearing the cuff bracelet that jeanclaude had had commissioned for him wolves running over a gold and platinum landscape the wolves looked so real you expected them to move i stared at the bracelet pretty i said he grinned and the bracelets nice too he looked down at me and his face was so serious i couldnt feel what jeanclaude was feeling the morphine and my own earlier panic had shut the marks down i didnt like how serious jason looked what was happening to my sweeties while i was arguing lets get you out of the clothes youve got to have something to wear back inside a moment ago i might have argued but jason was scared and i couldnt feel jeanclaude i was too befuddled to risk opening the marks afraid id screw up jeanclaudes concentration as badly as mine was and that would be a disaster bad things were happening and it was our fault the vampires had invited bad things to the city and now everyone was in danger help me out of the corset thought youd never ask jason said and he leered at me the way he usually did but i could see his eyes and his eyes werent having any fun at all bad things bad things what was happening inside i thought hold on jeanclaude i felt him like a distant caress of wind against the door id used to shut us down that breath of power smelled sweetly of his cologne his words seemed to fill the car feed before you come back to me ma petite do not loose the ardeur on the crowd then he was gone shut down and tight shielding his ass off but hed raised a good point it was perfectly me to raise munin heal and not feed the ardeur if i could stave it off that brief message let me know that he wanted me back fed and ready to fight not hungry and dangerous to the crowd jason helped me sit up and nathaniel started unlacing my corset back was it too smalltown midwestern of me to think it was weird that my main squeeze was encouraging me to have sex with a limo full of men before i came back inside to him we had the mother of all vampires lurking around a master vamp powerful enough to roll every master in town and mustnt forget the blond dancer adonis who had almost rolled me with his gaze powerful dangerous shit going on and the thing that made me squirm inside was the sex it was one of those evenings when id really get to decide if it was a fate worse than death the corset loosened enough to spill my breasts into the open air requiem jason said get over here the vampire came and he used his hands to hide his nakedness he seemed embarrassed i was uncomfortable with it too but the morphine took the edge off the embarrassment like it took the edge off everything they lifted the corset over my head and other hands went to the top of my skirt nathaniel took the clothes away as they came off they took everything but the diamond necklace apparently the jewelry was a theme tonight there was plastic over the far seat and he was putting the clothes under it how messy was everyone expecting to be i caught movement in the far back of the limo it was noel no i said get him out justin didnt get here anita jason said hes the only lion we got except for auggies bodyguard if your lion rises we need somewhere for it to go hes a baby jason nodded raina loved virgins i shook my head too hard made myself dizzy i closed my eyes and tried to concentrate he waits outside the car if my lion rises then ill bring his beast but we are not feeding him to raina i opened my eyes and the world had stopped wavering good jason touched requiems shoulder drew my attention back to him i dont think well have to anita look at requiem through her eyes look at those wounds anita hes fresh meat and hes wounded shell like that i looked at the knife wounds on his chest and side his arms were cut up silver blades i said requiem nodded meng die meant my death a little power and she changes her mind it is not a little power anita jason said i looked back at requiem do you know what raina will do nathaniel knelt by us i told him what she liked to do during sex i fought to focus on requiems still face is it i searched for the word i wanted all right i have been at the court of belle morte anita this will be as nothing he found a smile for me heal me so that we may both serve our master well this night i nodded okay i looked behind them all at noel he was pressed in the far back of the limo as far from the action as he could get out now wait outside with fredo jason said i was told to stay close noel said his eyes were big his mouth a little parted i realized i was naked in front of him id known that but the drugs or the emergency or my collapsing morals had made me not think about it the look on his face wasnt lust it was fear outside the car is close enough jason said still he hesitated get out of the car noel nathaniel said he sounded angry noel got out of the car when the door closed behind him nathaniel said how could joseph have sent him for this job joseph didnt understand jason said didnt want to understand nathaniel said his eyes had gone almost purple with anger protect the innocent i said he gave me those angry eyes then made a smile for me and nodded you can control raina i know you can the drugs will make it harder but you can do this i was there when you learned how to do this anita drugs or no drugs your will is stronger than hers i stared into his face studied that anger that surety i got that glimpse that i had sometimes of what he might be in ten years he was going to be something special at thirty and i planned on being there to see it i planned on us all being there to see it which meant we had to get through tonight whatever it took jason laid me back on the seat nathaniel gave me a quick kiss then he moved away too requiem sat on the end of the seat like he was on an uncomfortable first date i held out my hand to him help me he took my hand and knelt beside the seat still covering as much of his nakedness as he could how can i help you use your power on me his eyes filled with rich blue fire and my body jolted with it it hurt my sore hand but the mixture of pain and pleasure and confusion would appeal to her id learned to control raina which meant she had to be coaxed inside me now it was sort of like leaving a perfectly good house when you know a tiger is just outside and oh by the way lets strap a raw steak around your neck this was all such a bad idea problem was i didnt have a better one the first thing you need to know in order to control something is how it feels to do it i was a natural psychic which meant that my gifts werent something i had to strive for they just came to me the problem with being a natural is that sometimes things come so easily that you dont know how or even when youre doing psychic stuff it sort of sneaks up on you you must understand a thing to truly control it id relied for most of my life on the fact that i was just such a brute psychically that i could bull my way through things but some things cant be controlled by brute force alone or even by sheer power alone you need control its the difference between being able to throw a baseball ninety miles an hour and being able to throw it ninety miles an hour over home plate the speed and skill is great but if you keep throwing wild itll never get you into the majors in fact you may kill some poor fan in the stands getting hit in the head with a ball going that fast well not good raina wasnt my only ninetymileanhour ball but she was the second one i learned to control after the necromancy requiem was flat on his back on the seat i didnt remember changing places with him the last thing i remembered clearly was me naked on my back on the seat now it was him lying naked him looking up at me a surprised look on his face what had i done to put that look on requiems face what had i done while raina was in control and i was fighting off the morphine i was sitting on his waist which was an improvement over lower i guess i looked behind me to nathaniel and jason the look on my face must have been enough because jason said you bodyslammed him down on the seat your hand is bleeding nathaniel said i stared at my left hand as if it had just appeared at the end of my arm there was fresh blood soaking through the gauze the moment i saw the blood the hand began to hurt it wasnt as bad as before lillian gave me the shot but it was a persistent grinding pain with twinges of sharper things the sharper pains promised worse to come i believe you injured yourself throwing me down on the seat requiem said his voice was mild almost politely empty his face matched it handsome and blank the surprise was gone as if id dreamed it he was in control of himself once more i felt raina inside me she didnt want him in control of himself or anything else she wanted to break him id seen far enough inside his head with the ardeur to know hed been broken centuries before and more than once i knew that breaking someone already broken wouldnt appeal to her as much as being the first one to do it jason had been right raina liked virgins of every sort she loved to be in on someones first experience especially if she could turn pleasure to pain joy to terror that just flat did it for her not my kink which made it easier not to do it her voice whispered through my mind not as clear as it once had been more a windinthetrees kind of sound marianne had informed me that raina had come close to truly possessing me as in almost demonic possession that had been a scary thought now i knew how to keep raina from getting that intimate a grip on me the wind of her voice blew through my body smelling of forest and fur and perfume you know what i want anita you know what im willing to give you i said that part out loud because talking mindtomind with her spirit could give it a stronger hold on you i thought about how close requiem and i had come to intercourse earlier today i thought about him rolling off unsatisfied and unsatisfying the first fucking between you she laughed and my concentration wasnt pure enough to keep that laugh off my lips her laugh was a low throaty alto sound a joyous promise of sex i didnt own a laugh like that nathaniel said concentrate anita you can do this raina wanted me to look behind me at him and i fought not to do it not because it was a bad thing but because i had to start fighting somewhere and it was a place to start it was also something that if i lost the fight it wouldnt hurt anyone petty anita she whispered i ignored her as best i could always hard to ignore people who are sharing your consciousness i tried to concentrate on my breathing but the pain in my hand kept distracting me i tried concentrating on each heartbeat on the pulse in my body and that was a mistake it was as if each beat of my heart hit my injured hand like a spike as if the very pulse of blood made it hurt worse i shook my head and that was a mistake i was suddenly dizzy requiems hands caught my arms kept me from falling i let myself collapse on top of him my head resting against his shoulder he made no sound but his body flinched i was lying across his wounds raina liked that a lot i kissed his shoulder the skin was warm warm with the blood hed taken from me earlier but not as warm as it should have been i gazed up into those brilliant blue eyes with their hint of green around the iris your body is using more energy trying to heal your wounds yes he whispered do you need to feed more often when youre this badly hurt yes mlady i smiled at him somehow mlady doesnt work with me naked on top of you he smiled and it even reached his eyes you will always be mlady to me anita i was suddenly drowning in the scent of wolf the beast inside me stirred as if rainas power were a spoon and i were some kind of soup stirring looking for just the right tidbit her voice sounded inside me your very own wolf anita what have you been doing while ive been away the wolf my wolf appeared inside me i could see it forming no i thought no i turned my face into requiems neck where his pulse should have beat but didnt i pressed my mouth to that chilled flesh and chased away the warm prickling energy i did not run from my wolf for if you run things will chase you but i turned to colder things things that the wolf neither understood nor entirely approved of my wolf quieted under the brush of dead flesh and the scent of flesh unmoving the trouble with quieting my wolf was that raina fled too i rose up from requiems body enough to see his face your eyes they are like brown diamonds so much light in the darkness rainas gone jason said softly i didnt look at him i only had eyes for the vampire i began to kiss down his body a light kiss on his shoulder and with each kiss my body slid lower and because we were both nude that raised interesting things and i knew that his body was swelling with blood that hed taken from my veins that without that ruby kiss he would have been dead in so many more ways than just undead i raised my lower body enough so that we werent touching below the waist it felt wonderful so much promise of things to come but i wanted to concentrate on the feel of my mouth on his chest i couldnt do that and have him brush the front of my body with the swelling richness of his it distracted me i wanted to enjoy the smooth perfection of his skin cool and moving but not pulsing not alive not completely not really it was like kissing my way down a dream faintly unreal as if requiems pale body should have evaporated into the first alarm of the day did jeanclaude and asher play human for me more than this did they make their hearts beat their blood pump so i would not feel this amazing stillness requiems arms caressed down my back my sides his chest moved writhing with the pleasure of being touched but he did not breathe he did not play alive for me he was a moving dead thing it should have bothered me but it didnt the power that filled my eyes understood what he was and liked it liked it a lot i kissed down that smooth cool flesh until i came to coarseness and a faint metallic taste it made me open my eyes and look at what i was kissing it was the knife wound it looked so smooth but my lips told the truth the edges of the wound were rough the wound could look as pretty and neat as it wanted to but it had been violent the knife had torn his skin even around the edges minute tears that the eye couldnt see but the mouth could feel i traced a fingertip across the lip of the wound it drew small pain noises from him part of me liked the noises and part of me worried that it hurt too much i gazed up at him the look on his face as he stared down the length of his body at me wasnt a pained look there was a tightening around his eyes that showed it hurt but the look in those eyes was still eager which meant i hadnt crossed that thin line yet it still excited him more than it hurt him cool i concentrated on the sensation of the wound under the barest tip of my finger i closed my eyes so that i could concentrate on it it was coarse under my finger not as instantly noticeable as my lips had found it but the skin was torn and roughened by the violence of the blade touch also didnt give me that sweet faint taste of blood was this rainas thought or mine no jason was right raina was gone i realized i was using my hand both hands it made me lean back from requiem and stare at my burned hand id had burns before almost this bad and for similar reasons admittedly it had been because a vamp had pressed his flesh into the holy item i guess this was the first time it had been just my body involved had it been because marmee noir had been possessing me or had it been because i was using vampire powers huh that was an interesting thought i pushed it back for so many reasons id look at the implications later much later the skin had blistered and hardened and begun to slough off days or weeks of healing in minutes i moved the hardened skin to one side i wasnt quite brave enough to pull at it i moved all that truly dead skin aside until i found the palm of my hand the skin of the palm was soft baby soft but there was a new crossshaped scar in the middle of my hand that skin was shiny and not soft not rough more slick weeks of healing i hadnt used raina to heal requiem id used her to heal me but i understood why id asked something of her munin that it could not do she healed lycanthrope flesh living flesh and requiem was not living flesh no matter how alive he seemed it was a trick or a lie or something i had no name for i stared down at requiem he gazed up at me with eyes that had gone back to their normal swimming blue there was no power in him now if it hadnt been silver blades his body would have smoothed the damage over by now but it was silver and that meant healing would be almost humanslow unless he had help you are healed he made it a question i nodded a little trimming away of dead skin but yeah trimming away the dead he said voice soft he sighed and said i can go back inside as i am i will not be at my best but it was your wounds that were most important i stared down at him the two nearly fatal wounds in his upper body the dozens of cuts and slashes on his arms but i looked lower and found the rest of his body still hard and ready you should walk around nude more often i said he actually frowned at me why mlady because you are beautiful he smiled i thank you for that you say it like its not true if i were truly beautiful you would have found your way to my bed weeks ago i closed my eyes and drew a deep breath my necromancy was still here but it was changed somehow it was like calling the munin or something about chasing out the dark mother had changed my own power it was still necromancy but it held an edge of life it was more alive this energy i didnt understand it exactly but i understood one thing always before when id healed damage on vampires small wounds it had been in the daytime when they were dead once they rose their own personality or soul or whatever kept my power from recognizing them as a dead thing the way it recognized zombies they always hit the radar as dead no matter how mobile they were i could feel the wound i had touched i could feel it and knew that it was a little like gathering up the bits of a zombie one of the things i did most often in my job was to make the dead whole again it seemed important to do this thing as though if i didnt heal requiem now i would forget how to do it it was like a gift offered once and wiped away if you dont use it i wanted to use it it would feel good to use it always felt good to work with the dead i set my fingertips over his wound and thought about it like clay like smoothing clay back into place i closed my eyes so i could see the deeper tissues of the body knitting together things i could not touch with my physical fingers there was a wind in the car a wind that was chill but held an edge of spring i thought someone had opened a door but when i opened my eyes the car was closed the wind was coming from me i looked down at requiems body and found my hands touching smooth healed skin there wasnt even a scar i moved my hands to the wound on his side at the ribs i did it before my conscious mind could say gosh thats impossible i pressed my hands to his side and i smoothed the wound away the wind blew bits of my hair around my face the hardened skin of blistered flesh fell away on its own from my hand as i healed him dead flesh all of it dead flesh i grabbed his arms and smoothed my hands from elbow to wrist to hold his hands and the skin smoothed behind my touch like a fastforward camera trick it wasnt possible but i was still doing it the wind faltered and i fell forward onto him he caught me or i might have slipped to the floor of the car working with the dead always felt good but it had its price too it was especially trying if there was no blood magic involved it hadnt occurred to me it would be that similar to raising the dead in price jason and nathaniel were beside us whats wrong jason asked nathaniel answered shes exhausted i blinked up at him are you exhausted too he shook his head when you shut the marks down you shut them down i can tell youre exhausted but you arent draining me i dont think youre touching damian either i didnt want to risk the two of you again tonight you shut everybody out jason said jeanclaude is sensing more through me right now then you a pomme de sang is not nearly the connection that you are to him too much happening i said requiem hugged me what can i do to make this right mlady how do i repay such a miracle if we ever do this again i need to have you take blood during it just like a sacrifice at a zombie raising blood magic helps the energy you need to feed jason said and he had an abstracted look as if he were listening to something i couldnt hear it was probably jeanclaude whispering in his ear okay i said settling heavier onto requiems chest jason and nathaniel looked at each other then back at requiem call your power requiem jason said call her ardeur shes too weak to bind you with it like she tried to do earlier feed her first and you will be safe its like a ventriloquism act i said your mouth moves but jeanclaudes words come out jason gave me the grin that was all his and shrugged his words or not its still true i rolled my head to look up at requiems face is that why you stopped before you were afraid id own you through the ardeur yes he said i feared i would end as london has ended and i do not truly wish that i dont think im up to binding anyone right now a look passed over his face that wasnt gentle or hesitant it was a very male look for a moment then i can do as i wish with you i thought about arguing with the way hed phrased it but i just didnt have the energy for it too tired and too drained yes i said you can he sat up cradling me against the front of his body he sat up and halfcarried me until i was lying on the other end of the seat and he was kneeling over me his power danced over my body and even that was energy that was food i watched his eyes drown in the blue depths of his own magic until he stared down at me like one blind is this truly what mlady wishes i stared down the length of his body so hard so ready almost hard enough that it must have hurt him a little too hard for too long is not always a good feeling with his body practically screaming with need he asked asked permission one more time requiem i said i promise i will always think of you as a gentleman but ive already said yes it is good to be certain he whispered whoever taught you this caution it wasnt me i stroked my hand not across his chest but just above it playing in the energy of his aura so much energy to play with it made him close his eyes for a moment i promise requiem ill still respect you in the morning that made him smile and he said and you will always be mlady that made me laugh then he poured his power over my body and the laughter changed to other sounds he held on to the door to raise himself above me so that only the long hard length of him touched me at first his own magic had made my body tight and wet and more than ready so that each thrust was exquisite pleasure a pleasure so great it was almost painful that his movement was slow and shallow hed found that spot inside me and he meant to work it but i could feel his body fighting his own rhythm wanting something harder faster less controlled i was torn between wanting him to never stop and knowing that we needed to hurry but every time i opened my mouth to tell him to hurry to let me feed he thrust inside me again or moved his hips just a little and the thought died before i could say it the ardeur was raised but even the ardeur seemed weak id had it spread to most of the people in a room before now with nathaniel and jason trapped in a car with us it hadnt spread to them they were untouched i needed to feed not just to be strong enough to help jeanclaude tonight but to make certain i didnt start to suck damians life away i watched requiems body glide in and out of mine in the dimness of the car i couldnt see that he was wearing the condom that nathaniel had given him i was glad someone was thinking about safety because all i was thinking about was sex and food trouble was they were the same thing right now i curled my legs back rose up so i could see him sliding in and out of me the sight of him inside me for the first time finally bowed my spine back closed my eyes drew small sounds from me that warm delicious weight began to build inside me i found my words and managed to say when i go you go i would soak your body in all the pleasure it could take he said voice full of the strain of all that control jason said we dont have time to give anita all the pleasure she can take requiem jeanclaude needs us requiem nodded but never changed his rhythm that relentless gentle thrusting in and out over and over that spot just inside my body god youre good i whispered his hands convulsed on the car so that it creaked under his strength if i get to go when you do then i must let go of some of my control or i will still be fighting my body can you keep doing this until i go yes he whispered it it built and built and built and then came the stroke of his body inside me that spilled me over it brought me screaming digging nails into the leather of the seat it bucked my body against his and he thrust deep inside me as hard and fast as he could he brought me again with that deep thrust a different kind of orgasm before the first had finished i raked nails down his sides and screamed the pain didnt make him come again as it did sometimes for nathaniel or even micah he took it but he was done and the pain didnt change that he drew himself out of me and even that was a wondrous sensation that made me writhe on the seats someone touched my face and the ardeur jumped to him i smelled wolf and knew it was jason before i saw his face he swallowed hard voice breathy youre feeling better i nodded no offense but we need you fed and all of us back inside as soon as possible yes i said and my voice was hoarse if we double up you feed faster and were done faster i frowned at him part postorgasmic haze part the rising ardeur and part just me what nathaniel appeared over his shoulder and touched my hand the ardeur leaped to him but it had taken touch for it to transfer my powers were still weak i want you to go down on me while the ardeur rides you i began to have a clue and what will jason be doing while im going down on you fucking you nathaniel said jason tried to look embarrassed but never quite managed it he finally grinned at me you want me to be all gentlemanly about it i shook my head i want you to fuck me he looked startled for a moment then his eyes filled with that knowledge that darkness that is all male that look that is almost predatory but not when you want it when youve asked for it then its something to tighten your body low and hard i cried out just from the look on his face lets fuck he said lets i said i ended up sitting facing nathaniel him inside me i wrapped my legs around his waist with him buried as deep inside me as he could go it reminded me of earlier with london so intimate a lovemaking but staring into nathaniels eyes from inches away with his body inside mine my hips riding him it was more london had had to hold my hair force me to stare into his face i wanted to stare into nathaniels face wanted to watch his moods swim across his face wanted to watch him watch me jasons hands slid down my back cupped my buttocks theyd decided to change places when jason had mentioned that hed never gone with me orally intercourse yes but not oral sex nathaniel had told him you have to feel her do this shes amazing ive had foreplay from her that was when she was trying to be good its better when shes trying to be bad better than raina nathaniel had nodded a look of almost pain had crossed jasons face and hed said can i change my order please so wed changed the order without a lot of foreplay i didnt normally go in this position but thered been foreplay small gspot orgasm always makes intercourse more fun big gspot orgasm means youre done for the night as in stick a fork in me honey im done requiem had done just enough and not too much so that my body was tighter than normal but still wet still spasming with aftershocks every thrust of nathaniels body brought tiny spurts of pleasure made me move my hips against his body and drive him deeper inside me jason licked a cool wet line up my spine it made me shiver and lean a little back into his hands nathaniel kissed me hard and completely drowning his tongue inside my mouth until i had to relax my mouth wide he drove his body inside me as if he were imitating himself at both openings it brought me screaming the orgasm trying to bow my spine tear my mouth off his but his hand at the back of my head kept our mouths pressed together jason bit my back and it made me scream more nathaniel let go of my hair and let my upper body fall back into jasons arms i didnt feel her feed she didnt feed nathaniels body started finding a new rhythm from the slightly different angle my breathing started to change almost instantly i kept my legs around nathaniels waist his hands supporting most of my weight move back he told jason jason did and my body bowed backward my hands seeking his body i was suddenly staring upside down at a very intimate part of jasons anatomy nathaniels hands were strong and firm at the small of my back he gave me the foundation i needed to stretch off into space and reach for the other man i wrapped my hand around him tight and firm he made a small noise for me i wanted him to make more nathaniels body just kept going inside me over and over deep and smooth i felt the beginnings of another orgasm building i wanted jason inside my mouth before that happened i wanted to feed on them both nathaniel had put a condom on before being inside me but jason would slip naked between my lips i could suck him clean and naked and i wanted it in that moment the ardeur my own special hunger might not have cared whose body i was playing with i needed to feed jason wasnt quite at the angle i needed and i said please please he used his own hand to help guide himself between my lips my hands wrapped around his thighs and ass i started to make love to him with my mouth to suck lick and writhe my mouth my tongue and ever so lightly my teeth around the smooth muscled length of him i moved my mouth strained my throat to meet each thrust i lost myself in the sensations at my mouth and nathaniel reminded me hard and fast that i had two men to satisfy i fought to keep both rhythms going my hips writhing to meet nathaniels thrusts and my mouth and throat to meet jasons jasons hands found my upper back and he helped support me with one hand while his other hand found something to hold on to their hands were like a safety net holding me supporting me helping me fuck them are you close jason asked and his voice sounded strained for a moment i thought he was talking to me but his body kept me from answering nathaniel said i can be either she has to slow down or im going to go nathaniels hands tightened at the small of my back and he sat up higher and changed the angle of my hips at the same time it was like hed been waiting to do it it forced my legs higher up his back put my pelvis at a more than fortydegree angle his next thrust made me scream around jasons body god nathaniel stop that or im he thrust two three times with every word just a little more and he brought me screaming screaming with jasons body thrusting inside me so that i screamed around him my nails dug into his body jason thrust one last time as deep and hard as he could down my throat and i felt him go felt it hot but too far down to be thick i got only the heat and the spasming of him inside my throat nathaniel thrust deep and hard between my legs a heartbeat later it made me scream as i was trying to swallow jason down it made me have to suck harder or choke jason cried out his body spasming his nails digging into my back where he held me he screamed my name and the ardeur finally fed i fed i drank them both down and the rush of energy tightened our bodies made us all cry out nathaniel thrust inside me again brought me again jason spasmed deep inside my throat again i felt him spill inside me a moment before id been fighting not to choke or throw up and now the ardeur rode me and i drank him down as if he were exactly what i wanted i drank them both down everywhere our skin touched i got small sips but down my throat and between my legs that was food it was exactly what i needed exactly the way i needed it maybe the feeding would last longer if i fed on men who werent tied to us metaphysically but i didnt love anyone who wasnt tied to us so i had to feed more often so what we ended on the floor of the limo with jason on the bottom me in the middle and nathaniel on top of me as if the last orgasm had pulled us all to the floor wow jason said yeah i said nathaniel laughed low and a little unsteady i love you anita he said i love you too i said i could feel jasons heart thudding against my back i feel left out he said from underneath me nathaniel didnt so much raise his head as move his eyes to look at the other man i love you too or i wouldnt enjoy sharing her with you this much i managed to roll my head back enough to glimpse jasons face i love you jason you are our very dear friend i thought i was just everyones fuck buddy i cuddled against the front of his body nathaniel crawled up until he managed to wedge himself around us both youre the best friend ive ever had jason smiled at us both his eyes full of more emotion than i think he knew what to do with he managed a version of his usual grin and i thought the most interesting thing id ever do with a best friend was watch football nathaniel smiled at him we can if you want but youll have to explain the rules to me i am not watching football i said i hate football lets just keep fucking jason said not tonight i said we need to get inside he said whoever can move stand up first and get dressed i said he laughed hugged me and laid his head against nathaniels god i love my friends but if you guys can fall to one side i think i can stand ill have to work on that i said what he asked youve recovered too quickly i must have done something wrong the laughter faded around the edges and there was suddenly a very serious look on his face you did everything right you were wonderful as good as the person who gave you the teeth mark hickey on your neck he grinned as he started trying to wriggle out of the pile better actually but if you tell her i said so ill deny it tell me who im supposed to be nice to and i will he was opening a box of moist towelettes wiping a little of the sweat and other things off his body he said have you met all of the cape codders samuel and his family yeah jason shook his head not the family the entourage there was a man and woman with them her name is perdita perdy he stuffed the towelettes into an empty garbage bag apparently there for the purpose jeanclaude wanted to know some of what you could expect when you fuck sampson he sent you to fuck one of the mermaids so id be forewarned nathaniel got up slowly jason tossed him the box of towelettes and dragged the plastic off our clothes hadnt really needed the plastic we hadnt been that messy he didnt send me to fuck her just to find out what the transformation of a mermaid and maybe male siren could entail he grinned at me jeanclaude left it to me to decide how to get that information id forgotten that id agreed to try to bring sampsons powers so much had been happening it was hard to keep track it was always especially hard to keep track of things that made me uncomfortable having agreed to have sex with sampson qualified if the bite is a sample ouch it wasnt all ouch ill give you a full report after weve survived the ballet we got cleaned up as best we could an emergency makeup kit for touchups had been in the limo id thought maybe id smear my lipstick it was a little more extensive than that but we managed we were dressed and almost as fresh as when we started the evening requiem had gone to report to jeanclaude or maybe he just hadnt wanted to watch nathaniel and jason escorted me back inside lisandro was rear guard claudia and truth met us at the fox club entrance underneath those stoic bodyguard faces i saw worry but i didnt need their faces to tell me i could feel it it wasnt marmee noir or belle morte it was the vampires wed invited to town i wasnt sure what they were doing but whatever it was it was powerful jason and nathaniel shivered on either side of me what the hell are they doing up there jason whispered i dont know i said but were going to find out i started up the stairs on nathaniels arm with jasons hand in mine normally id have tried not to hold on to too many men at once in public but the hell with it one we all needed the comfort two my reputation couldnt get any more trashed than it already was outside the curtains to the seats i had to let go of jasons hand so he could go back to ashers box i didnt want to let go of him i wanted to wrap both him and nathaniel around me like a security blanket i put my arm around nathaniels waist tucking myself in under his arm he hugged me and whispered against my hair you all right i nodded jason would have called me a liar but nathaniel just accepted it he might not believe me but he wouldnt call me on it nathaniel parted the curtains the music swelled around us and the world was suddenly golden the air sparkled with glitter out of that scintillating cloud a vampire floated it was adonis the vamp who had almost rolled me with his gaze earlier his costume had changed to a ballet version of s dress which meant fairly accurate from the waist up and tights from the waist down id seen vampires fly before but not like this he hung in the air as if he could have hung there forever other vampires appeared out of the glitter hanging in the air as if theyd been pinned there adonis hovered just outside our box so close i could see his blond curls moving in the wind what wind the wind of his own magic jeanclaude and damian turned from that vision to look at me jeanclaude let me see a moment of relief in his eyes before his face became the blank perfect mask that he would wear for the public tonight damian reached out for me i gave him my free hand without thinking that i was touching nathaniel too it was as if his touch completed a circuit it wasnt just a leap of energy it was a feeling of deep contentment it was like suddenly being wrapped in a warm electric blanket it felt so good i couldnt think of anything i wanted more than to wrap them both around me and sleep i just knew that it would be healing and exactly what i needed not all psychic flashes are ambiguous or hard to interpret some of them are crystal clear problem is they always seem to come when you cant possibly act on them looking at the vampires spinning and diving through the falling glitter somehow a nap didnt seem likely i took my seat beside jeanclaude and nathaniel went to the seat on the other side of damian where micah had started the evening but to get everyone sitting down i had to let go of nathaniel it was almost wrenching to let go of him like giving up a shield when you know youre about to go into battle no not that nathaniel wasnt my shield he was my warmth on a cold night he was what kept me safe and sane well not always safe safety lay elsewhere i squeezed damians hand and let go of it there it didnt feel so bad not to be touching nathaniel for some reason giving up them both was easier than giving up just one of them i took jeanclaudes hand and that was safety that was armor in the face of battle there was love there too but jeanclaude sought power more than safety just touching his hand energized me i wasnt thinking nap now i was thinking battle it was the difference between a soldier and a general one sleeps when he can the other has to be preparing for the next conflict the glitter had fallen down so that the vampires were revealed in all their grace they danced in the air they held their places and danced damian leaned in and whispered do you have any idea how much strength it takes to do what theyre doing i shook my head jeanclaude leaned in and gave the barest whisper to fight gravity and your own bodys desire to touch earth it is impressive he squeezed my hand a little tighter as if watching the dozen vampires dance in their perfect solid circle was exciting or nerveracking i was too insecure to drop shields and check for sure so much had already gone wrong tonight that caution seemed smarter nathaniel was leaning forward in his seat his face was rapturous i glanced at our other box micah gave me a smile and i gave one back but it was jason who caught my eye he was sitting on the edge of his chair like nathaniel they wore almost identical entranced looks not entranced by vampire powers but by the beauty and strength of the dancers i realized that id taken away from the performance the two people in our group who would have appreciated the dancing most they both had dance training they both danced for a living yeah they took their clothes off while they did it but jeanclaude had insisted that all his dancers have some training you couldnt just shake your booty on stage at guilty pleasures jason and nathaniel were the two that had taken to the dancing most they were the ones who helped the other dancers work up new acts and id taken them away from the dancing the looks on their faces made me regret that among all the regrets tonight that was another asher was very still watching the show it was a stillness that a stranger wouldnt recognize but he wasnt a stranger to me he was as enraptured by the show as the boys he just had several hundred years of cool and wouldnt let it show that much the music changed and the vampires hesitated they pretended not to know what was coming next they were close enough to us that i could see their expressions of surprise as they turned one by one or two by two to look at the stage below them a woman stepped on stage dressed in one of those long white gossamer dresses i would have said the dress floated around her as she tiptoed on stage but compared to the vampires it didnt quite float but it was delicate and she was lovely her hair was long and shining brown tied back in a high ponytail the hair moved with her like an extension of her body as she danced slowly tentatively across the stage it reminded me of what nathaniel did with his hair on stage some nights not the same kind of dance but the same awareness of the hair as an extension of the dance she was young as in not long dead i whispered against jeanclaudes hair is she supposed to be human oui she was fresh enough that once upon a time i might have believed the illusion but that was long ago and i knew vampire when i saw it the vampires above us began to circle downward the way vultures will when they decide that the thing on the ground is finally dead one of the female vamps landed lightly on the stage she had hair almost as dark as mine but how much of all those curls were real and how much a wig i couldnt tell she went up on her toe shoes as the girl did they mirrored each other from across the stage the girl held her hands out beseeching asking a question or wanting something the darkhaired vampire mimicked her made fun of her it was amazingly well done sometimes the ballet leaves me confused but there was no confusion here the human was asking for help and the vampire wasnt going to give it another female vamp touched down brown hair this time then a blonde the three vamps linked arms and danced across the stage the girl went to her knees begging with graceful arms she was wearing more base than the rest it gave her a rosier skin tone made her look alive three male vampires alit upon the stage they joined the dancing women linked hands boy girl boy girl the girl in white continued to beseech them they laughed at her and broke into couples they danced around her the men were able to do amazing leaps and carry the weight of the women as if it truly were nothing the leaps were amazing but after seeing them fly it just didnt impress once youve seen someone fly whats a little grand jeté they began to circle around her close and closer she finally realized her danger and began to try to run but the circle had closed they would grab her and throw her back into the middle she fell like white and brown water spilling all that hair like a shining cloak across the white dress the vampires began to dance close and closer the circle tightening in graceful flowing movements but tightening all the same there was movement above us i had forgotten that there were vampires still hovering in the air they had risen to the ceiling using it like a rear stage area but now they dropped delicately to the stage and suddenly you realized that the vampires in the circle were nothing the dancers who hit the stage now rolled power outward like a trembling line of cold so cold it almost burned they stalked across the stage in a rolling predatory dance that made me afraid for her silly i knew theyd done this act across the country i even knew that she was already dead but still my body reacted to the menace in their movements the audience below us gasped theyd seen the whole show and they didnt know she was dead the circle of couples parted as the other vampires stalked forward two men and three women stalking across the stage the girl stared at them with fear plain on her face she begged with graceful arms on her knees when that didnt help she got slowly to her feet and her fear was palpable someone was projecting emotions onto the audience there werent many who could roll me that easily i looked up to find one last vamp hovering at the ornate ceiling adonis the blond that had damn near gotten me with his gaze he wasnt looking at me his attention was all for the stage i think he was waiting for his cue it wasnt him oh i was slow tonight it was merlin again merlin who i hadnt seen in the flesh but only through memory i didnt poke at his power he wasnt hurting anyone i was afraid if i poked at him made him stop projecting emotions into the crowd that it might raise marmee noir again i was not up to another visit from the mother of all darkness tonight so i left merlin alone wed discuss his sins later in private the vampires were chasing her around the stage it was a beautifully choreographed game of cat and mouse they would jump out at her use that incredible speed to stop her from leaving the stage shed almost run past them but they would be there grabbing a hand throwing her backward sliding her prettily across the stage i wondered how she kept the white tights so white doing all that i felt adonis move forward i felt his power reach outward he flew slowly toward the stage going down as if on wires so slow so incredibly slow it wasnt a bird of prey it was like a picture of some heavenbound saint except this one was coming down not going up he touched the stage and the dancers froze a redhaired vampire came to his hand as if hed commanded her the dancers all formed couples and began to dance around the girl she was huddled in the middle not begging anymore she had given up on asking for help she huddled like a white star in the center of the bright colors of the vampires they danced and showed that they could do traditional ballet then the music changed the couples gave themselves more room and they began to do dancing that would have looked more at home on the stage at guilty pleasures than at the ballet it was still beautiful graceful predatory but it was also very sexual nothing that would get you arrested but as they had been able to convey menace pity and derision with a gesture and a look now they conveyed sex the girl hid her face as if it were too awful to watch it was adonis who stood above her she raised a startled face slowly the way the actors look up in a horror movie when they hear that noise and know somehow that the monster is right there she gazed up at the handsome man with that look on her face in the posture of her body no matter how beautiful he was she made you see him as hideous dangerous frightening he grabbed her wrist and they did a slow dance with him halfdragging her and her trying to stay farther away from him her reluctance for him to touch her screamed through her every movement but he won as you knew he would he jerked her into his embrace and went skyward he flew her out over the audience while she struggled and pounded at him with little fists so he dropped her she actually screamed before another vampire caught her caught her just over the audiences heads the audience gasped and screamed with her the vampires played catch with the girl one would rise then let her struggles make him drop her she began to cling to them and they tore her hands from their clothes and flung her to the air then adonis caught her again and he held her close i caught the shine of tears on her face as he floated past us he grabbed that shining fall of hair and wadded his hand in it he pulled her neck into a graceful straining line and pretended to bite her then he threw her to the next vampire and that one bit her too they began to close in around her in a tight floating ball of arms and legs when they parted her neck was dotted with fake blood and she went eagerly to them embracing them with graceful arms it became a lovely feeding frenzy from one set of arms to another from one man one woman to another until the vampires faces were stained crimson and the girls dress looked like an accident victims sheet the fake blood made the dress cling to her body so you could see the muscles the small tight breasts it was both alluring and utterly disturbing the audience was silent with tension as the vampires landed on the stage again they surrounded her hiding her from view it gave the illusion that all of them were feeding at once though i knew logistically that wasnt possible too many mouths to fit like that a new vampire stalked onto the stage he was darkhaired and darkerskinned pale but i couldnt tell if it was makeup or skin tone he chased back the other vamps he saw the bloody almostcorpse and he wept his shoulders rose and fell with it adonis laughed at him one of those big stage laughs with the head back the dark vampire raised a face livid with anger they began to dance around the stage they danced with her bloody corpse as their centerpiece the other vampires vanished behind the stage the two men danced adonis had more bulky muscles the dark man was tall and lean and more graceful than anyone id ever seen he moved like a dream of water and even that didnt do him justice adoniss dancing came across as clunky human in comparison somewhere in the middle of the dance i realized i was looking at merlin merlin won the dancing fight for that was what it became they fought in the air and on the ground and it looked real real anger seemed to be involved and i wondered if it was projecting or if they were truly pissed at each other and the fight gave them an excuse to vent it adonis was vanquished not killed and that left merlin on stage alone with his dead love he leaned over her held her in his arms and rocked her my throat was tight damn him he wept and i fought not to weep with him jeanclaude did some of this with the audience at the clubs but he wasnt this good no one id ever met was this good at projecting emotions a mob entered from stage right they had crossbows and torches they shot the weeping vampire the crossbow bolt appeared in his chest like magic even knowing it was stage trickery it looked real he collapsed on top of his dead love and the lights circled round the two dead lovers he died curled around her as if even in death he would protect her the mob came and the weeping man who had shot the vampire picked up the dead girl he cradled her in his arms and a woman from the crowd joined him in weeping parents i thought they cradled her much as the dead vampire had they carried her offstage weeping and left the vampire dead the stage was empty for a moment then the vampires returned they crept out on the stage cautious afraid they seemed bewildered by the dead vampire it was adonis who knelt by him touched his face and wept he picked the fallen man up in his arms cradling him then he rose skyward and the vampires flew away with their fallen leader they flew away weeping to the sounds of music that sounded like the violins were weeping with them the curtain went down and there was a moment of utter silence then the audience went wild clapping making noises of all kinds the audience came to its feet and the curtain reopened the humans came out first the chorus but the audience stayed on their feet through it all when adonis took the stage they clapped louder when the girl and merlin came down to bow well the crowd actually screamed you dont hear screaming much at the ballet but you heard it now roses were delivered to the girl and to merlin more than one bouquet of them in different colors they bowed and bowed again and finally the audience began to quiet only then did the curtain close and the dancers exited to the soft sound of applause and the excited babble of the audience already asking themselves did you see what i saw was it real wed survived the ballet now all we had to survive was the cast party afterward the night was young damn it i was in jeanclaudes office at danse macabre it was blackandwhite elegant with framed kimonos and fans on the walls as the only color i sat behind his elegant black desk with a drawer open i had an extra gun in that drawer id loaded it with silver shot while we waited asher sat beside me in a chair pulled up so he could be close enough to touch me he was the reason the drawer was open and the gun was loaded but not sitting in plain sight on the desk or in my hand already he thought it might make the discussion get off on a hostile foot damian stood on my other side hand on my shoulder his touching me sharing his calmness was probably why asher had won his argument about the gun the other reason hed won the fight about the gun was leaning up against the door claudia truth and lisandro looking very bodyguardy against the wall where was jeanclaude he was out being the media darling elinore as manager here was also playing to the media for public events like this she made a much better hostess besides i was handling other business the kind the human media didnt get to know about merlin was sitting in a chair facing us adonis and the darkhaired woman from the chorus were sitting on the couch against the wall her name was elisabetta and her vaguely eastern european accent was thick enough to walk on merlins and adoniss accents seemed to flow with their moods but were mostly absent merlin was answering my questions in that elegant fromanywhereandeverywhere voice i wanted the show to be magical for the entire audience not just the humans so you tried to roll everyones mind including the master vampires and lycanthropes because you didnt want them to miss the show i didnt fight to keep the sarcasm out of my voice id have lost the fight so why try yes he said simply as if of course damians hand squeezed a little tighter on my bare shoulder his fingers caressing the edge of the collarbone scars i find that a little hard to believe i said there that was calm i hadnt called him a lying bastard why else would i have done it he asked his face was very calm i knew his eyes were dark pure brown but other than color i couldnt describe them much because i wasnt making eye contact this vampire had damn near rolled us all with no gaze i wasnt chancing it he was tall dark and handsome he was not european no something darker farther east as in middle east there was something very egyptian about him or maybe babylonian because he was old old enough that he made my bones ache with his age not power just age i was a necromancer and i could taste the power and age of most vampires it was a natural ability that had gotten better as my power had grown now that ability made my bones thrum with the weight of ages that sat smiling in front of me using power that way on a master of the city is a direct challenge to his or her authority you know that not if you dont get caught at it adonis said from the couch i glanced at him avoiding his eyes that made him laugh he liked that he could roll me with his gaze all right that we both thought he could asher spoke then are you implying that merlin rolled the minds of all the masters in all the cities that you performed in and they did not know it his voice was empty pleasant even happy it was a lie he wanted adonis to chat himself into a corner merlin raised a darkly pale hand that one gesture stopped adonis with his mouth parted no merlin said no we have answered the question of jeanclaudes servant when she speaks it is with his voice but why are you here asher why do you sit so close and join these talks i am jeanclaudes témoin how have you earned this place of trust and power asher it is not through strength there are at least four vampires here perhaps more who are more powerful than you and you were never known for your skill in battle so why do you sit at his right hand and now at hers i can tell you why hes here tonight sitting beside me i said merlin gave me a quizzical look it was so hard not to look him in the eye when he moved id lost the knack of not making eye contact with vampires do enlighten me miss blake i reached in the drawer and wrapped my hand around the gun i felt better holding it the moment the gun flashed to the room the tension level rose i felt rather than saw adonis and elisabetta begin to move forward on the couch claudia said dont merlin said do not react that is what she wants it was probably their masters voice not claudias warning that kept them on the couch or hell maybe shed been speaking to me i put the gun on the desk with my hand sort of caressing it not exactly holding it but touching it i wanted to have the gun naked on the desk when you came through the door asher talked me out of it so he is here to see you do not do anything foolish he is here because i trust him and i dont trust you you are not a fool i would not expect you to trust me and what would you do with your little gun adonis asked shooting you and merlin here seems like a possibility on what grounds merlin asked what laws have we broken we are allowed mass hypnosis for theatrical purposes i hated to admit it but he was right i shrugged if i think on it im sure i can come up with something would you as you americans say frame us i sighed and let my hand fall away from the gun no i guess i wouldnt then i say again why are we here what have we done to anger jeanclaude you know exactly what you did i said and why were pissed at you no truly miss blake i do not its ms blake or marshal blake to you he made a small gesture ms blake then what would you have done if you had succeeded in rolling the minds of six masters of the city asher asked his hair hid half his face a golden distraction i will not answer your question for you are not master here nor powerful enough to be témoin fine what he said merlin looked at me what is that ms blake dont make me repeat the question merlin just answer it i dont understand what you hope to gain by this little discussion ms blake truly i do not you tried to mindfuck six masters of the city plus a halfdozen or more rulers of the local lycanthropes hell weve got animals to call of several masters plus human servants you tried to bite off a great big bloody chunk and you werent master enough to swallow it merlin could have taken you all this from elisabetta i shook my head without looking at her no he couldnt or hed have done it what do you want from us ms blake merlin asked i want to know why you did it dont give me shit about wanting all your audience to enjoy the show if you have truly been mindfucking all the masters at all the performances then you wanted to know if you could take them all here tonight i want to know why why what ms blake why try to roll everyone why run the risk of insulting all of them why throw this big a gauntlet down youre a master vampire youre so damn old you make my bones ache just sitting there vamps like you dont make mistakes merlin vamps like you always have a reason for everything they do perhaps i do not believe that a human who has barely seen three decades of mortal life would be able to understand my motives try me better yet try jeanclaude you said it yourself when you speak to me you speak to him he went very still then i knew the quality of that stillness id surprised him in some way stillness could be as telling on a vampire as a gesture on a human touché ms blake he made another small gesture with his hands you will not believe that i did it only to make our production more enjoyable to all no i said he did that handsout gesture again i was beginning to wonder if it was his version of a shrug perhaps after succeeding in city after city i had simply grown arrogant perhaps i truly believed i could do you all i believe youre arrogant i might even believe that you rolled the rest of the masters individually im not sure on that one yet ive felt your mind i wont say you couldnt do it just that you might not have tried then why did i try tonight he asked i smiled it didnt feel like a happy smile more like that curl of lips when im pissed thats what im trying to find out and what you keep avoiding answering am i avoiding the question he asked i nodded and this time my smile was almost happy yeah you are perhaps i have answered it and you simply do not like the answer perhaps youre trying not to outright lie in case damian or asher or one of the others smells or feels the lie but you are definitely not answering the question completely do you truly believe that if i wished to lie in front of the people you have in this room that i could not do it successfully i thought about that for a second i fought the urge to look at asher damian played his hand along my shoulder i think you could but not without using more mind power than you want to use around me and why do i not wish to use mind powers around you ms blake his voice held disdain almost amusement i wasnt insulted his voice was like everything about him practiced calculated because youre afraid that mommie dearest will hear it and pay a second visit tonight he tried for arrogant disdain and made it but i could taste the change in him the faintest thinnest taste of fear and who is mommie dearest i stared very hard at that graceful line of jaw id have loved eye contact but didnt want to risk it do you really want me to say her name you can say anything you like he said i nodded and found my own heart beating faster my newly scarred hand clenched into a fist fine and my voice was a little breathy youre afraid the mother of all darkness will show up again did the lights grow a shade less bright or was it my imagination she is lost to us ms blake you know nothing of her she lies in a room that is underground but high up there are windows around the front of that room that look out upon a cave or underground building theres always firelight down below as if whoever watches is afraid of the dark i am aware that valentina has been inside the room you describe and lived to tell the tale do not seek to impress me with secondhand stories i was beginning to think that merlin didnt know that id been in his head with her did he not know that id seen his memory of her coming out of the darkness lets try another secondhand tale then i saw her in the shape of a great cat maybe a type of extinct lion bigger than anything that we have today i watched her stalk you in a night where the world smelled of rain and jasmine or something like jasmine i mean i dont know how long jasmine has existed as a plant maybe my mind just calls it jasmine because its the closest smell i know i thought hed gone still before but i had been wrong because now he went so still that i had to concentrate on his chest to make sure he didnt just disappear so still more still than any snake still in the way that live things dont get still as if he were willing himself not to be there anymore his voice was as empty as his body when he said you shared her memory tonight yeah i said then you know her secret shes got a lot of them but if you mean that shes a shapeshifter and a vampire simultaneously then yeah i know that secret he drew a breath a lot of them did that when they came back from that stillstillness they drew a breath as if to remind themselves they arent dead yet but ms blake everyone knows that you cannot be both the strain of vampirism that we have today is destroyed by the lycanthropy virus but maybe once it wasnt or maybe its a different kind of vampirism whatever i know what ive seen musette brought some of the dark ladys cats to visit us asher said they were both and neither yes belle morte says the sleeping cats of our mother have woken to her call merlin said what do you think of that ms blake do you think belle morte has grown so powerful that the servants of the mother have woken to her call no i said why no he asked his voice was still empty his body not moving much he wasnt trying to play human now because belle morte doesnt have that kind of power you have never seen her in the flesh adonis said or you would not be so quick to judge he didnt sound happy as he said it which was interesting it was the first time i felt that hed lost control of his voice i glanced at him shes powerful but its not the same kind of power as mommie dearest its just not if belle morte did not wake the servants of our good mother then who did merlin asked i had a moment of insight i dont get them often i debated on whether to act on it or ask ashers opinion first then i thought to hell with it i was tired id fed but the healing had taken more than the feeding had given back i was too tired for games do you want her to wake up merlin or do you fear her waking up he sank back into that stillness again i do not know how to answer that question yeah you do then i will not answer it are you a flunky of the vampire council is that it merlin has been outside the circle of inner power for centuries asher said i nodded yeah you guys filled me in on the limo ride here he grew so powerful that he was given a choice of giving up his territory or being killed he gave it all up and vanished into the mists of time jeanclaude thought there might be a place for him here on american soil in my head i thought and the next time that jeanclaude offers refuge to someone this fucking powerful he better run it by me first id made that clear in the limo he hadnt even argued with me if youre not working for the council then who are you working for i asked if i said myself would you believe me maybe maybe not dont know try me my hand was on the gun again why touch your gun because i think if you dont want to answer the question that you may try vampire powers again it just depends on what youre more afraid of i am not afraid of your little gun he said probably not but you are afraid of mommie dearest arent you he actually licked his lips the gesture gave me hope that his faзade was cracking and it made me give his eyes a full glance which was what it was supposed to do he tried to roll me in that moment of eye contact and he might have done it except that asher and damian touched my bare skin at the same time it was enough to distract me make me look away there must be more to the two of you than i have been told merlin said and his voice was back to emptiness again he is her vampire servant adonis said it isnt rumor his voice wasnt empty more hollow with an edge of anger but that is not what saved her merlin said he looked to asher and i saw what i had rarely seen one vampire look away from the gaze of another most vamps power like my own necromancy protected them against vampire gaze they couldnt roll each other but merlin could or asher feared he could scary bastard you were the weakest of belle mortes master vampires that vampire would not have helped save anyone from my gaze i have never met you before asher said his hand still on my arm and his gaze averted from the other vampire i have been closer to you than you know asher i did not like the direction this talk was taking look we brought you back here to get answers not the other way around and what answers do you think that i want from you you wanted to know how powerful we were i dont know why but you did you wanted to test us why perhaps i have sought long and hard for another master i could call my own someone who was powerful enough to make me feel that he was worthy to follow youre merlin not lancelot i said lancelot was fiction as is most of what you know today about me and the ones i served i blinked in his direction are you saying youre the merlin as in king arthur and the round table are you saying i am not i started to argue with him but decided not to it was no skin off my back if he wanted to pretend to be the real merlin i wouldnt even point out that merlin himself was a late addition to the legend of arthur it was his delusion obsidian butterfly thought she was an aztec goddess shed been powerful enough that i hadnt burst her bubble either another night maybe but tonight i want to get some straight answers out of you youre talking rings around me and im tired of it his power breathed through my mind i was suddenly pointing a gun at his chest dont try it you would slay me simply for using my power i would shoot you in the chest for trying to roll my mind oneonone mind control is illegal especially for nefarious purposes i do not plan to take your blood or feed upon you in any other way the gun was still nice and steady at his chest the law doesnt state you have to do mind control for feeding just that you infringe on the free will of mother its grounds for an order of execution it takes time to get an order of execution ms blake you cannot possibly have one with my name on it in your pocket he was chiding again silly girl his voice seemed to say i shook my head i was being silly wasnt i ashers hand found my leg when id pointed the gun his hand had had to move his hand went up under my skirt until he traced the edge of the hose and found skin it wasnt about sex it was about helping keep me clearheaded it was the first time a man touching my thigh had cleared my head i straightened my arm a little and made it a doublehanded grip damians hand on my shoulder dug in as if he was afraid of what i was about to do you try to mindfuck me again and ill take my chances with the courts there were other guns out in the room all of them in the hands of our guys and girl claudia said if you leave the couch you bleed adonis and elisabetta settled back against the cushions again i didnt spare a glance to see if they were happy about it claudia and the others had them i had my hands full with the vampire in front of me i will not use my power on you again ms blake i think you are a little too dangerous to tease good of you notice i said voice quiet fighting to keep my arms steady your word that you will not try to use your powers on any of us here tonight asher said his hand very still on my thigh i give you my word that i will not use my powers on any of you tonight broaden i said what asher asked his word that he doesnt use his powers on us while hes in town i want his word that hell be a good boy until he leaves our territory you heard the lady asher said and he didnt try to keep the humor out of his voice i was glad i was amusing someone he gave his word exactly as i asked him to he was an ancient vampire if you could ever get one of the bastards to give their word of honor then you had them they wouldnt break it weird but true i lowered my gun and claudia and the others did the same we didnt put the guns up though we had merlins word not adoniss or elisabettas i guess i should have thrown that in but i hadnt thought about it at the time you know that i am one of the few vampires she created personally you have seen the memory of my death i nodded i had heard rumors that she was stirring more rumors that she has visited you in dream or vision i am forbidden to approach the council for any reason on pain of death to have the rumors confirmed or denied i had no choice but to come here to you and jeanclaude why the power trip at the ballet i said i wanted to see if i could find something in jeanclaude that would interest her and i said i found you whats that supposed to mean it means you are a necromancer as of old and that means what you have powers that i have not seen in many long centuries you havent seen my powers used yet you have a vampire servant you have an animal to call you gain powers as if you were a master vampire you feed upon sex as jeanclaude does as belle morte does it is not an option for you or an added power from jeanclaude you must feed as if you were in truth a vampire not upon blood true but upon lust yeah yeah im a succubus i tried not to think hard about what id just admitted saying it quick you make light of it why because it scares me i said you admit that this from adonis i shrugged why not most people dont like admitting what they fear it doesnt make you less afraid of it i said i find that it does he said and it was his real voice i think not a game what do you fear asher asked nothing i will share with a lesser master lets not start namecalling i said we were actually talking what do you wish to talk about ms blake you say you came here looking for answers about mommie dearest ask your questions and you will answer them just like that he sounded like he didnt believe me i wont know until i hear the questions but maybe stop trying to mindfuck and just pretend were both civilized beings ask me he actually laughed and it was just a laugh not that touchable sound of jeanclaude or asher or belle morte it was just a laugh perhaps i am so old that i have forgotten how to simply talk practice on me ask your questions is she waking from her long sleep yes i said how do you know with such certainty ive seen her in dreams and ini hesitated searching for a word vision asher supplied but that makes it seem like some beatific otherworldly shit and it wasnt like that what was it like merlin asked she sent a spirit cat once an illusion it sort of climbed up my body in the jeep once she smells of night soft and tropical jasmine rain she damn near suffocated me once with the taste of a rainy night belle morte does it with the perfume of roses do you equate their power with each other he asked do you mean are they similar in power yes no i said how is it no ive seen her rise above me in vision or dream or whatever the fuck it was like a huge black ocean ive seen her rise like living night made into something real and separate as if night wasnt just the absence of light but was something real and alive she is the reason that our ancestors huddled around the fire at night shes why we fear the dark shes a fear in the very fiber of our beings something going back to the lizard part of us we dont fear her because we fear the dark we fear the dark because of her i shivered suddenly cold asher took off his tuxedo jacket and laid it around my bare shoulders it put damians hand against the back of my neck under my hair so he could keep contact i didnt argue about it then it is true merlin said in a voice that held a sliver of fear she is waking yes i said she is i took ashers hand in mine i needed the comfort belle morte believes it is her power that has raised the mothers servants that isnt it and you know it i said they wake because she is waking he said yes i said why is she so interested in a human servant adonis asked not rudely but like he truly wanted to know i believe it is not the human servant who interests her but the necromancer he looked at me and again i fought not to meet his eyes i didnt think it was mind tricks just habit you look in someones eyes you just do did you know ms blake that it is on her orders that the necromancers of old were slaughtered no i said i didnt know that it was her orders that all with your gifts be killed before they could grow to such power i can sort of understand that can you i nodded and squeezed ashers hand and pressed damians hand closer to my skin i can roll a vampires mind the way you guys roll us can you truly i realized that id said too much overshared i am too tired to play games tonight merlin when she mindfucked us both tonight a wellmeaning friend gave me a cross to hold oh dear he said i raised my left hand so he could see the new scar how did you heal it so quickly a holy item heals slowly for us i put my hand back on top of damians im not a vampire merlin im a necromancer its just another kind of psychic gift it doesnt make me evil and are we evil merely because we are vampires the question was too hard for me with a vampire in each hand im too tired to debate philosophy with you it took energy to heal this we felt you feed adonis said i fought not to look at him again yeah i fed but it wasnt enough dealing with mommie dearest takes a lot out of a girl it takes a great deal out of everyone merlin said i wondered for the first time if the reason he hadnt done some major mind control after the mother left wasnt just to be polite but because he was scared maybe he didnt have enough juice left maybe he like me was drained of energy she can feed off other vampires just by touching their powers cant she why do you ask she almost always comes to me after some other vampire has used major power on me she used to follow belle mortes mind games tonight it was you that she followed does she feed off us when she does this sometimes he said so she hasnt been asleep and not feeding for thousands of years shes been like some kind of dark dream feeding on energy on power i believe so why did she go to sleep in the first place how should i know avoiding the question arent you he gave a small smile perhaps do you know why she went to sleep yes will you tell me no why not because it is not a story i wish to share i cant make you tell me can i you could try to see if you are necromancer enough to command me to tell you i grinned my ego isnt that big more of the mothers servants have woken most of the council like belle morte believe it is their own growing powers that have broken the servants from their long sleeps which council members dont believe it since i am forbidden to go near the council how would i know that the same way you know what belle morte thinks he gave that smile again i think it was his imnottellingyou smile you need to feed again ms blake as do i the good mother fed upon us both shes not good and she was never your mother he made that hand gesture again the one that passed for a shrug she was mother to what i am now i couldnt argue with that so i didnt try you wanted to know if shes waking she is you say you wanted to know whether jeanclaude was a power strong enough for you to call him master you do not believe that i seek a master i believe that the only master youve ever acknowledged is lying in a room somewhere in europe haunting my dreams he took a deep breath sighing vamps didnt need to breathe only air enough to talk but id found that most of them sigh from time to time as if its a habit that even a few millennia cant break damians hand tightened almost painfully on the back of my neck i was being utterly calm what was the deal i started to look up at him but i felt it he let me feel it i was sucking his energy taking back the energy i gave him to live shit there was a knock on the door claudia looked at me see who it is i said she checked before opening the door good bodyguard it was nathaniel she opened the door for him he came through with his hair still back in its braid but hed lost his shirt and vest somewhere his upper body gleamed with sweat and the amethyst and diamond collar on his neck glittered as he glided into the room how did you lose your shirt i asked i got hot he said and grinned ill say he walked toward me still smiling but there was worry around the edges of his eyes a stranger wouldnt have seen it but id spent months reading his face he walked wide around the desk so hed be out of reach of merlin hed learned to be a better person and a worse victim living with me he came around and put his hand on my arm underneath ashers jacket having them both touch me was as if someone had stuck an electric plug in my spine it made me jump but underneath the rush of power was the feeling that it was going just one way into me shit i was really really going to have to get better at this energy thing you are very new at being the center of this triumvirate of power merlin said like he was certain of it and like it was interesting to him yeah theres a learning curve there are ways to keep the good mother from feeding upon your energy im all ears i said he frowned at me i mean id love to hear it sometimes i forgot that slang does not travel well not across countries or centuries a holy item hidden inside at least two layers of pillows will keep her at bay that sounds risky i said raising my newly marked hand the movement made damian move almost a stumble i felt nathaniel reach for him knew when he had put an arm around the taller mans waist even vampires can sleep thus if they believe and they do not call their own power i needed to feed but i didnt want a mistake here i bunked with too many vampires to want a holy item going off at the wrong moment a vampire can sleep with a holy item under his pillow yes or underneath the bed though pillow is better what happens if the holy item touches vampire flesh look at your own hand for that answer he said are you saying that the cross burned me because of my own power not mommie dearest you are a succubus ms blake that has long been a power associated with the demonic ive come up against demons vampirism is a contagion not a demonic anything its a bloodborne disease a doctor back in the s sort of figured out how to cure it you dont cure demonic possession with a blood transfusion cured it merlin said with a blood transfusion truly well yeah but the vampirism is what keeps the dead body up and running so you take the vampirism out of the blood and the body dies ah then not a cure that most would seek i shook my head no damian leaned over and whispered against my cheek all interesting but may i ask that you speed this up the mother cannot break through your protection on her own except in dream but she can follow the attack of another vampire inside your defenses you are correct on that fear of her was one of the reasons for the laws governing combat between masters but she has been asleep for so long that we have forgotten caution why does she need to follow someone elses attack because she is still a creature of nightmare and the lands of morpheus shes still asleep you mean yes that is what i mean he smiled damians hand dug into my shoulder i said i dont mean to be rude here but i need to feed so if youll excuse us cant we watch elisabetta asked no i said come elisabetta merlin said he went out the door with her behind him adonis turned in the doorway and stared at us all you dont get to watch either i said this meeting is over he started to say something then seemed to think better of it he finally shook his head and left without another word id learned more than he meant to tell but less than there was to know somehow i knew id see him again just a feeling claudia went to the door ill make sure no one interrupts she closed the door behind her i stood and gently moved their hands off my shoulders i took their hands in mine nathaniel take damian to the workers lounge or somewhere or find a table outside i guess why cant we watch i gave him a look but he gave innocent knowledgeable eyes its been less than two hours are you saying youd go again he smiled i cant feed on you again this soon nathaniel its too dangerous i dont know what the mother did to me exactly but i feel shaky i dont know if i can guarantee that the ardeur wont spread through the room outside the door youll be safe inside i dont know i looked at damian who was clinging to nathaniels shoulders as if hed fall down without the support if i fed on damian right now i think that would be bad who will you feed from then asher asked from where he stood near the wall if its okay with you you a man likes to be asked i squeezed the others hands and said nathaniel damian go please and stay where someone can keep an eye on you okay i promise nathaniel said and they started for the door i turned to asher are you mad at me no one likes to be taken for granted anita i dont take you for granted you do and so does jeanclaude i didnt know what to say to that so i said that part out loud i dont know what to say to that he shook his head we do not have time to tend my emotional wounds forgive me the door closed behind us nathaniel and damian were outside trying to find a place to wait while i fed enough to keep us all alive i reached for ashers hand he took it but he wouldnt look at me what little of his face he gave was that perfect profile with the scars hidden behind the glory of his hair id asked for sex and he was hiding from me not good what is wrong i asked do you realize that this will be the first time we have ever had sex alone together i started to argue with him but stopped myself i could remember his body so intimately so many nights and afternoons of his body against mine had there always been someone else with us had we never had a moment that was just us just ours i touched his face tried to get him to look at me but he wouldnt do it its not just jeanclaude that you havent gotten enough personal attention from is it he smiled then but not like he was happy i spent centuries being desired by all that i touched or wanted then i spent centuries being despised ridiculed sex was a mercy or done as a torment to the ones belle wished to punish i tried to hug him and he kept me away just holding my hand while he talked i said the only thing i could think to say im sorry he finally looked at me with the perfect side of his face he let me see the drowning beauty that had made people give up their fortunes their honor their virtue for but one more night staring into this face you have healed some of my hurts being with you and jeanclaude i thought it would be enough i slid my hand underneath his hair so i could touch the scarred side of his face i cupped that which he hid while i stared up into the face he let me see but you dont get enough attention from either of us it sounds childish when you say it out loud but it does not feel childish inside here he touched his chest it feels like i am starving to death in the midst of a feast but it is a feast that i share with too many neither of you watches only me there is always someone else more beautiful more desirable there is no one more beautiful than you asher he jerked back and exposed the scars on his face how can you say that to me what do you want me to say i want to be the center of someones life again anita jeanclaudes center is you yours is beginning to be nathaniel and micah he grabbed my arms and closed his eyes tight i am no ones darling and i cannot bear it he laughed but when he opened his eyes there was a shine of unshed tears how stupid and childish how selfish its not about being with men or women is it i said its because none of the men im picking will ever put you at the center of their world i want to be loved anita as i once was julianna i said softly he nodded once it was jeanclaude but he could never truly love another man the way he loves a woman belles tastes and demands sent many of us to the arms of other men but jeanclaude could never be content with just men in his bed he is a lover of women above all else and you i asked because he seemed to want me to ask i think if it were the right man i could be in love and content but i think the same of a woman it is love i seek anita not the package around it i have always been needier of attention than jeanclaude i sought a woman for my human servant when i realized that jeanclaude would never be content with just men with just me i didnt know what to say to the pain in his voice an emotional burden hed carried for two or three hundred years and i was supposed to fix it or at least make it better how how was i going to do that i felt damian reach out for me it made me stagger against asher he had to catch me im draining damian then i must stop being an enfant terrible and let you feed i do want you asher i do love you but right now i dont have time to to heal my wounds he finished for me to make love to you the way i want to he gave me a look like he didnt believe me we have to feed and get back to the party but you are not just emergency food to me you are not just someone i share with jeanclaude you are special to me asher you just you i dont have time to make you believe me tonight but ill try to do better later he drew me in against his body held me close whispered into my hair later you will have to feed upon someone else for i will have had my turn i drew back enough to see his face and said remember one thing that i didnt make love to you that first time because i had to feed the ardeur i made love to you because i wanted to because jeanclaude and i wanted to you did it to protect me from belle mortes agents yeah we did it so that belle couldnt call you home so youd belong to us by her rules but youre still the only new man in my life that i had sex with because i wanted to take care of you not because you were food take care of me i nodded its what you do when you love someone he smiled then and it was that rare smile the smile that made him look terribly young and not at all like himself as if that smile was all that was left of what he might have been centuries ago you cant possibly love all the men in your life anita no i agreed but i love you i love jeanclaude and micah and nathaniel he said i nodded and london and requiem he said i shook my head no not them why not love them they are beautiful and perfect i grinned not perfect handsome but not perfect requiems too damn moody by half london im a little embarrassed about him why embarrassed not sure maybe because im not sure i even like him and i had sex with him i felt damian slumping at the table where he sat nathaniel caught his arm kept him in the chair asher had to catch me or i might have fallen you need to feed he said i nodded then we have talked enough tonight i will take care of you because that is what you do when you love someone heat rose up in my face and i wasnt sure why he laughed not a magical vampire laugh but a very masculine laugh that laugh that lets you know youve pleased them in some very guy sort of way what i asked and wouldnt look at him because i knew that would make the blush worse you blushed because i said i loved you i nodded and tried to sound churlish as i said so so i know you love me that made me look up at him just because i blushed he nodded i blush a lot he drew me into the circle of his arms yes but this one was for me he laid a kiss upon my forehead i would like to feed while you feed havent you fed yet no the blood hunger did not rise isnt that unusual very then feed i thought about it though im sort of running out of spots for fresh fang marks he touched the side of my neck where requiems bite lay he traced his hand over the mound of my breast dipping a little lower than the corset top until he caressed londons bite he dipped his fingers lower so that he touched my nipple just that brought my breath in a gasp he laughed again that pleased sound his hand slid up my thigh forced me to move my legs apart so he could find jeanclaudes bite in my very inner thigh my voice came breathy how did you know it was there i smelled it he whispered are you ready for me i nodded because i didnt trust my voice then look at me anita look into my eyes i looked up slowly and found his eyes full of light like blue ice glittering in winter moonlight all shadows and shimmers his eyes dazzled me he was carrying me and i hadnt remembered him picking me up where are we going i whispered the couch he said we have to be quick he laid me down upon the couch my knees bent and him kneeling between them we can be quick now because i know that there will be long later all because i blushed for you i said yes he laid me down on the couch there wasnt room for him to lie beside me so he stood and began to take off his clothes if we take off the corset it will take forever to get it back on the corset can stay he threw his shirt and jacket on the arm of the couch he stood there for a moment nude from the waist up i stared up at him stupidly that golly wow look on my face i couldnt help it he was so beautiful and i knew that the rest of him was just as beautiful i could look at him with knowledgeable anticipation it made me shiver just staring up at him like that the look on your face anita mon dieu the look on your face i had to swallow twice to say what do you want me to take off panties just panties i said he nodded and started unfastening his pants my pulse sped up i had to sit up to take the panties off it also helped me look away from him while i did it was it just that we had never been alone before was that this incredible anticipation or was it more than that i wanted him i wanted him to touch me my body ached with the need not just to be touched but for asher to touch me his hands slid over my bare shoulders where i sat facing away from him the smoothing of his hands down my skin made me hold my breath he leaned down and whispered what do you want your hands on my body what else do you want you inside me what else my pulse was hammering in my throat so hard i could barely speak around it bite me while you fuck me make me come both ways while youre inside me inside you both ways he whispered yes he grabbed a handful of my hair and pulled until it hurt just a little just enough say please please i have to take blood to enter you to bring you a second time with my bite i will have to take blood again i tried to reason that out and failed but finally said the only thing i could think to say please he put us both on our knees on the couch me facing away from him his hand wrapped in my hair hard enough to hurt drawing my neck back in a clean straining angle he pressed his body against the back of mine used his hips to raise the short skirt so i could feel his body against my bare ass he plunged his hand down the front of the corset so he could grip my breast tight and hard it made me cry out he plunged his body against mine but without blood he was still soft he whispered in my ear your blood will make me a man again it will fill my body with life so that i may fill your body with life there was something about what hed said that should have bothered me but i couldnt make the thought form hed rolled my mind in a blissful rush and i couldnt make my thoughts march to logic all the logic i had was in his hands in the soft push of his body the growing tension as he held me something stabbed through that lustful calm damian reached out to me with a silent scream anita damn it feed it made me slump in ashers arms what is wrong let me feed with the first bite let me feed with your power damian is fading he made it a statement yes my voice was breathy and not for any good reason i will not fight your power anita i will let you take me then i will take you yes but please hurry please he was too tall to stay pressed as he was and bite me he had to ease his body back enough to fold that sixfeetandchange frame over me his hands tensed in my hair and on my breast the sudden pain seemed to send me back into his gaze my breath was short and eager when he struck there was a moment of pain then it was gone washed away in the first orgasm ashers bite was pleasure it was his gift his power and that power tightened my body and exploded like a wave of warm pleasure across my skin so much pleasure so much and as long as he fed it would be wave after warm thrilling wave it felt so good so good that it spilled out my mouth in long ragged screams somewhere in all of it the ardeur rose and fed it fed through his mouth his teeth on me it fed through his hands on my body i poured the spill of it into damian felt him sit up so hard in the chair that he almost fell off it nathaniel steadied him and got a taste of that pleasurable power i fought the energy fought to send only food and not the nearly overwhelming pleasure to send only so much and no more it was like trying to meditate in the middle of sex no wonder i wasnt better at it asher drew back from my neck breathing hard you took a great deal he sounded shaky and his bite didnt necessarily cause him pleasure so that wasnt it sorry i mumbled he let go of me and i slumped forward onto all fours head down god asher god the couch moved as he shifted position and the next thing i felt was his hands on my hips pulling my skirt up he pressed the tip of himself against me and there was nothing soft about him now he was hard and ready pushing against me do you still want me to pierce you twice i should have said no id missed so much of the evening but i didnt want to say no i wanted to say yes i tried not to think about asher much one it could cause miniorgasms at odd moments one of the side effects of his powers two because i understood why people had been willing to trade everything away just for one more night of the pleasure that only asher could bring the rest of the metaphysical sex was great but it was the affection i had for the people involved that made me want to be with most of them emergency food being the exception i loved asher but it wasnt love that made me want to be with him if i had been less stubborn i might have chased after him simply for the pleasure i stayed away from him when i could because no one could quite do what he could and it scared me which is why i said just fuck me you do not wish me to bring you pleasure with my bite again yes but we dont have time as you wish he used his hands to position my hips and he began to push his way inside me i was wet but tight my body spasmed around him as he fought to be inside me his voice came strained so tight tonight so tight forcing me to fight for every inch i love it i just nodded not trusting my voice i should have said no to the sex wed fed jeanclaude needed us to schmooze the crowd but i didnt want to say no i could have lied to myself and thought that asher needed this this time just the two of us but that wasnt why i said yes i said yes because i wanted him inside me i said yes because i was fighting myself not to beg for another bite i did want him to pierce me twice i did want it i did he had himself inside me as close as his body would let him he rested a moment with our bodies wedded to each other he laid his body across my back letting me support our weight for a moment his skin was warmer now alive with the blood hed taken from me his hair fell around me like a shining curtain bite me i whispered it what bite me while you fuck me take me take me as only you can take me my voice stayed a whisper as if that would make it all right make it less weak as only i can take you he made a question of it yes i said yes he wrapped his arms around me forced me to hold all of our combined weight he hugged me hard and tight you do feel my power yes i whispered are you afraid of it yes afraid of how much you want me yes he whispered i like that he raised himself off me so that the only part of him touching was the part that was deep inside me and the barest touch of thighs and hips he drew himself out slowly so slowly im still tight yes he said yes you are he drew himself out of me then used his knees to spread my legs wider it made me lower my head to the couch pressing my face to the leather asher entered me shallow just inside inside over that sweet spot he started slow and steady pushing himself in and out and always over that one spot i kept expecting him to speed up or go deeper but he kept that slow shallow rhythm i started moving my hips to help but he put his hands firmly on my hips kept me from moving it was strangely like all the ballroom dancing theyd made me learn for the party a flexing of the mans hands a squeeze in one direction or the other and you knew what he wanted or thought you did he wanted me not to move to let him do the work he spread my legs even farther forced my body at a higher angle up anita i want you up on all fours i did what he asked but my knees were spread so far that my hips protested the angle it didnt exactly hurt but it might if we did it long enough and through it all he kept up that gliding gentle rhythm inside my body the orgasm began to build inside me to build with each caress of his body just inside mine building building on the gentle touch of him inside me most of the time sex was about the ardeur the ardeur wasnt gentle i fed and i fucked because i had to i realized as asher took me so carefully so gently that it had taught us all bad habits i loved a good hard fucking more even than most women but just because i could take it didnt mean that that was what i wanted not always this this was perfect this was what i had been missing in all the frantic sex all the emergency feeding had made me forget that gentleness had its own pleasure i fought to stay where he wanted and not to move fought to keep my legs spread fought to hold the pleasure im close then go but go he said i might have argued but he pushed his body over mine one last time and the orgasm caught me only his hands digging into my ass kept me from writhing my pleasure around him he kept me in place and he kept going as if i werent screaming digging fingers into the leather so much pleasure so much pleasure that my hands needed something to hold on to i couldnt reach him so i dug nails into what i could reach anita i love you i love you i love you the rhythm changed i felt him fight his body not to lose himself yet he grabbed my hair and jerked me to my knees with his body still inside mine it changed the angle and he didnt try to stay shallow he used all the length of him still pushing gently still fighting his body not to pound into me i felt the struggle in his chest and arms as he pulled my head to one side and exposed my neck again now he whispered please i whispered he plunged his fangs into me locked his mouth around me and sucked he stopped fighting his body let himself plunge into me as hard and fast as he could he brought me screaming again brought me with his body brought me with his bite brought me with his power he came inside me with one last powerful thrust i raked nails down his arms and screamed myself hoarse he fed at my neck and as long as he fed the orgasms continued for me for him for us it was one of the things that made him so dangerous while you were in the middle of all that pleasure you could forget forget that this was my fourth blood donation tonight forget that he shouldnt open his mouth and let the blood pour down my body because he was too full to take more forget that we were supposed to save something to go outside to meet and greet forget everything but the feel of him thrusting inside me until he poured from between my legs poured over his own body forget until my blood poured down my neck to soak into the dress and the diamonds forget until hands pulled us apart and asher turned snarling to the room i didnt snarl i collapsed onto the couch because i couldnt do anything else i lay there like a broken doll and even my thoughts circled lazily white edged as if the world were covered in cotton someone rolled me over remuss jigsaw face loomed out of the growing dimness anita anita can you hear me i meant to say yes but the world went black and i was floating and i couldnt say anything to anyone i woke up in the hospital not the human hospital but the lycanthrope hospital the building that the local shapeshifters keep for just such emergencies if theyd taken me to the humans then asher might have ended up with an order of execution against him the downside to going to the furry hospital was that the blood they used for transfusing wasnt human blood if you get the right blood type humans can take in lycanthrope blood and lycanthropes can take in human blood but lycanthropes have trouble taking in blood that isnt their strain of lycanthropy since i carry three i was something of a problem but since i was also onegative there wasnt a lot of choice its not the most common blood type around especially in a small hospital like this one doc lillian wont actually tell me what strain of lycanthropy she decided to add to my mix or if she chose one that i already had she thinks that if i know what it is it could influence which beast wins since my mental process shouldnt have anything to do with it i have no idea what shes babbling about but she wont give in so come next full moon well see if my mixed bag of furry picks a winner i slept off and on and when i woke up again asher was sitting by my bed i startled when i saw him made a little gasp he looked away from me letting all that long hair fall forward to hide his face completely he wasnt flirting showing that perfect profile he was just hiding you are afraid of me now his voice held regret like a light persistent rain one you know will go on all day i started to deny it then stopped myself was i afraid of him yes yes i was but not for the reason he thought i touched the bandage at my neck and from the feel of it alone i knew the bite wouldnt be some polite pricking hed gotten carried away at my neck as he had elsewhere it wasnt like collarbonescar bad or even the bend of my arm bad but it wasnt what the old vamps usually did it felt like a rookie mistake under the bandages that made him sit up a little straighter his arrogance kicking in i am sorry that my manner displeases you so he sounded a little angry good it was better than despair youre right i should be furious with you and youre right that ive kicked men out of my life for a hell of a lot less than this the anger leaked away and that numbing depression rolled over him again it was like watching the light fade from him did you ask me to sit so you could grind the knife in deeper if i want to grind a knife in youll know it im just trying to talk i had to cough to clear my voice is there water asher looked around the room it was remus who found a pitcher of water and a little cup he poured it then hesitated and finally handed it to asher the two men had a moment where you could almost feel the battle of wills then asher finally took the cup and came to the bed he would not look at me as he offered the water with a little bendy straw in it the water tasted stale but it was cool and felt wonderful in my mouth and throat i raised my untaped arm to help hold the cup my fingers brushed ashers hand he jumped as if it had hurt but i knew it hadnt hurt have i spilled water on you no just a little on the sheets you are the only woman except belle who has ever made me feel clumsy ixion was there with a handkerchief asher took it and dabbed at the few spots hed gotten on the sheets is that a compliment or an insult i asked my voice sounded better less hoarse it made me wonder how long id been unconscious i didnt ask because if it had been a long time then asher would feel worse and id be more scared i let it go he finished trying to soak the water up handing the handkerchief back as if he expected ixion to simply be there to take it he was and he did but the offhand quality of the gesture made me wonder again how long had i been out it is neither just the truth you have made me feel awkward from the moment i met you i tend to have that effect on ladies men he looked at me then i tried to read his expression and failed i am a ladies man am i belle morte made certain that all of you were good with the ladies and the men do not forget anita she made certain we knew how to pleasure men as well i nodded and stopped because the bandages pinched ive grasped that concept thanks but you are not happy with it more puzzled by it he smoothed the sheets where hed dampened them i think he was looking for anything to fuss over rather than what we were doing id never seen him this uncomfortable i did what id wanted to do since he walked into the room i laid my hand on his he went very very still under my touch that awful unnatural stillness where it feels like youre not touching anything alive he went away from my touch but i kept my hand on his if he thought a little weird vampire shit would make me move he was wrong anita and his voice tried to be as empty as his body but failed im not afraid because you almost killed me im afraid because you almost killed me and i still want to touch you he drew his hand out of mine he sat down but he would at least look at me now i have rolled your mind completely and utterly i have done what you feared that i would do and dont you want to touch me yes he whispered it you were the first one to realize that just biting me helps me gain control over a vamp i dont think its just you whos rolled me are you saying you have gained control of me im not sure what im saying i just know that i dont want you gone i dont want you to never touch me again i want us to be together beyond that i dont know together in what way anita well just need a spotter i said a spotter what are you talking about a spotter like you have in gymnastics sex with you is so good we need spotters so dangerous you mean he said and he stared at his hands where they lay loose in his lap id do it again asher he looked up then and it wasnt a happy look do you really mean that yes that should frighten you and me it does scare me but it doesnt really scare you does it im terrified for your safety but youve been a very good boy havent you i asked what do you mean i had one of those moments of seeing so deep into another person that it makes the rest of the world seem unsteady for a moment it wasnt vampire powers or necromancy it was just a moment of insight so bright and painful that i couldnt look away look me in the eye asher and tell me that youve never done what you did with me before and had the woman not survive it he looked away then those pale eyes hiding from me asher i said he met my eyes with that blank perfect face peering through the mess of his hair i have done what you accuse me of its not an accusation i said it was more a statement do you not think me a monster for it i thought about it did i think him a monster did you do it on purpose did i go into the lovemaking planning the death of my lover he asked yeah thats what i mean no save once once there was a lord from whom belle desired money and land he had been diagnosed with a cancer he was a strong proud man he did not wish to die in pain and sickness he requested i kill him he wished to die by pleasure instead of pain he also felt that if i took his life it was not suicide so his soul was strangely safe he told the story in an empty voice as if it meant nothing to him it was the kind of voice that people use about trauma or tragedy when they havent dealt with it yet you liked him i said he was a decent man i dont think youre a monster why am i not a monster for killing someone to give myself pleasure put that way you would be but thats not what you did its a loop of pleasure asher its not your pleasure but hers mine i could have said no there was a point where i knew it was too much that we should stop i had rolled your mind you had no free will you can roll me but i dont stay rolled if i dont want to not anymore i didnt want to stop asher do you think im a monster for saying it was one of the most amazing orgasmic experiences that ive ever had no not a monster we can have intercourse together alone sometimes but no biting while were alone you do not trust me i dont trust either of us i said he almost smiled i nearly killed you i nearly spilled all that precious blood the sofa had to be destroyed the carpet taken up i almost killed you anita not for food but for pleasure you were in the middle of a major powerup asher an animal to call at long last he glanced behind at the waiting guards hyenas yes jeanclaude says that the first time any power kicks in its always hard to control asher took my hand i would not trade your love for a thousand powers i would not trade a single strand of your hair for any territory his eyes were glittery not with power but tears i believe you your new laws say we are citizens but we are monsters anita if i had killed you with the birth of this new power i would have followed you soon after youre saying you would have killed yourself he nodded i could not have borne it i dont want you dead nor i you he knelt and laid his head on my hand it was not blood that brought my power anita it was you you wanting me more than anyone else in that moment i could feel it you wanted me not jeanclaude not richard not micah not nathaniel me you wanted me my body my touch more than anyone elses i could see into your heart and i saw only me there he rose up tears staining his face faintly pink you truly do love me just me not because of memories you share with jeanclaude not out of pity you love me yes i said otherwise id be wicked pissed about the whole almostkillingme thing i will never forgive myself for that jeanclaude would have been within his rights to slay me for such carelessness he loves you he nodded yes he does i doubted that until i realized he was not going to kill me for almost killing you i doubted everyones love for me anita but no longer he loves me or he would have killed me when he walked into that room and saw what i had done so that was it i almost died asher had an animal to call jeanclaude didnt kill him for almost killing me i didnt kill asher for almost killing me jeanclaude has forbidden asher and me to have feeding sex by ourselves we didnt argue because asher and i both know the darkest secret of all between us it felt so good so incredibly good that we didnt trust each other not to do it again i am a succubus i am a vampire maybe not a bloodsucker but i feed off sex it isnt just damians life that can get drained away if i dont feed nathaniel will die i will die i think jeanclaude can protect himself and richard from me but i could kill us all if i dont learn to manage my own personal triumvirate of power london is the frontrunner for my new pomme de sang i wish i liked him better i dont dislike him but im afraid to bring him home he doesnt strike me as the domestic type requiem is part of the food chain but he is so not just food he craves true love i cant blame him but i cant help him either the sex is great but he scares me for centuriesold vampires they all seem so easy to hurt emotionally weird i wrapped a cross in silk put that in a velvet bag and that inside a pillowcase it seems to be working no more bad dreams of marmee noir no accidents for my vampire lovers or me id send merlin a thankyou note if i had an address sampson is staying in town so i can fulfill my promise to try to bring his powers over hes letting me recover my strength and my nerve for it nice of him i made auggie take haven home to chicago my hands ached to touch him so dangerous the local werelions are trying to find me someone else but i miss haven hes a dangerous thug but i miss him my lioness misses him he would be such a bad idea to keep i wasnt pregnant yea but while i thought i was pregnant i had unprotected sex with nathaniel jeanclaude micah and augustine no one handed london a condom when i fed the ardeur off him but ive managed to dodge the bullet on those too thank god pregnant by one of my boyfriends is one thing pregnant by augustine would be a disaster i could not deal with i think ill just start taping condoms to my body emergency sex comes up you rip a condom off and youre as safe as youre going to be im safe from disease because my lovers arent human but pregnancy that is one disease that im not safe from my period is still awol my doctor says theres nothing wrong with me it could just be stress or there is literature about female shapeshifters having interrupted periods until their first full moon or as my doctor pointed out i am like a metaphysical miracle on two legs so maybe its something else maybe its something we havent even thought of he recommended i take folic acid because there are birth defects that have nothing to do with werewolves and vampires i did what he said he also suggested a therapist or a vacation a vacation me where would i go and what would i do hell who would i take with me i try not to think too hard on the fact that my vampire powers gave me nathaniel and micah hell gave me to them why didnt it work on richard jeanclaude thinks its because he does not know his own hearts desire you can only get your wish when you truly know what it is you want maybe someday richard will truly know what his heart needs hes dating humans exclusively im the only preternatural hes seeing richard has informed me hes shopping for his white picket fence im happy behind my black wroughtiron fence the one with the pointy spikes on top white never really was my color
